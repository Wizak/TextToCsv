monclova xxx the man of destiny xxxi a spanish will xxxii the dawn heart of the sunset i the waterhole a fitful breeze played among the mesquite bushes the naked earth where it showed between the clumps of grass was baked plaster hard it burned like hot slag and except for a panting lizard here and there or a dustgray jackrabbit startled from its covert nothing animate stirred upon its face high and motionless in the blinding sky a buzzard poised longtailed mexican crows among the thorny branches creaked and whistled choked and rattled snored and grunted a dove mourned inconsolably and out of the air issued metallic insect cries the direction whence they came as unascertainable as their source was hidden although the sun was halfway down the west its glare remained untempered and the tantalizing shade of the sparse mesquite was more of a trial than a comfort to the lone woman who refusing its deceitful invitation plodded steadily over the waste stop indeed she dared not in spite of her fatigue regardless of the torture from feet and limbs unused to walking she must as she constantly assured herself keep going until strength failed so far fortunately she had kept her head and she retained sufficient reason to deny the fanciful apprehensions which clamored for audience if she once allowed herself to become panicky she knew she would fare worse far worse and now if ever she needed all her faculties somewhere to the northward perhaps a mile perhaps a league distant lay the waterhole but the country was of a deadly and a deceitful sameness devoid of landmarks and lacking welldefined watercourses the unending mesquite with its first spring foliage resembled a limitless peachorchard sown by some careless and unbelievably prodigal hand out of these false acres occasional knolls and low stony hills lifted themselves so that one came now and then to vantagepoints where the eye leaped for great distances across imperceptible valleys to horizons so far away that the scattered treeclumps were blended into an unbroken carpet of green to the woman these outlooks were unutterably depressing merely serving to reveal the vastness of the desolation about her at the crest of such a rise she paused and studied the country carefully but without avail she felt dizzily for the desert bag swung from her shoulder only to find it flat and dry the galvanized mouthpiece burned her fingers with a little shock she remembered that she had done this very thing several times before and her repeated forgetting frightened her since it seemed to show that her mind had been slightly unbalanced by the heat that perhaps explained why the distant horizon swam and wavered so in all probability a man situated as she was would have spoken aloud in an endeavor to steady himself but this woman did nothing of the sort seating herself in the densest shade she could find it was really no shade at all she closed her eyes and relaxed no easy thing to do in such a stifling temperature and when her throat was aching with drought at length she opened her eyes again only to find that she could make out nothing familiar undoubtedly she was lost the waterhole might be anywhere she listened tensely and the very air seemed to listen with her the leaves hushed their faint whisperings a nearby cactus held its forty fleshy ears alert while others more distant poised in the same harkening attitude it seemed to the woman that a thousand ears were straining with hers yet no sound came save only the monotonous crescendo and diminuendo of those locustcries coming out of nowhere and retreating into the voids at last as if satisfied the leaves began to whisper softly again away to her left lay the yellow flood of the rio grande but the woman though tempted to swing in that direction knew better than to yield at least twenty miles of barrens lay between and she told herself that she could never cover such a distance no the waterhole was nearer it must be close at hand if she could only think a little more clearly she could locate it once more she tried as she had tried many times before to recall the exact point where she had shot her horse and to map in her minds eye the footweary course she had traveled from that point onward desert travel was nothing new to her thirst and fatigue were old acquaintances yet she could not help wondering if in spite of her training in spite of that inborn sense of direction which she had prided herself upon sharing with the wild creatures she were fated to become a victim of the chaparral the possibility was remote death at this moment seemed as far off as ever if anything it was too far off no she would find the waterhole somehow or the unexpected would happen as it always did when one was in dire straits she was too young and too strong to die yet death was not so easily won as this rising she readjusted the strap of the empty waterbag over her shoulder and the loose cartridgebelt at her hip then set her dusty feet down the slope day died lingeringly the sun gradually lost its cruelty but a partial relief from the heat merely emphasized the travelers thirst and muscular distress onward she plodded using her eyes as carefully as she knew how she watched the evening flight of the doves thinking to guide herself by their course but she was not shrewd enough to read the signs correctly the tracks she found were old for the most part and they led in no particular direction nowhere uniting into anything like a trail she wondered if she could bring herself to drink the blood of a jackrabbit and if it would quench her thirst but the thought was repellent and besides she was not a good shot with a revolver nor did the cactus offer any relief since it was only just coming into bloom and as yet bore no fruit the sun had grown red and huge when at last in the hardbaked dirt she discovered fresh hoofprints these seemed to lead along the line in which she was traveling and she followed them gladly encouraged when they were joined by others for although they meandered aimlessly they formed something more like a trail than anything she had as yet seen guessing at their general direction she hurried on coming finally into a region where the soil was shallow and scarcely served to cover the rocky substratum a low bluff rose on her left and along its crest scattered spanish daggers were raggedly silhouetted against the sky she was in a welldefined path now she tried to run but her legs were heavy she stumbled a great deal and her breath made strange distressing sounds as it issued from her open lips hounding the steep shoulder of the ridge she hastened down a declivity into a knot of scruboaks and ebonytrees then halted staring ahead of her the nakedness of the stony arroyo the gnarled and stunted thickets were softened by the magic of twilight the air had suddenly cooled overhead the empty flawless sky was deepening swiftly from blue to purple the chaparral had awakened and echoed now to the sounds of life nestling in a shallow flinty bowl was a pool of water and on its brink a little fire was burning it was a tiny fire overhung with a blackened pot the odor of greasewood and mesquite smoke was sharp a man rising swiftly to his feet at the first sound was staring at the newcomer he was as alert as any wild thing but the woman scarcely heeded him she staggered directly toward the pond seeing nothing after the first glance except the water she would have flung herself full length upon the edge but the man stepped forward and stayed her then placed a tin cup in her hand she mumbled something in answer to his greeting and the hoarse ravenlike croak in her voice startled her then she drank with trembling eagerness drenching the front of her dress the water was warm but it was clean and delicious easy now take your time said the man as he refilled the cup it wont give out she knelt and wet her face and neck the sensation was so grateful that she was tempted to fling herself bodily into the pool the man was still talking but she took no heed of what he said then at last she sank back her feet curled under her her body sagging her head drooping she felt the strangers hands beneath her arms felt herself lifted to a more comfortable position without asking permission the stranger unlaced first one then the other of her dusty boots seeming not to notice her weak attempt at resistance once he had placed her bare feet in the water she forgot her resentment in the intense relief the man left her seated in a collapsed semiconscious state and went back to his fire for the time she was too tired to do more than refill the drinkingcup occasionally or to wet her face and arms but as her pores drank greedily her exhaustion lessened and her vitality returned it was dark when for the first time she turned her head toward the campfire and stared curiously at the figure there the appetizing odor of broiling bacon had drawn her attention and as if no move went unnoticed the man said without lifting his eyes let em soak supperll be ready directly howd you like your eggs if we had any evidently he expected no reply for after a chuckle he began to whistle softly in a peculiarly clear and liquid tone almost like some birdcall he had spoken with an unmistakable texas drawl the woman put him down at once for a cowboy she settled her back against a boulder and rested the pool had become black and mysterious the sky was studded with stars when he called her and she laboriously drew on her stockings and boots well back from the fire he had arranged a seat for her using a saddleblanket for a covering and upon this she lowered herself stiffly as she did so she took fuller notice of the man and found his appearance reassuring i suppose you wonder how i happen to be here she said now dont talk til youre rested miss this coffee is strong enough to walk on its hands and i reckon about two cups of itll rastle you into shape as she raised the tin mug to her lips he waved a hand and smiled drink hearty he set a plate of bread and bacon in her lap then opened a glass jar of jam heres the dulces ive got a sort of sweet tooth in my head i reckon youll have to make out with this cause i rode in too late to rustle any fresh meat and the deliverywagon wont be round before morning so saying he withdrew to the fire the woman ate and drank slowly she was too tired to be hungry and meanwhile the young man squatted upon his heels and watched her through the smoke from a husk cigarette it was perhaps fortunate for her peace of mind that she could not correctly interpret his expression for had she been able to do so she would have realized something of the turmoil into which her presence had thrown him he was accustomed to meeting men in unexpected placeseven in the deserts isolation but to have a night camp in the chaparral invaded by a young and unescorted woman to have a footsore goddess stumble out of the dark and collapse into his arms was a unique experience and one calculated to disturb a person of his solitary habits have you had your supper she finally inquired who me oh ill eat with the help he smiled and when his flashing teeth showed white against his leathery tan the woman decided he was not at all badlooking he was very tall and quite lean with the long legs of a horseman this latter feature accentuated by his highheeled boots and by the short canvas cowboy coat that reached only to his cartridgebelt his features she could not well make out for the fire was little more than a bed of coals and he fed it indianlike with a twig or two at a time i beg your pardon im selfish she extended her cup and plate as an invitation for him to share their contents please eat with me but he refused i aint hungry he affirmed honest accustomed as she was to the diffidence of ranchhands she refrained from urging him and proceeded with her repast when she had finished she lay back and watched him as he ate sparingly my horse fell crossing the arroyo grande she announced abruptly he broke a leg and i had to shoot him is there any water in the grande asked the man no they told me there was plenty i knew of this charco so i made for it who told you there was water in the arroyo those mexicans at the littlegoat ranch balli so you walked in from arroyo grande lord its a good ten miles straightaway and i reckon you came crooked eh yes and it was very hot i was never here but once and the country looks different when youre afoot it certainly does the man nodded then he continued musingly no water there eh i figured there might be a little the fact appeared to please him for he nodded again as he went on with his meal not much rain down here i reckon very little where are you from me hebbronville my name is law evidently thought the woman this fellow belonged to the east outfit or some of the other big cattleranches in the hebbronville district probably he was a range boss or a foreman after a time she said i suppose the nearest ranch is that balli place yesm id like to borrow your horse mr law stared into his plate well miss im afraid she added hastily ill send you a fresh one by ballis boy in the morning he looked up at her from under the brim of his hat dyou reckon you could find that goatranch by starlight miss the woman was silent aint you just about caught up on traveling for one day he asked i reckon you need a good rest about as much as anybody i ever saw you can have my blanket you know the prospect was unwelcome yet she reluctantly agreed perhaps then in the morning law shook his head i cant loan you my horse miss ive got to stay right here but ballis boy could bring him back i got to meet a man here yesm when will he come hed ought to be here at early dark tomorrow evening heedless of her dismay he continued yesm about sundown but i cant stay here ill ride to ballis and have your horse back by afternoon my man might come earlier than i expect mr law persisted really i cant see what difference it would make it wouldnt interfere with your appointment to let me law smiled slowly and setting his plate aside selected a fresh cigarette then as he reached for a coal he explained i havent got what youd exactly call an appointment this feller im expectin is a mexican and day before yesterday he killed a man over in jim wells county they got me by phone at hebbronville and told me hed left hes headin for the border and hes due here about sundown now that arroyo grandes dry i was aimin to let you ride his horse then youre an officer yesm ranger so you see i cant help you to get home till my man comes do you live around here the speaker looked up inquiringly and after an instants hesitation the woman said quietly i am mrs austin she was grateful for the gloom that hid her face i rode out this way to examine a tract of grazingland it seemed fully a minute before the ranger answered then he said in a casual tone i reckon las palmas is quite a ranch maam yes but we need more pasture i know your la feria ranch too i was with general castro when we had that fight near there you were a maderista yesm machinegun man thats a fine country over there seems like god almighty got mixed and put the mexicans on the wrong side of the rio grande but i reckon you havent seen much of la feria since the last revolution broke out no we have tried to remain neutral but again she hesitated mr austin has enemies fortunately both sides have spared la feria law shrugged his broad shoulders oh well the revolution isnt over a ranch in mexico is my idea of a bad investment he rose and taking his blanket sought a favorable spot upon which to spread it then he helped mrs austin to her feet her muscles had stiffened until she could barely stand after which he fetched his saddle for a pillow he made no apologies for his meager hospitality nor did his guest expect any when he had staked out his horse for the night he returned to find the woman rolled snugly in her covering as in a cocoon the dying embers flickered into flame and lit her hair redly she had laid off her felt stetson and one loosened braid lay over her hard pillow thinking her asleep law stood motionless making no attempt to hide his expression of wonderment until unexpectedly she spoke what will you do with me when your mexican comes she said well maam i reckon ill hide you out in the brush till i tame him i hope you sleep well thank you im used to the open he nodded as if he well knew that she was then shaking out his slicker turned away as he lay staring up through the thorny mesquite branches that roofed him inadequately from the dew he marveled mightily a bright steadyburning star peeped through the leaves at him and as he watched it he remembered that this redhaired woman with the still white face was known far and wide through the lower valley as the lone star well he mused the name fitted her she was if reports were true quite as mysterious quite as cold and fixed and unapproachable as the title implied knowledge of her identity had come as a shock for law knew something of her history and to find her suing for his protection was quite thrilling tales of her pale beauty were common and not tame but she was all and more than she had been described and yet why had no one told him she was so young this womans youth and attractiveness amazed him he felt that he had made a startling discovery was she so cold after all or was she merely reserved red hair above a pure white face a womans form wrapped in his blanket ripe red lips caressing the rim of his mean drinkingcup those were things to think about those were pictures for a lonely man she had not been too proud and cold to let him help her in her fatigue she had allowed him to lift her and to make her more comfortable hot against his palms palms unaccustomed to the touch of womans flesh he felt the contact of her naked feet as at the moment when he had placed them in the cooling water her feeble resistance had only called attention to her sex to the slim whiteness of her ankles beneath her short ridingskirt following his first amazement at beholding her had come a fantastic explanation of her presence for a moment or two it had seemed as if the fates had taken heed of his yearnings and had sent her to him out of the dusk wild fancies like these bother men who are much alone of course he had not dreamed that she was the mistress of las palmas that altered matters and yet they were to spend a long idle day together if the mexican did not come another night like this would follow and she was virtually his prisoner perhaps after all dave law stirred nervously and sighed dont this beat hell he murmured ii the ambush alaire austin slept badly the days hardships had left their traces the toxins of fatigue not only poisoned her muscles with aches and pains but drugged her brain and rendered the night a long succession of tortures during which she experienced for a second time the agonies of thirst and fatigue and despair extreme physical ordeals like profound emotional upheavals leave imprints upon the brain and while the body may recover quickly it often requires considerable time to rest exhausted nerves the finer the nervous organism the slower is the process of recuperation like most normal women alaire had a surprising amount of endurance both nervous and muscular but having drawn heavily against her reserve force she paid the penalty during the early hours of the night she slept hardly at all and as soon as her bodily discomfort began to decrease her mind became unruly twice she rose and limped to the waterhole for a drink and it was not until nearly dawn that she dropped off into complete unconsciousness she was awakened by a sunbeam which pierced her leafy shelter and with hot touch explored her upturned face it was still early the sun had just cleared the valleys rim and the ground was damp with dew somewhere near by an unfamiliar bird was sweetly trilling alaire listened dreamily until the birdcarol changed to the air of a familiar cowboy song then she sat up queerly startled david law was watering his horse grooming the animal meanwhile with a burlap doth such attention was unusual in a stock country where horses run wild but this horse mrs austin saw justified unusual care it was a beautiful bloodbay mare and as the woman looked it lifted its head then with wet trembling muzzle caressed its owners cheek undoubtedly this attention was meant for a kiss and was as daintily conferred as any womans favor it brought a reward in a lump of sugar there followed an exhibition of equine delight the mares lips twitched her nose wrinkled ludicrously she stretched her neck and tossed her head as the sweetness tickled her palate even the nervous switching of her tail was eloquent of pleasure meanwhile the owner showed his white teeth in a smile good morning said mrs austin law lifted his hat in a graceful salute as he approached around the edge of the pool his spurs jingling musically the mare followed you have a fine horse there yesm her and me get along all right i hope we didnt wake you maam no i was too tired to sleep well of course i heard you stirring about during the night law paused and the mare with sharp ears cocked forward looked over his shoulder inquisitively tell the lady good morning bessie belle he directed the animal flung its head high then stepped forward and stretching its neck sniffed doubtfully at the visitor what a graceful bow mrs austin laughed you taught her that i presume yesm shed never been to school when i got her she was plumb ignorant but shes got all the airs of a fine lady now sometimes i go without sugar but bessie belle never does and you with a sweet tooth the ranger smiled pleasantly shes as easy as a rockinchair were kind of sweethearts aint we kid again bessie belle tossed her head high thats yes with the reverse english the speaker explained now you just rest yourself maam and order your breakfast what ll it be quail dove or cottontail why whatever you can get that aint the kind of restaurant we run bessie belle would sure be offended if she understood you ever see anybody call a quail can it really be done laws face brightened you wait he led his mare down the arroyo then returned and taking his winchester from its scabbard explained theres a pair of topknots on that sidehill waitin for a drink watch em run into my lap when i give the distress signal of our secret order he skirted the waterhole and seated himself with his heels together and his elbows propped upon his spread knees in the military position for close shooting from where he sat he commanded an unobstructed view of the thickets edge next he moistened his lips and uttered an indescribable low whistle at intervals he repeated the call while the woman looked on with interest suddenly out of the grass burst a blue quail running with wings outstretched and every feather ruffled angrily it paused the mans cheeks snuggled against the stock of his gun and the bark of the thirtythirty sounded loudly mrs austin saw that he had shot the little birds head off she spoke but he stilled her with a gesture threw in a second shell and repeated his magic call there was a longer wait this time but finally the performance was repeated the marksman rose picked up the two birds and came back to the campingplace kind of a lowdown trick when theyve just started housekeeping aint it he smiled mrs austin saw that both crested heads had been cleanly severed that is quite wonderful she said you must be an unusually good shot yesm you can fool turkeys the same way turkeys are easy what do you say to them what brings them out all ruffled up she asked curiously law had one of the birds picked by this time i tell em a snake has got me i reckon each one thinks the other is in trouble and comes to the rescue anyhow its a mighty mean trick he would not permit her to help with the breakfast so she lay back enjoying the luxury of her hard bed and watching her host whose personality now that she saw him by daylight had begun to challenge her interest of late years she had purposely avoided men and circumstances had not permitted her to study those few she had been forced to meet but now that fate had thrown her into the company of this stranger she permitted some play to her curiosity physically law was of an admirable make considerably over six feet in height with wide shoulders and lean strong limbs although his face was schooled to mask all but the keenest emotions the deftness of his movements was eloquent betraying that complete muscular and nervous control which comes from life in the open a pair of bluegray meditative eyes with a whimsical fashion of wrinkling halfshut when he talked relieved a countenance that otherwise would have been a trifle grim and somber the nose was prominent and boldly arched the ears large and pronounced and standing well away from the head the mouth was thinlipped and mobile alaire tried to read that bronzed visage with little success until she closed her eyes and regarded the mental image then she found the answer law had the face and the head of a hunter the alert ears the watchful eyes the predatory nose were like those of some hunting animal yes that was decidedly the strongest impression he gave and yet in his face there was nothing animal in a bad sense certainly it showed no grossness the man was wild untamed rather than sensual and despite his careless use of the plains vernacular he seemed to be rather above the average in education and intelligence at any rate without being stupidly tonguetied he knew enough to remain silent when there was nothing to say and that was a blessing for mrs austin herself was not talkative and idle chatter distressed her on the whole when alaire had finished her analysis she rather resented the good impression law had made upon her for on general principles she chose to dislike and distrust men rising she walked painfully to the pond and made a leisurely toilet breakfast was ready when she returned and once more the man sat upon his heels and smoked while she ate alaire could not catch his eyes upon her except when he spoke at which time his gaze was direct and open yet never did she feel free from his intensest observation after a while she remarked im glad to see a ranger in this county there has been a lot of stealing down our way and the association men cant seem to stop it perhaps you can the rangers have a reputation in that line he admitted but there is stealing all up and down the border since the war you lost any stuff yes mostly horses sure they need horses in mexico the ranchers have organized they have formed a sort of vigilance committee in each town and talk of using bloodhounds bloodhounds aint any good outside of novels if beef got scarce them greasers would steal the dogs and eat em he added meditatively dog aint such bad eatin either have you tried it mr law nodded it was better than some of the army beef we got in the philippines then in answer to her unspoken inquiry yesm i served an enlistment there you were a private soldier yesm mrs austin was incredulous and yet she could not well express her surprise without too personal an implication i cant imagine anybody that is a man like you as a common soldier well i wasnt exactly that he grinned no i was about the most uncommon soldier out there i had a speakin acquaintance with most of the guardhouses in the islands before i got through but why did you enlist a man like you why he pondered the question i was young i guess i needed the excitement i have to get about so much or i dont enjoy my food did you join the maderistas for excitement mostly then too i believed panchito madero was honest and would give the peons land an honest mexican is worth fightin for anywhere the pelados are still struggling for their land for that and a chance to live and work and be happy mrs austin stirred impatiently they are fighting because they are told to fight there is no patriotism in them said she i think he said with grave deliberateness the majority feel something big and vague and powerful stirring inside them they dont know exactly what it is perhaps but it is there mexico has outgrown her dictators they have been overthrown by the same causes that brought on the french revolution the french revolution alaire leaned forward eying the speaker with startled intensity you dont talk like a like an enlisted man what do you know about the french revolution reaching for a coal the ranger spoke without facing her ive read a good bit maam and im a noble listener i remember good too why i had a picture of the bastille once he pronounced it bastilly and his hearer settled back that was some calaboose now wasnt it a moment later he inquired ingenuously i dont suppose you ever saw that bastille did you no only the place where it stood sho you must have traveled right smart for such a young lady he beamed amiably upon her i was educated abroad and i only came home to be married law noted the lifeless way in which she spoke and he understood ill bet you hablar those french and german lingoes like a native he ventured beats me how a person can do it you speak spanish dont you oh yes but i was born in mexico as near as i can make out and you probably speak some of the filipino dialects yesm a few there was something winning about this young mans modesty and something flattering in his respectful admiration he seemed also to know his place a fact which was even more in his favor undoubtedly he had force and ability probably his love of adventure and a happy lack of settled purpose had led him to neglect his more commonplace opportunities and sent him first into the army and thence into the ranger service the world is full of such and the frontier is their gatheringplace mrs austin had met a number of men like law and to her they seemed to be the true soldiers of fortune fellows who lived purely for the fun of living and leavened their days with adventure they were buoyant souls for the most part drifting with the tide resentful of authority and free from care meeting each day with enthusiastic expectancy for what it held in store they were restless and improvident the world counted them neerdowells and yet she knew that at least their hours were full and that their names some of them were written large in the distant places alaire austin often told herself that had she been born a man such a life as this might have been hers and she took pleasure in dreaming sometimes of the experience that fate in such a case would have brought to her being a woman however and being animated at this particular moment by a peculiarly feminine impulse she felt urged to add her own touch to what nature had roughed out this man had been denied what she termed an education therefore she decided to put one in his way do you like to read she asked him say its my favorite form of exercise laws bluegray eyes were expressionless his face was bland why i have a great many books at las palmas you might enjoy some of them now thats nice of you maam mebbe ill look into this cattlestealin in your neighborhood and if i do ill sure come borrowin oh ill send you a boxful when i get back said alaire and dave thanked her humbly later when he went to move his mare into a shady spot the ranger chuckled and slapped his thigh with his hat bessie belle were going to improve our minds he said aloud were going to be literary and read pilgrims progress and alice in wonderland i bet well enjoy em eh but doggone shes a nice lady and your coat is just the same color as her hair where the shade was densest and the breeze played most freely there dave fixed a comfortable couch for his guest and during the heat of the forenoon she dozed asleep she exercised upon him an even more disturbing effect than when awake for now he could study her beauty deliberately from the loose pile of warm red hair to the narrow tightlaced boots what he saw was altogether delightful her slightly parted lips offered an irresistible attraction almost an invitation the heat had lent a feverish flush to her cheeks dave could count the slow pulsations of her white throat he closed his eyes and tried to quell his unruly longings he was a strong man adventurous days and nights spent in the open had coarsened the masculine side of his character perhaps at expense to his finer nature for it is a human tendency to revert he was masterful and ruthless lacking obligations or responsibilities of any sort he had been accustomed to take what he wanted therefore the gaze he fixed upon the sleeping woman betrayed an ardor calculated to deepen the color in her cheeks had she beheld it and yet strangely enough dave realized that his emotions were unaccountably mixed this womans distress had of course brought a prompt and natural response but now her implicit confidence in his honor and her utter dependence upon him awoke his deepest chivalry then too the knowledge that her life was unhappy indeed tragic filled him with a sort of wondering pity as he continued to look at her these feelings grew until finally he turned away his face with his chin in his hands he stared out somberly into the blinding heat he had met few women of late years and never one quite like this never one for instance who made him feel so dissatisfied with his own shortcomings after a time he rose and withdrew to the shelter of another tree there to content himself with mental images of his guest but one cannot sleep well with a tropic sun in the heavens and since there was really nothing for her to do until the heat abated alaire when she awoke obliged the ranger to amuse her although she was in fact younger than he married life had matured her and she treated him therefore like a boy law did not object mrs austins position in life was such that most men were humble in her presence and now her superior wisdom seemed to excite the rangers liveliest admiration only now and then as if in an unguarded moment did he appear to forget himself and speak with an authority equaling her own what he said at such times indicated either a remarkably retentive memory or else an ability to think along original lines too rare among men of his kind to be easily credited for instance during a discussion of the mexican situation and of course their talk drifted thither for at the moment it was the one vitally interesting topic along the border he excused the barbarous practices of the mexican soldiers by saying of course theyre cruel vindictive treacherous but after all there are only a hundred and forty generations between us and adam only a hundred and forty lifetimes since the garden of eden we civilized peoples are only a lap or two ahead of the uncivilized ones when you think that it takes ten thousand generations to develop a plant and root out some of its early heredities you can see that human beings have a long way yet to go before they become perfect were creatures of environment just like plants environment has made the mexican what he is certainly this was an amazing speech to issue from a sunbrowned cowboy sitting crosslegged under a mesquitetree from under her hatbrim alaire austin eyed the speaker with a curiosity into which there had come a vague hostility for the moment she was suspicious and piqued but law did not appear to notice and as he talked on her doubts gradually subsided you said last night that you were born on the other side she inclined her ruddy head to the west yesm my father was a mining man and he done well over there until he locked horns with the guadalupes old don enrique and him had a runin at the finish over some land or something it was when the don was gobbling all the property in the state and laying the foundation for his big fortune you know he had permission from the president to steal all the land he cared to just like the rest of those local governors had well guadalupe tried to run my people out did he succeed nom he killed em but they stayed not really the listener was shocked american citizens too times wasnt much different then than now theres plenty of good americans been killed in mexico and nothing done about it even in our day i dont know all the details never could get em either for i was away at school but after i came back from the philippines the madero fuss was just brewing so i went over and joined it but it didnt last long and there wasnt enough fighting to suit me ive been back off and on since and ive burned a good deal of guadalupe property and swum a good many head of guadalupe stock as the morning progressed law proved himself an interesting companion and in spite of the discomforts of the situation the hours slipped past rapidly luncheon was a disagreeable meal eaten while the arroyo baked and the heat devils danced on the hills but the unpleasantness was of brief duration and law always managed to banish boredom nor did he seem to waste a thought upon the nature of that grim business which brought him to this place quite the contrary in the afternoon he put his mare through her tricks for alaires edification and gossiped idly of whatever interested his guest then as the sun edged to the west and mrs austin became restless he saddled bessie belle and led her down the gulch into a safer covert returning he carefully obliterated all traces of the camp he watered the ashes of the fire gathered up the telltale scraps of paper and fragments of food and then when the place suited him fell to examining his rifle alaire watched him with interest where shall i go she asked and what shall i do you just pick out a good cover beyond the waterhole and stay there maam it may be a long wait for something may have happened if so well have to lie close and dont worry yourself none maam he wont make no trouble the afternoon drew to a close gradually the blinding white glare of the sun lessened and yellowed the shadow of the bluffs began to stretch out the shallow pool lay silent deserted save for furtive little shapes that darted nervously out of the leaves or for winged visitors that dropped out of the air with the sunset there came the sound of hoofs upon loose stones branches rustled against breasting bodies and mrs austin cowered low in her hidingplace but it was only the advanceguard of a bunch of brush cattle coming to water they paused at a distance and nothing except their thirst finally overcame their suspicions one by one they drifted into sight drank warily at the remotest edge of the tanque then alarmed at some imaginary sight or sound went clattering up the ravine once again the waterhole lay sleeping alaires retreat was far from comfortable there was an ants nest somewhere near her and she thought of moving but suddenly her breath caught and her heart jumped uncontrollably she crouched lower for directly opposite her position and outlined against the sky where the sharp ridge cut it was the figure of a mounted man rider and horse were silhouetted against the pearlgray heaven like an equestrian statue how long they had been there alaire had no faintest notion perhaps it was their coming which had alarmed the cattle she was conscious that a keen and hostile pair of eyes was searching the coverts surrounding the charco then as silently as it had appeared the apparition vanished beyond the ridge and alaire wondered if the rider had taken alarm she earnestly hoped so this breathless vigil was getting on her nerves and the sight of that threatening figure had set her pulses to throbbing the rider was on his guard that was plain he was armed too and probably desperate the ominous possibilities of this ambush struck her forcibly alaire lay close as she had been directed praying that the horseman had been warned but shortly she heard again the rustle of stiff branches and out into the opening rode a mexican he was astride a wiry gray pony and in the strong twilight alaire could see his every feature the swarthy cheeks the roving eyes beneath the black felt hat a carbine lay across his saddlehorn a riata was coiled beside his leg a cartridgebelt circled his waist there was something familiar about the fellow but at the moment alaire could not determine what it was after one swift appraising glance the newcomer rode straight to the verge of the waterhole and dismounted then he and his horse drank side by side it was the moment for a complete and effective surprise but nothing happened why didnt law act alaire bent low straining eyes and ears but no command came from the ranger after a while the traveler rose to his feet and stretched his limbs next he walked to the ashes of the fire and looked down at them stirring them with his toe apparently satisfied he lit a cigarette could it be that something had gone wrong with the rangers plan had something happened to him alaire was startled by the possibility this delay was beyond her comprehension then as if in answer to her perplexity a second horseman appeared and the woman realized how simply she had been fooled iii what happened at the waterhole the newcomers exchanged a word or two in spanish then the second rider flung himself from his saddle and made for the water he was lying prone and drinking deeply when out of nowhere came a sharp command oiga hands up both of you the first arrival jumped as if a rattlesnake had buzzed at his back the second leaped to his feet with an oath they stared in the direction whence the voice had come drop your gun companero the order was decisive it was directed at the man who had first appeared for the other had left his winchester in its scabbard both mexicans cried as if at a cue who speaks a ranger the fellow law had addressed let fall his rifle two pairs of dark hands rose slowly then the ranger went on in spanish anto lower your left hand and unbuckle your belt anto did as he was told his revolver and cartridgebelt dropped to the ground and you compadre do the same mind you the left hand now face about and walk to the charco both of you good law stepped into view his winchester in the crook of his arm he emptied the three discarded weapons then walking to antos horse he removed the second carbine from beneath the saddleflap and ejected its shells into his palm this done he addressed the stranger now friend who are you and why are you riding with this fellow my name is panfilo sanchez senor before god i have done nothing the speaker was tremendously excited well panfilo that will take some proving the ranger muttered what do you say the gist of this statement having been repeated in spanish both prisoners burst into clamorous explanation of their presence together panfilo it seemed had encountered his companion purely by chance and was horrified now to learn that his newly made friend was wanted by the authorities in the midst of his incoherent protestations mrs austin appeared he is telling you the truth mr law she said quietly he is one of my men both mexicans looked blank at sight of the speaker their mouths fell open and panfilo ceased his gesticulations mrs austin went on he is my horsebreakers cousin he couldnt have had any part in that murder in jim wells county for he was at las palmas when i left panfilo recovered from his amazement removed his sombrero and blessed his employer extravagantly then he turned triumphantly upon his captor behold cried he there you have the truth i am an excellent hardworking man and as honest as god surely you dont want him alaire appealed to law he was probably helping his countryman to escape but they all do that you know all right if hes your man thats enough dave told her now then boys it will soon be dark and well need some supper before we start it wont hurt antos horse to rest a bit either you are under arrest he added addressing the latter you understand what that means si senor i wont tie you unless no senor anto understood perfectly and was grateful well then build a fire and you panfilo lend a hand the senora will need a cup of tea for we three have a long ride ahead of us no time was lost both mexicans fell to with a will and in a surprisingly short time water was boiling when it came laws turn to eat alaire who was eager to be gone directed her employee to fetch the rangers horse panfilo acquiesced readily and buckled on his cartridgebelt and sixshooter he was about to pick up his rifle too but finding laws eyes inquiringly fixed upon him he turned with a shrug and disappeared down the arroyo it was plain that he considered his friendly relations well established and resented the rangers suspicion how long has that fellow been working for you law jerked his head in the direction panfilo had taken not long i dont know much about him alaire confessed then as if in answer to his unspoken question but im sure hes all right is he looking up range for you n no i left him at the ranch i dont know how he came to be here unless it is rather strange dave shot a swift interrogatory glance at panfilos traveling companion but antos face was stony his black eyes were fixed upon the fire with an abrupt gesture law flung aside the contents of his cup and strode to panfilos horse which stood dejectedly with reins hanging where are you going alaire rose nervously it was nearly dark now only the crests of the ridges were plain against the luminous sky in the brushy bottom of the arroyo the shadows were deep alaire had no wish to be left alone with the prisoner with bridlerein and carbine in his left hand the ranger halted then stooping for antos discarded cartridgebelt he looped it over his saddlehorn he vaulted easily into the seat saying i hid that mare pretty well your man may not be able to find her then he turned his borrowed horses head toward the brush anto had squatted motionless until this moment he had not even turned his eyes but now without the slightest warning he uttered a loud call it might have served equally well as a summons or as an alarm but it changed the rangers suspicions into certainty dave uttered an angry exclamation then to the startled woman he cried watch this man he cant hurt you for ive got his shells to his prisoner he said sharply stay where you are dont move the next instant he had loped into the brush on the tracks of panfilo sanchez spurring the tired gray pony into vigorous action it was an uncomfortable situation in which alaire now found herself law was too suspicious she murmured to herself he was needlessly melodramatic she felt exceedingly ill at ease as the ponys hoofbeats grew fainter she was not afraid of anto having dealt with mexican vaqueros for several years yet she could not forget that he was a murderer and she wondered what she was expected to do if he should try to escape it was absurd to suppose that panfilo her own hired man could be capable of treachery the mere suspicion was a sort of reflection upon her alaire was startled by hearing other hoofbeats now their drumming came faint but unmistakable yes there were two horses racing down the arroyo anto the fugitive rose to his feet and stared into the dusk sit down alaire ordered sharply he obeyed muttering beneath his breath but his head was turned as if in an effort to follow the sounds of the pursuit next came the distant rattle of loosened stones evidently one horse was being urged toward the open high ground then the peaceful quiet evening was split by the report of laws thirtythirty another shot followed and then a third both alaire and her prisoner were on their feet the woman shaking in every limb the mexican straining his eyes into the gloom and listening intently soon there came a further echo of dry earth and gravel dislodged but whether by laws horse or by that of sanchez was uncertain perhaps both men had gained the mesa it had all happened so quickly and so unexpectedly that alaire felt she must be dreaming or that there had been some idiotic mistake she wondered if the rangers sudden charge had not simply frightened panfilo into a panicky flight and she tried to put her thoughts into words the mexican would understand but his answer was unintelligible his black scowl however was eloquent of uncertainty and apprehension alaire had begun to feel the strain of the situation and was trying to decide what next to do when david law came riding out of the twilight he was astride the gray behind him at the end of a lariat was bessie belle and her saddle was empty mrs austin uttered a sharp cry law dismounted and strode to the prisoner his face was black with fury he seemed gigantic in his rage without a word he raised his right hand and cuffed the mexican to his knees then he leaped upon him as a dog might pounce upon a rabbit rolled him to his face and twisted the fellows arms into the small of his back anto cursed he struggled but he was like a child in the rangers grasp law knelt upon him and with a jerk of his riata secured the fellows wrists rising he set the knot with another heave that dragged the prisoner to his knees next he booted anto to his feet by god ive a notion to bend a gun over your head law growled clever little game wasnt it where did you kill him the woman gasped alaire had never beheld such a demoniac expression as law turned upon her the mans face was contorted his eyes were blazing insanely his chest was heaving and for an instant he seemed to include her in his anger ignoring her inquiry he went to his mare and ran his shaking hands over her as if in search of an injury his questing palms covered every inch of glistening hide from forelock to withers from shoulder to hoof and under cover of this task he regained in some degree his selfcontrol that hombre of yours didnt look right to me he said finally laying his cheek against bessie belles neck as a woman snuggles close to the man of her choice he addressed the mare i reckon nobody is going to steal you eh not if i know it no sir that hombre wasnt any good was he alaire wet her lips then you shot him law laughed grimly almost mockingly say he must be a favorite of yours nno i hardly knew the fellow but did you i didnt say i shot him he told her gruffly i warned him first and he turned on me blew smoke in my face then he took to the brush afoot and i cut down on him once more to help him along he got away i reckon so oh oh alaires tone left no doubt of her relief he was always a good man good didnt he steal my horse didnt he aim to get me at the first chance and free his compadre thats why he wanted his winchester say i reckon he needs killin about as much as anybody i know i cant understand it alaire sat down weakly one of my men too this fellow behaved himself while i was gone eh law jerked his head in antos direction i was afraid he hed try something if he had such a possibility oddly enough seemed to choke the speaker and the ferocity of his unfinished threat caused mrs austin to look up at him curiously there was a moment of silence then he said shortly well weve got a horse apiece now lets go the stars had thickened and brightened rounding the night sky into a glittering dome anto the murderer with his ankles lashed beneath his horses belly rode first next in a sullen silence came the ranger his chin upon his breast and in the rear followed alaire austin in spite of her release from a trying predicament the woman was scarcely more eager to go home than was the prisoner for while antos trail led to a jail hers led to las palmas and there was little difference these last two days in the open had been like a glimpse of freedom for a time alaire had almost lost the taste of bitter memories it had required an effort of will to drug remembrance but she had succeeded and had proven her ability to forget but now las palmas it meant the usual thing the same endless battle between her duty and her desire she was tired of the fight that resulted neither in victory nor defeat she longed now more than ever to give up and let things take their course why could not women as well as men yield to their inclinations drift with the current instead of breasting it until they were exhausted there was david law for instance he was utterly carefree no duties shackled him he had his horse his gun and his blanket and they were enough alaire like him was young her mind was eager her body ripe and her veins full of fire life must be sweet to those who were free and happy but the object of her envy was not so completely at peace with himself as she supposed even yet his mind was in a black turmoil from his recent anger and of late be it said these spells of temper had given him cause for uneasiness then too there was a lie upon his lips under the stars at the break of the arroyo three hundred yards below the waterhole a coyote was slinking in a wide circle around the body of panfilo sanchez iv an evening at las palmas although the lower counties of southwest texas are flat and badly watered they possess a rich soil they are favored too by a kindly climate subtropic in its mildness the days are long and bright and breezy while night brings a drenching dew that keeps the grasses green of late years there have been few of those distressing droughts that gave this part of the state an evil reputation and there has been a corresponding increase in prosperity the rio grande jaundiced erratic as an invalid wrings its saffron blood from the clay bluffs and gravel canons of the hill country but near its estuary winds quietly through a low coastal plain which the very impurities of that blood have richened here the rivers banks are smothered in thickets of huisache ebony mesquite oak and alamo railroads those vitalizing nervefibers of commerce are so scarce along this division of the border that even in this day when we boast or lament that we no longer have a frontier there remain in texas sections larger than some of our eastern states which hear the sound of iron wheels only on their boundaries to travel from brownsville north along the international line one must for several hundred miles avail oneself of horses mules or motorcars since rail transportation is almost lacking and on his way the traveler will traverse whole counties where the houses are jacals where english is a foreign tongue and where peons plow their fields with crooked sticks as did the ancient egyptians that part of the state which lies below the nueces river was for a time disputed territory and long after texans had given their lives to drive the eagle of mexico across the rio grande much of it remained a forbidden land even today it is alien it is a part of our southland but a south different to any other that we have within it there are no blacks and yet the whites number but one in twenty the rest are swarthy blackhaired men who speak the spanish tongue and whose citizenship is mostly a matter of form the stockmen pushing ahead of the nesters and the tillers of the soil were the first to invade the lower rio grande and among these old ed austin was a pioneer out of the unmapped prairie he had hewed a foothold and there among surroundings as mexican as mexico he had laid the beginnings of his fortune of old eds early life strange stories are told like the other cattle barons he was hungry for land and took it where or how he could there are tales of fertile sections bought for ten cents an acre tales of mexican ranchers dispossessed by mortgage by monte or by any means that came to hand stories even of some more stubborn than the rest who refused to feed the austin greed for land and who remained on their farms to feed the buzzards instead those were crude old days the pioneers who pushed their herds into the far pastures were lawless fellows ruthless acquisitive mastered by the empirebuilders urge for acres and still more acres they were the reclaimers the men who seized and held and then seized more concerning themselves little or not at all with the moral law as applicable to both mexican and white and leaving it to the second generation to justify their acts if ever justification were required as other ranches grew under the hands of such unregenerate owners so also under old ed austins management did las palnaas increase and prosper the estate took its name from a natural grove of palms in which the house was built it comprised an expanse of rich riverland backed by miles of range where box a cattle lived and bred in his later years the old man sold much land and some he leased but when he handed las palmas to his son young ed as a wedding gift the ranch still remained a property to be proud of and one that was known far and wide for its size and richness leaving his boy to work out of it a fortune for himself and his bride the father retired to san antonio whither the friends and cronies of his early days were drifting there he settled down and proceeded to finish his allotted span exactly as suited him best the ranchers ideal of an agreeable old age comprised three important items to wit complete leisure unlimited freedom of speech and two pints of rye whisky daily he enjoyed them all impartially until about a year before this story opens he died profanely and comfortably he had a big funeral and was sincerely mourned by a coterie of gouty old indianfighters las palmas had changed greatly since austin senior painfully scrawled his slanting signature to the deed it was a different ranch now to what the old man had known indeed it was doubtful if he would have recognized it for even the house was new alaire had some such thought in mind as she rode up to the gate on the afternoon following her departure from the waterhole and she felt a thrill of pride at the acres of sprouting corn the dense green fields of alfalfa so nicely fitted between their fences they were like clean green squares of matting spread for the feet of summer a mexican boy came running to care for her horse a mexican woman greeted her as she entered the wide cool hall and went to her room alaire had ridden far part of the night had been spent at the balli goatranch the remainder of the journey had been hot and dusty and even yet she was not wholly recovered from her experience of the outward trip the house servants at las palmas were on the whole well trained and mrs austins periodic absences excited no comment in the present instance dolores fixed a bath and laid out clean clothes with no more than a running accompaniment of chatter concerned with household affairs dolores indeed was superior to the ordinary servant she was a woman of some managerial ability and she combined the duties of personal maid with those of housekeeper she was a great gossip and possessed such a talent for gaining information that through her husband benito the range boss she was able to keep her mistress in fairly intimate touch with ranch matters alaire however was at this moment in no mood to resume the tiresome details of management she quickly dismissed her servitor and proceeded to revel in the luxury of a cool bath after which she took a nap later as she leisurely dressed herself she acknowledged that it was good to feel the physical comforts of her own house even though her homecoming gave her no especial joy she made it a religious practice to dress for dinner regardless of eds presence though often for weeks at a time she sat in solitary state presiding over an empty table nevertheless she kept to her custom for not only did the formality help her to retain her own selfrespect but it had its influence upon the servants without companionship one needs to be ever upon guard to retain the nice refinements of gentle breeding and any one who has exercised authority in savage countries soon learns the importance of leaving unbridged the gulf of color and of class but alaire looked forward to no lonely dinner tonight for ed was at home it was with a grave preoccupation that she made herself ready to meet him dolores bustled in for a second time and straightway launched herself into a tirade against juan the horseboy devil take me if there was ever such a shameless fellow she cried angrily he delights in tormenting me and dios he is lazier than a snake work bah he abhors it all day long he snaps his revolver and pretends to be a bandido and when he is not risking bells fire in that way he is whirling his riata and jumping through it useless capers he ropes the dog he ropes the rosebushes he ropes fat victoria the cook carrying a huge bowl of hot water to scald the ants nest victorias stomach is boiled red altogether and so painful that when she comes near the stove she curses in a way to chill your blood what does he do this morning but fling his wicked loop over a calfs head and break off one of its little horns it was terrible but senor austin only laughed and told him he was a fine vaquero has mr austin been here all the time yes has he drunk much umm no more than common he is on the gallery now with his cocktails he knows i am at home i told him alaire went on dressing after a little she asked has benito finished branding the calves in the south pasture he finished yesterday and sent the remuda to the six mile jose sanchez will have completed the rodeo by this afternoon benito rode in last night to see you by the way you know joses cousin panfilo si why did he leave las palmas dolores hesitated so long that her mistress turned upon her with a look of sharp inquiry he went to la feria senora then in a lowered tone mr austin ordered it suddenly without warning he sent him away though panfilo did not wish to go benito told me all about it why was he transferred come what ails your tongue dolores well i keep my eyes open and my ears too i am no fool dolores paused doubtfully yes yes dolores drew closer rosa morales you know the girl her father works the big pumpengine at the river well he is not above anything that man not above selling his own flesh and blood and the girl is no better she thinks about nothing except men and she attends all the bailes for miles around on both sides of the river panfilo loved her he was mad about her thats why he came here to work they were engaged were they not truly and panfilo was jealous of any man who looked at rosa now you can understand why he was sent away doloress sharp eyes narrowed meaningly senor ed has been riding toward the river every day lately panfilo was furious so i see that is all i care to hear alone alaire stood motionless for some time her face fixed her eyes unseeing but later when she met her husband in the diningroom her greeting was no less civil than usual ed acknowledged his wifes entrance with a careless nod but did not trouble to remove his hands from his pockets as he seated himself heavily at the table and with unsteady fingers shook the folds from his napkin he said you stayed longer than you intended umm you were gone three days werent you four days alaire told him realizing with a little inward start how very far apart she and ed had drifted she looked at him curiously for an instant wondering if he really could be her husband or if he were not some peculiarly disagreeable stranger ed had been a handsome boy but maturity had vitiated his good looks he was growing fat from drink and soft from idleness his face was too full his eyes too sluggish there was an unhealthy redness in his cheeks in contrast to his wifes semiformal dress he was unkempt unshaven and soiled he wore spurred boots and a soft shirt his nails were grimy when in the city he contrived to garb himself immaculately he was in fact something of a dandy but at home he was a sloven and openly reveled in a freedom of speech and a coarseness of manner that were sad trials to alaire his preparations for dinner this evening had been characteristically simple he had drunk three dry cocktails and flung his sombrero into a corner ive been busy while you were gone he announced been down to the pumphouse every day laying that new intake it was a nasty job too i had morales barbecue a cabrito for my lunch and it was good but im hungry again austin attacked his meal with an enthusiasm strange in him for of late his appetite had grown as errant as his habits ed boasted in his clubs that he was an outdoor man and he was wont to tell his friends that the rough life was the life for him but as a matter of fact he spent much more time in san antonio than he did at home and each of his sojourns at las palmas was devoted principally to sobering up from his last visit to the city and to preparing for another nor was he always sober even in his own house ed was a heavy and a constant drinker at all times what little exercise he took was upon the back of a horse and as no one knew better than his wife the physical powers he once had were rapidly deteriorating by and by he inquired vaguely lets see where did you go this time i went up to look over that ygnacio tract oh yes how did you find it not very promising it needs a lot of wells i havent been out that way since i was a boy think youll lease it i dont know i must find some place for those la feria cattle austin shook his head better leave em where they are until the rebels take that country i stand mighty well with them thats the trouble alaire told him you stand too well so well that i want to get my stock out of federal territory as soon as possible ed shrugged carelessly suit yourself theyre your cows the meal went on with a desultory flow of small talk during which the husband indulged his thirst freely alaire told him about the accident to her horse and the unpleasant ordeal she had suffered in the mesquite lucky you found somebody at the waterhole ed commented who was this ranger never heard of the fellow he commented on the name the rangers are nothing like they used to be this fellow would do credit to any organization as alaire described how expeditiously law had made his arrest and handled his man her husband showed interest nicolas anto eh said he who was his companero panfilo sanchez ed started thats strange they must have met accidentally so they both declared why did you let panfilo go we didnt need him here and he was too good a man to lose so ed found his wifes eyes fixed upon him and dropped his own i knew you were shorthanded at la feria there was an interval of silence then ed exclaimed testily what are you looking at i wondered what youd say eh cant i fire a man without a longwinded explanation something in alaires expression warned him of her suspicion therefore he took refuge behind an assumption of anger my god dont i have a word to say about my own ranch just because ive let you run things to suit yourself wait we had our understanding alaires voice was low and vibrant it was my payment for living with you and you know it you gave me the reins to las palmas so that id have something to do something to live for and think about except your actions the ranch has doubled in value every penny is accounted for and you have more money to spend on yourself than ever before you have no reason to complain austin crushed his napkin into a ball and flung it from him with a scowl he shoved himself back from the table it was an idiotic arrangement just the same i agreed because i was sick dad thought i was all shot to pieces but im all right now and able to run my own business nevertheless it was a bargain and it will stand if your father were alive hed make you live up to it hell you talk as if i were a child shouted her husband and his plump face was apoplectic with rage the title is in my name how could he make me do anything nobody could force you his wife said quietly you are still enough of a man to keep your word i believe so long as i observe my part of our bargain ed slightly mollified agreed of course i am i never welched but i wont be treated as an incompetent and im tired of these eternal wrangles and jangles you have welched eh austin frowned belligerently you agreed to go away when you felt your appetite coming on and you promised to live clean at least around home well have you done it certainly i never said id cut out the booze entirely what about your carousals at brownsville austin subsided sullenly other men have got full in brownsville no doubt but you made a scandal you have been seen with women in a good many places where we are known bah theres nothing to it alaire went on in a lifeless tone that covered the seething emotions within her i never inquire into your actions at san antonio or other large cities although of course i have ears and i cant help hearing about them but these border towns are home to us and people know me i wont be humiliated more than i am public pity is hard enough to bear ive about reached the breakingpoint indeed austin leaned forward his eyes inflamed his tone was raised heedless of possible eavesdroppers then why dont you end it why dont you divorce me god knows i never see anything of you you have your part of the house and i have mine all we share in common is mealhours and and a mail address youre about as much my wife as dolores is alaire turned upon him eyes dark with misery you know why i dont divorce you no ed were going to live out our agreement and these brownsville episodes are going to cease her lips whitened so are your visits to the pumpingstation what do you mean by that you transferred panfilo because he was growing jealous of you and rosa ed burst into sudden laughter good lord theres no harm in a little flirtation rosas a pretty girl his wife uttered a breathless smothered exclamation her hands as they lay on the tablecloth were tightly clenched shes your tenant almost your servant what kind of a man are you havent you any decency left say go easy i guess im no different to most men austins unpleasant laughter had been succeeded by a still more unpleasant scowl i have to do something its dead enough around here you must stop going there humph i notice you go where you please rosa and i never spent a night together in the chaparral ed alaires exclamation was like the snap of a whip she rose and faced her husband quivering as if the lash had stung her flesh that went home eh well im no fool ive seen something of the world and ive found that women are about like men id like to have a look at this david law this gunman this handsome harry who waits at waterholes for ladies in distress ed ignored his wifes outflung hand and continued mockingly ill bet hes all thats manly and splendid everything that im not youd better stop gasped the woman i cant stand everything so well neither can i after this i think youd better go to san antonio maybe ill forget before you come back to this young ed agreed quickly enough good said he that suits me its hell around las palmas anyhow and ill at least get a little peace at my club he glowered after his wife as she left the room then still scowling he lurched out to the gallery where the breeze was blowing and flung himself into a chair v something about heredity it had required but one generation to ripen the fruits of old ed austins lawlessness and upon his son heredity had played one of her grimmest pranks the father had had faults but they were those of his virtues he had been a strong man at least and had ridden herd upon his unruly passions with the same thoroughness as over his wild cattle the result was that he had been universally respected at first the son seemed destined to be like his father it was not until young ed had reached his full manhood that his defects had become recognizable evil tendencies that his infirmity had developed into a disease like sleeping cancers the austin vices had lain dormant in him during boyhood it had required the mutation from youth to manhood and the alterative effect of marriage to rouse them but once awakened their ravages had been swift and destructive eds marriage to alaire had been inevitable they had been playmates and their parents had considered the union a consummation of their own lifelong friendship upon her mothers death alaire had been sent abroad and there she remained while young ed attended an eastern college for any child the experience would have been a lonesome one and through it the motherless texas girl had grown into an imaginative sentimental person living in a makebelieve world peopled for the most part with the bestremembered figures of romance and fiction there were of course some few fleshandblood heroes among the rest and of these the finest and the noblest had been young ed austin when she came home to marry alaire was still very much of a child and she still considered ed her knight as for him he was captivated by this splendid handsome girl whom he remembered only as a shy redheaded little comrade never was a marriage more propitious never were two young people more happily situated than these two for they were madly in love and each had ample means with which to make the most of life as las palmas had been the elder austins weddinggift to his son so alaires dowry from her father had been la feria a grant of lands across the rio grande beyond the twentyleague belt by which mexico fatuously strives to guard her border and to las palmas had come the bride and groom to live to love and to rear their children but rarely has there been a shorter honeymoon seldom a swifter awakening within six months young ed had killed his wifes love and had himself become an alcoholic others of his fathers vices revived and so multiplied that what few virtues the young man had inherited were soon choked the change was utterly unforeseen its cause was rooted too deeply in the past to be remedied maturity had marked an epoch with young ed marriage had been the milepost where his whole course veered abruptly to the bride the truth had come as a stunning tragedy she was desperately frightened too and lived a nightmare life the while she tried in every way to check the progress of that disintegration which was eating up her happiness the wreck of her hopes and glad imaginings left her sick bewildered in the face of the thing that couldnt nor had the effect of this transformation in young ed been any less painful to his father for a time the old man refused to credit it but finally when the truth was borne in upon him unmistakably and he saw that las palmas was in a fair way to being ruined through the boys mismanagement the old cattleman had risen in his wrath the ranch had been his pride as ed had been his joy to see them both go wrong was more than he could bear there had been a terrible scene and a tonguelashing delivered in the language of early border days there had followed other visits from austin senior other and even bitterer quarrels at last when the girlwife remained firm in her refusal to divorce her husband the understanding had been reached by which the management of las palmas was placed absolutely in her hands of course the truth became public as it always does this was a new country only yesterday it had been the frontier and even yet a frontier code of personal conduct to some extent prevailed nevertheless young ed austins life became a scorn and a hissing among his neighbors they were not unduly fastidious these neighbors and they knew that hot blood requires more than a generation to cool but everything ed did outraged them in trying to show their sympathy for his wife they succeeded in wounding her more deeply and alaire withdrew into herself she became almost a recluse and fenced herself away not only from the curious but also from those who really wished to be her friends in time people remarked that ed austins metamorphosis was no harder to understand than that of his wife it was true she had changed the alteration reached to the very bone and marrow of her being at first the general pity had wounded her then it had offended and finally angered her that people should notice her affliction particularly when she strove so desperately to hide it seemed the height of insolence the management of las palmas was almost her only relief having sprung from a family of ranchers the work came easy and she grew to like it as well as she could like anything with that everpresent pain in her breast the property was so large that it gave ample excuse for avoiding the few visitors who came and the range boss benito gonzales attended to most of the buying and selling callers gradually became rarer friends dropped away almost entirely since las palmas employed no white help whatever it became in time more mexican than in the days of old ed austins ownership in such wise had alaire fashioned her life living meanwhile under a sort of truce with her husband but las palmas had prospered to admiration and la feria would have prospered equally had it not been for the armed unrest of the country across the border no finer stock than the box a was to be found anywhere the old lean longhorned cattle had been interbred with whitefaced herefords and the sleek coats of their progeny were stretched over twice the former weight of beef alaire had even experimented with the brahman strain importing some huge humpbacked bulls that set the neighborhood agog people proclaimed they were sacred oxen and whispered that they were intended for some outlandish pagan rite alaire by this time had gained the reputation of being queer while experienced stockmen declared the venture a womans folly affirming that buffaloes had never been crossed successfully with domestic cattle it was rumored that one of these imported animals cost more than a whole herd of mexican stock and the ranchers speculated freely as to what old ed austin would have said of such extravagance it was blaze jones one of the few county residents granted access to las palmas who first acquainted himself with the outcome of alaires experiment and it was he who brought news of it to some visiting stockbuyers at brownsville blaze was addicted to rhetorical extravagance his voice was loud his fancy ran a splendid course gentlemen said he youall interest me with your talk about your prize northern stock but i claim that the bigger the state the bigger the cattle it raises thats why old texas beats the world but it doesnt some one contradicted it dont hey my boy blaze jabbed a rigid finger into the speakers ribs as if he expected a groundsquirrel to scuttle forth weve got steers in this valley that are damn near the size of the whole state of rhode island if they keep on growin i doubt if you could fatten one of em in delaware without hed bulge over into some neighboring commonwealth its the gods truth i was up at las palmas last month las palmas the name was enough to challenge the buyers interest blaze nodded youall think you know the stock business youre all swollen up with cowknowledge now aint you he eyed them from beneath his black eyebrows well some of our people thought they did too they figured theyd inherited all there was to know about live stock and they grew plumb arrogant over their wisdom but pshaw they didnt know nothing miz austin has bred in that brayma strain and made steers so big they run four to the dozen and heres the remarkable thing about em they aint got as many ticks as you gentlemen some of the cattlemen were incredulous but blaze maintained his point with emphasis its true theyre a grave disappointment to every kind of parasite but alaire had not confined her efforts to cattle she had improved the breed of box a horses too and hand in hand with this work she had carried on a series of agricultural experiments las palmas so people used to say lay too far up the river to be good farmingland nevertheless once the pumpingplant was in certain parts of the ranch raised nine crops of alfalfa and corn that stood above a riders head there was no money in finished stock the border was too far from market that also had long been an accepted truism yet this woman built silos which she filled with her own excess fodder in scientific proportions and somehow or other she managed to ship fat beeves direct to the packinghouses and get big prices for them these were but a few of her many ventures she had her hobbies of course but oddly enough most of them paid or promised to do so for instance she had started a grove of papershelled pecans which was soon due to bear the ranch house and its clump of palms was all but hidden by a forest of strange trees which were reported to ripen everything from mothballs to bicycle tires blaze jones was perhaps responsible for this report for alaire had shown him several thousand eucalyptus saplings and some ornamental rubberplants that miz austin is a moneymakin piece of furniture he once told his daughter paloma im no mechanical adder i count mostly on my fingers but her and me calculated the profits on them eucher whatstheirname trees and it gave me a splittin headache shell be a drug queen sure why dont you follow her example asked paloma we have plenty of land blaze in truth was embarrassed by the size of his holdings but he shook his head no im too old to go rampagin after new gods i aint got the imagination to raise anything more complicated than a mortgage but if i was younger id organize myself up and do away with that ed austin id sure help him to an untimely end and then id marry them pecangroves and blooded herds and drugstore orchards she certainly is a heartbreakin device with her red hair and red lips and father paloma was deeply shocked complete isolation of course alaire had found to be impossible even though her ranch lay far from the traveled roads and her mexican guards were not encouraging to visitors business inevitably brought her into contact with a considerable number of people and of these the one she saw most frequently was judge ellsworth of brownsville her attorney it was perhaps a week after ed had left for san antonio that alaire felt the need of ellsworths counsel and sent for him he responded promptly as always ellsworth was a kindly man of fiftyfive with a forceful chin and a drooping heavylidded eye that could either blaze or twinkle he was fond of alaire and his sympathy like his understanding was of that wordless yet comprehensive kind which is most satisfying judge ellsworth knew more than any four men in that part of texas information had a way of seeking him out and his head was stored to repletion with facts of every variety he was a good lawyer too and yet his knowledge of the law comprised but a small part of that mental wealth upon which he prided himself he knew human nature and that he considered far more important than law his mind was like a full granary and every grain lay where he could put his hand upon it he motored out from brownsville and after ridding himself of dust insisted upon spending the interval before dinner in an inspection of alaires latest ranch improvements he had a fatherly way of walking with his arm about alaires shoulders and although she sometimes suspected that his warmth of goodfellowship was merely a habit cultivated through political necessities nevertheless it was comforting and she took it at its face value not until the dinner was over did ellsworth inquire the reason for his summons its about la feria general longorio has confiscated my stock alaire told him ellsworth started longorio thats bad yes one of my riders just brought the news i was afraid of this very thing and so i was preparing to bring the stock over stilli never thought theyd actually confiscate it why shouldnt they alaire interrogated the speaker silently hasnt ed done enough to provoke confiscation asked the judge ed exactly ed has made a fool of himself and brought this on you think so well i have it pretty straight that hes giving money to the rebel junta and lending every assistance he can to their cause i didnt know hed actually done anything how mad yes for a man with interests in federal territory but ed always does the wrong thing you know then i presume this confiscation is in the nature of a reprisal but the stock is mine not eds im an american citizen and my dear youre the first one ive heard boast of the fact cynically affirmed the judge if you were in mexico youd profit more by claiming allegiance to the german or the english or some other foreign flag the american eagle isnt screaming very loudly on the other side of the rio grande just now and our dusky neighbors have learned that its perfectly safe to pull his tail feathers im surprised at you alaire smiled just the same i want your help in taking up the matter with washington ellsworth was pessimistic it wont do any good my dear he said youll get your name in the papers and perhaps cause another diplomatically worded protest but there the matter will end you wont be paid for your cattle then i shall go to la feria no the judge shook his head decidedly ive been there a hundred times the federals have always been more than courteous longorio has a bad reputation i strongly advise against your going why judge people are going and coming all the time mexico is perfectly safe and i know the country as well as i know las palmas youd better send some man whom can i send asked alaire you know my situation the judge considered a moment before replying i cant go for im busy in court you could probably accomplish more than anybody else if longorio will listen to reason and after all you are a person of such importance that i dare say youd be safe but it will be a hard trip and you wont know whether you are in rebel or in federal territory well people here are asking whether texas is in the united states or mexico alaire said lightly sometimes i hardly know after a moment she continued since you know everything and everybody i wonder if you ever met a david law ellsworth nodded tell me something about him he asked me the same thing about you well i havent seen much of dave since he grew up hes such a roamer he said his parents were murdered by the guadalupes the judge looked up quickly a queer startled expression flitted over his face dave said that he said both of them were killed yes isnt it true oh dave wouldnt lie it happened a good many years ago and certainly they both met a violent end i was instrumental in saving what property frank law left but it didnt last dave very long hes right careless in money matters daves a fine fellow in some ways most ways i believe but the judge lost himself in frowning meditation i have never known you to damn a friend or a client with such faint praise said alaire oh i dont mean it that way im almost like one of daves kin and ive been keenly interested in watching his traits develop im interested in heredity ive watched it in eds case for instance if you know the parents its easy to read their children again he lapsed into silence nodding to himself yes nature mixes her prescriptions like any druggist im glad you and ed have no babies alaire mumured something unintelligible and yet the lawyer continued many people are cursed with an inheritance as bad or worse than eds what has that to do with mr law dave oh nothing in particular i was just moralizing its a privilege of age my dear vi a journey and a dark man alaires preparations for the journey to la feria were made with little delay owing to the condition of affairs across the border ellsworth had thought it well to provide her with letters from the most influential mexicans in the neighborhood what is more in order to pave her way toward a settlement of her claim he succeeded in getting a telegram through to mexico city no mean achievement with most of the wires in rebel hands and the remainder burdened with military business but ellsworths influence was not bounded by the rio grande it was his advice that alaire present her side of the case to the local military authorities before making formal representation to washington though in neither case was he sanguine of the outcome the united states indeed had abetted the rebel cause from the start its embargo on arms had been little more than a pretense of neutrality which had fooled the federals not at all and it was an open secret that financial assistance to the uprising was rendered from some mysterious northern source the very presence of american troops along the border was construed by mexicans as a threat against president potosi and an encouragement to revolt while the talk of intervention invasion and war had intensified the natural antagonism existing between the two peoples so it was that ellsworth while he did his best to see to it that his client should make the journey in safety and receive courteous treatment doubted the wisdom of the undertaking and hoped for no practical result alaire took dolores with her and for male escort she selected after some deliberation jose sanchez her horsebreaker jose was not an ideal choice but since benito could not well be spared no better man was available sanchez had some force and initiative at least and alaire had no reason to doubt his loyalty the party went to pueblo by motor an unpleasant trip for the road followed the river and ran through a lonesome country unpeopled save for an occasional goatherd and his family or a glaringhot village of some halfdozen cubical houses crouching on the riverbank as if crowded over from mexican soil this road remained much as the first oxcarts had laid it out the hills were gashed by arroyos some of which were difficult to negotiate and in consequence the journey was from an automobilists point of view decidedly slow the first night the travelers were forced to spend at a mud jacal encircled like some african jungle dwelling by a thick brush barricade jose sanchez was in his element here he posed he strutted he bragged he strove to impress his countrymen by every device jose was indeed rather a handsome fellow with a bold insolence of bearing that marked him as superior to the common pelador and having dressed himself elaborately for this journey he made the most of his opportunities for showing off nothing would do him but a baile and a baile he had once the arrangements were made other mexicans appeared mysteriously until there were nearly a score and until late into the night they danced upon the hardpacked earth of the yard alaire fell asleep to the sounds of feet scuffling and scraping in time to a wheezy violin arriving at pueblo on the following day alaire secured her passports from the federal headquarters across the rio grande while jose attended to the railroad tickets on the second morning after leaving home the party was borne southward into mexico although train schedules were uncertain the railroad journey itself was similar to many alaire had taken except for occasional evidences of the war the revolution had ravaged most of northern mexico long rows of rusting trucks and twisted car skeletons beside the track showed how the railways rollingstock had suffered in this particular vicinity and as the train penetrated farther south temporary trestles and the charred ruins of stationhouses spoke even more eloquently of the struggle now and then a steel watertank pierced with loopholes and ripped by cannon balls showed where some detachment had made a stand there was a military guard on the train too a dozen unkempt soldiers loaded down with rifles and bandoliers of cartridges and several officers neatly dressed in khaki who rode in the firstclass coach and occupied themselves by making eyes at the women at its frequent stops the train was besieged by the customary crowd of curious peons the same noisy hucksters dealt out enchiladas tortillas goat cheeses and coffee from the same dirty baskets and pails even their outstretched hands seemed to bear the familiar grime of antebellum days the coaches were crowded women fanned themselves unceasingly their men snored openmouthed over the backs of the seats and the aisles were full of squalling squabbling children as for the country itself it was dying the ranches were stripped of stock no carts creaked along the highways and the roads like the little farms were growing up to weeds stores were empty the people were idle over all was an atmosphere of decay and what was far more significant the people seemed content all morning the monotonous journey continued a trial to alaire and dolores but to jose sanchez a redletter experience he covered the train from end to end making himself acquainted with every one and bringing to alaire the gossip that he picked up it was not until midday that the first interruption occurred then the train pulled in upon a siding and after an interminable delay it transpired that a northbound trooptrain was expected jose brought this intelligence soon you will behold the flower of the mexican army he told alaire you will see thousands of longorios veterans every man of them a very devil for blood they are returning to nuevo pueblo after destroying a band of those rebels they had a great victory at san pedro thirty kilometers from la feria not a prisoner was spared senora is general longorio with them alaire inquired quickly that is what i came to tell you it is believed that he is for he takes his army with him wherever he goes he is a great fighter he has a nose for it that man and he strikes like the lightning here there anywhere jose it seemed was a rabid potosista but dolores held opposite sympathies she uttered a disdainful sniff to be sure he takes his army with him otherwise the constitutionalistas would kill him wait until pancho gomez meets this army of longorios ha you will see some fighting jose blew two fierce columns of cigarette smoke from his nostrils longorio is a gentleman he scorns to use the tricks of that bandit pancho gomez fights like a savage think of the cowardly manner in which he captured espinal the last time what did he do then ill tell you he laid in wait and allowed a trainload of our troops to pass through his lines toward chihuahua then he took possession of the telegraph wires and pretended to be the federal commander he sent a lying message back to espinal that the railway tracks were torn up and he could not reach chihuahua and so of course he was ordered to return that was bad enough but he loaded his bandits upon other trains he locked them into freightcars like cattle so that not a head could be seen and the devil himself would never have guessed what was in those cars of course he succeeded no one suspected the truth until his infamous army was in espinal then it was too late the carnage was terrible but do you call that a nice action it was nothing but the lowest deceit it was enough to make our soldiers furious dolores giggled they say he went to his officers and told them compadres we are now going into espinal i will meet you at the plaza and i will shoot the last man who arrives there dios there ensued a footrace it is well for him to train his men how to run fast said jose frowning sternly for some day they will meet luis longorio and then you will see some of the swiftest running in all the world yes truly dolores was trembling with excitement her voice was shrill god will need to lend them speed to catch this army of longorios otherwise no human legs could accomplish it bah who can argue with a woman sneered jose alaire who had listened smilingly now intervened to avert a serious quarrel when the train arrives she told her horsebreaker i want you to find general longorio and ask him to come here but senora jose was dumfounded shocked he is a great general give him this note quickly writing a few lines on a page from her notebook she gave him the scrap of paper which he carefully placed in his hat then shaking his head doubtfully he left the car flushed with triumph dolores took the first occasion to enlarge upon her theme you will see what a monster this longorio is she declared it was like him to steal your beautiful cattle he would steal a crucifix once there was a fine ranch owned by a man who had two lovely daughters girls of great respectability and refinement but the man was a candelerista longorio killed him he and his men killed everybody on the hacienda except the daughters and those he captured he took them with him and for no good purpose either as you can imagine naturally the poor creatures were nearly dead with fright but as they rode along the elder one began talking with longorios soldiers she made friends with them she pretended to care nothing about her fate she behaved like a lost person and the soldiers laughed they liked her spirit god pity them finally she declared she was a famous shot with a pistol and she continued to boast until one of her guards gave her his weapon with which to show her skill then what before they could hinder her she turned in her saddle and shot her younger sister through the brain herself she destroyed with a bullet in her breast every word is the sacred truth senora longorios soul is stained with the blood of those two innocents ive heard many stories like that from both sides alaire said gravely in the course of time the military train came creaking along on the main track and stopped to the great interest of the southbound travelers it was made up of many stock cars crowded with cavalry horses each animal bore its equipment of saddle and bridle and penned in with them were the women and the children the soldiers themselves were clustered thickly upon the car roofs far down at the rear of the train was a rickety passengercoach and toward this jose sanchez made his way there began a noisy interchange of greetings between the occupants of the two trains and meanwhile the hot sun glared balefully upon the huddled figures on the car tops a halfhour passed then occurred a commotion at the forward end of alaires coach a group of officers climbed aboard and among them was one who could be none other than luis longorio as he came down the passageway alaire identified him without the aid of his insignia for he stood head and shoulders above his companions and bore himself with an air of authority he was unusually tall at least six feet three and very slim very lithe he was alert keen he was like the blade of a rapier the leanness of his legs was accentuated by his stiff starched ridingbreeches and closefitting pigskin puttees while his face apart from all else would have challenged prompt attention longorio was a young man his cheeks were girlishly smooth and of a clear pale olive tint which sun and weather apparently were powerless to darken his eyes were large bold and brilliant his nostrils thin and sensitive like those of a blooded horse he seemed almost immature until he spoke then one realized with a curious shock that he was a man indeed and a man moreover with all the ardor and passion of a woman such was alaires first hasty impression of luis longorio the tarleton of potosis army disdain hauteur impatience were stamped upon the generals countenance as he pushed briskly through the crowd turning his head from side to side in search of the woman who had summoned him not until she rose did he discover alaire then he halted his eyes fixed themselves upon her with a stare of startled amazement alaire felt herself color faintly for the man seemed to be scanning her from head to foot taking in every detail of her face and form and as he did so his expression remained unaltered for what seemed a full minute longorio stood rooted then the stiffvizored cap was swept from his head he bowed with the grace of a courtier until alaire saw the part in his oily black hair senora a thousand apologies for my delay he said caramba i did not dream i did not understand your message he continued to regard her with that same queer intensity you are general longorio alaire was surprised to note that her voice quavered uncertainly and annoyed to feel her face still flushing your obedient servant with a gesture mrs austin directed dolores to vacate her seat and invited the general to take it but longorio checked the maids movement then with a brusque command he routed out the occupants of the seat ahead and reversing the back took a position facing alaire another order and the men who had accompanied him withdrew up the aisle his luminous eyes returned once more to the woman and there was no mistaking his admiration he seemed enchanted by her pale beauty her rich red hair held him fascinated and with latin boldness he made his feelings crassly manifest vii luis longorio you probably know why i wished to see you alaire began longorio shook his head in vague denial it is regarding my ranch la feria seeing that the name conveyed nothing she explained i am told that your army confiscated my cattle ah yes now i understand the mexican nodded mechanically but it was plain that he was not heeding her words in the least all his mental powers appeared to be concentrated in that disconcerting stare which he still bent upon her we confiscate everything it is a necessity of war he murmured but this is different the ranch is mine and i am an american there was a pause the general made a visible effort to gather his wits it was now quite patent that the sight of alaire the sound of her voice her first glance had stricken him with an odd semiparalysis as if to shut out a vision or to escape some dazzling sight he dosed his eyes alaire wondered if the fellow had been drinking she turned to dolores to find that good woman wearing an expression of stupefaction it was very queer it made alaire extremely ill at ease longorio opened his eyes and smiled it seems that i have seen you before as if we were old friends or as if i had come face to face with myself said he i am affected strangely it is unaccountable i know you well completely everything about you is familiar to me and yet we meet for the first time eh how do you explain that unless a miracle it is merely your imagination such beauty here among these common people i was unprepared longorio passed a brown hand across his brow to brush away those perverse fancies that so interfered with his thoughts in moments of stress the attention often centers upon trivial things and the mind photographs unimportant objects alaire noticed now that one of longorios fingers was decorated with a magnificent diamondandruby ring and this interested her queerly no ordinary man could fittingly have worn such an ornament yet on the hand of this splendid barbarian it seemed not at all out of keeping dios let me take hold of myself for my wits are in mutiny longorio continued then he added more quietly i need not assure you senora that you have only to command me your ranch has been destroyed your cattle stolen eh yes at least we will shoot the perpetrators of this outrage at once bueno come with me and you shall see it with your own eyes no no you dont understand so what then i dont want to see any one punished i merely want your government to pay me for my cattle alaire laughed nervously ah but a lady of refinement should not discuss such a miserable business it is a matter for men bother your pretty head no more about it and leave me to punish the guilty in my own way she endeavored to speak in a brisk businesslike tone la feria belongs to me personally and i have managed it for several years just as i manage las palmas across the river i am a woman of affairs general longorio and you must talk to me as you would talk to a man when i heard about this raid i came to look into it to see you or whoever is in charge of this district and to make a claim for damages also i intend to see that nothing similar occurs again i have delayed making representations to my own government in the hope that i could arrange a satisfactory settlement and so avoid serious complications now you understand why i am here and why i wished to see you valgame dios this is amazing i become more bewildered momentarily there is nothing extraordinary about it that i can see you think not you consider such a woman as yourself ordinary the men of my country enshrine beauty and worship it they place it apart as a precious gift from god which nothing shall defile they do not discuss such things with their women now this sordid affair is something for your husband mr austins business occupies his time this is my own concern i am not the only practical woman in texas longorio appeared to be laboriously digesting this statement so he said at last when you heard of this you came eh you came alone into mexico where we are fighting and killing each other well that is spirit you are wonderful superb he smiled showing the whitest and evenest teeth such extravagant homage was embarrassing yet no woman could be wholly displeased by admiration so spontaneous and intense as that which longorio manifested in every look and word it was plain to alaire that something about her had completely bowled him over perhaps it was her strange red hair and her white foreign face or perhaps something deeper something behind all that sex phenomena are strange and varied in their workings who can explain the instant attraction or repulsion of certain types we meet why does the turn of a head a smile a glance move us to the depths why does the touch of one strangers hand thrill us while anothers leaves us quite impassive whence springs that personal magnetism which has the power to set the very atoms of our being into new vibrations like a highly charged electric current alaire knew the susceptibility of mexican men and was immune to ordinary flattery yet there was something exciting about this martial heros complete captivation to have charmed him to the point of bewilderment was a unique triumph and under his hungry eyes she felt an adventurous thrill it is true that luis longorio was utterly alien and in that sense almost repellent to alaire moreover she suspected him of being a monster so depraved that no decent woman could bring herself to accept his attentions nevertheless in justice to the fellow she had to acknowledge that externally at least he was immensely superior to the mexicans she had met then too his aristocracy was unmistakable and alaire prided herself that she could recognize good blood in men as quickly as in horses the fellow had been favored by birth by breeding and by education and although military service in mexico was little more than a form of banditry nevertheless longorio had developed a certain genius for leadership nor was there any doubt as to his spectacular courage in some ways he was a second cid another figure out of castilian romance while he and alaire were talking the passengers had returned to their seats they were shouting goodbyes to the soldiers opposite the enginebell was clanging loudly and now the conductor approached to warn longorio that the train was about to leave but the railway official had learned a wholesome respect for uniforms and therefore he hung back until urged by necessity he pushed forward and informed the general of his train orders longorio favored him with a slow stare you may go when i leave said he si senor but the general uttered a sharp exclamation of anger at which the conductor backed away expressing by voice and gesture his most hearty approval of the change of plan we mustnt hold the train alaire said quickly i will arrange to see you in nuevo pueblo when i return longorio smiled brilliantly and lifted a brown hand no no i am a selfish man i refuse to deprive myself of this pleasure the end must come all too soon and as for these peladors an hour more or less will make no difference now about these cattle mexico does not make war upon women and i am desolated that the actions of my men have caused annoyance to the most charming lady in the world ah you are polite knowing that in this mans help alone lay her chance of adjusting her loss alaire deliberately smiled upon him can i count upon your help in obtaining my rights she asked assuredly but how where longorio thought for a moment and his tone altered as he said senora there seems to be an unhappy complication in our way and this we must remove first may i ask are you a friend to our cause i am an american and therefore i am neutral ah but americans are not neutral there is the whole difficulty this miserable revolt was fostered by your government american money supports it and your men bear arms against us your tyrant president is our enemy his hands itch for mexico i cant argue politics with you alaire interrupted positively i believe most americans agree that you have cause for complaint but what has that to do with my ranch and my cattle this is something that concerns no one except you and me longorio was plainly flattered by her words and took no trouble to hide his pleasure ah if that were only true we would arrange everything to your satisfaction without another word his admiring gaze seemed to envelop her and its warmth was unmistakable no one could have the cruelty to deny your slightest wish i least of all why did you take my cattle she demanded stubbornly i was coming to that it is what i meant when i said there was a complication your husband senora is an active candelerista for a moment alaire was at a loss then she replied with some spirit we are two people he and i la feria belongs to me nevertheless his conduct is regrettable longorio went on probably evil men have lied to him san antonio is full of rebels conspiring to give our country into the hands of outlaws what a terrible spectacle it is enough to bring tears to the eyes of any patriot he turned his melancholy gaze from alaire to her companion and for the first time dolores stirred she had watched her countryman with a peculiar fascination and she had listened breathlessly to his words now she inhaled deeply as if freed from a spell then she said pah nobody pays heed to senor ed we do not consider him dolores lacked diplomacy her bluntness was often trying alaire turned upon her with a sharp exclamation conscious meanwhile that the womans tone even more than her words had enlightened longorio to some extent his lifted brows were eloquent of surprise and curiosity but he held his tongue am i to understand then that you rob me because of my husbands action alaire asked no but we must combat our enemies with the weapons we have not only those who bear arms with candeleria but those who shelter themselves beyond the rio grande alaires face fell i had hoped that you would understand and help me but i shall go to mexico city and demand my rights if necessary wait i shall help longorio beamed enthusiastically it shall be the object of my life to serve you and you and i shall arrange this matter satisfactorily i have influence believe me a word from luis longorio will go further with my chief than a protest from your president general potosi is a man of the highest honor and i am his right hand very well then duty calls me to nuevo pueblo and you shall return with me as the guest of my government dios it is a miserable train but you shall occupy the coach and travel as befits a queen of beauty like a royal princess with her guard of honor he rose to his feet but his eagerness soon gave place to disappointment thank you said alaire but i must first go to la feria and get all the facts senora it is a wretched journey see he waved a contemptuous gesture at the car crowded to congestion there is no food you have no one to wait upon you in my company you will be safe upon my honor you will enjoy the highest courtesy of course but i must go on i have dolores and jose to look after me alaire indicated sanchez who had edged his way close and now stood with admiring eyes fixed upon his hero yes mi general jose exclaimed eagerly i am here longorio scrutinized the horsebreaker critically your name is jose sanchez you look like a brave fellow jose swelled at this praise and no doubt would have made suitable answer but his employer held out her hand and general longorio bent over it raising it to his lips senora one favor you can grant me no it is a right i shall claim he called one of his subordinates closer and ordered that a lieutenant and six soldiers be detached to act as an escort to mrs austins party it is nothing he assured her it is the least i can do have no uneasiness for these men are the bravest of my command and they shall answer with their lives for your safety as for that teniente ah he is favored above his general longorio rolled his eyes think of it i could be faithless to duty a traitor to my country for the privilege he is to enjoy it is the sacred truth senora the hours will drag until i may see you again and be of further service meanwhile i shall be tortured with radiant dreams go with god for a second time he bowed and kissed the hand he held then taking jose sanchez intimately by the arm he turned to the door dolores collapsed into her seat with an exclamation caramba the man is a demon and such eyes uf they say he was so furious at losing those two sisters i told you about that he killed the soldier with the very weapon dolores was interrupted by longorios voice beneath the open window the general stood cap in hand holding up to alaire a solitary wild flower which he had plucked beside the track see he cried it is the color of your adorable eyes blue like a sapphire gem i saw it peeping at me and it was lonely but now behold how it smiles like a star that sees paradise eh and i too have seen paradise he placed the delicate bloom in alaires fingers and was gone cuidado breathed dolores there is blood on it the blood of innocents he will burn for a million years in hell that man longorio made good his promise soon a grizzled old teniente with six soldiers was transferred as a bodyguard to the american lady and then after some further delay the military train departed upon the rear platform stood a tall slim khakiclad figure and until the car had dwindled away down the track foreshortening to a mere rectangular dot luis longorio remained motionless staring with eager eyes through the capering dust and the billowing heat waves jose sanchez came plowing into alaires car tremendously excited look senora he cried look what the general gave me and he proudly displayed longorios service revolver around joses waist was the cartridgebelt and holster that went with the weapon with his own hands he buckled it about me and he said jose something tells me you are a devil for bravery guard your mistress with your life for if any mishap befalls her i shall cut out your heart with my own hands those were his very words senora caramba there is a man to die for nor was this the last of longorios dramatic surprises shortly after the train had got under way the lieutenant in command of alaires guard brought her a small package saying the general commanded me to hand you this with his deepest regard alaire accepted the object curiously it was small and heavy and wrapped in several leaves torn from a notebook and it proved to be nothing less than the splendid diamondandruby ring she had admired god protect us now murmured dolores crossing herself devoutly viii blaze joness nemesis blaze jones rode up to his front gate and dismounted in the shade of the big ebonytree he stepped back and ran an approving eye over another animal tethered there it was a thoroughbred bay mare he had never seen and as he scanned her good points he reflected that the time had come when he would have to accustom himself to the sight of strange horses along his fence and strange automobiles beside the road for paloma was a woman now and the young men of the neighborhood had made the discovery yes and paloma was a pretty woman therefore the hole under the ebonytree would probably be worn deep by impatient hoofs he was glad that most of the boys preferred saddles to soft upholstery for it argued that some vigor still remained in texas manhood and that the country had not been entirely ruined by motors pictureshows low shoes and high collars of course the youths of this day were nothing like the youths of his own and yet blaze let his gaze linger fondly on the highbred mare and her equipment here at least was a person who knew a good horse a good saddle and a good gun as he came up the walk he heard paloma laugh and his own face lightened for palomas merriment was contagious then as he mounted the steps and turned the corner of the gallery he uttered a hearty greeting dave law where in the world did you drop from law uncoiled himself and took the ranchmans hand hello blaze i been ordered down here to keep you straight pshaw now whos giving you orders dave why im with the rangers never knew a word of it last i heard you was filibustering around with the maderistas blaze seated himself with a grateful sigh where the breeze played over him he was a big bearlike swarthy man with the squarehewn deeplined face of a tragedian and a head of long curly hair which he wore parted in a line over his left ear jones was a character a local landmark this part of texas had grown up with blaze and inasmuch as he had sprung from a free race of pioneers he possessed a splendid indifference to the artificial fads of dress and manners it was only since paloma had attained her womanhood that he had been forced to fight down his deepseated distrust of neckwear and store clothes and the like but now that his daughter had definitely asserted her rights he had acquired numerous unwelcome graces and no longer ventured among strangers without the stamp of her approval upon his appearance only at home did he maintain what he considered a manly independence of speech and habit today therefore found him in a favorite suit of baggy wrinkled linen and with a weeks stubble of beard upon his chin he was so plainly an outdoor man that the air of erudition lent him by the pair of goldrimmed spectacles owlishly perched upon his sunburned nose was strangely incongruous so youre a ranger and got notches on your gun blaze rolled and lit a tiny cigarette scarcely larger than a wheat straw well youd ought to make a right able thiefcatcher dave only for your size youre too long for a man and you aint long enough for a snake still i reckon a thief would have trouble getting out of your reach and once you got close to him how many men have you killed counting mexicans law inquired with a smile hell nobody counts them not many thats good blaze nodded and relit his cigarette which he had permitted promptly to smolder out the force aint what it was most of the boys nowadays join so they can ride a horse crosslots pack a pair of guns and give rein to the predilections of a vicious ancestry theyre bad rams most of em there arent many said paloma dave tells me the whole force has been cut down to sixteen thats plenty her father averred its like when capn bill mcdonald was sent to stop a riot in dallas he came to town alone and when the citizens asked him where his men was he said hell aint i enough theres only one riot are you workin up a case dave umm yes people are missing a lot of stock hereabouts its these blamed refugees from the war a mexican has to steal something or he gets run down and pore if it aint stock its something else why one morning i rode into jonesville in time to see four greasers walkin down the main street with feedsacks over their shoulders each one of those gunnies had something long and flat and heavy in it and i growed curious when i investigated what dyou suppose i found tombstones thats right four marble beauties fresh from the cemetery well it made me right sore for id helped to start jonesville i was its city father id made the place fit to live in and i aimed to keep it safe to die in and so bein a sort of lefthanded selfappointed deppitysheriff i rounded up those ghouls and drove em to the countyseat in my spring wagon i had the evidence propped up against the front of our realestate office sacred to the memory of four of our leading citizens so i jailed em but thats all the good it did couldnt convict eh blaze lit his cigarette for the third time the prosecuting attorney and i wasnt very good friends seeing as how id had to kill his daddy so he turned em loose im damned if those four greasers didnt beat me back to jonesville blaze shook his head ruminatively this was a hard country those days there wasnt but two honest men in this whole valley and the other one was a nigger dave laws duties as a ranger rested lightly upon him his instructions were vague and he had a leisurely method of working up his evidence since he knew that blaze possessed a thorough knowledge of this section and its people it was partly business which had brought him to the jones home this afternoon strictly speaking blaze was not a rancher although many of his acres were under cultivation and he employed a sizable army of fieldhands his disposition was too adventurous his life had been too swift and varied for him to remain interested in slow agricultural pursuits therefore he had speculated heavily in raw lands and for several years past he had devoted his energies to a gigantic colonization scheme originally blaze had come to the rio grande valley as a stockraiser but the natural advantages of the country had appealed to his gambling instinct and he had gone broke buying land he had located some fifteen miles below the borders of las palmas and there he had sunk a large fortune then as a first step in his colonization project he had founded the town of jonesville next he had caused the branch line of the frisco railroad to be extended until it linked his holdings with the main system after which he had floated a big irrigation company and now the feat of paying interest on its bonds and selling farms under the ditch to northern people kept him fully occupied it was by no means a small operation in which he was engaged the venture had taken foresight courage infinite hard work and blaze was burdened with responsibilities that would have broken down a man of weaker fiber but his pet relaxation was reminiscence his own experience had been wide he knew everybody in his part of the state and although events in his telling were sometimes colored by his rich imagination the information he could give was often of the greatest value as dave law knew after a time the latter said casually tell me something about tad lewis blaze looked up quickly what dyou want to know anything everything tad owns a right nice ranch between here and las palmas blaze said cautiously paloma broke out impatiently why dont you say what you think then to dave tad lewis is a bad neighbor and always has been theres a ford on his place and we think he knows more about wet cattle than he cares to tell its a good place to cross stock at low water her father agreed and lewiss land runs back from the rio grande in its old spanish form its a natural outlet for those brushcountry ranchos but i havent anything against tad except a natural dislike he stands well with some of our best people so im probably wrong i usually am you cant call ed austin one of our best people sharply objected paloma they claim that arms are being smuggled across to the rebels dave and if its true ed austin now paloma her father remonstrated mildly the regulars and the river guards watched lewiss ranch till the embargo was lifted and they never saw anything i believe austin is a strong rebel sympathizer law ventured sure and him and the lewis outfit are amigos if you go pirootin around tads place youre moren apt to make yourself unpopular dave id grieve some to see you in a wooden kimono tads too well fixed to steal cattle and if he runs arms its because of his sympathy for those noble darkskinned patriots we hear so much about in washington tads a galvanized gringo himself married a mexican you know nobody pays much attention to the embargo law agreed i ran arms myself before i joined the force when mealtime drew near both jones and his daughter urged their guest to stay and dine with them and dave was glad to accept after supper im going to show you our town blaze declared its the finest city in south texas and growing like a weed all we need is good farmers those weve got are mostly backtonature students who leaped a drugcounter expecting to light in the lap of luxury in the last outfit we sold there wasnt three men that knew which end of a mule to put the collar on but theyll learn natures with em and so am i god supplies em with all the fresh air and sunshine they need and when they want anything else they come to old blaze aint that right paloma yes father paloma jones had developed wonderfully since dave law had last seen her she had grown into a most wholesome and attractive young woman with an unusually capable manner and an honest humorous pair of brown eyes during dinner she did her part with a grace that made watching her a pleasure and the ranger found it a great treat to sit at her table after his strenuous scouting days in the mesquite im glad to hear jonesville is prosperous he told his host and they say youre in everything thats right and prosperitys no name for it everybody wants blaze to have a finger in the pie im interested in the bank the sugarmill the hardwarestore the iceplant say that iceplants a luxury for a town this size dyou know what i made out of it last year ive no idea twentyseven thousand dollars the father of jonesville spoke proudly impressively and then through habit called upon his daughter for verification didnt i paloma miss palomas answer was unexpected and came with equal emphasis no you didnt father the miserable thing lost money blaze was only momentarily dismayed then he joined in his visitors laughter how can a man get along without the cooperation of his own household he inquired naively maybe it was next year i was thinking about thereafter he confined himself to statements which required no corroboration dave had long since learned that to hold blaze jones to a strict accountability with fact was to rob his society of its greatest charm a slavish accuracy in figures an arid lack of imagination reduces conversation to the insipidness of flat wine and blazes talk was never dull he was a keen shrewd practical man but somewhere in his being there was concealed a tremendous lopsided sense of humor which took the form of a bewildering imagery an attentive audience was enough for him and once his fancy was in full swing there was no limit to his outrageous exaggerations a light of credulity in a hearers eye filled him with prodigious mirth and it is doubtful if his listeners ever derived a fraction of the amusement from his fabrications that he himself enjoyed palomas spirit of contradiction was the only fly in his ointment now that his daughter was old enough to keep books on him much of the storytellers joy was denied him of course his proclivities occasionally led to misapprehensions chance acquaintances who recognized him as an artful romancer were liable to consider him generally untruthful but even in this misconception blaze took a quiet delight secure in the knowledge that all who knew him well regarded him as a rock of integrity as a matter of fact his genuine exploits were quite as sensational as those of his manufacture when after supper blaze had hitched a pair of drivingmules to his buckboard preparatory to showing his guest the glories of jonesville dave said palomas getting mighty pretty shes as pretty as a bluebonnet flower her father agreed and she runs me around something scandalous i aint got the freedom of a peon blaze sighed and shook his shaggy head you know me dave i never used to be scared of nobody well its different now she rides me with a spanish bit and my soul aint my own with a sudden lightening of his gloom he added say youre going to stay right here with us as long as youre in town i want you to see how i cringe in spite of blazes plaintive tone it was patent that he was inordinately proud of paloma and well content with his serfdom jonesville proved to be a typical texas town of the modern variety and altogether different to the pictured frontier village there were no onestoried square fronts no rows of saloons with wellgnawed hitchingrails no rioting cowboys on the contrary the larger buildings were of artificial stone the sidewalks of concrete and the store fronts of plateglass arclights shed a bluishwhite glare over the wide streetcrossings and all in all the effect was much like that of a prosperous orderly northern farming town not that jonesville would have filled an eye for beauty it was too new and crude and awkward for that it fitted loosely into its clothes for its citizens had patterned it with regard for the future and it sprawled over twice its legitimate area but to its happy founder it seemed wellnigh perfect and its destiny roused his maddest enthusiasm he showed dave the little red frame railroad station distinguished in some mysterious way above the hundred thousand other little red frame railroad stations of the identical size and style he pointed out the odd fellows hall the palace picture theater with its glaring orange lights and discordant electric piano he conducted law to the first national bank of which blaze was a proud but somewhat ornamental director then to the sugarmill the iceplant and other points of equally novel interest everywhere he went jones was hailed by friends for everybody seemed to know him and to want to shake his hand some town and some body of men eh he inquired finally and dave agreed yes shes got a grand framework blaze shell be most as big as fort worth when you fatten her up jones waved his buggywhip in a wide circle that took in the miles of level prairie on all sides weve got the whole blamed state to grow in and dave i havent got an enemy in the place it wasnt many years ago that certain people allowed id never live to raise this town why it used to be that nobody dared to ride with me except paloma and she used to sleep with a shotgun at her bedside you sure have been a responsibility to her but im as safe now as if i was in church law ventured to remark that none of blazes enemies had grown fat in prosecuting their feuds but this was subject which the elder man invariably found embarrassing and now he said pshaw i never was the bloodletter people think im as gentle as a sheep then to escape further curiosity on that point he suggested that they round out their riotous evening with a game of pool law boasted a liberal education but he was no match for the father of jonesville who wielded a cue with a dexterity born of years of devotion to the game in consequence blazes enjoyment was in a fair way to languish when the proprietor of the elite billiard parlor returned from supper to say mr jones theres a real good poolplayer in town and he wants to meet you blaze uttered a triumphant cry get him quick send the brassband to bring him dave you hook your spurs over the rung of a chair and watch your uncle clean this tenderfoot if hes got class ill make him mayor of the town for a good poolshooter is all this metropolis lacks why sometimes i go plumb to san antone for a game he whispered in his friends ear paloma dont let me gamble but if youve got any dinero get it down on me then addressing the bystanders he proclaimed boys if this pilgrim is good enough to stretch me out well marry him off and settle him down no chance uncle blaze hes the most married person in town some one volunteered his wife is the new dressmaker and shes got a mustache for some reason this remark excited general mirth thats too bad i never saw but one woman with a mustache and she licked me good if hes yoked up to that kind of a lady i allow his nerves will be wrecked before he gets here i hope to god he aint entirely done for blaze ran the last three balls from a wellnigh impossible position then racked up the whole fifteen with trembling eagerness and eyed the door expectantly he was wiping his spectacles when the proprietor returned with a slim sallow man whom he introduced as mr strange welcome to our city blaze cried with a flourish of his glasses get a prod mr strange and bust em while i clean my windshields these fellowtownsmen of mine handle a cue like it was an oxgad mr strange selected a cue studied the pyramid for an instant then called the three ball for the upper lefthand corner and pocketed it following which he ran the remaining fourteen blaze watched this procedure nearsightedly and when the table was bare he thumped his cue loudly upon the floor he beamed upon his opponent he appeared ready to embrace him bueno theres art science and natural aptitude fly at em again mr strange and take your fill he finished polishing his spectacles and readjusted them i aim to make you so comfortable in jonesville that blaze paused he started and a peculiar expression crept over his face it seemed to law that his friend actually turned pale at any rate his mouth dropped open and his gaze was no longer hypnotically following the poolballs but was fixed upon his opponent now there were chapters in the life of blaze jones that had never been fully written and it occurred to dave that such a one had been suddenly reopened therefore he prepared himself for some kind of an outburst but blaze appeared to be numbed he even jumped nervously when mr strange missed a shot and advised him that his chance had come as water escapes from a leaky pail so had joness fondness for pool oozed away and with it had gone his accustomed skill he shot blindly and much to the general surprise missed an easy attempt cant expect to get em all comfortingly observed mr strange as he executed a combination that netted him two balls and broke the bunch after that he proved the insincerity of his statement by clearing the cloth for a second time the succeeding frames went much the same and finally blaze put up his cue mumbling i reckon i must have another chill coming on my feet are plumb dead cold feet are sure bad strange favored the crowd with a wink im sort of sick thats tough the victor exclaimed regretfully but ill tell you what well do well take a little look into the future what dyou mean simply this nature has favored me with second sight and the ability to read fortunes i foretell good an evil questions of love and mattermony by means of numbers cards dice dominoes appleparings eggshells tealeaves an coffeegrounds the speakers voice had taken on the brazen tones of a circus barker i pronosticate by charms ceremonies omens and moles by the features of the face lines of the hand spots an blemishes of the skin i speak the language of flowers i know one hundred and eightyseven weather signs and i interpet dreams now ladies and gents this is no idle boast triflin incidents little marks on the cuticle although they appear to be the effect of chance are nevertheless of the utmost consequence an to the skilled interpeter they foretell the temper of an the events that will happen to the person bearin em now let us take this little deck of common playingcards the monologist suiting the action to the word conjured a deck of cards from somewhere and extended them to blaze select one any one hell snorted jones slipping into his coat you are a skeptic very well i convince nobody against his will but wait you have a strong face stand where you are extracting from another pocket a tiny pair of scissors and a sheet of carbon paper mr strange with the undivided attention of the audience upon him began to cut blazes silhouette he was extraordinarily adept and despite his subjects restlessness he completed the likeness in a few moments then fixing it upon a plain white cardboard he presented it with a flourish blaze accepted the thing and plunged for the open air ix a scouting trip what ails you law inquired as he and blaze rolled away in the buckboard serves me right for leaving my sixshooter at home panted the rancher well i might have known theyd find me some day they who that hombre and his wife the woman with the mustache they swore theyd get me and it looks like they will for i daresnt raise my hand to protect myself this was very mystifying to dave and he said so the womanll recognize me quick enough blaze asserted and then god knows what paloma will do really is it that bad its a vile story dave and i never expected to tell anybody but its bound to come out on me now so you better hear my side last summer i attended a convention at galveston and one hot day i decided to take a swim so i hired a suit and a room to cache my sixshooter in it was foolish proceedings for a man my age but the beach was black with people and i wasnt altogether myself you see wed had an open poker game running in my room for three days and i hadnt got any sleep i was plumb feverish and needed a dip well im no waterdog dave i cant swim no better than a tarrapin with its legs cut off but i sloshed around some in the surf and then i took a walk to dreen off and see the sights it was right interesting when i got so i could tell the women from the men you see id left my glasses in the bathhouse now id sort of upheld the general intemperance of that poker game for three days and nights but i dont offer my condition as an excuse for what follows no gentleman ought to lay his indecencies onto john barley corn when theyre nothing more nor less than the outcroppins of his own orneriness liquor has got enough to answer for without being blamed for human depravities i dare say i was friendlier than i had any right to be i spoke to strangers and some of the girls hollered at me but i wouldnt have harmed a soul well in the course of my promenade i came to a couple of fellers setting halfburied in the sand and just as i was passing one of them got up sort of on allfours and er facing away from me sabe thats where the trouble hatched i reached out and with nothing but goodwill in my heart i sort of pinched this partysort of on the hip or thereabouts i didnt mean a thing by it dave i just walked on smiling till something run into me from behind when i got up and squared around there was that man we just left cutting didos out of black paper what dyou mean by pinching my wife he says and he was rarin mad your wife i stammers and with that he climbs me dave i was weak with shame and surprise and all i could do was hold him off sure enough the man id pinched was a long gant woman with a little black mustache and here she came we started in right there i never saw such a poisonous person as that woman she was coiled her head was up and her rattles agoing and so i finally lit out but im sort of fat and they overran me they bayed me against the seawall and all i had the heart to do was to hold em off some more soon as i got my wind i shook em off a second time and run some more but they downed me by that time wed begun to gather quite a crowd dave was you ever treed by wild hogs thats how them two people kept after me youd have thought id deprived em of their young i didnt want to hurt em but whenever id run theyd tangle my legs by and by i got so short of breath that i couldnt run so i fell on top of the man but the woman got me by the legs and rolled me under i busted out and hoofed it again but they caught me and down we went me on top then that mans helpmate grabbed my legs and rolled me over like she did before finally i got too tired to do anything but paw like a puppy it seems like we must have fought that way all the morning dave anyhow people gathered from long distances and cheered the woman i got desperate toward the last and i unraveled the right hip of my bathing suit grabbing for my gun i couldnt see the bathhouse for the sand in my eyes so i must have led em up across the boulevard and into the tent colony for after a while we were rolling around among tentpegs and tangling up in guyropes and all the time our audience was growing dave those tentropes sounded like guitar strings blaze paused to wipe the sweat from his brow whereupon his listener inquired in a choking voice how did you come out i reckon id have got shed of em somehow for i was resting up on top of my man but that stinging lizard of a woman got her claws into the neck of my bathingsuit and rared back on it dave she skinned me out of that garment the way youd skin out an eel and there i was you never heard such a yelling as went up and i didnt hear all of it either for i just laid back my ears and went through those sightseers like a jackrabbit i never knew a man could run like i did i could hear people holler here he comes there he goes yonder he went but i was never headed i hurdled the seawall like an antelope and before they got eyes on me i was into my bathhouse when id got dressed i sneaked up to the galvez for a drink in the bar were a lot of stockmen and they asked me where id been i told em id been nursing a sick lodge member and they said too bad you missed the damnedest fight since custer was licked we couldnt get very close for the jam but it was great the story went all over galveston the husband swore hed kill the man who attacked his wife and the newspapers called on the police to discover the ruffian there was a protracted silence then law controlled his voice sufficiently to say its fortunate he didnt recognize you tonight maybe he did anyhow his wife is the new dressmaker palomas hired i aint got a chance dave that story will ruin me in the community and paloma will turn me out when she learns im a a ladypincher what are you going to do about it blaze sighed i dont know yet probably ill end by running from those scorpions like i did before the next morning at breakfast paloma announced father you must help dave hunt down these cattle thieves aint that sort of a big order blaze queried perhaps but youre the very man to do it ricardo guzman is the only person who knows the lewis gang as well as you do jones shook his head doubtfully don ricardo has been working up his own private feud with that outfit if i was the kind that went looking for a fight i wouldnt have paid freight on myself from the panhandle down here i could have got one right at home any morning before breakfast ricardo guzman is something of a black sheep himself law spoke up pshaw hes all right i reckon he has changed a few brands in his time but so has everybody else why thats how old ed austin got his start if a cowman tells you he never stole anything hes either a dam good liar or a dam bad roper but ricardos going straight enough now he has lost his share of stock paloma explained and hell work with you if father asks him you go along with dave im too busy blaze demurred and i aint feeling good i had bad dreams all night i dont want you around here this morning that new dressmaker is coming jones rose abruptly from the table i reckon my business can wait hustle up dave a few moments later as they were saddling their horses he lamented what did i tell you here i go on the dodge from a dressmaker i spose ive got to live like a roadagent now till something happens don ricardo guzman was an american but he spoke no english an accident of birth had made him a citizen of the united states his father having owned a ranch which lay north instead of south of the rio grande inasmuch as the property had fallen to ricardo his sons too were yankees in the eyes of the law but in all other respects don ricardo and his family differed not at all from the many guzmans who lived across the border the guzman ranch comprised a goodly number of acres and since live stock multiply rapidly its owner had in some sort prospered on the bank of a resaca a former bed of the rio grande stood the house an adobe structure square white and unprotected from the sun by shrub or tree behind it were some brush corrals and a few scattered mud jacals in which lived the help ricardo had just risen from a siesta when his two visitors rode up and he made them welcome with the best he had there followed a complimentary exchange of greetings and the usual flow of small talk ricardo had suffered a severe toothache the same abominable affliction that had lost porfirio diaz an empire it had been a dry spring but praise god the water still held in the resaca his two sons were branding calves in one of the outer pastures and there had been a very good calf crop indeed blaze recounted his own doings law told of ranger activities along the lower border in the cool of the afternoon ricardo rode with his visitors and then cordial relations being now established he began to divulge information of value to law yes he had endured many depredations from thieves it was shameful but doubtless god willed that a certain amount of stealing should go on in the world the evildoers were certainly favored by nature in this locality for the great expanse of brush country to the north and east offered almost perfect security and the river to the south gave immunity from pursuit or prosecution the beeves were driven north into the wilderness but the horses went to mexico where the war had created a market for them the federals had plenty of money to buy mounts whom did don ricardo suspect the old man was noncommittal suspicion was one thing proof was quite another and conviction was difficult under the best of circumstances why even a cows recognition of her own calf was not evidence for a court and alibis were easily proven unless the thieves were caught in the very act there was no case against them and por dios one could not be for ever on guard who could tell where the malefactors would strike next now in mexico one could afford to kill an undesirable neighbor without so much formality but thank god don ricardo was not a mexican no he was a good american citizen it was something to make him sleep well in these wartimes just the same ill bet hed sleep better if the lewis outfit was cleaned up dave ventured and blaze agreed guzman caught his enemys name and nodded ah that sin verguenza he sells arms to the candeleristas and horses to the potosistas perhaps he steals my calves who knows senor lewis doesnt need to steal he has money jones argued true but who is so rich that he would not be richer lewis employs men who are poor and he himself is above nothing i too am a friend of the rebels panchito the liberator was a saint and i give money to the patriots who fight for his memory but i do not aid the tyrant potosi with my other hand yes and who is richer for instance than senor eduardo austin you surely dont accuse him of doubledealing with the rebels blaze inquired curiously i dont know he is a friend of tad lewis and there are strange stories afloat just what these stories were however ricardo would not say feeling perhaps that he had already said too much the three men spent that evening together and in the morning blaze rode home leaving the ranger behind for the time being as guzmans guest dave put in the next two days riding the pastures familiarizing himself with the country and talking with the few men he met about all he discovered however was the fact that the guzman range not only adjoined some of lewiss leased land but also was bounded for several miles by the las palmas fence it was pleasant to spend the days among the shy brushcattle with bessie belle for company the mare seemed to enjoy the excursions as much as her owner her eyes and ears were ever alert she tossed her head and snorted when a deer broke cover or a jackrabbit scuttled out of her path she showed a friendly interest in the awkward calves which stood and eyed her with such amazement and then galloped stiffly off with tails high arched law had many times undertaken to break bessie belle of that habit of flinging her head high at sudden sounds but she was nervous and inquisitive and this was the one thing upon which she maintained a feminine obstinacy on the second evening the ranger rode home through a drizzle that had materialized after a long threatening afternoon and now promised to become a real rain ricardo met him at the door to say you bring good fortune with you senor for the land is thirsty tomorrow if this rain holds we shall ride together you pedro and i those thieves do their stealing when they leave no tracks raoul the younger son volunteered to go in place of his father but ricardo would not hear of it am i so old that i must lie abed he cried no we three shall ride the fences and if we encounter a cut wire diablo we shall have a story to tell eh the sky was leaden the rain still fell in the morning when dave and his two companions set out until noon they rode their slickers dripping their horses steaming then they ate an uncomfortable lunch under the thickest hackberrytree they could find after which they resumed their patrol ricardos tongue at length ran down under this discomfort and the three riders sat their saddles silently swaying to the tireless foxtrot of their horses their eyes engaged in a watchful scrutiny at last pedro who was ahead reined in and pointed the others saw where the barbedwire strands of the fence they had been following were clipped a number of horse and calf tracks led through the opening and after an examination ricardo announced there are two men they have come and gone with the calves tied neck and neck that is las palmas isnt it law indicated the pasture into which the trail led father and son answered si senor for a time the ranger lounged sidewise in his saddle studying the country before him the land was open and comparatively flat it was broken by tiny clumps of mesquite and low sprawling beds of cactus perhaps a halfmile away however began a long narrow patch of woods with the tops of occasional oaks showing and this ran parallel with the fence for a considerable distance they took them in yonder to brand he said straightening himself maybe well be in time side by side the three men rode off guzmans land following the tracks to the nearest point of woods there law stopped to give his directions pedro you ride down this side ricardo you skirt the outside i shall keep to the middle walk your horses for i shall go slowly he slipped his carbine from its scabbard the others did the same but daves plan did not commend itself to ricardo the old mans face puckered into an expression of doubt and removing his hat he ran a hand over his wiry shortcropped white hair senor he protested i know something about these men and they will not wait to learn that you are an officer perhaps i had better ride with you but law declined the wellmeant offer and with a dubious shake of the head ricardo rode away while dave guided bessie belle into the grove the mare seemed to know that something unusual was afoot perhaps some nervous tensity of her rider made itself felt perhaps with equine sagacity she had understood from the first the nature of this scouting expedition dave was inclined to believe the latterhe had often averred that bessie belle knew quite as much as or more than he at any rate she picked her way with admirable care her hoofs made almost no sound upon the wet soil only the complaint of the saddle leathers or the swish of a wet branch rose above the steady patter of the raindrops it was not necessary to guide her she selected the openings of her own free will her small sharp ears were alert and her eyes searched the glades intently dave smiled at this excess of caution and stroked bessie belles wet neck encouragingly whereupon she turned her head and it seemed to the rider that she nodded her complete understanding law could have kissed her x a rangers horse onward through the dense foliage the two friends wound now and then they stopped to listen but the rain was heavy enough to drown all other noises encountering fresh tracks finally dave leaned from his saddle and studied them what he saw caused him to push forward with no diminution of stealth he had gone perhaps half a mile when bessie belle raised her head and he noted that her nostrils were working sensitively a few yards farther on law fancied that he could detect the smell of a wood fire almost without a signal from him the mare halted in her tracks until he had satisfied himself still farther along they came to a place where the brush was low and there rising through the treetops beyond they saw a wavering plume of blue smoke the ranger rode into sight of the brandingfire with his winchester across his saddlehorn and his thumb upon the hammer what followed came with almost the blinding suddenness of a lightning crash though afterward the events of that crowded moment lingered as a clearcut memory first there was the picture of a sandy glade in the center of which burned a fire with brandingirons in it and a spotted calf tied to a tree but otherwise no sign of life then without warning bessie belle threw up her head in that characteristic trick of hers and simultaneously dave saw a figure rise out of the grass at his left with rifle leveled the ranger remembered afterward the odd foreshortening of the weapon and the crooked twist of the face behind it with the first jerk of his horses head his own gun had leaped to his shoulder he was not conscious of having willed it to do so and even as he pressed the trigger he beheld a jet of smoke spurt from the muzzle aimed at him with the kick of his carbine he felt bessie belle give way it seemed to dave that he shot while she was sinking the next instant his feet still in the stirrups were on the ground and his horse lay between them motionless that nervous fling of her head had saved daves life for the rustlers bullet had shattered her skull in its flight and she lay prone with scarcely a muscular twitch so sudden had been her end the breath escaped slowly from her lungs it was as if she heaved a lingering sigh one leg contracted and then relaxed for a moment the ranger was dazed he stood staring down at his pet then the truth engulfed him he realized that he had ridden her to her death and at the thought he became like a woman bereft of her child like a lover who had seen his sweetheart slain a shout it was a hoarse inarticulate cry a swift maddened scrutiny that searched the sodden scene of the ambush then he was down beside the mare calling her name heartbrokenly his arms around her neck his face against her warm wet velvet hide law knew that two men had entered the thicket and therefore one still remained to be reckoned with but he gave no thought to that nor did he rise to look after the grotesquely huddled figure that had been a cattle thief only a moment before both he and his assailant had been too close to miss from the corner of his eye he could see a pair of bootsoles staring at him out of the grass and they told him there was no need for investigation near the body he heard a calf stirring but he let it struggle bessie belles bright eyes were glazing she did not hear her lovers voice her muzzle softer than any satin was loose her lips would never twitch with that clumsy quivering caress which pleased her master so one front hoof washed as clean as agate was awkwardly bent under her the other had plowed a furrow in the soft earth as she sank and against this leg her head lay tipped don ricardo and his son burst out of the brush from opposite directions almost at the same moment to find the ranger with his face buried in his horses mane caramba what is this the old man flung himself from the saddle and came running you are injured pedro too bent over the officer his brown face pale with apprehension mother of god breathed the latter it was a wild thing to do to ride alone im all right law said rising stiffly whereupon both mexicans voiced their relief the saints be praised si what happened there was a shot did you see nothing law jerked his head in the direction of the fallen man at his back and pedro uttered a loud cry look father and son ran through the grass then recoiled and broke into a jargon of oaths and exclamations law followed them with his eyes is he dead he inquired coldly god yes right in the mouth the fellow was in hell before he realized it see it is as we thought pedro one of lewiss tse tse tse what a sight who is he queried the officer pino garza one of the worst chimed the two guzmans ricardo was dancing in his excitement i told you that lewis knew something the other one got past me but he rode like the devil and i cannot shoot like this wait exclaimed pedro this is beyond my understanding i heard but one shot from here then after an instant my fathers gun and yet here is a dead horse and a dead man this fellow and i fired at about the same instant dave explained but even when he had related the history of the encounter his companions could scarcely believe that such quick shooting was possible it was difficult to secure a connected story from ricardo but he finally made it plain that at the first report the other thief had fled exposing himself only long enough for the old man to take a quick shot in his direction ricardo had missed and the miscreant was doubtless well away by this time he had ridden a sorrel horse that was all ricardo could remember law looked only briefly at the gruesome results of his marksmanship then he turned back to the body of his beloved mare ricardo noticed at length that he was crying as the ranger knelt beside the dead thoroughbred the old mexican whispered to his son valgame dios this is a strange fellow he weeps like a woman he must have loved that horse as a man loves his wife who can understand these gringos after a time he approached cautiously and inquired what shall we do with this hombre senor pedro has found his horse law roused himself with his own hands he gently removed bessie belles saddle bridle and blanket then he gave his orders ill take your horse ricardo and you take that fellows get a wagon and move him to jonesville and you im going to follow that man on the sorrel the dead mans saddle was left beside the body then when the exchange of mounts had been effected and all was ready law made a request that amazed both father and son if im not back by morning i want you to bury my mare his voice broke he turned away his face bury her deep ricardo sothe coyotes cant dig her up right here where she fell ill be back to see that its done right understand bueno i understand perfectly she was a pretty horse she was your bonita eh well you have a big heart senor as a brave man should have everything shall be done as you wish i give you my hand on it ricardo reached down and gripped laws palm we will name our pasture for her too because it is plain you loved her dearly so then until tomorrow law watched his two friends ride away then he wiped his winchester and saw to his cinch this done he raised bessie belles head and kissed the lip that had so often explored his palm for sugar with a miserable ache in his throat he mounted and rode off to pick up the trail of the man on the sorrel pony fortunately this was not difficult for the tracks of a running horse are plain in soft ground finding where his quarry had broken cover law set out at a lope the fellow had ridden in a wide semicircle at first then finding he was not pursued he had slackened pace and in consequence the signs became more difficult to follow they seemed to lead in the direction of las palmas which dave judged must be fully twelve miles away and when they continued to maintain this course the ranger became doubly interested could it be he asked himself that his quarry would have the audacity to ride to the austin headquarters if so his identification promised to become easy for a man on a sorrel cowpony was more than likely to be observed perhaps he thought himself secure and counted upon the assistance of some friend or confederate among the las palmas ranchhands in case of pursuit that seemed not unreasonable particularly inasmuch as he could have no suspicion that it was a ranger who was on his trail dave lost the hoofprints for a time but picked them up again at the pasture gate a few miles farther on and was able to trace them far enough to assure himself that his quarry was indeed headed for the austin house and had no intention of swinging southward toward the lewis headquarters by this time the rain had done its work and to follow the tracks became a matter of guesswork night was coming on also and dave realized that at this rate darkness would find him far from his goal therefore he risked his own interpretation of the riders intent and pushed on without pausing to search out the trail step by step at the second gate the signs indicated that his man was little more than an hour ahead of him the prospect of again seeing the ruddyhaired mistress of las palmas stirred law more deeply than he cared to admit alaire austin had been seldom out of his thoughts since their first meeting for after the fashion of men cut off from human society he was subject to insistent fancies dave had many times lived over those incidents at the waterhole and for the life of him he could not credit the common stories of alaires coldness to him at least she had appeared very human and after they had once become acquainted she had been unaffected and friendly since that meeting dave had picked up considerable information about the object of his interest and although much of this was palpably false it had served to make her a still more romantic figure in his eyes alaire now seemed to be a sort of superwoman and the fact that she was his friend that something deep within her had answered to him afforded him a keen satisfaction the greater perhaps because of his surprise that it could be go nevertheless he was uncomfortably aware that she had a husband not only so but the sharp contrast in their positions was disagreeable to contemplate she was unbelievably rich and a person of influence in the state while he had nothing except his health his saddle and his horse with a desperate pang law realized that now he had no horse bessie belle his best beloved lay cold and wet back yonder in the weeping mesquite he found several cubes of sugar in his pocket and with an oath flung them from him don ricardos horse seemed stiffgaited and stubborn dave remembered how mrs austin had admired the mare no doubt she would grieve at the fate that had befallen her and that would give them something to talk about his own escape would interest her too and law realized not without some natural gratification that he would appear to her as a sort of hero the mist and an early dusk prevented him from seeing las palmas itself until he was well in among the irrigated fields a few moments later when he rode up to the outbuildings he encountered a middleaged mexican who proved to be benito gonzalez the range boss dave made himself known and benito answered his questions with apparent honesty no he had seen nothing of a sorrel horse or a strange rider but he had just come in himself doubtless they could learn more from juan the horsewrangler who was somewhere about juan was finally found but he proved strangely recalcitrant at first he knew nothing though after some questioning he admitted the possibility that he had seen a horse of the description given but was not sure more pressure brought forth the reluctant admission that the possibility was almost a certainty what horse was it benito inquired but the lad was noncommittal probably it belonged to some stranger juan could not recollect just where or when he had seen the pony and he was certain he had not laid eyes upon the owner devil take the boy hes halfwitted benito growled but dave changed his tactics oiga he said sternly do you want to go to jail juan had no such desire then tell the truth was the horse branded yes with what brand juan had not noticed with the kt perhaps that was the lewis brand perhaps where is it now juan insolently declared that he didnt know and didnt care oh you dont eh law reached for the boy and shook him until he yelled you will make a nice little prisoner juanito and we shall find a way to make you speak gonzalez was inclined to resent such highhanded treatment of his underling but respect for the rangers was deeprooted and juans behavior was inexplicable at last the horseboy confessed he had seen both horse and rider but knew neither mr austin and the stranger had arrived together and the latter had gone on that was the truth bueno law released his prisoner who slunk away rubbing his shoulder now benito we will find mr austin a voice answered from the dusk he wont take much finding and ed austin himself emerged from the stable door well what do you want he asked you are mr austin i reckon i am what dyou mean by abusing my help the master of las palmas approached so near that his threatening scowl was visible i dont allow strangers to prowl around my premises amazed at this hostile greeting law explained in a word the reason for his presence i dont know anything about your man what dyou want him for and who are you dave introduced himself i want him for stealing guzman calves i trailed him from where he and his partner cut into your south pasture benito stirred and muttered an oath but austin was unmoved i reckon you must be a bad trailer he laughed weve got no thieves here what makes you think guzman lost any calves daves temper never too well controlled at best began to rise he could not imagine why a person of ed austins standing should behave in this extraordinary manner unless perhaps he was drunk well i saw the calves and i left the fellow that was branding them with a wet saddleblanket over his face eh whats that austin started and gonzalez uttered a smothered exclamation you killed him hes dead dead enough to skin i caught him with his irons in the fire and the calves necked up in your pasture now i want his companero i hope you dont think we know anything about him ed protested wheres that man on the sorrel horse austin turned away with a shrug you rode in with him dave persisted ed wheeled quickly how do you know i did your boy saw you the ranchmans voice was harsh as he said look here my friend youre on the wrong track the fellow i was with had nothing to do with this affair would you know your man did you get a look at him no but i reckon don ricardo could tell his horse humph austin grunted disagreeably so just for that you come prowling around threatening my help eh trying to frame up a case maybe well it dont go i was out with one of tad lewiss men what was his name dave managed to inquire urbina he had a sorrel under him but there are thousands of sorrel horses what time did you meet him i met him at noon and ive been with him ever since so you see youre wrong i presume your man doubled back and is laughing at you laws first bewilderment had given place to a black rage for the moment he was in danger of disregarding the reason for young eds incivility and giving free rein to his passion but he checked himself in time would you mind telling me what you and this urbina were doing he inquired harshly austin laughed mockingly thats my business said he dave moistened his lips he hitched his shoulders nervously he was astonished at his own selfcontrol though the certainty that austin was drunk helped him to steady himself nevertheless he dared not trust himself to speak construing this silence as an acknowledgment of defeat ed turned to go some tardy sense of duty however prompted him to fling back carelessly i suppose youve come a good ways if youre hungry benito will show you the way to the kitchen then he walked away into the darkness followed by the shocked gaze of his range boss benito roused himself from his amazement to say warmly si compadre you will enjoy a cup of hot coffee but law ground out fiercely im not used to kitchen handouts i reckon i can chew my bridlereins if i get too hungry walking to his horse he vaulted into the saddle benito laid a hand upon his thigh and apologized senor ed is a strange man he is often like this lately you understand me will you come to my house for supper thank you but i think ill ride on to tad lewiss and see urbina at this the mexican shook his head as if apprehensive of the result but he said nothing more law hesitated as he was about to spur out of the yard by the way he ventured you neednt mention this to mrs austin she is not here gonzalez told him she has gone to la feria to see about her affairs she would not permit of this occurrence if she were at home she is a very fine lady yes good night benito good night senor when the ranger had gone gonzalez walked slowly toward his house with his head bowed thoughtfully it is very strange he muttered how could don eduardo have met this garza at noon when with my own eyes i saw him ride away from las palmas at three oclock in the afternoon it is very strange xi judge ellsworth exacts a promise on his way to the lewis ranch dave law had a struggle with himself he had earned a reputation as a man of violent temper and the time was not long past when a fraction of the insult ed austin had offered him would have provoked a vigorous counterblast the fact that on this occasion he had managed to restrain himself argued an increase of selfcontrol that especially gratified him because his natural tendency to fly off the handle had led more than once to regrettable results in fact it was only since he had assumed the duties of a peace officer that he had made a serious effort at selfgovernment a rangers work calls for patience and forbearance and dave had begun to realize the perils of his temperament normally he was a levelheaded conservative fellow but when angered a thousand devils sprang up in him and he became capable of the wildest excess this instability indeed had been largely to blame for his aimless roaming deep inside himself he knew that it was nothing but his headstrong temper which had brought on all his misfortunes and left him well along in his thirties a wanderer with nothing he could call his own as with most men of his turbulent disposition fits of fury were usually followed by keen revulsions of feeling in dave these paroxysms had frequently been succeeded by such a sense of shame as to drive him from the scene of his actions and in the course of his rovings he had acquired an ample store of regrets bitter food for thought during the silent hours when he sat over his campfire or rode alone through the mesquite his hatreds were keen and relentless his passions wild and yet so far as he knew they had never led him to commit a mean or a downright evil deed he had killed men to be sure but never he was thankful to say in one of his moments of frenzy the killing of men in the fierce exultation of battle the slaying of a criminal by an officer under stress of duty even the taking of life under severe personal provocation were acts that did not put one beyond the pale such blood washes off but there were stains of a different kind dave was glad that he had swallowed young eds incivility not only for his own sake but for the sake of alaire after all he argued it was barely possible that ed had spoken the truth there were many sorrel horses the evidence of those rainwashed hoofprints was far from conclusive even the fact that urbina belonged to the tad lewis outfit was no more than a suspicious circumstance and yet earnestly as he strove to convince himself of these possibilities the ranger could not down the conviction that the rancher had lied and that he himself was on the right track it was late when he arrived at his destination but lewiss house was dark and it required some effort to awaken the owner when tad at last appeared clad in undershirt and trousers he greeted the ranger with a leveled winchester but when dave had made known his identity he invited him in though with surly reluctance lewis was a sandycomplexioned man of about forty with colorless brows and a mean shifty eye formerly a cowboy he had by the exercise of some natural ability acquired a good property and a bad reputation just how or why he had prospered was a mystery which his neighbors never tired of discussing tad it seemed resented any interruption of his rest and showed the fact plainly yes he employed a fellow named urbina what was wanted of him law explained briefly why hes one of my best men laughed the rancher he wouldnt steal nothing well i had to shoot another good man of yours dave said quietly lewis fell back a step which one who he inquired quickly pino garza dave told of the meeting at the brandingfire and its outcome he was aware meanwhile that lewiss family were listening for behind a halfopen bedroom door he could hear an excited whispering killed him the first shot eh tad was dumfounded now i never thought pino was that bad but you never can tell about these greasers can you theyll all steal if they get a chance i let pino go bout a week back but hes been hangin around aimin to visit some of his relatives up in the brush country it was probably one of them old guzman saw anyhow it couldnt of been adolfo urbina he was over to las palmas all the afternoon did you send him there sure ed austin can tell you where is urbina now i reckon hes asleep somewhere well dig him up and talk to him if you say so good tads willingness to cooperate with the officer now that he understood the situation was in marked contrast to the behavior of austin in fact his offer to help was almost too willingly given to suit dave who expected him to protest at being dragged out on such a night no protest came however lewis slipped into his boots and slicker explaining meanwhile im sorry this play came up for i dont want folks to think i got a gang of thieves workin for me but adolfo urbina was nowhere to be found no one had seen him since about seven oclock nor could it be discovered where he was spending the night dave remembered that it had been about seven when he left las palmas and ascertained indirectly that tad had a telephone on his way from austins law had stopped at a rancho for a bite to eat but he could forgive himself for the delay if as he surmised urbina had been warned by wire of his coming thats too bad aint it lewis said but hell be around again in the morning and ill get him for you you leave it to me there was plainly nothing to do but accept this offer since it could avail nothing to wait here for urbinas return unless the fellow gave himself up he probably could not be found now that the alarm was given without a considerable search in view of which dave finally remounted his borrowed horse and rode away in the direction of jonesville it was after daylight when he dismounted stiffly at blazes gate he was wet to the skin and bespattered with mud he had been almost constantly in the saddle for twentyfour hours and don ricardos cowpony was almost exhausted blaze and paloma of course were tremendously interested in his story say now thats quick work the latter exclaimed heartily youre some thiefbuster dave and if youll just stay around here little calves can grow up with some comfort when dave rode to jonesville after breakfast he found that the body of his victim had been brought in during the night and that the town was already buzzing with news of the encounter during the forenoon don ricardo and his sons arrived bringing additional information which they promptly imparted to the ranger the guzmans were people of action all three of them had spent the night on horseback and pedro had made a discovery on the day previous garza had been seen riding in company with a man astride a sorrel pony and this man had been recognized as adolfo urbina pedros witness would swear to it their distance from las palmas at the time when they had been seen together proved beyond question that unless urbina had flown he could not have arrived at the place in question by noon the hour ed austin had fixed this significant bit of information however dave advised the guzmans not to make public for the time being toward midday tad lewis and three of his men arrived with the news that urbina had left for pueblo before they could intercept him hes got a girl up there and hes gone to get married tad explained im sure sorry we missed him dave smiled grimly at the speaker are you sure he didnt cross to the other side he asked lewis retorted warmly adolfos an allright hombre and ill back him so ll ed austin i guess me an ed are responsible aint we some skeptical expression in his hearers face prompted him to inquire brusquely dont you believe what im telling you about his goin to pueblo i guess hes gone somewhere tad uttered an angry exclamation looks to me like youd made up your mind to saddle this thing onto him whether he done it or not well hes a poor mexican but i wont stand to see him railroaded and neither will young ed no you heard me ed will alibi him complete law answered sharply you tell ed austin to go slow with his alibis and you take this for what its worth to you im going to get all the cattlerustlers in this county all of them understand lewis flushed redly and sputtered if you make this stick with adolfo nobody ll be safe i reckon urbinas word is as good as old ricardos everybody knows what he is later when dave met the guzmans ricardo told him excitedly that horse tad lewis is riding is the one i saw yesterday are you sure listen senor men in cities remember the faces they see i have lived all my life among horses and to me they are like men i seldom forget very well tad says urbina has gone to pueblo to get married so im going to follow him and i shall be there when he arrives bueno another matter ricardo hesitated your bonita the pretty mare she is buried deep im glad said dave i think i shall sleep better for knowing that since the recent rain had rendered the black valley roads impassable for automobiles dave decided to go to pueblo by rail even though it was a roundabout way and that afternoon found him jolting over the leisurely miles between jonesville and the main line he was looking forward to a good nights sleep when he arrived at the junction but on boarding the northbound through train he encountered judge ellsworth who had just heard of the garza killing and of course was eager for details the two sat in the observationcar talking until a late hour knowing the judge for a man of honor and discretion dave unburdened himself with the utmost freedom regarding his suspicions of ed austin ellsworth nodded yes ed has thrown in with the rebel junta in san antone and tad lewis is the man they use to run arms and supplies in this neighborhood thats why he and ed are so friendly urbina is probably your cattle thief but he has a hold over ed and so he rode to las palmas when he was pursued knowing that no jury would convict him over austins testimony do you think ed would perjure himself dave asked he has gone clean to the bad lately theres no telling what hell do id hate to see you crowd him dave they call you the best lawyer in this county because you settle so many cases out of court the judge smiled at this well heres a chance for you to do the county a good turn and keep ed austin out of trouble how the prosecuting attorney is a new man and he wants to make a reputation by breaking up the lewis gang well he intends to cinch urbina on ricardos and my testimony youre a friend of austins youd better tip him to set his watch ahead a few hours and save himself a lot of trouble the prosecuting attorney dont like ed any too well understand the judge pondered this suggestion for a moment young ed is a queer fellow once in a while he gets his neck bowed so do i law declared quietly he treated me like a hobo sent me to the kitchen for a handout that sticks if i hadnt tamed down considerably these late years id have wound him up right there from beneath his drooping lids ellsworth regarded the ranger curiously you have a bad temper havent you rotten i know you were a violent boy ive often wondered how you were getting along how do you feel when youre that way it was the younger mans turn to hesitate well i dont feel anything when im mad he confessed im plumb crazy i guess but i feel plenty bad afterwards there was a flicker of the judges eyelids dave went on musingly i dare say its inherited they tell me my father was the same he was a killer yes he was all of that say was he my father ellsworth started what do you mean dave lifted an abstracted gaze from the pullman carpet i hardly know what i mean judge but youve had hunches havent you didnt you ever know that something you thought was true wasnt true at all well i never felt as if i had frank laws blood in me this is interesting ellsworth stirred and leaned forward whatever made you doubt it dave umm nothing definite thats whats so unsatisfactory but for instance my mother was mexican spanish all right am i spanish have i any spanish blood in me she didnt look spanish she was lightcomplexioned for one thing we both know plenty of people with a latin strain in them who look like anglosaxons isnt there anything else nothing i can lay my finger on except some kid fancies and that hunch i spoke about ellsworth sat back with a deep breath you were educated in the north and your boyhood was spent at school and college away from everything mexican that probably accounts for it law agreed then his face lit with a slow smile by the way dont tell mrs austin that im a sort of college person she thinks im a redneck and she sends me books ellsworth laughed silently your talk is to blame dave has she sent you the swiss family robinson no mostly good sad romances with an uplift stories full of lances at rest and willieboys in tin sweaters life must have been mighty interesting in olden days there was so much loving and killing going on the good women were always beautiful too and the villains never had a redeeming trait its a shame how human nature has got mixed up since then isnt it there isnt a mylady in all those books who could bust a cowpony or run a ranch like las palmas say judge howd you like to have to live with a perfect lady dont try your damned hoglatin on me chided the lawyer alaire austins romance is sadder than any of those novels dave nodded but she doesnt cry about it then he asked gravely why didnt she pick a real fellow whod kneel and kiss the hem of her dress and make a man of himself thats what she wants love and sacrifice and lots of both if i were ed austin id wear her glove in my bosom and treat her like those queens in the stories incense and adoration and whats the matter with you queried the judge i guess im lonesome are you smitten with that girl dave laughed maybe who wouldnt be why doesnt she divorce that bum she could do it easy enough and then marry a chap who could run las palmas for her a man about six feet three or four acidly suggested the judge thats the picture i have in mind you think you could run las palmas i wouldnt mind trying really foolish question number three you must never marry firmly declared the older man youd make a bad husband dave she ought to know how to get along with a bad husband by this time both men had been but half serious ellsworth knew his companions words carried no disrespect nevertheless he said gravely if you ever think of marrying i want you to come to me promise ill do it on the way back from church no on the way to church ill have something to tell you tell me now urged law theres nothing to tell yet ill have no old ruffians kissing my brandnew bride dave averred the judges face broadened in a smile thank heaven young ed has the insides of a steel range and so my pet client is safe from your mercenary schemes for some years just the same if you ever do think of marrying remember i want you to come to me and ill cure you xii longorio makes bold upon her arrival at la feria alaire discovered that the federal depredations had been even greater than she had feared not only had the soldiers taken a great many head of cattle but they had practically cleared the ranch of horses leaving scarcely enough with which to carry on the work alaires hacienda comprised a hundred thousand acres or more lacking a thorough survey she had never determined exactly how much land she really owned and the property fronted upon a stream of water in any other country it would have been a garden of riches but agriculture was wellnigh impossible in northern mexico for several years now the instability of the government had precluded any plan of development and in consequence the fields were out of cultivation and cattle grazed over the moist bottom lands belly deep in grass the entire ranch had been given over to pasture and even now after alaire had sold off much of her stock because of the war the task of accurately counting what remained required a longer time than she had expected and her visit lengthened however life in the roomy fortresslike adobe house was pleasant enough dolores saw to her mistresss wants and the regular inhabitants of la feria were always extravagantly glad to make their employer welcome they were a simple mirthloving industrious people little concerned over the war so long as they were unmolested but obviously relieved to see alaire because of their recent fright at the incursion of longorios troops in the work that now went forward jose sanchez took a prominent part for once in his life he was a person of recognized importance not only was he the right hand of the owner of la feria but the favor of that redoubtable general the hero of a hundred tales rested upon his shoulders like a mantle joses extravagant praises of the federal commander together with the daily presence of the military guard forcibly brought home to the ranchdwellers the fact that war was actually going on and that luis longorio was indeed a man of flesh and blood and no myth this realization caused a ripple of excitement to stir the peons placid lives and yet in the midst of his satisfaction sanchez confessed to one trouble he had expected to find his cousin panfilo here and the fact that nothing whatever had been heard from him filled him with great uneasiness of course he came to alaire who told him of seeing panfilo at the waterhole on the day after her husband had discharged him but that information gave jose little comfort since it proved nothing as to his cousins present whereabouts alaire thought best not to tell him the full circumstances of that affair believing that panfilo would turn up at la feria in due time she gave little heed to joses dark threats of vengeance for any injury to his relative the horsebreakers concern increased as the days passed and to the lieutenant and members of the guard he repeated his threats truly he declared if any evil had fallen upon his beloved cousin panfilo he jose would exact a terrible reckoning a revenge befitting a man of his character and a friend of luis longorio these soldiers by the way were something of a trial to alaire for they were ever in her way she could not ride a mile over her own pastures without the whole martial squad following at her heels protest was unavailing the lieutenant was mulishly stubborn he had been ordered to keep the senora in sight at all times so he said and that ended the matter as far as he was concerned his life and the lives of his six followers depended entirely upon her safety and happiness for general longorio was a man of his word of course the lieutenant would not offend for the world the object of his solicitude was at liberty to tread upon his worthless old carcass but orders were orders especially when they came from a certain source he besought alaire to exercise forbearance toward him and above all to use the extremest caution in regard to her own wellbeing for if aught befell her if even a despicable rattlesnake should rise out of the grass to sting her caramba the teniente in that case would better destroy himself on the spot otherwise he would surely find himself in a short time with his back to a stone wall and his face to a firingsquad that was the sort of man longorio was the speaker wondered if mrs austin really understood his chiefs nature how determined he was how relentless he could be general longorio was a remarkable person opposition of any sort he could not brook his discipline was rigorous and his punishments were severe being utterly without fear himself he insisted upon implicit obedience in others at whatever cost for instance during the battle of san pedro just south of here a handful of rebels had taken refuge in a small oneroomed adobe house where they resisted all efforts at dislodgment time and again the federals had charged only to meet a fire too murderous to face the slaughter had been terrific the lieutenant veteran of many revolutions vowed he had never seen a street so full of dead and wounded as the one in front of this house finally the soldiers had refused to advance again and their captain had sent for a cannon during the wait longorio had ridden up come make haste said he that house obstructs my view seeing that alaire was deeply interested in this recital the old lieutenant paused dramatically well the capitan explained that an army was insufficient to take that house that it meant death to all who approached i was not present god be praised but others told me what happened general longorio dismounted and embraced the capitan he kissed him on the cheek saying adios my dear good friend i fear i have seen the last of you then what senora you would never guess the speaker shook his head longorio took two dynamite grenades and laughing like a boy he ran forward before any one knew what he was about it is nothing but the truth senora and he a general this capitan loved him dearly and so his bones turned to rope when the windows of that accursed house began to vomit fire and the dust began to fly they say that the dead men in the street rose to their knees and crossed themselves i only repeat what i was told by those who looked on anyhow i have seen things quite as remarkable never was such courage senora god must have been moved to astonishment and admiration for he diverted those bullets every one when our general came to the house he lit the fuses from his cigarette then he cried viva potosi and hurled one bomb to the roof the other he flung through a window into the very faces of his enemies those rebels were packed in there like goats in a corral and they say such a screaming you never heard doubtless many of them died from sheer terror the rest were blown through each other the lieutenant breathed an admiring oath truly it must have been a superb spectacle general longorio must be very brave indeed alaire agreed but wait that is not all after we had taken the town and destroyed what rebel officers we found you mean your prisoners si but there were only a few and doubtless some of them would have died from their wounds well then after that general longorio called his old friend that capitan out before his troops and with his own hand he shot him then every fifth man among those who had refused to charge he ordered executed it effected much good i assure you for a moment alaire and her companion rode in silence but the teniente was not content with this praise of his leader and yet general longorio has another side to his character he continued he can be as mild as the shyest senorita and he possesses the most beautiful sentiments women are mad over him but he is hard to please strangely so truly the lady who captivates his fancy may count herself fortunate the old soldier turned in his saddle and with a grace surprising in one of his rough appearance removed his hat and swept alaire a bow the unmistakable meaning of which caused her to start and to stammer something unintelligible alaire was angry at the fellows presumption and vexed with herself for showing that she understood his insinuation she spurred her horse into a gallop leaving him to follow as he could it was absurd to take the mans word seriously indeed he probably believed he had paid her a compliment alaire assured herself that longorios attentions were inspired merely by a temporary extravagance of admiration characteristic of his nationality doubtless he had forgotten all about her by this time that too was characteristic of latin men nevertheless the possibility that she had perhaps stirred him more deeply than she believed was disturbing one might easily learn to fear longorio as a suitor he would be quite as embarrassing quite asdangerous as an enemy if all reports were true alaire tried to banish such ideas but even in her own room she was not permitted entirely to forget for dolores echoed the tenientes sentiments in marked contrast to jose sanchezs high and confident spirits was the housekeepers conviction of dire calamity in the presence of these armed strangers she saw nothing but a menace and considered herself and her mistress no more nor less than prisoners destined for a fate as horrible as that of the two beautiful sisters of whom she never tired of speaking longorio was a bloodthirsty beast and he was saving them as prey for his first leisure moment that was doloress belief abandoning all hope of ever seeing las palmas again she gave herself up to thoughts of god and melancholy praises of her husbands virtues in spite of all this however alaire welcomed the change in her daily life everything about la feria was restfully unamerican from the house itself with its bare walls and floors its brilliantly flowering patio and its primitive kitchen arrangements to the blackshawled barefooted indian women and their naked children rolling in the dust even the timberless mountains that rose sheer from the westward plain into a tumbling purpleshadowed rampart were mexican la feria was several miles from the railroad therefore it could not have been more foreign had it lain in the very heart of mexico rather than near the northern boundary in such surroundings and in spite of faint misgivings it was not strange that after a few days alaires unhappiness assumed a vaguely impersonal quality and that her life for the moment seemed not to be her own even the thought of her husband ed austin became indistinct and unreal then all too soon she realized that the purpose of her visit was accomplished and that she had no excuse for remaining longer she was now armed with sufficient facts to make a definite demand upon the federal government the lieutenant took charge of the return journey to the railroad and the two women rode to the jingling accompaniment of metal trappings when at last they were safely aboard the northbound train alaire mildly teased dolores about her recent timidity but dolores was not to be betrayed into premature rejoicing anything may happen at a moments notice she declared something tells me that i am to meet a shocking fate i can hear those ruffianly soldiers quarreling over me it is what comes from good looks dolores mechanically smoothed the wrinkles from her dress and adjusted her hair mark you i shall kill myself first i have made up my mind to that but it is a great pity we were not born ugly alaire could not forbear a smile for she who thus resigned herself to the penalties of beauty had never been well favored and age had destroyed what meager attractions she may have once possessed dolores went on after a time my benito will not long remain unmarried he is like all men more than once i have suspected him of making eyes at young women and any girl in the country would marry him just for my fine silver coffeepot and those spoons there is my splendid silk mantilla with fringe half as long as your arm too oh i have treasures enough she shook her head mournfully it is a mistake for a wife to lay up pretty things since they are merely temptations to other women alaire tried to reason her out of this mood why should any one molest us who could wish us harm she asked ha did you see that general he was like a drunken man in your presence it was as if he had laid eyes upon the shining madonna i could hear his heart beating nonsense in the first place i am an old married woman dolores sniffed vaya old indeed what does he care for a husband he only cares that you have long bright hair redder than rust and eyes like blue flowers and a skin like milk an angel could not be so beautiful ah dolores you flatterer seriously though dont you realize that we are americans and people of position an injury to us would bring terrible consequences upon general longorios head that is why he sent his soldiers with us all the same dolores maintained stubbornly i wish i had brought that shawl and that silver coffeepot with me the homeward journey was a repetition of the journey out there were the same idle crowds the same displays of filthy viands at the stoppingplaces the same heat and dust and delays longorios lieutenant hovered near and jose as before was newsgatherer hour after hour they crept toward the border until at last they were again laid out on a siding for an indefinite wait the occasion for this was made plain when an engine drawing a single caboose appeared even before it had come to a pause a tall figure in spotless uniform leaped to the ground and strode to the waiting coaches it was luis longorio he waved a signal to the conductor then swung aboard the northbound train the general was all smiles as he came down the and bowed low over alaires hand dolores gasped and stiffened in her seat like a woman of stone god be praised you are safe and well said the newcomer i have blamed myself for allowing you to take this abominable journey i have been in torment lest something befall you every night i have prayed that you might be spared all harm when i received word that you were coming i made all speed to meet you dolores and i are greatly in your debt alaire told him but you stayed so long there was more work than i thought general you have ruined me longorio was pained his face became ineffably sad please i beg of you he entreated i have arranged for reparation of that miserable mistake you shall see what i have done with your own eyes you shall read the furious correspondence i have carried on with the minister together you and i shall manage a settlement and you will find that i am a friend indeed i hope so have i not proved it am i not ready to give you my life the general queried earnestly fix the damages at your own figure and i shall see that you receive justice if the government will not pay i will i have means i am not a poor man all i possess would be too little to buy your happiness you embarrass me im afraid you dont realize what you say alaire remained cool under the mans protestations i have lost more than a thousand head of cattle we shall say two three thousand and the government will pay longorio asserted brazenly i will vouch for your figures and no one will question them for i am a man of honor no all i want it is done let us say no more about the affair senora i have thought of you every hour the duties that held me in nuevo pueblo were like irksome chains i was in madness i would have flown to la feria but i could not my husband will thank you for your great courtesy to me alaire managed to say but the mention of husbands was not agreeable to one of longorios sensitiveness and his face betrayed a hint of impatience yes yes he agreed carelessly senor austin and i must know each other better and become friends that is hardly possible at present when the war is over bah this war is nothing i go where i please you would be surprised to greet me at las palmas some day soon eh when you tell your husband what a friend i am he would be glad to see me would he not why of course but surely you wouldnt dare and why not las palmas is close to the river and my troops are in romero directly opposite mexico is not at war with your country and when i am in citizens clothes i am merely an ordinary person i have made inquiries and they tell me las palmas is beautiful heavenly and that you are the one who transformed it i believe them you have the power to transform all things even a mans heart and soul no wonder you are called the lone star but wait you will see how constantly i think of you longorio drew from his pocket several photographs of the austin ranchhouse where did you get those alaire asked in astonishment ah my secret see they are badly worn already for i keep them next my bosom we entertain very few guests at las palmas she murmured uncomfortably i know i know a great deal it would scarcely be safe for you to call the country is full of candeleristas cattle said the officer with a careless shrug did not that great poet byron swim an ocean to see a lovely lady well i too am a poet i have beautiful fancies songs of love run through my mind those englishmen know nothing of passion your american men are cold only a mexican can love we have fire in our veins senora to these perfervid protestations dolores listened with growing fright her eyes were wide and they were fixed hypnotically upon the speaker she presented much the appearance of a rabbit charmed by a serpent but to longorio she did not exist she was a chattel a servant and therefore devoid of soul or intelligence or use beyond that of serving her mistress thinking to put an end to these blandishments alaire undertook to return the generals ring with the pretense that she considered it no more than a talisman loaned her for the time being but it was a task to make longorio accept it he was shocked offended hurt he declared the ring to be of no value it was no more than a trifling evidence of his esteem but alaire was firm your customs are different to ours she told him an american woman is not permitted to accept valuable presents and this would cause disagreeable comment at such a thought the generals finest sensibilities were wounded but nothing it seemed could permanently dampen his ardor and he soon proceeded to press his attentions with even more vehemence than before he had brought alaire candies of american manufacture mexican sweetmeats of the finest variety a beautiful silken shawl and at midday the grizzled teniente came with a basket of lunch containing dainties and fruits and vacuum bottles with hot and cold drinks when invited to share the contents the general was plainly overjoyed but he was so enthralled by his companions beauty that he could eat but little it was a most embarrassing situation longorio kept alaire for ever upon the defensive and it sorely taxed her ingenuity to hold the conversation in safe channels as the journey proceeded it transpired that the man had made use of his opportunities to learn everything about her even to her life with ed his information was extensive and his deductions almost uncanny in their correctness he told her about austins support of the rebel cause and her own daily doings at las palmas he intimated that her unhappiness was almost more than he could bear this intimate knowledge and sympathy he seemed to regard as a bond that somehow united them he was no longer a new acquaintance but a close and loyal friend whose regard was deathless undoubtedly the man had a way with him he impressed people and his magnetism was potent moreover he knew the knack of holding what ground he gained it was an odd unreal ride through the blazing heat of the long afternoon longorio cast off all pretense and openly laid siege to the redhaired womans heart all without offering her the smallest chance to rebuff him the slightest ground for open resentment so respectful and guarded were his advances but he was forceful in his way and the very intensity of his desires made him incapable of discouragement so the duel progressed alaire cool and unyielding he warm persistent and tireless he wove about her an influence as difficult to combat as the smothering folds of some flocculent robe or the strands of an invisible web and no spider was ever more industrious when the train arrived at its destination his victim was wellnigh exhausted from the struggle he helped her into a coach with the gentlest and gravest courtesy and not until the vehicle rolled away did alaire dare to relax through her fatigue she could still hear his soft farewell until the morrow and realized that she had committed herself to his further assistance his palms against hers had been warm his adoring eyes had caressed her but she did not care all she wished now was to reach her hotel and then her bed after a good nights rest however alaire was able to smile at yesterdays adventure longorio did not bulk so large now even these few hours had greatly diminished his importance so that he appeared merely as an impulsive foreigner who had allowed a woman to turn his head alaire knew with what admiration even a moderately attractive american woman is greeted in mexico and she had no idea that this fellow had experienced anything more than a fleeting infatuation now that she had plainly shown her distaste for his outlaw emotions and convinced him that they awoke in her no faintest response she was confident that his frenzy would run its brief course and die meanwhile it was not contrary to the standards of feminine ethics to take advantage of the impression she had made upon him and with his help push through a fair financial settlement of her loss once back across the river however she discovered that there were obstacles to a prompt adjustment of her claim the red tape of her own government was as nothing to that of mexico there were a thousand formalities a myriad of maddening details to be observed and they called for the services of an advocate a notary a jefe politico a jefe de armas officials without end all of these worthies were patient and polite but they displayed a malarial indifference to delay and responsibility seemed to rest nowhere during the day alaire became bewildered almost lost in the mazes of official procedure and was half minded to telegraph for judge ellsworth but that again meant delay and she was beginning to long for home longorio by no means shared her disappointment on the contrary he assured her they were making splendid progress and he was delighted with her grasp of detail and her knowledge of business essentials at his word all nuevo pueblo bowed and scraped to her she was treated with impressive formality and even the military guards at the various headquarters presented arms when she passed the generals official business waited upon alaires convenience and to spare her the necessity of the short ride back to american soil he arranged for her an elaborate luncheon in his quarters as on the day before he assumed the privileges of a close friend and treated his guest as a sort of fellowconspirator working hand in hand with him for some holy cause xiii dave law becomes jealous you can never know what these two days have been for me the general said as he and alaire lingered over their meal they will afford me something to think about all my life it is a delicious comfort to know that you trust me that you do not dislike me and you do not dislike me eh why of course not i have a great deal for which to thank you general longorio fingered his wineglass and stared into it i am not like other men would to god i were for then i could close my eyes and forget you have your great tragedy it is old to you but mine dear lady is just beginning i can look forward to nothing except unhappiness he sighed deeply im sorry you are unhappy alaire parried surely you have every pleasant prospect it would seem so i am young rich a hero i serve my country in glorious fashion but what is all that if there is no pretty one to care even the meanest peon has his woman his hearts treasure i would give all i have i would forego my hope of heaven and doom myself to eternal tortures for one smile from a pair of sweet lips one look of love i am a man of iron yes an invincible soldier and yet i have a heart and a woman could rule me you say you have a heart alaire studied her visavis curiously as he met her eyes with his mournful gaze how is it that i hear such strange stories about you general what stories stories too terrible to mention i wonder if they can be true lies all of them longorio asserted for instance they tell me that you shoot your prisoners of course then at her shocked exclamation he explained it is a necessity of war listen senora we have twelve million indians in mexico and a few selfish men who incite them to revolt everywhere there is intrigue and nowhere is there honor to war against the government is treason and treason is punishable by death to permit the lower classes to rise would result in chaos black anarchy indescribable outrages against life and property there is but one way to pacify such people exterminate them mexico is a civilized nation there is no greater in the world but she must be ruled with an iron hand soldiers make rulers i am still a young man and at present there is but one other capable of this gigantic task for the time being therefore i permit myself to serve under him and i salute him viva potosi the speaker lifted his glass and drank madero was a wicked believer in spells and charms he talked with the dead he and those who came after him fired the peons to revolt and despoiled our country leaving her prone and bleeding we of the cientificos have set ourselves to stop her wounds and to nourish her to life again we shall drive all traitors into the sea and feed them to the sharks we shall destroy them all and mexico shall have peace but i am not a bloodthirsty man no i am a poet and a lover at heart as great a patriot as i am i could be faithless to my country for one smile from the woman i adore alaire did not color under the ardent glance that went with this declaration she deliberately changed the subject this morning while we were in the office of the jeje de armas she said i saw a poor woman with a baby she was scarcely more than a child herself whose husband is in prison she told me how she had come all the way from the country and is living with friends just to be near him every day she goes to the carcel but is denied admission and every day she comes to plead with the jefe de armas for her husbands life but he will not see her and the soldiers only laugh at her tears a common story these women and their babies are very annoying observed the general she says that her husband is to be shot very likely our prisons are full doubtless he is a bad man cant you do something eh longorio lifted his brows in the frankest inquiry that poor girl with her little bare browneyed baby was pitiful alaire leaned forward with an earnest appeal in her face and her host smiled so that is how it is eh what is her name inez garcia the husbands name is juan of course these peladors are all juans you would like to appear as an angel of mercy eh your heart is touched deeply bastante there is no more to be said longorio rose and went into the next room where were certain members of his staff after a time he returned with a paper in his hand and this he laid before alaire it was an order for the release of juan garcia the salvo conducto which will permit juan and his inez and their juanito to return to their farm is being made out he explained are you satisfied alaire looked up wonderingly i am deeply grateful you overwhelm me you are a strange man dear lady i live to serve you your wish is my law how can i prove it further as he stood beside her chair the fervor of his gaze caused her eyes to droop and a faint color to come into her cheeks she felt a sudden sense of insecurity for the man was trembling the evident desire to touch her to seize her in his arms was actually shaking him like an ague what next would he do of what wild extravagance was he not capable he was a queer mixture of fire and ice of sensuality and selfrestraint she knew him to be utterly lawless in most things and yet toward her he had shown scrupulous restraint what possibilities were in a man of his electric temperament who had the strength to throttle his fiercest longings the strained throbbing silence that followed longorios last words did more to frighten the woman than had his most ardent advances after a time he lifted alaires hand she felt his lips hot and damp upon her flesh then he turned and went away with the document when he reappeared he was smiling these garcias shall know who interceded for them you shall have their thanks said he no no it is enough that the man is free how now the general was puzzled what satisfaction can there be in a good deed unless one receives public credit and thanks for it i am not like that he would have lingered indefinitely over the table but alaire soon rose to go explaining i must finish my disagreeable task now so that i can go home tomorrow tomorrow her host cried in dismay no no you must wait my husband is expecting me this statement was a blow it seemed to crush longorio who could only look his keen distress as they stepped out into the street alaire was afforded that treat which longorio had so thoughtfully arranged for her there in the gutter stood inez garcia with her baby in her arms and beside her the ragged figure of a young man evidently her juan the fellow was emaciated his face was gaunt and worn and frightened his feet were bare even of sandals the huge peaked straw hat which he clutched over his breast was tattered and yet in his eye there was a light they had waited patiently these garcias heedful of longorios orders and now they burst into a torrent of thanks they flung themselves to their knees and kissed the edge of alaires dress their instructions had been plain and they followed them to the letter yet their gratitude was none the less genuine for being studied the little mothers hysteria for instance could not have been entirely assumed and certainly no amount of rehearsals could have taught the child to join his cries so effectively to his parents between them all they made such a racket as to summon a crowd and dolores who had also awaited her mistress was so deeply stirred that she wept with them general longorio enjoyed this scene tremendously and his beaming eyes expressed the hope that alaire was fully satisfied with the moment but the garcias having been thoroughly coached insisted upon rendering full measure of thanks and there seemed to be no way of shutting them off until the general ordered them to their feet that is enough he declared hombre you are free so go about your business and fight no more with those accursed rebels juan of course was ready at this moment to fight for any one he was told to fight for particularly longorio himself and he so declared his life was at the service of the benefactor who had spared him his wife and baby lived only to bless the illustrious general they look very poor said alaire and opened her purse but longorio would not permit her to give extracting a large roll of paper money from his own pocket he tossed it without counting to juan and then when the onlookers applauded he loudly called to one of his officers saying oiga give these good friends of mine two horses and see that they are well cared for now juan he addressed the dazed countryman i have one order for you every night of your life you and your pretty wife must say a prayer for the safety and happiness of this beautiful lady who has induced me to spare you do you promise we promise eagerly cried the pair good see that you keep your word on the day that you forget for the first time luis longorio will come to see you and then what he scowled at them fiercely we will not forget the garcias chorused there was a murmur from the onlookers some one cried viva longorio the general bowed smilingly then taking alaires arm he waved the idlers out of his path with a magnificent gesture when later in the day mrs austin came to say goodby and thank the mexican for his courtesies he humbly begged permission to pay his respects that evening at her hotel and she could not refuse as the coach went bouncing across the international bridge dolores said spitefully it will take more than the pardon of poor juan garcia to unlock heaven for that bandit he is the wickedest man i ever met yes probably the wickedest man in the world he has been kind to us bah he has a motive do you notice the way he looks at you it is enough to damn him for all eternity upon her arrival at the hotel alaire received an agreeable surprise for as her vehicle paused at the curb david law stepped forward hat in hand what bloodthirsty business brings you to pueblo she queried when they had exchanged greetings law smiled at her i came to offer free board and lodging to a poor greaser but he aint here and you maam alaire briefly outlined the reasons that had taken her to la feria and the duties that had kept her busy since her return while dave nodded his understanding when however he learned that she was counting upon general luis longorios aid in securing justice his expression altered he regarded her with some curiosity as he inquired isnt longorio the very man who robbed you yes and now he offers to square himself precisely you dont seem to put much faith in him mexicans are peculiar people law said slowly at least we consider them peculiar probably because they are different to us anyhow we dont understand their business methods or their habits of mind even their laughter and their tears are different to ours but from my experience with them i wouldnt put much confidence in this longorios word i say this and im supposed to have a little mexican blood in me during this brief conversation they had entered the hotel and now the lobby idlers took quick cognizance of mrs austins presence the lanky booted ranger excited no comment for men of his type were common here but alaire was the heroine of many stories and the object of a widespread curiosity therefore she received open stares and heard low whisperings naturally resenting this attention she gave her hand to law more quickly than she would have done otherwise i hope we shall see each other again she murmured thats moren likely im located in your neighborhood now he informed her im leaving for jonesville in the morning by train nom im goin to follow the river road if i can get an automobile mindful of the rangers courtesy to her on their previous meeting alaire said wont you go with us we intend to start early id love to maam but ill have to make a few inquiries along the line good it is a large car and she smiled at him if we have tire trouble i may need your help jose my man is a splendid horsebreaker but he seems to think a tire tool is some sort of a fancy brandingiron his mechanical knowledge is limited to a bridlebit and a cinch and im almost certain he believes there is something ungodly about horseless wagons dave was nearly speechless with delight and when the mistress of las palmas had gone upstairs he felt inclined to pinch himself to see if he were dreaming he had pursued a fruitless quest during the past few days and his resentment had grown as he became certain that tad lewis had sent him on a wildgoose chase but the sight of alaire miraculously restored his good spirits and the prospect of a long intimate ride in her company changed the whole trend of his thoughts his disappointment at not seeing her upon his visit to las palmas had only served to enhance his memories of their first meeting and time now had deepened his interest tenfold yes she was the lone star the estrella brillante of his empty sky when the supperhour came he managed by carefully watching the diningroom to time his meal with mrs austins he even ventured to hope that they might share the same table but in this he was disappointed however from where he sat he could see her profile and worship her to his hearts content and when she favored him with a smile and a nod he was happy all without his knowledge dave realized this woman had secured an amazing hold over him he had thought a great deal about her of course but his thoughts had been idle and it had required this second encounter to make him know the truth now however there could be no doubt about his feelings he was more than romantically interested the mere sight of her had electrified him the discovery distressed him and he very properly decided that the affair should end here since it could lead to nothing except disappointment but who can govern a wayward fancy one moment law promised himself to see no more of this married woman the next he wondered how she would occupy the evening and ventured to hope that he might have a chance to talk with her after supper however she was nowhere to be found when his first chagrin had passed he decided that this was exactly as it should be he didnt like to see women make themselves conspicuous in hotels at the time of this story relations between the united states and the established government of mexico were at such high tension that a hostility had sprung up between the troops fronting each other along the rio grande and in consequence their officers no longer crossed the boundary even when off duty it created a flurry of suppressed excitement therefore when luis longorio the autocrat of the potosista forces boldly crossed the bridge traversed the streets of pueblo and entered the hamilton hotel from his seat in the lobby law heard the general inquire for mrs austin and then saw him ascend in the direction of the parlor what the devil could longorio want with the lone star at such an hour the ranger asked himself why should he presume to call upon her unless he was interested mexican officers in these parlous times were not given to social courtesies and longorios reputation was sufficiently notorious to render his attentions a cause for gossip under any circumstances dave rose and strolled restlessly about the hotel a halfhour passed and longorio did not reappear an hour dragged by and then dave took occasion to go to his room a glance through the open parlor door showed the foreigner in closest conversation with mrs austin they were laughing they were alone even dolores was nowhere to be seen when dave returned to his big rockingchair he found it uncomfortable he watched the clock anxiously he chewed several cigars viciously before realizing that he was jealous yes madly unreasonably jealous so his divinity was not as unapproachable as he had imagined doubtless longorio was mad over her which explained the fellows willingness to help her exact reparation from his government fine doings for a respectable married woman it was wrong scandalous detestable after a time dave rose impatiently what had come over him anyhow he must be crazy to torture himself in this fashion what went on upstairs certainly was none of his business and he had better far amuse himself in accordance with this excellent reasoning he went to a pictureshow but he could not become interested the flat images on the screen failed to divert him and the only faces he saw were those of luis longorio and the lone mistress of las palmas had dave only known the truth he would have gained a grim comfort from it for alaire austin was not enjoying herself this evening her caller stayed on interminably and she became restive under the flow of his conversation for some reason or other longorio was not the romantic figure he had been in his citizens clothes he was only a dandified mexican gallant like any number of others the color was gone from the picture this quixotic guerrilla hero this elegant ruy blas was nothing more than a tall oliveskinned foreigner whose ardor was distasteful longorio was tiresome xiv jose sanchez swears an oath on this same evening a scene of no little significance was taking place at las palmas ed austin was entertaining callers and these were none other than tad lewis and adolfo urbina the progress of events during the last few days had shaped this conference for as dave had forecast during his conversation with judge ellsworth the local prosecuting attorney saw in the guzman cattle case an opportunity to distinguish himself and was taking action accordingly he had gathered considerable evidence against urbina and was exerting himself to the utmost for an indictment he had openly declared that the testimony of ricardo guzman and his other witnesses would convict the suspect and the fact that his politics were opposed to ed austins complicated matters still further it was the unwelcome news of all this which had brought tad lewis and his mexican helper to las palmas under cover of darkness having gone over the circumstances in detail lewis concluded were depending on you ed you got to stand pat but austin was lukewarm he had experienced a change of heart and the cause appeared when he read aloud a letter that day received from judge ellsworth in which the judge told of his meeting with dave law and the rangers reasons for doubting eds word ive got to take water young ed told his visitors or ill get myself into trouble then querulously he demanded of adolfo why in hell did you come here anyhow why didnt you keep to the chaparral adolfo shrugged i thought you were my friend sure tad agreed urbinas been a friend to you now you got to stick to him we got to hang together all of us my evidence wouldnt carry no weight but there aint a jury in south texas that would question yours adolfo done the right thing i dont see it ed declared petulantly whats the use of getting me into trouble theres the river they cant follow you across but urbina shook his head you know he cant cross tad explained his people would shoot him if he ever went to mexico well hell be caught if he stays here you darent send that damned ranger on another blind trail if adolfo cant go south hell have to go north not on your life affirmed lewis if he runs itll prove his guilt and look bad for me im the one theyre after and i dont stand any too good as you know you got to go through with this ed i wont do it austin asserted stubbornly i wont be dragged into the thing youve no business rustling stock anyhow you dont have to urbina exhaled a lungful of cigarette smoke and inquired you wont help me eh no i wont very well if i go to prison you shall go too i shall tell all i know and we shall be companions you and i austins temper rose at the threat bah he cried contemptuously theres nothing against me except running arms and the embargo is off now its a joke anyhow nobody was ever convicted even when the embargo was in effect why the government winks at anybody who helps the rebels oh that is nothing urbina agreed but you would not wish to be called a cattle thief eh what dyou mean you knew that the stealing went on huh i should say i did havent i lost a lot of horses lewis interposed impatiently say suppose adolfo tells what he knows about them horses suppose he tells how you framed it to have your own stock run across on shares sos you could get more money to go hifalutin around san antone without your wife knowing it i reckon you wouldnt care to have that get out you cant prove it growled young ed oh i reckon it can be proved all right confidently asserted lewis nobodyd believe such a thing folks are ready to believe most anything about you your wife would believe it aint las palmas in her name and dont she give you so much a month to spend if them aint facts you lied to me yes urbina supplemented i can swear to all that and i can swear also that you knew about those calves the other day what ed started why not we were together your own people saw us well then if you would steal your wifes horses why would you not steal your neighbors cattle the relatives of poor pino garza god rest his soul will bear me out i have arranged for that suppose i tell the jury that there were three of us in that pasture of yours instead of two what then i would be lonely in prison without a good compadre to bear me company urbina grinned in evil triumph this is the damnedest outrage i ever heard of gasped young ed its a fairy story prove it chuckled lewis the prosecuting attorneyd eat it up ed it sounds kind of crazy but you cant ask adolfo to take to the brush and live like a javelin just for your sake when you could square him with a word there was a moment or two of silence during which the visitors watched the face of the man whose weakness they both knew at last ed austin ventured to say apologetically im willing to do almost anything to help adolfo but theyll make a liar of me if i take the stand isnt there some other way out i dont know of any said lewis moneyll square anything ed urged hopefully whereupon urbina waved his cigarette and nodded this ricardo guzman is the cause of it all he is a bad man no doubt of that lewis agreed hes got more enemies than i have if he was out of the way there wouldnt be nothin to this case and the countryd be a heap better off too what about that other witness ed queried if ricardo were gone if something should happen to him urbinas wicked face darkened there would be no other witness i would see to that the color receded from ed austins purple cheeks and he rose abruptly this is getting too strong for me he cried i wont listen to this sort of talk i wont be implicated in any such doings nobodys goin to implicate you tad told him adolfo wants to keep you out of trouble theres plenty of people on both sides of the river that dont like guzman any bettern we do me an adolfo was talkin it over on the way up well you can talk it over some more but im going for a drink ed declared and left the room nervously mopping his face he knew only too well the character of his two visitors he had learned much about tad lewis during the past few months and as for the mexican he thought the fellow capable of any crime at this moment ed bitterly regretted his acquaintance with these neighbors for both men knew more about his affairs than he cared to have made public he was angry and resentful at tad for taking sides against him and more than a little fearful of adolfos enmity if he refused assistance the owner of las palmas still retained a shred of selfrespect a remnant of pride in his name he did not consider himself a bad man he was determined now to escape from this situation without loss of credit no matter what the price if escape were possible and he vowed earnestly to himself that hereafter he would take ample pains never to become similarly involved austin remained out of the room for some time when he returned his visitors appeared to have reached some determination i reckon we can fix things if youll help lewis announced and thats just what i wont do ed impatiently declared do you think im going to be tangled up in a murder ive got nothing against don ricardo who said anything about murder things aint like they was when your father owned las palmas he done his share of killin but nowadays theres too dam much law layin around loose all youve got to do is give me about a thousand dollars what for ed asked suspiciously sos we can handle ourselves its up to you to do something aint it austin demurred i havent that much that i can lay hands on he said sullenly im broke and anyhow i dont see what good itll do you better dig it up somehow just for your own sake the two men eyed each other for a moment then austin mumbled something about his willingness to try and left the room for a second time the money which alaire kept on hand for current expenses was locked in her safe but he knew the combination it was with an air of resignation with a childish halfhearted protest that he counted out the desired amount into lewiss hand salving his conscience with the statement im doing this to help adolfo out of his trouble understand i hope itll enable you to square things maybe it will and maybe it wont sneered lewis anyhow i aint scared of tryin i got the guts to make a battle even if you havent ed austin was greatly relieved when his unwelcome callers rode away as he composed himself for sleep an hour later he refrained from analyzing too deeply the motives behind this forced loan and refused to speculate too long upon the purpose to which it might be put the whole occurrence was unfortunate ed austin sincerely hoped he had heard the last of it jose sanchez made use of the delay at pueblo to institute further inquiries regarding his missing cousin but nowhere could he find the slightest trace panfilo had set out to ride to this point and thence to la feria but the last seen of him had been at the waterhole one days ride from the home ranch at that point the earth had opened and swallowed him if he were alive why had he not written to his sweetheart rosa jose swore an oath that he would learn the truth if it required his whole lifetime and if it should turn out that his sainted relative had indeed met with foul play well jose told his friends they could judge by looking at him the sort of man he was he proudly displayed longorios revolver and called it his cousins little avenger the weapon had slain many it had a duty still to perform so he said jose intended to confide his purpose to mrs austin but when it came time to start for las palmas there was a fourth passenger in the automobile and he was obliged to hold his tongue for the moment a motor trip along the lower rio grande would prove a novel and not altogether agreeable experience to the average automobilist for there are few improved roads and the rest offer many difficulties not the least of which are frequent fords some deep some shallow so it was that alaire considered it necessary to make an early start in spite of the unhealthy fancies that dave law had taken to bed with him he arose this morning in fine spirits and with a determination to put in a happy day alaire too was in good humor and expressed her relief at escaping from everything mexican i havent seen a newspaper for ages and i dont know what is going on at jonesville or anywhere else she confided dave told her of the latest developments in the mexican situation the slow but certain increase of tension between the two governments and then of home happenings when she asked him about his own doings he informed her of the affair which had brought him to pueblo of course all three of his companions were breathlessly interested in the story of pino garzas death dolores and jose did not allow a word to escape them so they cut our fence and ran the calves into our pasture to brand alaire said its time somebody like you came to jonesville mr law caramba it required bravery to ride alone into that rincon jose declared i knew pino garza well and he could shoot like the devil you said your horse saved your life mrs austin went on how do you mean when dave had explained she cried quickly you werent riding bessie belle yes shes buried where she dropped ohh alaires exclamation was eloquent of pity and law smiled crookedly ive been right lonesome since she went away most every day i find myself stealing sugar for her the way i used to do see he fumbled in the pocket of his coat and produced some broken lumps probably you dont understand how a man gets to love his horse now we used to talk to each other just like two people of course i did most of the talking but she understood why maam ive awakened in the night to find her standing over me and my cheek wet where shed kissed it shed leave the nicest grass just to come and visit with me alaire turned a quick glance upon the speaker to find his face set and his eyes miserable impulsively she laid her hand upon his arm saying i know how you must feel do you know what has always been my dearest wish to be able to talk with animals and to have them trust me just think what fun it would be to talk with the wild things and make friends of them oh when i was a little girl i used to dream about it law nodded his vigorous appreciation of such a desire dogs and horses sabe more than we give them credit for ive learned a few bird words too you remember those quail at the waterhole oh yes dave smiled absentmindedly theres a wonderful book about birds one of the keenest satires ever written i reckon its about a nearsighted old frenchman who was cast away on a penguin island he saw the big birds walking around and thought they were human beings how did you happen to read anatole france alaire asked with a sharp stare of surprise the ranger stirred but he did not meet her eyes well said he i read most anything i can get a feller meets up with strange books just like he meets up with strange people not books like that there was a brief silence mr law every now and then you say something that makes me think youre a rank impostor pshaw said he i know cowboys that read twice as good as i do you went to school in the east didnt you yesm where the man hesitated at which she insisted where dave reluctantly turned upon her a pair of eyes in the depths of which there lurked the faintest twinkle cornell said he alaire gasped after a while she remarked stiffly you have a peculiar sense of humor now dont be offended he begged of her im a good deal like a chameleon i unconsciously change my color to suit my surroundings when we first met i saw that you took me for one thing and since then ive tried not to show you your mistake why did you let me send you those silly books now that you have begun to tell the truth keep it up how many of them had you read well i hadnt read any of them lately how disagreeable of you to put it that way the car leaped forward as if spurred by alaires mortification i wondered how you knew about the french revolution that bastilly was some calaboose wasnt it she quoted his own words scornfully i dare say youve had a fine laugh at my expense no gravely denied the man they had come to an arroyo containing a considerable stream of muddy water and law was forced to get out to plug the carburetor and stop the oilintakes to the crankcase this done alaire ran the machine through on the selfstarter when joses carambas and doloress shrieks had subsided and they were again under way mrs austin it seemed had regained her good humor you will receive no more of my favorite authors she told dave spitefully ill keep them to read myself you like knights and chivalry and such things dont you chivalry yes in the days when i believed in it i used to cry over those romances dont you still believe in chivalry alaire turned her eyes upon the questioner and there were no girlish illusions in them do you she queried with a faint curl of her lip why yes she shook her head men have changed nowadays they are all selfish and sordid but i shouldnt generalize for im a notorious manhater you know it seems to me that women are just as selfish as men perhaps more so in all but little things our definitions of little things may differ what do you call a big thing love thats the biggest thing in the world law responded promptly it seems to be so considered so you think women are selfish in love he nodded whereupon she eyed him speculatively let us see you are a man how far would you go for the woman you loved the limit mrs austin frowned at this lightseeming answer i suppose you mean that you would make any sacrifice yes thats it would you give up the woman herself if you considered it your duty no there couldnt be any duty higher than love to my way of thinking but you shouldnt take me as a specimen im not a good representative of my sex i think you are a very good one alaire said quietly and dave realized that no flattery was intended although he was willing to talk further on this subject mrs austin gave him no opportunity of airing his views love it appeared was a thing she did not care to discuss with him on their footing of semiintimacy despite the rough roads they made fair time and the miles of cactus and scrawny brush rolled swiftly past occasionally a lazy jackrabbit ambled out of his roadside covert and watched them from a safe distance now and then a spotted roadrunner raced along the dusty ruts ahead of them the morning sun swung higher and by midday the metal of the automobile had become as hot as a fryingpan they stopped at various goatranches to inquire about adolfo urbina and at noon halted beside a watercourse for lunch dave was refilling the radiator when he overheard jose in conversation with mrs austin nowhere a trace the horsebreaker was saying no one has seen him poor rosa morales will die of a broken heart alaire explained to her guest jose is worried about his cousin panfilo it seems he has disappeared so you are panfilos cousin dave eyed the mexican with new interest si you remember the man alaire went on he was with that fellow you arrested at the waterhole oh yes i remember him with steady fingers dave shook some tobacco into a cigarettepaper he felt alaires eyes upon him and they were eloquent of inquiry but he did not meet them jose frowned no one at la feria has seen him and in pueblo there was not a word it is strange panfilo was in bad company when i saw him law finished rolling his cigarette and lit it still conscious of alaires questioning gaze he may have had trouble he was a good man the horsebreaker asserted if he is dead the mexicans frown deepened to a scowl what then jose significantly patted the gift revolver at his hip this little fellow will have something to say dave looked him over idly from head to heel then murmured you would do well to go slow compadre panfilo made his own quarrels we were like brothers and i do not know of any quarrels but i shall find out it begins to look bad for somebody after he left that charco there is nothing where did he go whom did he encounter rosa will ask me those questions i am not given to boasting senor but i am a devilish bad man in my way xv the truth about panfilo nothing more was said during the luncheon but when alaire had finished eating and her two employees had begun their meal she climbed the bank of the arroyo ostensibly to find a cool spot having succeeded she called to dave there is a nice breeze up here the rangers face set rising slowly he climbed the bank after her when they stood face to face in the shade of a gnarly oaktree alaire asked him pointblank where is panfilo sanchez dave met her eyes squarely his own were cold and hard hes where he dropped at my second shot said he he could hear his companions sharp inhalation he did not flinch at the look she turned upon him then you killed him yesm god he was practically unarmed what do you call such an act daves lips slowly whitened his face became stony he closed his eyes then opened them upon hers he had it coming he stole my horse he took a chance mrs austin turned away for a time they were silent and dave felt himself pitilessly condemned why didnt you tell me at the time she asked why didnt you report it ill report it when you give me permission i what she wheeled to face him think a moment i cant tell half the truth and if i tell everything it will lead to gossip ah i think i understand mr law you can be insulting for the first time the man lost muscular control of his features they twitched and under their tan his cheeks became a sickly yellow youve no right to say that he told her harshly youve plumb overstepped yourself maam and i reckon youve formed quite a wrong opinion of me and of the facts let me tell you something about that killing and about myself so youll have it all straight before you bring in your verdict you say panfilo was unarmed and you call it murder he had his sixshooter and he used it he had the darkness and the swiftest horse too he intended to ambush me and release his companion but i forced his hand so it aint what id call murder now about myself panfilo isnt the first man ive killed and he may not be the last but i havent lost any sleep over it and id have killed him just as quick if i hadnt been an officer thats the kind of man i am and you may as well know it i you are utterly ruthless yesm you left him there without burial law shrugged impatiently whats the difference hes there to stay and hes just as dead under the stars as hed be under the sand id rather lie facing the sky than the grass roots but you must have known it would get out sometime this puts both of us in a very bad light i know but i stood on my cards id have preferred to report it but id keep still again under the same circumstances you seem to consider that an insult if it is i dont know how to compliment you maam alaire pondered this statement briefly before saying you have a strange way of looking at the affair a strange careless unnatural way it seems to me perhaps thats the fault of my training im not what you would consider a nice person the death of panfilo sanchez means nothing whatever to me if you can grasp that fact youll see that your own reputation weighed heavier in my mind than the lives of a dozen mexicans or whites for that matter people know me for what i am and that may have had something to do with my decision i go anywhere everywhere no one has ever had the effrontery to question my actions alaire told him stiffly and i dont aim to give em a chance dave was stubborn there was another interval of silence you heard what jose said what are you going to do dave made a gesture of indifference it doesnt greatly matter ill tell him the truth perhaps such an attitude was incomprehensible to alaire and brought an impatient frown to her brow you dont seem to realize that he will try to revenge himself you might warn him against any such foolishness jose has some sense the woman looked up curiously dont you know how to be afraid havent you any fear she asked daves gray eyes were steady as he answered yesm im afraid this thing is going to spoil our friendship ive been desperately afraid all along that i might have hurt your reputation even now im afraid on your account to make public panfilo sanchezs death yesm i know what it is to be afraid i presume the law would hold you blameless she said thoughtfully if there was any doubt about that it would be another matter entirely a ranger can get away with a heap more than killing a mexican no its up to you to say what i shall do let me think it over jose mustnt know today thats certain im in your hands they returned to the automobile in silence but as they took their seats dave said youre tired maam wont you let me drive can you when he smiled his answer alaire was only too glad to give up the wheel for her nerves were indeed unsteady and she was grateful for an opportunity to think out the best course to pursue in this unexpected difficulty later as she listened to laws inconsequential talk with dolores and jose and watched the way he handled the car she marveled at his composure she wondered if this man could have a heart it became evident to dave as the afternoon progressed that they would be very late in arriving at las palmas for although he drove as rapidly as he dared over such roads the miles were long and the going heavy they were delayed too by a mishap that held them back for an hour or two and he began to fear that his hostess would feel in duty bound to insist upon his spending the night at her home to accept after his clash with ed austin was of course impossible and he dreaded another explanation at this particular crisis that a crisis in their relations had arisen he felt sure he had tried to make plain his attitude of mind toward the killing of panfilo sanchez and the wisdom of his course thereafter but he doubted if alaire understood the one or agreed with the other probably she considered him inhuman or what was worse cowardly in attempting to avoid the consequences of his act and yet he could not explain his full anxiety to protect her good name without confessing to a deeper interest in her than he dared and his interest was growing by leaps and bounds this woman fascinated him he was infatuated bewitched by her personality to be near her affected him mentally and physically in a way too extraordinary to analyze or to describe it was as if they were so sympathetically attuned that the mere sound of her voice set his whole being into vibrant response where all his life he had lain mute she played havoc with his resolutions too awaking in him the wildest envy and desire he no longer thought of her as unattainable on the contrary her husbands shortcomings seemed providential absurd impossible ways of winning her suggested themselves to risk a further estrangement therefore was intolerable but as if his thoughts were telepathic messages she did the very thing he feared we wont be in before midnight she said but ill send you to jonesville in the morning thank you maam ill have to go right through ill get you there in time for business weve gained a reputation for inhospitableness at las palmas that i want to overcome in spite of their recent clash in spite of the fact that this fellows ruthlessness and indifference to human life shocked her alaire was conscious of her obligation to him and aware also of a growing friendship between them which made the present situation all the more trying law was likable and he inspired her with a sense of security to which she had long been a stranger mr austin ought to know she added about this matter we were discussing and i want him to meet you he has dave said shortly and at his tone alaire looked up so she studied his grim face and you quarreled id really prefer to go on maam ill get to jonesville somehow you refuse to stay under his roof thats about it im sorry she did not ask for further explanation evening came bringing a grateful coolness and they drove through a tunnel of light walled in by swiftly moving shadows the windows of las palmas were black the house silent when they arrived at their journeys end dolores was fretful and her mistress ached in every bone when jose had helped his countrywoman into the house alaire said if you insist upon going through you must take the car you can return it tomorrow and about panfilo dave queried wait perhaps ill decide what is best to do in the mean time good night law took her extended hand alaire was glad that he did not fondle it in that detestable mexican fashion of which she had lately experienced so much glad that the grasp of his long strong fingers was merely firm and friendly when he stepped back into the car and drove off through the night she stood for some time looking after him blaze jones had insisted that dave live at his house and the ranger had accepted the invitation but as it was late when the latter arrived at jonesville he went to the hotel for a few hours rest when he drove his borrowed machine up to the jones house about breakfasttime both blaze and paloma were delighted to see him say now what you doing rolling around in a gasoline godevil the elder man inquired and law was forced to explain why mrs austin must have experienced a change of heart exclaimed paloma she never gave anybody a lift before blaze agreed shes sure poisonous to strangers then he looked over the car critically these automobiles are all right but whenever i want to go somewhere and get back i take a team of hayburners mules dont puncture the first automobile paloma had nearly scared me to death on the road to brownsville there used to be a person who didnt like me wed had a considerable unpleasantness in fact one day paloma and i were licketysplittin along past his place when we had a blowout it was the first one id ever heard and it fooled me complete comin right at that particular turn of the road i sure thought this party i spoke of had cut down on me so i rared up and unlimbered i shot out three windowlights in his house before paloma could explain if hed been in sight id have beefed him then and there and saved six months delay no gasbuggies are all right for people with strong nerves but im tuned too high father has never learned to drive a car without yelling gee and haw laughed paloma and he thinks he has title to the whole road too you know these mexicans are slow about pulling their wagons to one side well father got mad one day and when a team refused him the right of way he whipped out his revolver and fired blaze smiled broadly it worked great and believe me them greasers took to the ditch i went through like a hot wind but i shot up sixtyfive catridges between here and town why didnt mrs austin ask you to stay all night at las palmas the girl inquired of dave she did wonderful palomas surprise was evidently sincere i suppose you refused because of the way ed treated you well id have accepted just to spite him tell me is she nice shes lovely this vehement declaration brought a sudden gleam of interest into the questioners eyes they say she has the most wonderful gowns and jewels and dresses for dinner every night well paloma tossed her head im going to have some nice clothes too you wait now dont you start riggin yourself up for meals blaze said warningly first thing i know youll have me in a fulldress suit spillin soup on my shirt then to his guest he complained feelingly i dont know whats come over paloma lately this new dressmaker has plumb stampeded her somebodyd ought to run that feline out of town before she ruins me she is a very nice woman complacently declared the daughter but her father snorted loudly i wouldnt associate with such a critter my but youre proud it aint that blaze defended himself i know her husband and hes a bad hombre he backed me up against a waterintrough and told my fortune yesterday he said id be married twice and have many children he told me i was fond of music and a skilled performer on the organ but melancholy and subject to catarrh brights disease and ailments of the legs he said i loved widows and unless i was poisoned by a dark lady id live to be eighty years old why he run me over like a pet squirrel lookin for moles and if id had a gun on me id have busted him for some of the things he said a dark lady thats his wife i give you warnin paloma dont you ask her to stay for meals people like them are dangerous youre too silly said paloma nobody believes in such things they dont eh well hes got all of jonesville walkin around ladders and spittin through crossed fingers and countin the spots on their nails he interprets their dreams and locates lost articles maybe he can tell me where to find adolfo urbina dave suggested humph if he cant tad lewis can say dave this case of yours has stirred up a lot of feelin against tad the prosecutin attorney says hell sure cinch him and urbina both one of lewiss men got on a bender the other night and declared adolfo would never come to trial what did he mean it may have been mescal talk but witnesses sometimes have a way of disappearin i wouldnt put anything past that gang not long after breakfast don ricardo guzman appeared at the jones house and warmly greeted his two friends to dave he explained last night i came to town and this morning i heard you had returned so i rode out at once you were unsuccessful our man never went to pueblo exactly i thought as much hes probably safe across the river but ricardo thought otherwise no urbina deserted from this very colonel blanco who commands the forces at romero he would scarcely venture to return to federal territory however i go to meet blanco today and perhaps i shall discover something what takes you over there blaze inquired wait until i tell you senor david here brings me good fortune at every turn he honors my poor thirsty rancho with a visit and brings a glorious rain then he destroys my enemies like a thunderbolt no sooner is this done than i receive from the federals an offer for fifty of my best horses caramba such a price too they are in a great hurry which looks as if they expected an attack from the candeleristas at matamoras i hope so god grant these traitors are defeated anyhow the horses have gone and today i go to get my money in gold whos going with you asked law ricardo shrugged nobody there is no danger blaze shook his head they know you are a redhot rebel i wouldnt trust them they know also that i am an american like you gentlemen proudly asserted guzman that makes a difference i supported the liberator god rest his soul and i secretly assist those who fight his assassins but so does everybody else i am receiving a fine price for those horses so it is worth a little risk now senor he addressed himself to the ranger i have brought you a little present day and night my boys and i have worked upon it for we know the good heart you have it was finished yesterday see ricardo unwrapped a bundle he had fetched displaying a magnificent bridle of plaited horsehair it was cunningly wrought and lavishly decorated with silver fittings you recognize those hairs he queried they came from the mane and tail of your bonita bessie belle law accepted the handsome token then held out his hand to the mexican that was mighty fine of you ricardo i you couldnt have pleased me more you like it eagerly demanded the old man that is good i am repaid a thousandfold your sentiment is like a womans but see i am famous for this work and i have taught my boys to use their fingers too that mare will always guide you now wherever you go and we handled her gently for your sake dave nodded youre a good man ricardo were going to be friends guzmans delight was keen his grizzled face beamed and he showed his white teeth in a smile say no more what is mine is yours my house my cattle my right hand i and my sons will serve you and you must come often to see us now i must go he shook hands heartily and rode away waving his hat theres a good greaser blaze said with conviction and dave agreed feelingly yes id about go to hell for him after this then he took the bridle in for paloma to admire xvi the rodeo it was with a feeling of some reluctance that dave drove up to las palmas shortly after the lunch hour for he had no desire to meet young ed however to his relief austin did not appear and inasmuch as alaire did not refer to her husband in any way dave decided that he must be absent perhaps on one of his notorious sprees the mistress of the big ranch was in her harness having at once assumed her neglected duties she came to welcome her caller in a short khaki ridingsuit her feet were encased in tan boots she wore a mannish felt hat and gauntlet gloves showing that she had spent the morning in the saddle dave thought she looked exceedingly capable and businesslike and not less beautiful in these clothes he feasted his eyes covertly upon her i expected you for luncheon she smiled and dave could have kicked himself im just going out now if youre not in too great a hurry to go home you may go with me that would be fine he agreed come then i have a horse for you as she led the way back toward the farm buildings she explained im selling off a bunch of cattle benito is rounding them up and cutting out the best ones you keep them i reckon always thats how i improve the grade you will see a splendid herd of animals mr law the best in south texas i suppose youre interested in such things id rather watch a good herd of stock than the best show in new york he told her when they came to the corrals an intricate series of pens and chutes at the rear of the outbuildings law beheld two thoroughbred horses standing at the hitchingrail im proud of my horses too said alaire you have reason to be with his eyes alight dave examined the fine points of both animals he ran a caressing hand over them and they recognized in him a friend these beauties were raised on kentucky blue grass brother and sister arent they yes montrose and montrosa are their names the horse is mine the mare is yours seeing that dave did not comprehend the full import of her words she added yours to keep i mean you must make another bessie belle out of her mine oh maam law turned his eyes from alaire to the mare then back again youre too kind i cant take her you must dave made as if to say something but was too deeply embarrassed unable to tear himself away from the mares side he continued to stroke her shining coat while she turned an intelligent face to him showing a solitary white star in the center of her forehead see she is nearly the same color as bessie belle yesm i i want her maam im just sick from wanting her butwont you let me buy her oh i wouldnt sell her then as dave continued to yearn over the animal like a small boy tempted beyond his strength alaire laughed i owe you something mr law and a horse more or less means very little to me he yielded he could not possibly continue his resistance and in his happy face alaire took her reward the mare meanwhile was doubtfully nosing her new master deciding whether or not she liked him but when he offered her a cube of sugar her uncertainties disappeared and they became friends then and there he talked to her too in a way that would have won any female heart and it was plain to any one who knew horses that she began to consider him wholly delightful now montrosa was a sad coquette but this man seemed to say rosa you rogue if you try your airs with me i will outflirt you who could resist such a person why the touch of his hands was positively thrilling he was gentle but masterful and he had a delicious smell rosa felt that she understood him perfectly and was enraptured to discover that he understood her there was some satisfaction in knowing such a man you do speak their language alaire said after she had watched them for a few minutes you have bewitched the creature dave nodded silently and his face was young then half to herself the woman murmured yes you have a heart i beg pardon nothing im glad you like her do you mind if i call her something else than rosa just to myself why shes yours dont you like the name oh yes but see dave laid a finger upon montrosas forehead she wears a lone star and id like to call her that the lone star alaire smiled in tacit assent then when the two friends had completely established their intimacy she mounted her own horse and led the way to the roundup daves unbounded delight filled the mistress of las palmas with the keenest pleasure he laughed he hummed snatches of songs he kept up a chatter addressed as much to the mare as to his companion and under it montrosa romped like a tomboy it was gratifying to meet with such appreciation as this alaire felt warm and friendly to the whole world and decided that out of her abundance she must do more for other people of course dave had to tell of don ricardos thoughtful gift and concluded by saying i think this must be my birthday although it doesnt fit in with the calendar don ricardo has his enemies but he is a goodhearted old man yes dave agreed then more gravely im sorry i let him go across the river there was a pause if anybody harms him i reckon ill have a feud on my hands for im a grateful person i believe it i can see that you are loyal i was starved on sentiment when i was little but its in me bigger than a skinned ox they say gratitude is an elemental primitive emotion perhaps thats why it is so rare nowadays said alaire not more than half in jest you find it rare dave looked up keenly well you have certainly laid up a store of it today benito and his men had rounded up perhaps three thousand head of cattle when alaire and her companion appeared and they were in the process of cutting out assembled near a flowing well which gave life to a shallow pond the herd was held together by a halfdozen horsemen who rode its outskirts heading off and driving back the strays other men under benitos personal direction were isolating the best animals and sending them back to the pasture it was an animated scene one fitted to rouse enthusiasm in any plainsman for the stock was fat and healthy there were many calves and the incessant rumbling complaint of the herd was bloodstirring the las palmas cowboys rode like centaurs doubling dodging yelling and whirling their ropes like lashes the air was drumming to swift hoofbeats and over all was the hoarse unceasing undertone from countless bovine throats out near the grubwagon the remuda was grazing and thither at intervals came the perspiring horsemen to change their mounts benito wet dusty and tired rode up to his employer to report progress dios this is hot work for an old man we will never finish by dark said he whereupon law promptly volunteered his services lend me your rope benito till i get another caballo eh that montrosa is the best cutting horse on las palmas but dave shook his head vigorously i wouldnt risk her among those gopherholes he slid out of his seat and with an arm around the mares neck whispered into her ear we wont have any broken legs and broken hearts will we honey girl rosa answered by nosing the speaker over with brazen familiarity then when he had removed her equipment and turned away dragging her saddle she followed at his heels like a dog diablo he has a way with horses hasnt he benito grinned now that montrosa is wilder than a deer alaire rode into the herd with her foreman while dave settled his loop over a buckskin preparatory to joining the cowboys the giant herd milled and eddied revolving like a vast pool of deep swift water the bulls were quarrelsome the steers were stubborn and the wet cows were distracted motherless calves dodged about in bewilderment in and out of this confusion the cowboys rode following the animals selected for separation forcing them out with devious turnings and twistings and then running them madly in a series of breakneck crescent dashes over flats and hummocks through dust and brush until they had joined the smaller herd of choice animals which were to remain on the ranch it was swift sweaty exhausting work the kind these mexicans loved for it was not only spectacular but held an element of danger once he had secured a pony dave law made himself one of them alaire sat her horse in the heart of the crowding herd with a sea of rolling eyes lolling tongues and clashing horns all about her and watched the ranger good riding she was accustomed to the horses of las palmas were trained to this work as bird dogs are trained to theirs they knew how to follow a steer and as ed austin boasted turn on a dime with a nickel to spare but law it appeared was a born horseman and seemed to inspire his mount with an exceptional eagerness and intelligence in spite of the mans unusual size he rode like a feather he was grace and life and youth personified now he sat as erect in his saddle as a swaying reed again he stretched himself out like a whiplash once he had begun the work he would not stop all that afternoon the cowboys labored and toward sundown the depleted herd was driven to the water it moved thither in a restless thirsty mass it churned the shallow pond to milk and from a high knoll where alaire had taken her stand she looked down upon a vast undulating carpet many acres in extent formed by the backs of living creatures the voice of these cattle was like the bass rumble of the sea steady heavydroning ceaseless then through the cool twilight came the drive to the next pasture and here the patience of the cowboys was taxed to the utmost for as the stronger members of the herd forged ahead the wearied worried littlest members fell behind their joints were limber and their legs unsteady one and all were orphaned too for in that babel of sound no untrained ears could catch a mothers low a mile of this and the whole rear guard was composed of plaintive weteyed little calves who made slower and slower progress some of them were stubborn and risked all upon a spirited dash back toward the homes they were leaving and toward the mothers who would not answer it took hard sharp riding to run them down for they fled like rabbits bolting through pricklypear and scrub their tails bravely aloft their stiff legs flying others too tired and thirsty to go farther lay down and refused to budge and these had to be carried over the saddlehorn until they had rested some hid themselves cunningly in the mesquite clumps or burrowed into the coarse sagauista grass but now those swarthy daredevil riders were as gentle as women they urged the tiny youngsters onward with harmless switches or with painless blows from loosecoiled riatas they picked them up in their arms and rode with them once through the gate and safe inside the restraining pasture fence the herd was allowed to settle down then began a patient search by outraged mothers a series of mournful quests that were destined to continue far into the night endless nosings and sniffings and caressings which would keep up until each cow had found her own until each calf was butting its head against maternal ribs and gaining that consolation which it craved a new moon was swinging in the sky as alaire and dave rode back toward las palmas the dry gray grass was beginning to jewel with dew the paths were ribbons of silver between dark blots of ink where the bushes grew behind rose the jingle of spurs and bridles the creak of leather the voices of men it was an hour in which to talk freely an environment suited to confidences and dave law was happier than he had been for years he closed his eyes to the future he stopped his ears to misgivings with a song in his heart he rode at the stirrup of the woman he adored how or when alaire austin came to feel that this man loved her she never knew certainly he gave no voice to his feeling save perhaps by some unconscious tone or trick of speech rather the knowledge came to her intuitively as the result of some subconscious interchange of thought some responsive vibration which only a psychologist could analyze however it was alaire knew tonight that she was dear to her companion and strange to say this certainty did not disturb her inasmuch as the thing existed why deny its right to exist she asked herself since it was in no wise dishonorable how could it be wrong provided it went no further alaire had been repelled by luis longorios evident love for her but a similar emotion in this mans breast had quite the opposite effect she was eager for friendship hungry for affection starved for that worship which every woman lives upon having a wholesome confidence in her own strength of character and complete faith in laws sense of honor she was neither alarmed nor offended for the first time in years she allowed her intimate thoughts free expression and spoke of her hopes her interests and her efforts under the spell of the moonlight she even confided something about those dreams that kept her company and robbed her world of its sordidness dave law discovered that she lived in a fanciful land of unrealities and the glimpse he gained of it was delightful supper was waiting when they arrived at las palmas and dolores announced that young ed had telephoned from the lewis ranch that he would not be home yielding to a sudden impulse alaire said to her companion you must dine with me dolores will show you to a room i will be ready in half an hour dave hesitated but it was not in human nature to refuse later as he washed himself and combed his hair he had a moment of misgivings but the next instant he asked himself wherein he was doing wrong surely there was no law which denied him the right to love provided he kept that love a secret the inner voice did not argue with him yet he was disquieted and restless as he paced the big livingroom waiting for his hostess the austin ranchhouse offered a contrast to the majority of texas country homes young ed had built almost a mansion for his bride and in the latter years alaire had remodeled and changed it to suit her own ideas the verandas were wide the rooms large and cool and open polished floors brilliant grass mats and easy wicker furniture gave it a further airiness the place was comfortable luxurious yet it was a home and it had an atmosphere not for many years had dave law been a guest amid such surroundings and as the moments dragged on he began to feel more and more out of place with growing discomfort he realized that the mistress of this residence was the richest woman in all this part of texas and that he was little better than a tramp his free life his lack of care and responsibility had bred in him a certain contempt for money nevertheless when through the door to the diningroom he saw alaire pause to give a final touch to the table he was tempted to beat an ignominious retreat for she was a radiant vision in evening dress she was stately beautiful her hair was worn high her arms were bare underneath a shimmer of lace her gown exposed a throat round and smooth and adorable in reality she was simply clad but to the rangers untrained eye she seemed regal and his own rough clothes became painfully conspicuous by contrast alaire knew how to be a gracious and winning hostess of course she did not appear to notice her guests embarrassment she had rather welcomed the thought that this man cared for her and yet had she deliberately planned to dampen his feeling she could hardly have succeeded better than by showing him the wide disparity in their lives and situations dave was dismayed he felt very poor and ridiculous alaire was no longer the woman he had ridden with through the solitudes her very friendliness seemed to be a condescension he did not linger long after they had dined for he wished to be alone where he could reach an understanding with himself on the steps he waited just a moment for alaire to mention if she chose that subject which they had still left open on the night before reading his thought she said you are expecting me to say something about panfilo sanchez yes i have thought it over in fact i have been thinking about it all day but even yet i dont know what to tell you one moment i think the truth would merely provoke another act of violence the next i feel that it must be made public regardless of consequences as for its effect upon myself you know i care very little what people say or think im sorry i killed the fellow i shouldnt have done it but one sees things differently out in the rough and here in the settled country laws dont work alike in all places they depend a good deal upon geography there are times when the theft of a crust of bread would warrant the punishment i gave panfilo i cant help but feel that his conduct under the circumstances called for what he got he wasnt a good man in spite of what jose says anto confessed to me that they were planning all sorts of deviltry together that is hardly an excuse alaire smiled faintly oh i know dave agreed but you see i dont feel the need of one the sentimental side of the affair which bothers you doesnt affect me in the least alaire nodded you have made me understand how you look at things and i must confess that i tolerate actions that would have shocked me before i came to know this country panfilo is dead and gone rightly or wrongly i dont know what i dread now is further consequences dont weaken on my account no im not thinking of the consequences to you or to me you are the kind of man who can protect himself im sure your very ability in that direction frightens me a little on joses account but she sighed and lifted her round shoulders in a shrug perhaps time will decide this question for us dave laughed with some relief i think youve worried yourself enough over it maam he said splitting hairs as to whats right and whats wrong when it doesnt matter much in either case suppose you continue to think it over at your leisure perhaps id better and now alaire extended her hand wont you and montrosa come to see me once in a while im very lonesome wed love to dave declared he had it on his lips to say more but at that moment an eager whinny and an impatient rattle of a bridlebit came from the driveway and he smiled theres her acceptance now oh no she merely heard your voice the fickle creature alaire watched her guest until be had disappeared into the shadows then she heard him talking to the mare benitos words at the rodeo recurred to her and she wondered if this ranger might not also have a way with women the house was very still and empty when she reentered it xvii the guzman incident ricardo guzman did not return from romero when two days had passed with no word from him his sons became alarmed and started an investigation but without the slightest result even colonel blanco himself could not hazard a guess as to guzmans fate the man had disappeared it seemed completely and mysteriously meanwhile from other quarters of the mexican town came rumors that set the border afire readers of this story may remember the famous guzman incident so called and the complications that resulted from it for at the time it raised a storm of indignation as the crowning atrocity of the mexican revolution serving further to disturb the troubled waters of diplomacy and threatening for a moment to upset the precariously balanced relations of the two countries at first the facts appeared plain a citizen of the united states had been lured across the border and done to death by mexican soldiers for it soon became evident that ricardo was dead the outrage was a casus belli such as no selfrespecting people could ignore so ran the popular verdict then when that ominous mailed serpent which lay coiled along the rio grande stirred itself warlike americans prepared themselves to hear of big events a motive for ricardo guzmans murder was not lacking for it was generally known that president potosi had long resented yankee enmity particularly as that enmity was directed at him personally a succession of irritating diplomatic skirmishes an unsatisfactory series of verbal sparring matches had roused the old indians anger and it was considered likely that he had adopted this means of permanently severing his relations with washington of course the people of texas were delighted that the longdelayed hour had struck accordingly when the state department seemed strangely loath to investigate the matter when in fact it manifested a willingness to allow don ricardo ample time in which to come to life in preference to putting a further strain upon international relations they were both surprised and enraged telegraph wires began to buzz the governor of the state sent a crisply sarcastic message to the national capital offering to despatch a company of rangers after guzmans body just to prove that he was indeed dead and that the mexican authorities were lying when they professed ignorance of the fact this offer not only caught the popular fancy north of the rio grande but it likewise had an effect on the other side of the river for on the very next day general luis longorio set out for romero to investigate personally the ranchers disappearance now throughout all this public clamor truth as usual lay hidden at the bottom of its well and few even of ricardos closest friends suspected the real reason for his murder jonesville of course could think or talk of little else than this outrage and blaze jones as befitted its leading citizen was loudest in his criticism of the governments weakkneed policy it makes me right sore to think im an american he confided to dave why if ricardo had been an englishman the british consul at mexico city would have called on potosi the minute the news came hed have stuck a sixshooter under the presidents nose and made him locate don ricardo or pay an indemnity and kiss the union jack blazes conception of diplomacy was peculiar if potosi didnt talk straight that british consul would have bent a gunbarl over the old ruffians bean and telephoned for a couple hundred battleships england protects her sons but we americans are cussed with notions of brotherly love and universal peace bah were bound to have war dave some day or other why not start it now dave nodded his agreement yes well have to step in and take the country over sooner or later but everybody has the wrong idea of this guzman killing the federal officers in romero didnt frame it up no who did tad lewis jones started what makes you think that listen tad was afraid to let urbina come to trial you remember one of his men boasted that the case would never be heard well it wont ricardos dead and the other witness is gone now draw your own conclusions gone you mean the fellow who saw urbina and garza together yes he has disappeared too evidently frightened away jones was amazed say dave he cried that means your case has blown up eh absolutely lewis has been selling wet stock to the federals and he probably arranged with some of them to murder ricardo at any rate thats my theory blaze cursed eloquently id like to hang it on to tad id sure clean house down his way if i was positive i sent a man over to romero dave explained further he tells me ricardo is dead all right but nobody knows how he died or why theres a new grave in the little cemetery above the town but nobody knows whos buried in it there hasnt been a death in romero lately the speaker watched his friend closely ricardos family would like to have his body and id like to see it myself wouldnt you we could tell just what happened to him if he really faced a firingsquad for instance i reckon washington would have something to say eh what are you aimin at blaze inquired if we had ricardos body on this side it would put an end to all the lies and perhaps force colonel blanco to make known the real facts it might even mean a case against tad lewis what do you think of my reasoning its eighteen karat what dyou say we go over there and get ricardo dave smiled thats what ive been leading up to will you take a chance hell yes i knew you would all we need is a pair of mexicans to do the work i liked ricardo i owe him something suppose were caught in that case well have to run for it and i presume ill be discharged from the ranger service i aint very good at runnin not from mexicans blazes eyes were bright and hard at the thought its moren possible that if they discover us we can start a nice little war of our own that evening dave managed to get his ranger captain by longdistance telephone and for some time the two talked guardedly when dave rang off they had come to a thorough understanding it had been an easy matter for jose sanchez to secure a leave of absence from las palmas especially since benito was not a little interested in the unexplained disappearance of panfilo and work was light at this time benito did not think it necessary to mention the horsebreakers journey to his employer so that alaire knew nothing whatever about the matter until jose himself asked permission to see her on a matter of importance the man had ridden hard most of the previous night and his excitement was patent even before he spoke alaire realized that panfilos fate was known to him and she decided swiftly that there must be no further concealment senora a terrible thing jose burst forth god knows i am nearly mad with grief it is about my sainted cousin it is strange unbelievable my head whirls alaire quieted him saying in spanish calm yourself jose and tell me everything from the beginning but how can i be calm oh what a crime what a misfortune well then panfilo is completely dead i rode to that tanque where you saw him last and what do you think but you know alaire nodded i suspected joses dark face blazed he bent forward eagerly what did you suspect and why tell me all there is something black and hellish here and i must know about it quickly suppose you tell me your story first alaire answered and remember that you are excited the mexican lowered his voice bueno forgive me if i seem half crazed well i rode to that waterhole and found nothing it is a lonely place only the brush cattle use it but i said to myself panfilo drank here he was here beyond there is nothing so i will begin god was my helper senora i found him his bones as naked and clean as pebbles caramba you should have heard me then i was like a demon i couldnt think i couldnt reason i rode from that accursed spot as if panfilos ghost pursued me and i am here i shall rouse the country the people shall demand the blood of my cousins assassin it is the crime of a century wait when you spoke to me last i didnt dream that panfilo was dead but since then i have learned the truth and why he was killed you must let me tell you everything jose just as it happened then you may do whatever you think best and you shall have the whole truth it was a trying situation in spite of her brave beginning alaire was tempted to send the mexican on to jonesville there to receive an explanation directly from david law himself but such a course she dared not risk jose was indeed half crazed and at this moment quite irresponsible if he met dave terrible consequences would surely follow accordingly it was with a peculiar apprehensive flatter in her breast that alaire realized the crisis had come heretofore she had blamed law but now oddly enough she found herself interested in defending him as calmly as she could she related all that had led up to the tragedy while jose listened with eyes wide and mouth open you see i had no suspicion of the truth she concluded it was a terrible thing and mr law regrets it deeply he would have made a report to the authorities only he feared it might embarrass me he will repeat to you all that i have said and he is ready to meet the consequences jose was torn with rage yet plainly a prey to indecision he rolled his eyes and cursed under his breath these rangers he muttered that is the kind of men they are they murder honest people this was not murder alaire cried sharply panfilo was aiding a felon to escape the courts will not punish mr law bah who cares for the courts this man is a gringo and these are gringo laws but i am mexican and panfilo was my cousin we shall see alaires eyes darkened dont be rash jose she exclaimed warningly mr law bears you no illwill but he is a dangerous man you would do well to make some inquiries about him you are a good man you have a long life before you reading the fellows black look she argued you think i am taking his part because he is my countryman but he needs no one to defend him he will make this whole story public and face the consequences i like you and i dont wish to see you come to a worse end than your cousin panfilo jose continued to glower then turning away he said without meeting his employers eyes i would like to draw my money very well i am sorry to have you leave las palmas for i have regarded you as one of my gente joses face remained stony what do you intend to do where are you going the fellow shrugged quien sabe perhaps i shall go to my general longorio he is in romero just across the river he knows a brave man when he sees one and he needs fellows like me to kill rebels well you shall hear of me people will tell you about that demon of a jose whose cousin was murdered by the rangers yes i have the heart of a bandit alaire smiled faintly you will be shot she told him those soldiers have little to eat and no money at all but joses bright eyes remained hostile and his expression baffling it was plain to alaire that her explanation of his cousins death had carried not the slightest conviction and she even began to fear that her part in the affair had caused him to look upon her as an accessory nevertheless when she paid him his wages she gave him a good horse which jose accepted with thanks but without gratitude as alaire watched him ride away with never a backward glance she decided that she must lose no time in apprising the ranger of this new condition of affairs she drove her automobile to jonesville that afternoon more worried than she cared to admit it was a moral certainty she knew that jose sanchez would sooner or later attempt to take vengeance upon his cousins slayer and there was no telling when he might become sufficiently inflamed with poisonous mexican liquor to be in the mood for killing then too there were friends of panfilo always ready to lend bad counsel law was nowhere in town and so in spite of her reluctance alaire was forced to look for him at the joneses home as she had never called upon paloma and had made it almost impossible for the girl to visit las palmas the meeting of the two women was somewhat formal but no one could long remain stiff or constrained with paloma jones the girl had a directness of manner and an honest friendly smile that simply would not be denied her delight that alaire had come to see her pleased and shamed the elder woman who hesitatingly confessed the object of her visit oh i thought you were calling on me paloma pouted her pretty lips dave isnt here he and father have gone away a little pucker of apprehension appeared upon her brow i must get word to him at once miss jones shook her head is it very important it needed no close observation to discover the concern in palomas eyes alaire told her story quickly mr law must be warned right away she added for the man is capable of anything paloma nodded dave told us how he had killed panfilo she hesitated and then cried impulsively mrs austin im going to confess something ive got to tell somebody or ill burst i was walking the floor when you came well dad and dave have completely lost their wits they have gone across the river to get ricardo guzmans body what alaire stared at the girl uncomprehendingly they are going to dig him up and bring him back to prove that he was killed dave knows where hes buried and hes doing this for ricardos family some foolish sentiment about a bridle but dad i think merely wants to start a war between the united states and mexico my dear girl arent you dreaming i thought i must be when i heard about it dad wouldnt have told me at all only he thought i ought to know in case anything happens to him palomas breath failed her momentarily theyll be killed i told them so but dave seems to enjoy the risk he said ricardo had a sentimental nature and of course the possibility of danger delighted both him and dad theyre perfect fools when did they go tell me everything they left an hour ago in my machine with two mexicans to help them they intend to cross at your pumpingplant as soon as it gets dark and be back by midnight that is if they ever get back why its unbelievable its too much for me longorio himself is in romero and hed have them shot if he caught them wed never even hear of it palomas face was pale her eyes were strained and tragic father always has been a trial to me but i thought i could do something with dave she made a hopeless gesture and alaire wondered momentarily whether the girls anxiety was keenest for the safety of her father or the other cant we prevent them from going she inquired why they are breaking the law arent they something like that but what can we do its nearly dark and theyll go anyhow regardless of what we say mr law is a ranger too the girl nodded oh if its ever discovered hell be ruined and think of dad a man of property dave declares tad lewis is at the bottom of it all and put the federals up to murder ricardo he thinks in this way he can force them into telling the truth but dad is just looking for a fight and wants to be a hero there was a moment of silence then alaire reasoned aloud i presume they chose our pumpingplant because it is directly opposite the romero cemetery i could have benito and some trusty men waiting on this side or i could even send them over no no dont you understand the whole thing is illegal well we could be there you and i paloma agreed eagerly yes maybe we could even help them if they got into trouble come then well have supper at las palmas and slip down to the river and wait paloma was gone with a rush in a moment she returned ready for the trip and with her she carried a winchester rifle nearly as long as herself i hope you arent afraid of firearms she panted ive owned this gun for years i am rather a good shot alaire told her paloma closed her lips firmly good maybe well come in handy after all anyhow ill bet those mexicans wont chase dad and dave very far jose sanchez was true to his declared purpose with a horse of his own between his knees with money in his pocket and hate in his heart he left las palmas and riding to the lewis crossing forded the rio grande by early afternoon he was in romero and there after some effort he succeeded in finding general longorio romero at this time the southern outpost of federal territory standing guard against the rebel forces in tamaulipas is a sunbaked little town sprawling about a naked plaza and except for the presence of colonel blancos detachment of troops it would have presented much the same appearance as any one of the lazy border villages a scow ferry had at one time linked it on the american side with a group of dobe houses which were sanctified by the pious name of sangre de cristo but of late years more advantageous crossings above and below had come into some use and romeros ferry had been abandoned perhaps a mile above sangre de cristo and directly opposite romeros weedgrown cemetery stood the pumpingplant of las palmas its corrugated iron roof and highflung chimney forming a conspicuous landmark luis longorio had just awakened from his siesta when jose gained admittance to his presence the general lay at ease in the best bed of the best house in the village he greeted the newcomer with a smile so my brave jose you wish to become a soldier and fight for your country eh yes my general longorio yawned and stretched lazily body of christ this is a hard life here am i in this goatherds hovel hot dirty and half starved and all because of a fellow i never saw who got himself killed you would think this ricardo was an englishman instead of a gringo for the fuss that is made who was he some great jefe a miserable fellow i knew him well then he is indeed dead quite dead i believe longorio said carelessly then turning his large bright eyes upon the visitor he continued with more interest now tell me about the beautiful senora your mistress jose scowled shes not my mistress i am no longer of her gente i have a debt of blood to wipe out longorio sat up in his bed the smile left his face my jose he said quietly if you harm her in the least i shall bury you to the neck in an ants nest and fill your mouth with honey now what is this you are telling me jose uncomfortably startled by this barbarous threat told as connectedly as he knew how all about his cousins death and his reasons for leaving las palmas ahh longorio relaxed you gave me a start at first i thought you came with a message from her but that was too much to expect then i feared you meant the lady some evil now i shall tell you a little secret i love your senora yes i love her madly furiously i can think of nothing but her i came to this abominable village more to see her than to annoy myself over the death of ricardo guzman i must see my divinity i must hear her blessed voice or i shall go mad why do i tell you this because i have decided that you shall lead me to her tonight the general fell silent for a moment then i intend to have her some day jose and perhaps you will be my right hand see i make you my confidant because you will not dare to anger me or well my little friend you must understand what fate would befall you in that case i can reach across the rio grande amazement and then fear were depicted in joses face as he listened he asserted his loyalty vehemently yes yes i know you love me the general agreed carelessly but what is far more to the point i intend to pay well for your services perhaps i shall also arrange so that you may have a reckoning with the murderer of your cousin what is his name it was joses opportunity to make an impression and he used it to the full telling all that he knew of the killing of panfilo and describing law with the eloquence of hatred longorio listened for a time and then held up his hand enough for my sake too you shall kill him for you have made me jealous impossible jose raised protesting palms he was sure the general was wrong senora austin was above suspicion of any kind and yet this man met her in pueblo and rode with her to las palmas he comes to see her frequently you say the general bent his bright keen eyes upon the visitor yes she gave him the finest horse at las palmas too and a new thought presented itself to jose ho by the way they were alone at the waterhole when my cousin panfilo was shot now that i think of it they were alone together for a day and a night i begin to wonder longorio breathed an oath and swung his long legs over the edge of the bed you have poisoned my mind a whole day and night eh that is bad what happened what kind of a fool is her husband i cannot bear to think of this see i am beside myself caramba i live in paradise i come flying on the wings of the wind only to learn that my blessed divinity has a lover if only my excellent blanco had shot this fellow law instead of that guzman if only i could lay hands upon him here in mexico ha there would be something to print in the american papers he began to dress himself feverishly muttering as he did so i will permit no one to come between us the thought kills me you bring me bad news jose and yet i am glad you came i accept your offer and you shall be my man henceforth but you shall not go out to be shot by those rebels no you shall return to las palmas to be my eyes and my ears and when the time comes you shall be my hands too i will avenge your cousin panfilo for you my word on that yes and i will make you a rich man jose listened hungrily to these promises he was relieved at the change in his plans for after all a soldiers life offered few attractions and the food at las palmas was good the general promised him fine wages too truly it was fortunate that he had come to romero now we have settled this joses new employer declared run away and amuse yourself until dark then we will take a little journey by way of the old ferry it is not altogether safe ventured jose that country over there is alive with refugees i will take some men with me said longorio now go and let me think xviii ed austin turns at bay had it not been for her fears paloma jones would have taken her visit to the austin ranch as an unmixed enjoyment to her alaire had always been an ideally romantic figure more than once in her moments of melancholy paloma had envied mrs austins unhappiness and yearned to bear a similar sorrow to be crossed in love and to become known as a woman of tragedy to have ones life blasted ones happiness slain by some faithless lover impressed the girl as interesting thrilling moreover it was a misfortune calculated to develop ones highest spiritual nature surely nothing could be more sadly satisfying than to live alone with regretful memories and to have the privilege of regarding the world as a vain show unfortunately however paloma was too healthy and too practical to remain long occupied with such thoughts she was disgustingly optimistic and merry misanthropy was entirely lacking in her makeup and none of her admirers seemed the least bit inclined to faithlessness on the contrary the men she knew were perfect nuisances in their earnestness of purpose and she could not manage to fall in love with any one sufficiently depraved to promise her the slightest misery paloma felt that she was hopelessly commonplace now that she had an opportunity of becoming better acquainted with the object of her envy she made the most of it she soon found however that alaire possessed anything but an unhappy disposition and that to pity her was quite impossible mrs austin was shy and retiring certainly at first but once the ice was broken she was delightfully frank friendly and spirited palomas curiosity was allconsuming and she explored every phase of her new friends life with interest and delight she even discovered that imaginary world of alaires and learned something about those visionary people who bore her company it must be lots of fun said paloma yes sometimes my dreampeople are very real why i can actually see them then i realize i have been too much alone you ought to have children the girl declared calmly i have yes imaginary kiddies and they are perfect dears too are they ever naughty oh indeed they are and i have to punish them then i feel terribly but theyre much nicer than fleshandblood children for they have no bad traits whatever and theyre so amazingly intelligent such exchanges of confidence drew the women into fairly close relations by the time they had arrived at las palmas but the thought of what had brought them together had a sobering effect and during their hasty supper they discussed the situation in all its serious phases in offering to lend a hand in this difficulty alaire had acted largely upon impulse and now that she took time to think over the affair more coolly she asked herself what possible business of hers it could be how did this effort to secure don ricardos body concern her and how could she hope or expect to be of help to the men engaged in the hazardous attempt with paloma of course it was different the girl was anxious on her fathers account and probably concerned more deeply than was alaire for the safety of dave law probably she and dave had an understanding it would be natural well paloma was a nice girl and she would make a splendid wife for any man for her part paloma was troubled by no uncertainty of purpose it did not seem to her at all absurd to go to her fathers assistance and she was so eager to be up and away that the prospect of a long evenings wait made her restless as usual ed austin had not taken the trouble to inform his wife of his whereabouts alaire was relieved to find that he was out and she decided that he had probably stayed at tad lewiss for supper the women were seated on the porch after their meals when up the driveway rode two horsemen a moment later a tall figure mounted the steps and came forward with outstretched hand crying in spanish senora i surprise you well i told you some day i should give myself this great pleasure i am here general longorio but what a surprise alaires amazement was naive her face was that of a startled schoolgirl the mexican warmly kissed her fingers then turned to meet paloma jones as he bowed the women exchanged glances over his head miss jones looked frankly frightened and her expression plainly asked the meaning of longorios presence to herself she was wondering if it could have anything to do with that expedition to the romero cemetery she tried to compose herself but apprehension flooded her alaire meanwhile her composure recovered was standing slim and motionless beside her chair inquiring smoothly what brings you into texas at such a time my dear general this is quite extraordinary need you ask me cried the man i would ride through a thousand perils senora god in his graciousness placed that miserable village romero close to the gates of heaven why should i not presume to look through them briefly i came two days ago and every hour since then i have turned my eyes in the direction of las palmas at last i could wait no longer a courtly bow at the conclusion of these words robbed the speech of its audacity and tinged it with the licensed extravagance of latin flattery nevertheless paloma gasped and alaire stirred uncomfortably the semidarkness of the veranda was an invitation to even more daring compliments and therefore as she murmured a polite word of welcome alaire stepped through the french window at her back and into the brightly lighted livingroom paloma jones followed as if in a trance longorios bright eyes took a swift inventory of his surroundings then he sighed luxuriously how fine said he how beautiful a nest for a bird of paradise dont you consider this rather a mad adventure alaire insisted suppose it should become known that you crossed the river longorio snapped his fingers i answer to no one i am supreme but your interest warms my heart it thrills me to think you care for my safety thus am i repaid for my days of misery you surely did not paloma swallowed hard come alone no i have a duty to my country i said luis you are a brave man and fear is a stranger to you but nevertheless you must have regard for the fatherland so i took measures to protect myself in case of eventualities how by bringing with me some of my troopers oh they are peaceable fellows he declared quickly and they are doubtless enjoying themselves with our friend and sympathizer morales where asked alaire i left them at your pumpingplant senora paloma jones sat down heavily in the nearest chair but you need have no uneasiness they are quiet and orderly they will molest nothing no one would believe them to be soldiers i take liberties with the laws and the customs of your country dear lady but you would not care for a man who allowed such considerations to stand in his way eh alaire answered sharply it was a very reckless thing to do and you must not remain here yes yes paloma eagerly agreed you must go back at once but longorio heard no voice except alaires in fact since entering the livingroom he had scarcely taken his eyes from her now he drew his evenly arched brows together in a plaintive frown saying you are inhospitable then his expression lightened or is it he asked is it that you are indeed apprehensive for me alaire tried to speak quietly i should never forgive myself if you came to harm here at my ranch longorio sighed and i hoped for a warmer welcome especially since i have done you another favor you saw that hombre who came with me yes well you would never guess that it is your jose sanchez whom i prevailed upon to return to your employ but it is no other and he comes to beg your forgiveness for leaving he was distracted at the news of his cousins murder and came to me his cousin was not murdered exactly i told him so when i had learned the facts a poor fellow this panfilo evidently a very bad man indeed but jose admired him and was harboring thoughts of revenge i said to him jose my boy it is better to do nothing than to act wrongly since it was gods will that your cousin came to a bad end why follow in his footsteps you will not make a good soldier go back to your beautiful employer be loyal to her and think no more about this unhappy affair it required some argument i assure you but he is here he comes to ask your forgiveness and to resume his position of trust i am glad to have him back if he feels that way i have nothing whatever to forgive him then he will be happy and i have served you that is the end of the matter with a graceful gesture longorio dismissed the subject is it to be my pleasure he next inquired to meet senor austin your husband i am afraid not too bad i had hoped to know him and convince him that we federales are not such a bad people as he seems to think we ought to be friends he and i every loyal mexican in these troublesome times desires the goodwill and friendship of such important personages as senor austin this animosity is a sad thing under this flow of talk paloma stirred uneasily and at the first opportunity burst out its far from safe for you to remain here general longorio this neighborhood is terribly excited over the death of ricardo guzman and if any one learned so then this guzman is dead longorio inquired with interest isnt he blurted paloma not so far as i can learn only today i made official report that nothing whatever could be discovered about him certainly he is nowhere in romero and it is my personal belief that the poor fellow was either drowned in the river or made way with for his money probably the truth will never be known it is a distressing event but i assure you my soldiers do not kill american citizens it is our boast that federal territory is safe one can come or go at will in any part of mexico that is under potosista control i sincerely hope that we have heard the last of this guzman affair longorio had come to spend the evening and his keen pleasure in alaire austins company made him so indifferent to his personal safety that nothing short of a rude dismissal would have served to terminate his visit neither alaire nor her companion however had the least idea how keenly he resented the presence of paloma jones ed austins absence he had half expected and he had wildly hoped for an evening an hour a few moments alone with the object of his desires joses disclosures earlier in the day had opened the generals eyes they had likewise inflamed him with jealousy and with passion and accordingly he had come prepared to force his attentions with irresistible fervor should the slightest opportunity offer to find alaire securely chaperoned therefore and to be compelled to press his ardent advances in the presence of a third party was like gall to him the fact that he made the most of his advantages even at the cost of scandalizing paloma spoke volumes for his determination it was a remarkable wooing on the one hand this halfsavage man gnawed by jealousy heedless of the illicit nature of his passion yet held within the bounds of decorum by some fagend of respectability and on the other hand a woman bored resentful and tortured at the moment by fear about what was happening at the riverbank alaire too had a further cause for worry of late ed austin had grown insultingly suspicious more than once he had spoken of dave law in a way to make his wifes face crimson and he had wilfully misconstrued her recital of longorios attentions fearing therefore that in spite of paloma joness presence ed would resent the generals call alaire strained her ears for the sound of his coming it was late when austin arrived visitors at las palmas were unusual at any time hence the sound of strange voices in the brightly lighted livingroom at such an hour surprised him he came tramping in booted and spurred a belligerent look of inquiry upon his bloated features but when he had met his wifes guests his surprise turned to black displeasure his own sympathies in the mexican struggle were so notorious that longorios presence seemed to him to have but one possible significance why paloma jones was here he could not imagine thus far alaires caller had succeeded in ignoring miss jones and now with equal selfassurance he refused to recognize eds hostility he remained at ease and appeared to welcome this chance of meeting austin yet it soon became evident that his opinion of his host was far from flattering beneath his politeness he began to show an amused contempt which alaire perceived even though her husband did not luis longorio was the sort of man who enjoys a strained situation and one who shows to the best advantage under adverse conditions accordingly eds arrival instead of hastening his departure merely served to prolong his stay it was growing very late now and paloma was frantic profiting by her first opportunity she whispered to alaire for gods sake send him away alaires eyes were dark with excitement yes said she talk to him and give me a chance to have a word alone with ed the opportunity came when austin went into the diningroom for a drink alaire excused herself to follow him when they were out of sight and hearing her husband turned upon her with an ugly frown whats that greaser doing here he asked roughly he called to pay his respects you must get him away i must ed glowered at her why dont you you got him here in my absence now that im home you want me to get rid of him eh whats the idea dont be silly i didnt know he was coming and he must be crazy to risk such a thing crazy eds lip curled he isnt crazy i suppose he couldnt stay away any longer by god alaire alaire checked this outburst with a sharp exclamation dont make a scene dont you understand he holds over fifty thousand dollars worth of la feria cattle dont you understand we cant antagonize him is that what he came to see you about yes she bit her lip ill explain everything but you must help me send him back right away glancing at the clock alaire saw that it was drawing on toward midnight with quick decision she seized her husband by the arm explaining feverishly there is something big going on tonight ed longorio brought a guard of soldiers with him and left them at our pumphouse well it so happens that blaze jones and mr law have gone to the romero cemetery to get ricardo guzmans body what austins red face paled his eyes bulged yes thats why paloma is here they crossed at our pumpingstation and theyll be back at any time now if they encounter longorios men you understand god almighty austin burst forth ricardo guzmans body he wet his lips and swallowed with difficulty why do they want the body to prove that he is really dead and to prove who killed him noting the effect of these words alaire cried sharply whats the matter ed but austin momentarily was beyond speech the decanter from which he was trying to pour himself a drink played a musical tattoo upon his glass his face had become ashen and pasty have they got the body do they know who shot him he asked dully no no alaire was trembling with impatience dont you understand they are over there now and theyll be back about midnight if longorio had come alone or if he had left his men at sangre de cristo everything would be all right but those soldiers at moraless house will be up and awake why it couldnt have happened worse how many men has he got austin nodded in the direction of the front room i dont know probably four or five what ails you that wont do they wont fight on this side of the river they theyd hold them off who what are you talking about something in her husbands inexplicable agitation something in the hunted desperate way in which his eyes were running over the room alarmed alaire ed utterly disregarded her question catching sight of the telephone which stood upon a stand in the far corner of the room he ran to it and snatching the receiver violently oscillated the hook dont do that alaire cried following him wait it mustnt get out hello give me the lewis ranch quick ive forgotten the number with his free hand ed held his wife at a distance muttering harshly get away now i know what im doing get awaydamn you he flung alaire from him as she tried to snatch the instrument out of his hands what do you want of lewis she panted none of your business you keep away or ill hurt you ed she cried are you out of your mind you mustnt their voices were raised now heedless of the two people in the adjoining room keep your hands off i tell you hello is that you tad again austin thrust his wife violently aside listen ive just learned that dave law and old man jones have crossed over to dig up ricardos body yes tonight theyre over there now be back inside of an hour alaire leaned weakly against the table her frightened eyes fixed upon the speaker even yet she could not fully grasp the meaning of her husbands behavior and tried to put aside those fears that were distracting her perhaps after all she told herself ed was taking his own way to yes they aim to discover how he was killed and all about it sure i suppose they found out where he was buried they crossed at my pumpingplant and theyll be back with the body tonight if they havent already the speakers voice broke his hand was shaking so that he could scarcely retain his hold upon the telephone how the hell do i know he chattered its up to you youve got a machine ed cried the wife she went toward him on weak unsteady feet but she halted as the voice of longorio cut in sharply whats this i hear ricardo guzmans body husband and wife turned the open doubledoor to the livingroom framed the tall figure of the mexican general xix rangers longorio stared first at the huddled perspiring man beside the telephone and then at the frightened woman is that the truth he demanded harshly yes austin answered they are bringing the body to this side you know what that means did you know this the general turned upon alaire of the four he was the least excited from the background paloma quavered you told us ricardo was not dead so it is all right there is no harm done a brief silence ensued then longorio shrugged who knows let us hope that he suffered no harm on mexican soil that would be serious indeed yes very serious for i have given my word to your government this david law he pronounced the name carefully but with a strange foreign accent he is a reckless person to defy the border regulations it is a grave matter to invade foreign territory on such a mission longorio again bent his brilliant eyes upon alaire i see that you are concerned for his safety you would not desire him to come to trouble eh he has done you favors he is your friend as i am well a mirthless smile exposed his splendid white teeth we must think of that now i will bid you good night where are you going demanded miss jones to the river and then to romero i may be needed for those men of mine are stupid fellows and there is danger of a misunderstanding in the dark anything may happen i should like to meet this david law he is a man of my own kind turning to young ed he said there is reason for haste and a horse moves slowly would you do me the favor if you have an automobile no i wont ed declared i dont want to see the rio grande tonight i wont be involved but you are already involved come there is no time to waste and i have something to say to you you will drive me to the river and my horse will remain here until i return for him there was no mistaking the command in longorios tone the master of las palmas rose as if under compulsion he took his hat and the two men left the room oh my god paloma gasped theyll be in time and so will the lewis gang quick ed will take his runabout well follow in my car alaire fled to make herself ready a few moments later she looked out from her window and saw the headlights of eds runabout flash down the driveway to the road then she and paloma rushed to the garage where the touringcar stood theyll never expect us to follow them alaire tried to speak hopefully and well drive without lights maybe well get there in time after all as the machine rolled out through the gate she elaborated the halfformed plan that had come to her the brush is thick along the river we can leave the car hidden and steal up to the pumphouse when we hear the boat coming maybe we can call out in time to warn your father the moon is rising paloma half sobbed theyll be sure to see us do you think were ahead of tad lewis oh yes he hasnt had time to get here yet but hell come fast when he starts this is the only plan i can think of alaire drove as swiftly as she dared following the blurred streak of gray that was the road and taking the bumps with utter recklessness already the yellow rim of the moon was peering over the horizon to her right and by its light she found the road that turned abruptly toward the rio grande a mile or more distant the black mud from the last heavy rain had hardened the ruts in this side road were deep and the car leaped and plunged flinging its occupants from side to side ahead loomed the dark ridge of the river thickets a dense rampart of mesquite ebony and coma with here and there a taller alamo or hackberry thrusting itself skyward but even before they were sheltered from the moonlight paloma saw the lights of another automobile approaching along the maintraveled highway behind them the lights evidently of tad lewiss machine a moment later alaires car drove into the black shadows but fearing to switch on her headlights she felt her way cautiously between the walls of foliage until at her right another opening showed like a narrow arroyo diverging from the one they followed into this she swerved regardless of the fact that it was half grown up with brush thorny branches swept the sides of the machine rank dewsoaked grass rose to the height of the tonneau the car came to a jolting pause then the motor ceased its purring and the two women sat motionless listening for the rattle of the oncoming machine it had been a short swift exciting ride young eds runabout could not be many minutes ahead of them alaire knew the tad lewis car an oldstyle cheap affair which advertised its mechanical imperfections by a loud clashing of gears and a noisy complaint of loose parts therefore when the leafy canon walls behind her hidingplace were brilliantly illuminated and a car stole silently past at low speed she seized paloma by the arm and whispered thats not lewis who is it it cant be ed no he and longorio are ahead of us its another motor entirely the women got out then breasted the high grass and brambles between their hidingplace and the pumphouse road as soon as they were back in the trail they made all possible speed speculating meanwhile upon the mystery of the unknown car emerging into the clearing which surrounded the powerplant they discovered the machine in question standing dark and deserted in the shadows evidently the driver whoever he was well knew what he was about and had not blundered upon this place by accident a hundred yards away they could now see the ghostly rio grande its saffron surface faintly silvered by the low moon lights gleamed from the windows of moraless house in the distance the vague outlines of the mexican shore were resolving themselves and far beyond winked the evidence that some belated citizens of romero were still awake paloma had brought with her the longbarreled winchester rifle and this she clutched nervously as she and alaire stood whispering conditions were favorable for an approach to the pumphouse itself for two ridges of earth perhaps eight feet high thrown up like parallel furrows from a giant plow marked the beginning of the irrigation ditch and in the shadow of these the women worked their way forward unobserved they had nearly reached their goal when out into the clearing behind them with metallic rattle and clang burst another automobile and paloma whispered excitedly theres the lewis outfit at last in the lewis car were several men they descended hurriedly and when one of them ran around the front of the car to turn off its lights both women saw that he carried a rifle evidently tad lewis had come prepared for desperate measures a small door gave entrance to the boilerroom and into the lock of this mrs austin fitted a key the next moment she and paloma were safely inside they found themselves in utter darkness now with a smooth brick floor beneath their feet and a strong odor of oil and burnt fuel in their nostrils alaire was agreeably surprised in paloma jones for although the girl was wrought to a pitch of hysterical excitement she had nevertheless retained her wits nor had she faltered in the slightest it was evident that the fighting blood of her father was aroused in her for she said calmly when it gets light enough to shoot im going to get tad lewis dont act too quickly cautioned alaire perhaps your father and dave have come and gone anyhow we can warn them just as well by firing into the air in reply to this suggestion paloma merely muttered something under her breath the brief night ride had given alaire time in which to recover from her first apprehensions and now she was surprised at her own coolness eds behavior had shocked and horrified her she was still half paralyzed at his treachery nevertheless her mind was clear and she was determined to avert a tragedy if possible she knew only too well what would happen when blaze jones and dave law encountered the lewis gang the presence of longorios soldiers merely made more certain the outcome of that meeting the general was furious it was plain that he would not tolerate this expedition the avowed purpose of which was to prove him a liar it would make but little difference therefore whether the quest for ricardo guzmans body had been successful or not even the fact that this was american soil would not deter longorio from violent action for the rio grande was no real boundary and this part of texas was as truly mexican as that other riverbank which lay two hundred yards distant a confusion of such thoughts were racing through alaires mind as she felt her way out of the boilerroom and into that part of the building where the pumping machinery stood dusty cobwebbed windows let in a faint ghostglow of moonlight but prevented clear observation of anything outside alaires fumbling fingers found the latch of the front door and began to lift it when some one spoke just outside the building what did you discover inquired a voice which neither woman recognized paloma clutched blindly for her companion the two eavesdroppers stood rooted in their tracks the pounding of their hearts sounded loudly since the building was little more than a wooden shell they could plainly hear the answer the house is full of greasers i cant tell who they are a third man spoke this time in spanish that was tad lewis who just came senor there followed some whispered words indistinguishable to the listeners then a rustle of bodies moving through the tall grass and weeds paloma placed her lips close to alaires ear who are those people she breathed i dont know they must be the ones who came in that strange automobile paloma chattered viciously everybody in texas is here i wish wed thought to scatter tacks behind us cautiously they swung the door back and looked out the open space along the riverbank was leveled by the moonlight from moraless house to their right came the sound of voices the women waited a few moments then a number of men appeared paloma judged there were at least a dozen but she was too excited to count them as they came straggling toward the pumphouse one of them called back morales put out your damned lights both women recognized tad lewis as the speaker alaire had stubbornly refused to charge her husband with any active share in this evil business but her faith in ed suddenly vanished when she heard him say hush youre making too much noise youd better scatter out too for theres no telling where theyll land alaire leaned weakly against the door im going to leave and let youall attend to the rest he was saying but tad lewis halted him as he turned from the group where are you going ed you left your car back yonder by the road i almost ran into it eh what are you talking about my car is over by moraless house senor austin is in a great hurry sneered some one in spanish once more he leaves all of the fighting to his friends thats adolfo urbina panted paloma i know him stung by this open charge of cowardice austin began a voluble defense but in the midst of it general longorio addressed him sharply you will stay here senor nobody leaves this place i told you i wouldnt be a party to the business ed declared hotly you forced me to come in the first place yes and now i force you to stay longorios stand appeared to please lewis who chimed in with the words thats right ed youve got to stick for once in your life what do you mean you nearly ran into my car back yonder austin asked after a moment aint that your machine yonder by the thicket inquired lewis if it aint whose is it as no one answered he started in the direction he had indicated but at that moment a man came running from the riverbank crying softly look out they come im going to shoot paloma jones gasped but alaire who once again heard the sound of whispering in the shadows just outside their hidingplace managed to restrain her companion it was well that she succeeded for even as paloma raised her weapon a man passed swiftly by the crack of the halfopen door and scarcely ten feet beyond the muzzle of the rifle he was followed by three others the first of the newcomers acting as spokesman for his party stepped out into the moonlight and cried loudly hello men whats goin on here it was an american voice it had a broad slow texas drawl the group of plotters turned there was a startled murmur then tad lewis answered hello who are you what do you want i reckon we must have got off the road announced the stranger then he peered out across the river say aint that a skiff coming yonder he inquired well it dont look like a steamboat lewis laughed disagreeably were havin a little party of our own i reckon you fellows had better beat it understand the outposts that had been sent to cover the bank in both directions were now coming in through the stillness of the night there sounded the thump of oarlocks seeing that the stranger did not seem to take his hint lewis raised his voice menacingly thats your road back yonder its a right good road and id advise you to travel it fast but this suggestion was also ignored in fact it appeared to amuse the man addressed for he too laughed he turned and the women noticed that he carried a short saddlegun they saw also that at least one of the men at his back was similarly armed now whats the hurry the stranger was chuckling suddenly he raised his voice and called loudly hello dave is that youall the answer floated promptly back hello cap sure its us have you got him it was blaze joness voice which answered this time you bet paloma jones was trembling now she clung to alaire crying thankfully its the rangers the rangers then she broke away and ran out into the moonlight trailing her absurd firearm after her now boys the ranger captain was saying i know most every one of you and we aint going to have the least bit of trouble over this thing are we i reckon youall are friends of ricardo guzman and you just couldnt wait to find out about him eh alaire who had followed paloma was close enough now to recognize the two guzman boys as members of the ranger party lewis and his men had drawn together at the first alarm longorios mexicans had gathered about their leader the entire situation had changed in a moment and the ranger captain was in control of it soon dave law and blaze jones came up over the riverbank they paused stricken with surprise at finding a score of people where they had expected no more than four blaze was the first to speak what the hell he cried he peered nearsightedly from one to the other then his huge bulk shook with laughter say do my glasses magnify or is this an oddfellows meetin dad oh dad paloma scurried to him and flung herself into his arms lord of mercy kid the father exclaimed why youd ought to be home and abed long ago youll catch your death of cold is that gun loaded dave law was even more amazed than his companion his first glimpse of the waiting figures had warned him that something had gone wrong and therefore he did not stop to ask himself how tad lewis and longorio could have learned of this affair or what could have brought alaire and ed austin to the scene recovering from his first surprise he took a position beside his superior officer captain evans did not seem at all troubled by the disparity in numbers one ranger or two at the most had always been sufficient to quell a texan disturbance now that there were three of them he felt equal to an invasion of mexican soil if necessary in consequence he relaxed his watchful vigilance and to dave he drawled weve got most of the leading citizens of the county and i reckon somebody in the outfit will be able to identify guzman theres no trouble about that sir we found him pedro and raoul can make sure the sons of ricardo guzman stepped forward promptly and law waved them toward the boat landing where the two helpers were waiting with ricardos remains despite the ranger captains easy assumption of command the strain of the situation had not subsided and longorio drew swift attention to himself when he said it is fortunate that i chanced to learn of this matter you have done me a great service senor law for i came to romero purposely to examine into the death of this unfortunate man but i could learn nothing nobody knew anything whatever about the matter and so i became convinced that it amounted to little now behold i discover that i was deceived or perhaps there still may be a mistake blaze jones thrust his daughter aside and advanced toward the speaker theres no mistake he declared belligerently i dont make mistakes when i go graverobbin don ricardo was shot by your men he had five thousand dollars on him or he should have had and he was an american citizen your colonel blanco covered the body but hell have a hell of a job coverin the facts its time we came to a showdown with your murderin outfit and i aim to see if weve got a government in this country heaven guided my hand devoutly breathed the general it is regrettable that you used this means when a word to me would have served the purpose for it is no trivial matter to desecrate a mexican graveyard my country too has a government an officer of the state of texas under arms has crossed the rio grande what does that mean captain evans had a sense of humor longorios ominous words amused him say general it aint the first time he chortled and youre an officer too aint you youre in texas at this minute and ill bet if i frisked you id find that you was under arms the mexican understood english sufficiently well to grasp the significance of these words after a moments consideration therefore he modified his threatening tone but my mission was friendly i had no criminal purpose he said mildly however perhaps one offense condones the other at any rate we must have no international complications there is a more practical side to the matter if don ricardo guzman met his death in mexico there will be a rigid investigation i assure you evans agreed thats fair and ill make a bargain with you you keep still and soll we we never aimed for this affair to get out anyhow i reckon these men he indicated lewis and his followers aint liable to talk much the two guzman boys greatly moved returned to announce that they had indeed identified their fathers body and longorio could not well refuse to accept their evidence very well said he i am indebted to you since there is nothing more to be said apparently i will return to romero with a bow to mrs austin who had silently watched the play of these opposing motives he turned away and tad lewis followed him but dave law had recognized adolfo urbina in the crowd and stepping forward disarmed him saying adolfo theres a warrant for you so ill just take you in for a moment adolfo was inclined to resist but thinking better of it he yielded with bad grace bitterly regretting the curiosity which had prompted him to remain to the end of this interesting affair tad lewis gave him some comfort never mind adolfo he said they cant prove anything on you and ill go your bail ed austin knows where you was the day that stock was stole he and his two remaining men moved toward their automobile and a moment later the vehicle went clattering away up the thicket road so ended the attempt to foil the return of ricardo guzmans body to texas soil when alaire came to look for her husband he was gone xx superstitions and certainties the sensation caused by ricardo guzmans disappearance was as nothing to that which followed the recovery of his body by the next afternoon it was known from mexico to the canadian border that the old ranchman had been shot by mexican soldiers in romero it was reported that a party of americans had invaded foreign soil and snatched ricardos remains from under the nose of general longorio but there all reliable information ceased just how the rescue had been effected by whom it had been done what reasons had prompted it were a mystery with the first story the newspapers printed a terse telegram signed by captain evans and addressed to the governor of texas which read ranger force crossed rio grande and brought back the body of ricardo guzman this message created tremendous enthusiasm for the texas rangers have ever stood for prompt and decisive action but two hours after the publication of this despatch there came a sharp inquiry from washington and on the heels of that the state house at austin denied the receipt of any such message when this denial was in turn made public the newspapers demanded to know who had performed this sensational exploit one rumor had it that the sons of ricardo guzman had risked their lives to insure their father christian burial this was amplified by a touching penpicture of the ranchers weeping family waiting at the bank of the rio grande and an affecting account of the grief of the beautiful guzman girls it mattered not that there were no daughters in other quarters the expedition was credited to members of a secret order to which ricardo had belonged from a third source came a statement that the guzman family had hired a band of mexicans to exhume the body so that proof of death might be sufficient to satisfy an insurance company in which the rancher had held a policy even at jonesville there were conflicting rumors but whatever the facts of the rescue it was generally recognized that the result had been to bring on a crisis in the affairs of the two nations people declared that since the outrage was now proven the next move was the duty of the state department at washington therefore when several days passed and nothing was done a widespread feeling of indignation grew what mattered these diplomatic communications between the two governments it was asked why wait for another investigation by general longorio strong influences however were at work to prevent that very outcome for which the people of texas prayed during the delay there arose a report that ricardo guzman had borne an evil reputation and that he had been so actively associated with the rebel cause as to warrant punishment by the federal government moreover a legal question as to his american citizenship was raised a question which seemed to have important bearing upon the case public interest is shortlived few living men can hold it more than a day or two and it reckons no dead man worthy of more than an obituary notice other mexican offenses equally grave had failed to stir the administration to definite action the death of this obscure border ranchman did not seem to weigh very heavily in washington thus in the course of time the guzman incident was in a fair way of being officially forgotten and forgiven of course the people of texas did not forget nor did those who had personally known ricardo forgive dave law for instance felt bitter over the matter for he had counted upon prompt and definite results a little pressure properly applied would have wrung the truth from colonel blanco and fastened some measure of guilt upon the men who had actually arranged the murder dave did not doubt tad lewiss part in it but there was only one source from which pressure could be brought and when this failed he found his further efforts blocked there remained to him only the consolation of knowing that he had in a measure squared his account with old ricardo but there were several persons who felt intense relief at the course events had taken and among these was alaire austin in the days following that midnight expedition she had had ample time in which to meditate upon her husbands actions young ed had taken advantage of the confusion to slip out of the crowd and escape in his roadster and when alaire arrived at las palmas she had found that he was gone leaving behind no word as to when he would return it seemed probable that he had fled to san antonio there to remain until interest in the guzman matter had abated if ed was relieved to escape the immediate consequences of his connection with the affair his wife was no less thankful for his absence since it left her free to think and to plan their relations were becoming constantly more difficult she realized that it was impossible for her to go on in this way much longer before leaving ed had again rifled the safe thus disregarding for a second time his explicit agreement with his wife of course he was welcome to whatever money he needed even in excess of his allowance but his act showed his weak sense of honor and strengthened alaires conviction that he was in every way rapidly deteriorating as yet she could not believe him really wicked at heart he had many qualities which were above the average nor could she convince herself that he had been criminally involved in tad lewiss schemes and yet what other explanation could there be eds behavior had been extraordinary his evident terror at news of dave laws expedition his conversation with tad lewis over the telephone his subsequent actions at the river all seemed to indicate that he had some vital interest in maintaining the mystery of guzmans death what could it be suspicions like these were extremely disturbing in spite of herself alaire began to think more seriously about that separation which ed had so frequently offered her her whole nature it is true recoiled at the thought of divorce it was a thing utterly repugnant to her sentiment and her creed a thing that stood for notoriety gossip scandal deep in her heart she felt that divorce was wicked for marriage to her had always meant a sacred and unbreakable bond and yet there seemed to be no alternative she wished ed would go away leave her quietly and for ever so that she might live out her empty life in seclusion but that of course he would never do such longings were not strangers to alaire they were old and persistent enemies but of late the prospect of a loveless childless future was growing more and more unbearable even her day dreams failed to give their customary relief those imaginary figures with whom she took counsel were strangely unresponsive she had told paloma jones about her dreamchildren but she had not confessed the existence of another and a far more intimate creature of her brain one who occupied the place ed austin should have held there was such a person however and alaire called him her dream husband now this mans physical aspect was never long the same it altered according to her changing ideals or to the impression left by new acquaintances nevertheless he was in some ways the most real and the most tangible of all her pale romantic fancies no one who has watched a solitary child at play can doubt that it sees and hears playmates invisible to others alaire austin in the remotest depths of her being was still a child of late her prince had assumed new characteristics and a new form he was no longer any one of the many shapes he had been he was more like the spirit of the outofdoors a stronglimbed deepchested sunbronzed creature with a strain of gipsy blood that called to hers he was moody yet tender roughly masculine and yet possessed of the gentleness and poetry of a girl he was violent tempered he was brave he rode a magnificent bay mare that worshiped him as did all animals during one of these introspective periods alaire telephoned dave law arguing to herself that she must learn more about her husbands connection with the lewis gang dave arrived even sooner than she had expected she made him dine with her and they spent the evening on the dimlit gallery in the course of their conversation alaire discovered that dave too had a hidden side of his nature that he possessed an imagination and with it a quaint whimsical exploratory turn of mind which enabled him to talk interestingly of many things and many places on this particular evening he was anything but the man of iron she had known until she ventured to speak of ed then he closed up like a trap he was almost gruff in his refusal to say a word about her husband because of eds appropriation of the ranch cash alaire found it necessary a few days later to go to the bank and feeling the need of exercise she rode her horse montrose when her errands had been attended to she suddenly decided to call on paloma jones it was years since she had voluntarily done such a thing the very impulse surprised her paloma it happened was undergoing that peculiar form of feminine torture known as a fitting but insecurely basted pinned and tucked as she was she came flying down to the gate to meet her visitor alaire was introduced to mrs strange the dressmaker a large acidulous brunette with a mouthful of pins and then when paloma had given herself once more into the seamstresss hands the two friends gossiped since mrs strange was the first capable dressmaker who had ever come to jonesville paloma had closed her eyes and plunged with reckless extravagance now the girl insisted upon a general exhibition of her new wardrobe a sort of grand fashion review for the edification of her caller in the course of which she tried on all her dresses paloma was petite and well proportioned and the gowns were altogether charming alaire was honest in her praise and palomas response was one of wholehearted pleasure the girl beamed never before had she been so admired never until this moment had she adored a person as she adored mrs austin whose every suggestion as to fit and style was acted upon regardless of mrs strange i dont know what dad will say when he gets the bill for these dresses paloma confessed your father is a mighty queer man mrs strange observed i havent so much as laid eyes on him paloma nodded yes and hes getting more peculiar all the time i cant make out what ails him where is he now asked alaire heaven knows out in the barn or under the house taking advantage of the dressmakers momentary absence from the room paloma continued in a whisper i wish youd talk to dad and see what you make of him hes absolutely queer mrs strange seems to have a peculiar effect on him why its almost as if what well i suppose im foolish but im beginning to believe in spells you know mrs stranges husband is a sort of necromancer how silly there was no further opportunity for words as the woman reappeared at that instant but a little later alaire went in search of blaze still considerably mystified as she neared the farm buildings she glimpsed a mans figure hastily disappearing into the barn the figure bore a suspicious resemblance to blaze jones yet when she followed he was nowhere to be seen now this was curious for texas barns are less pretentious than those of the north and this one was little more than a carriagehouse and a shelter for agricultural implements mr jones alaire called she repeated blazes name several times then something stirred the door of a harness closet opened cautiously and out of the blackness peered palomas father he looked more owlish than ever behind his big goldrimmed spectacles what in the world are you doing in there she cried blaze emerged blinking he was dusty and perspiring hello miz austin he saluted her with a poor assumption of breeziness i was fixin some harness but im right glad to see you alaire regarded him quizzically what made you hide she asked hide who me i saw you dodge in here like a gopher blaze confessed i reckon ive got the willies every woman i see looks like that dam dressmaker paloma was telling me about you why do you hate her so i dont knows i hate her but her and her husband have put a jinx on me theyre the worst people i ever see miz austin you dont really believe in such things blaze dusted off a seat for his visitor saying i never did till lately but now im worse than a plantation nigger i tell you theres things in this world we dont sabe i wish youd get paloma to fire her ive tried and failed i wish youd tell her those dresses are rotten but theyre very nice theyre lovely and ive just been complimenting her now what has this woman done to you it seemed impossible that a man of blaze joness character could actually harbor crude superstitions and yet there was no mistaking his earnestness when he said i aint sure whether shes to blame or her husband but misfortune has folded me to herself how well im sick you dont look it i dont exactly feel it either but i am i dont sleep good my hearts actin up ive got rheumatism my stomach feels like id swallowed something alive youre smoking too much alaire affirmed with conviction but skepticism aroused blazes indignation with elaborate sarcasm he retorted i reckon thats why my best team of mules run away and dragged me through a tenacre patch of grass burrs on my belly eh its a wonder i wasnt killed i reckon i smoked so much that i give a tobacco heart to the best threeyearold bull in my pasture well i smoked him to death all right probably it was nicotine poisonin that killed twenty acres of my cotton too and maybe if id cut out bull durham id have floated that bond issue on the irrigation ditch but i was wedded to cigarettes so my banks are closin down on me sure thats what a man gets for smokin and do you attribute all these misfortunes to palomas dressmaker the man nodded gloomily that aint half everything goes wrong im scared to pack a weapon for fear ill injure myself why ive carried a bowieknife in my bootleg ever since i was a babe in arms you might say but the other day i jabbed myself with it and nearly got bloodpoisonin the very first time i ever laid eyes on this man and his wife a great misfortune overtook me and ever since they come to jonesville ive had a close squeeze to make a live of it this fellow strange with his fortunetellin and his charms and his conjures has hocuspocussed the whole neighborhood hes gettin rich off of the mexicans he knows more secrets than a priest he tells em whether their sweethearts love em whether a child is goin to be a boy or a girl and how to invest their money he is nothing more than a circus fakir mr jones yesm just the same these greasersd vote him into the legislature if he asked em why he knows who fetched back ricardo guzmans body he told me so really alaire looked up quickly then the smile left her face after a moment she said perhaps he could tell me something that i want to know now dont you get him started blaze cautioned hastily or hell put a spell on you like he did on me i want to know what ed had to do with the guzman affair blaze shook his head slowly well hes mixed up somehow with lewis dave thinks tad was at the bottom of the killin and he hoped to prove it on him but our government wont do anything and hes stumped for the time bein i dont know any more about eds dealins than you do miz austin all i know is that i got a serpent in my household and i cant get shed of her ive got a lapful of troubles of my own ive ordered paloma to let that woman go but pshaw its like a bowlegged man drivin a shoat there aint any headin paloma off when her minds made up you mark what i say that female spiderll sew venom into those dresses i never seen a woman with a mustache that was any good look here blaze drew a wellthumbed pack of playingcards from his pocket shuffle em and ill prove what i say if i dont turn up a dark woman three times out of five ill eat that saddleblanket dry alaire shuffled the deck and blaze cut the cards sure enough he exposed the queen of spades what did i tell you theres the bearded lady herself now ill shuffle and you cut alaire smilingly followed directions she separated the deck into three piles after which jones interpreted the oracle you got a good fortune miz austin theres a light man comin to your house danger and marriage youre goin to marry a light man alaires laughter rang out unaffectedly now you see how utterly absurd it is maybe it is and maybe it aint from another pocket jones drew a small volume entitled the combination fortuneteller and complete dictionary of dreams alaire reached to take it and the book dropped to the floor then as she stooped blaze cried wait hit it three times on the floor and say money money money as alaire was running over the pages of the book one of blazes ranchhands appeared in the door to ask him a question when the fellow had gone his employer rose and tiptoed after him then he spat through his crossed fingers in the direction the man had taken now what does that mean alaire inquired didnt you see hes crosseyed this is too occult for me she declared rising but im interested in what you say about mr strange if the mexicans tell him so much perhaps he can tell me something i do hope you have no more misfortunes you stay to supper blaze urged hospitably ill be in as soon as that tarantulas gone but alaire declined after a brief chat with paloma she remounted montrose and prepared for the homeward ride at the gate however she met dave law on his new mare and when dave had learned the object of her visit to jonesville he insisted upon accompanying her you have enough money in those saddlebags to tempt some of our very best citizens he told her if you dont mind ill just be your bodyguard very well she smiled but to make perfectly sure of our safety cross your fingers and spit eh seeing the amusement in her eyes he declared youve been talking to blaze well last night i dreamed i was eating chestnuts and he told me i was due for a great good fortune you see theres something in it after all and you must be the light man i discovered in the cards blaze declared you were coming to my house they jogged along side by side and law thanked his lucky stars for the encounter did blaze tell you how he came to meet the stranges no he only said they had brought him bad luck from the start dave grinned then in treacherous disregard of his promise to jones he recounted the tale of that disastrous defeat on the beach at galveston when he had finished the story which he ingeniously elaborated alaire was doubled over her saddle it was the first spontaneous laugh she had had for days and it seemed to banish her worries magically alaire was not of a melancholy temperament gaiety was natural to her and it had required many heartaches many disappointments to darken her blithe spirit nor was dave law a person of the comic type yet he was a gloomdispeller and now that alaire was beginning to know him better she felt a certain happy restfulness in his company the ride was long and the two proceeded leisurely stopping now and then to talk or to admire the banks of wild flowers beside the road no country is richer in spring blooms than is south texas the cactus had nearly done blooming now and its everlistening ears were absurdly warted with fruit gorgeous carpets of bluebonnets were spread beside the ditches while the air above was filled with thousands of yellow butterflies like whirling windblown petals of the pricklypear blossom montrose and montrosa enjoyed the journey also it was just the mode of traveling to please equine hearts for there were plenty of opportunities to nibble at the juicy grass and to drink at the little pools then too there were mad romping races during which the riders laughed and shouted it was law who finally discovered that they had somehow taken the wrong road the fact that alaire had failed to notice this gave him a sudden thrill it aroused in his mind such a train of dizzy drunken speculations that for some time following the discovery he jogged silently at his companions side it was early dusk when they reached las palmas it was nearly midnight when dave threw his leg across his saddle and started home alaires parting words rang sweetly in his ears this has been the pleasantest day i can remember the words themselves meant little but dave had caught a wistful undertone in the speakers voice and fancied he had seen in her eyes a queer halffrightened expression as of one just awakened jose sanchez had beheld dave law at the las palmas table twice within a few days he spent this evening laboriously composing a letter to his friend and patron general luis longorio xxi an awakening time was when phil strange boasted that he and his wife had played every fairground and seaside amusementpark from coney island to galveston in his battered wardrobetrunks were parts of old costumes scrapbooks of clippings and a goodly collection of lithographs some advertising the supernatural powers of professor magi sovereign of the unseen world and others the accomplishments of mlle le garde renowned serpent enchantress in these gaudy portraits of magi the mystic no one would have recognized phil strange and even more difficult would it have been to trace a resemblance between mrs strange and the blond bushyheaded mlle le garde of the posters nevertheless the likenesses at one time had been considered not too flattering and phil treasured them as evidences of imperishable distinction but the stranges had tired of public life for a long time the wife had confessed to a lack of interest in her vocation which amounted almost to a repugnance snakecharming she had discovered was far from an ideal profession for a woman of refinement it possessed unpleasant features and even such euphemistic titles as serpent enchantress and reptilian mesmerist failed to rob the calling of a certain odium a suggestion of vulgarity in the minds of the more discriminating this had become so distressing to mrs stranges finer sensibilities that she had voiced a yearning to forsake the platform and pit for something more congenial and finally she had prevailed upon phil to make a change the step had not been taken without misgivings but a benign providence had watched over the pair mrs strange was a natural seamstress and luck had directed her and phil to a community which was not only in need of a good dressmaker but peculiarly ripe for the talents of a soothsayer phil too had intended to embrace a new profession but he had soon discovered that jonesville offered better financial returns to a man of his accepted gifts than did the choicest of seaside concessions and therefore he had resumed his old calling under a slightly different guise before long he acknowledged himself well pleased with the new environment for his wife was far happier in draping dress goods upon the figures of her customers than in hanging python folds about her own and he found his own fame growing with every day his mediumistic gifts came into general demand the country people journeyed miles to consult him and blaze joness statement that they confided in the fortuneteller as they would have confided in a priest was scarcely an exaggeration phil did indeed become the repository for confessions of many sorts contrary to blazes belief however strange was no prince of darkness and took little joy in some of the secrets forced upon him phil was a good man in his way so conscientious that certain information he acquired weighed him down with a sense of unpleasant responsibility chancing to meet dave law one day he determined to relieve himself of at least one troublesome burden but dave was not easily approachable he met the mediums allusions to the occult with contemptuous amusement nor would he consent to a private reading strange grew almost desperate enough to speak the ungarnisned truth youd better pay a little attention to me he grieved ive got a message to you from the unseen world charges collect i reckon the ranger grinned strange waved aside the suggestion it came unbidden and i pass it on for what its worth as dave turned away he added hastily its about a skeleton in the chaparral and a redhaired woman dave stopped he eyed the speaker curiously go on said he but a public street strange explained was no place for psychic discussions if dave cared to come to his room where the surroundings were favorable to thought transference and where phils spirit control could have a chance to make itself felt they would interrogate the unseen forces further dave agreed when they were alone in the fortunetelling parlor he sat back while the medium closed his eyes and prepared to explore the invisible after a brief delay phil began i see a great many things that woman i told you about and three men one of em is you the other two is mexicans youre at a waterhole in the mesquite now theres a shooting scrape i see the body of a dead man the speaker became silent evidently his cataleptic vision was far from perfect but he soon began to drone again now i behold a stranger at the same waterhole hes alone hes looking for something he rides in circles hes off his horse and bending over what a skeleton yes its the skeleton of one of them other mexicans stranges voice became positively sepulchral as his spirit control took fuller possession of his earthly shell and as his visions resolved themselves into clearer outline see he swears an oath to avenge and now the scene changes everything dissolves im in a mansion and the redhaired woman comes toward me over her head floats that skeleton dave broke in crisply all right lets get down to cases whats on your mind strange the psychic simulated a shudder a painful contortion such as any one might suffer if rudely jerked out of the spirit world eh what was i there youve broke the connection he declared did i tell you anything no but evidently you can im sorry they never come back rot phil was hurt indignant with some stiffness he explained the danger of interrupting a seance of this sort but law remained obdurate you can put over that secondsight stuff with the greasers he declared sharply but not with me so jose sanchez has been to see you and you want to warn me is that it i dont know any such party strange protested he eyed his caller for a moment then with an abrupt change of manner he complained say bo whats the matter with you ive got a reputation to protect and i do things my own way im getting set to slip you something and you try to make me look like a sucker is that any way to act i prefer to talk to you when your eyes are open i know all about you dont know nothing about anything snapped the other joses got it in for mrs austin you said you didnt know him well i dont hes never been to see me in his life but his sweetheart has rosa morales comes regular rosa joses sweetheart yes her and jose have joined out together since you shot panfilo and theyre framing something what for instance the fortuneteller hesitated i only wish i knew he said slowly it looks to me like a killing dave nodded probably is jose would like to get me and of course the girl oh they dont aim to get you you aint the one theyre after no who then i dont know nothing definite in this business you understand a fellow has to put two and two together sometimes i have to make one and two count four i have to tell moren im told i have to shoot my game on the wing for nobody tells me any moren they dast all the same im sure jose aint carving no epitaph for you from what ive dug out of rosa hes acting for a third party somebody with pull and a lot of coin but who it is i dont know anyhow hes cooking trouble for the austins and i want to stand from under now that the speaker had dropped all pretense he answered daves questions without evasion and told what he knew it was not much to daves way of thinking but it was enough to give cause for thought and when the men finally parted it was with the understanding that strange would promptly communicate any further intelligence on this subject that came his way on the following day daves duties called him to brownsville where court was in session he had planned to leave by the morning train but as he continued to meditate over stranges words he decided that before going he ought to advise alaire of the fellows suspicions in order that she might discharge jose sanchez and in other ways protect herself against his possible spite since the matter was one that could not well be talked over by telephone dave determined to go in person to las palmas that evening truth to say he was hungry to see alaire by this time he had almost ceased to combat the feeling she aroused in him and it was in obedience to an impulse far stronger than friendly anxiety that he hired a machine and shortly after dark took the river road the fates are malicious jades they delight in playing illnatured pranks upon us not content with spinning and measuring and cutting the threads of our lives to suit themselves they must also tangle the skein causing us to cut capers to satisfy their whims at no time since meeting alaire had dave law been more certain of his moral strength than on this evening at no time had his grip upon himself seemed firmer nor had alaire the least reason to doubt her selfcontrol dave to be sure had appealed to her fancy and her interest in fact he so dominated her thoughts that the imaginary creature whom she called her dreamhusband had gradually taken on his physical likeness but the idea that she was in any way enamoured of him had never entered her mind that she could ever be tempted to yield to him to be false to her ideals of wifehood was inconceivable in such wise do the fates amuse themselves alaire had gone to her favorite afterdinner refuge a nook on one of the sidegalleries where there was a wide swinging wicker couch and there in a restful obscurity fragrant with unseen flowers she had prepared to spend the evening with her dreams she did not hear daves automobile arrive her first intimation of his presence came with the sound of his heel upon the porch when he appeared it was almost like the materialization of her uppermost thought quite as if a figure from her fancy had stepped forth full clad she rose and met him smiling how did you know i wanted to see you she inquired dave took her hand and looked down at her framing a commonplace reply but for some reason the words lay unspoken upon his tongue alaires informal greeting her parted lips the welcoming light in her eyes had sent them flying it seemed to him that the dim halflight which illumined this nook emanated from her face and her person that the fragrance which came to his nostrils was the perfume of her breath and at the prompting of these thoughts all his smothered longings rose as if at a signal as mutinous prisoners in a jail delivery overpower their guards so did daves longrepressed emotions gain the upper hand of him now and so swift was their uprising that he could not summon more than a feeble panicky resistance the awkwardness of the pause which followed alaires inquiry strengthened the rebellious impulses within him and quite unconsciously his friendly grasp upon her fingers tightened for her part as she saw this sudden change sweep over him her own face altered and she felt something within her breast leap into life no woman could have failed to read the meaning of his sudden agitation and strange to say it worked a similar state of feeling in alaire she strove to control herself and to draw away but instead found that her hand had answered his and that her eyes were flashing recognition of his look all in an instant she realized how deathly tired of her own struggle she had become and experienced a reckless impulse to cast away all restraint and blindly meet his first advance she had no time to question her yearnings she seemed to understand only that this man offered her rest and security that in his arms lay sanctuary to both it seemed that they stood there silently hand in hand for a very long time though in reality there was scarcely a moment of hesitation on the part of either a drunken breathless instant of uncertainty then alaire was on daves breast and his strength his ardor his desire was throbbing through her her bare arms were about his neck a sigh the token of utter surrender fluttered from her throat she raised her face to his and their lips melted together for a time they were all alone in the universe the center of all ecstasy dave was whispering wild incoherencies as alaire lay in his embrace her limbs relaxed her flesh touching his her body clinging to his dreamman she murmured as consciousness returns after a swoon so did realization return to alaire austin faintly uncertainly at first then with a swift strong effort she pushed herself out of daves reluctant arms they stood apart frightened daves gaze was questioning alaire began to tremble and to struggle with her breath are we mad she gasped what have we done theres no use righting it was here it was bound to come out oh alaire dont she shook her head and avoiding his outstretched hands went to the edge of the veranda and leaned weakly against a pillar with her head in the crook of her arm dave followed her but the words he spoke were scarcely intelligible finally she raised her face to his no it is useless to deny itnow that we know but i didnt know until a moment ago ive known all the time ever since the first moment i saw you he told her hoarsely to me youre all there is nothing else matters and you love me god i wonder if im awake dreamman she repeated more slowly oh why did you come so late so late yes we must think it out the best way we can i wonder what you think of me you must know theres no need for excuses theres nothing to explain except the miracle that such great happiness could come to a fellow like me happiness it means anything but that i was miserable enough before what shall i do now why readjust your life he cried roughly surely you wont hesitate after this but alaire did not seem to hear him she was staring out into the night again what a failure i must be she murmured finally i suppose i should have seen this coming but i didnt and in his house too this dress is his and these jewels everything she held up her hands and stared curiously at the few rings she wore as if seeing them for the first time how does that make you feel dave stirred there was resentment in his voice when he answered your husband has sacrificed his claim to you as everybody knows to my mind he has lost his rights youre mine mine by god he waved a vigorous gesture of defiance ill take you away from him at any cost ill see that he gives you up somehow youre all i have of course the law provides a way but you wouldnt couldnt understand how i feel about divorce the mere mention of the word was difficult and caused alaire to clench her hands were both too shaken to talk sanely now so lets wait theres something you must understand before we go any further dave insisted im poor i havent a thing i can call my own so im not sure i have any right to take you away from all this he turned a hostile eye upon their surroundings most people would say that ive simply wasted my life perhaps i have that depends upon the way you look at it and upon what you consider worth while anyhow all i can offer you is love he broke off momentarily as if his breath had suddenly failed him greater love it seems to me than any woman ever had money means so little and its so easy to be happy without it alaire told him but im not altogether poor of course everything here is eds but i have enough all my life ive had everything except the very thing you offer and how ive longed for that how ive envied other people do you think ill be allowed somehow to have it yes ive something to say about that you gave me the right when you gave me that kiss alaire shook her head im not sure it seems easy now while you are here but how will it seem later im in no condition at this minute to reason perhaps as you say it is all a dream perhaps this feeling i have is just a passing frenzy dave laughed softly confidently its too new yet for you to understand but wait it is frenzy witchery yes and more tomorrow and every day after it will grow and grow and grow trust me ive watched it in myself so you cared for me from the very first alaire questioned it was the womans curiosity the womans hunger to hear over and over again that truth which never fails to thrill and yet never fully satisfies oh even before that i think when you came to my fire that evening in the chaparral i knew every line of your face every movement of your body every tone of your voice as a man knows and recognizes his ideal but it took time for me to realize all you meant to me alaire nodded yes and it must have been the same with me she met his eyes frankly but when he reached toward her she held him away no dear not yet not again not until we have the right it would be better for us both if you went away now no no oh i have so much to say ive been dumb all my life and youve just opened my lips please after ive decided what to do once i feel that i can control myself better ill send for you but you must promise not to come until then for you would only make it harder it required all daves determination to force himself to obey her wish and the struggle nearly kept him from recalling the original object of his visit remembering he tried to tell alaire what he had learned from phil strange but so broken and so unconvincing was his recital that he doubted if she understood in the least what he was talking about at last he took her hand and kissed her wrist just over her pulse as if to speed a message to her heart then into her rosy palm he whispered a tender something that thrilled her she stood white motionless against the dim illumination of the porch until he had gone and not until the last sound of his motor had died away did she stir then she pressed her own lips to the palm he had caressed and walked slowly to her room xxii what ellsworth had to say on his way to brownsville the next morning dave found himself still somewhat dazed by his sudden happiness the more he thought of it the more wonderful it seemed during the day he went through his court duties like a man in a trance such joy as this was unbelievable he felt as if he must tell the world about it he well understood alaires repugnance to divorce but he was sure that he could overcome it if indeed her own truer understanding of herself did not relieve him of that necessity for at this moment his desires were of a heat sufficient to burn away all obstacles no matter how solid it seemed therefore that the future was all sunshine he had no opportunity of speaking with judge ellsworth until court adjourned then the judge took him by the arm with that peculiarly flattering assumption of intimacy of which he was master and led the way toward his office inquiring meanwhile for news of jonesville daves high spirits surprised him and finally impelled him to ask the cause when dave hinted unmistakably at the truth ellsworth exclaimed with a sharp stare of curiosity see here you havent forgotten what i told you that night on the train what yes i had forgotten you promised to tell me if you thought seriously about marriage very well then im telling you now do you mean that dave of course i do but dont look at me as if id confessed to arson or burglary listen judge if you have good taste in jewelry ill let you help me select the ring but judge ellsworth continued to stare and then muttered uncertainly youre such a joker dave assumed a show of irony your congratulations overwhelm me you look as if you were about to begin the reading of the will i want to hear about this right away ellsworth smiled faintly can you come to my office tonight where we can be alone dave agreed to the appointment and went his way with a feeling of amusement old folks are usually curious he reflected and they are prone to presume upon the privileges that go with age in this instance however it might be well to make a clean breast of the affair since ellsworth was alaires attorney and would doubtless be selected to secure her divorce the judge was waiting when dave called after supper but for some time he maintained a flow of conversation relating to other things than the one they had met to discuss at last however he appeared to summon his determination he cleared his throat and settled himself in his chair premonitory signs unusual in a man of ellsworths poise and selfassurance i reckon you think im trying to mix up in something that doesnt concern me he began and perhaps i am maybe youll make me wish id minded my own business thats what usually happens i remember once out of pure chivalry trying to stop a fellow from beating his wife of course they both turned on me as they always do i went to the hospital for a week and lost a profitable divorce case however we try to do our duty as we see it this was anything but a promising preamble dave wondered too at his friends obvious nervousness so youve found the girl eh the judge went on yes are you accepted i mean have you asked her to marry you of course i have thats about the first thing a fellow does ellsworth shuffled the papers on his desk with an abstracted gaze then said slowly dave i dont think you ought to marry so you told me once before i suppose you mean im poor and a failure oh no all men are failures until they marry im thinking of what marriage means of the new duties it brings of the mans duty to himself to the woman and to society im thinking of what lies inside of the man himself umm thats pretty vague ive studied you a long time dave and with a reason ive studied heredity too and you mustnt marry law stirred in his chair and smiled whimsically ive done some studying along those lines too and i reckon i know myself pretty well ive the usual faults but ellsworth interrupted you dont know yourself at all my boy theres just the trouble im the only man living man that is who knows you for the first time he looked directly at his caller and now his lids were lifted until the eyes peered out bright hard and piercing something in his face startled dave i was your fathers attorney and his friend i know how he lived and how he died i know what killed him you mean dont you that you know who killed him i mean just what i say dave leaned forward studying the speaker curiously well come through whats on your mind he demanded finally the guadalupes had to kill him dave had to had to why dont you know dont you know anything about your family history dave shook his head well then he was insane insane yes violently really i why i suppose you know what youre talking about but it sounds incredible yes it must to you especially since you never knew the facts very few people did know then even at the time for there were no newspapers in that part of mexico you of course were a boy at school in the united states nevertheless its true that part of the story which i didnt know at the time i learned by talking with general guadalupe and others it was very shocking daves face was a study his color had lessened slightly he wet his lips this is news of course said he but it doesnt explain my mothers death who killed her if not the guadalupes cant you guess thats what i meant when i said they had to kill frank law ellsworth maintained his fixity of gaze and when dave started he nodded his head its gods truth the details were too dreadful your father turned his hand against the woman he loved and died a wifekiller the guadalupes had to destroy him like a mad dog im sorry you had to learn the truth from me my boy but it seems necessary that i tell you when i knew frank law he was like any other man quicktempered a little too violent perhaps but apparently as sane as you or i and yet the thing was there dave rose from his chair and bent over the desk so thats what youve been driving at he gasped thats what you meant when you said i shouldnt marry he began to tremble now his voice became hoarse with fury now i understand youre trying to tell me that maybe ive got it in me eh hell youre crazy not i im all right i reckon i know he didnt know ellsworth said quietly i doubt if he even suspected dave struck the desk violently with his clenched fist bosh youre hipped on this heredity subject crazy why you doddering old fool with an effort he calmed himself realizing that he had shouted his last words he turned away and made a circuit of the room before returning to face his friend i didnt mean to speak to you like that judge you pulled this on me too suddenly and im upset but it merely proves my own contention that im not frank laws son at all ive always known it how do you know it dont you suppose i can tell in spite of himself daves voice rose again but it was plain from the lawyers expression that to a man of his training no mere conviction unsupported by proof had weight this skepticism merely kept daves impatience at a white heat very well then he argued angrily lets say that im wrong and youre right lets agree that i am his son what of it what makes you think ive inherited the damned thing it isnt a disease me insane rot he laughed harshly took another uncertain turn around the room then sank into his chair and buried his face in his hands ellsworth was more keenly distressed than his hearer imagined when next he spoke his voice was unusually gentle it is a disease dave or worse and theres no way of proving that you havent inherited it if there is the remotest possibility that you have if you have the least cause to suspect why you couldnt marry and bring children into the world now could you ask yourself if youve shown any signs oh i know what you mean youve always said i go crazy when imangry well thats true but its nothing more than a villainous temper im all right again afterward i wasnt thinking so much of that but are you sure its altogether temper the judge insisted you dont merely lose control of yourself youve told me more than once that you go completely out of your mind that you see red and want to kill and dont you i never felt the slightest desire to destroy no matter how angry i chanced to be ive always asserted that murderers homicides suicides were irresponsible that they were sick here ellsworth touched his forehead i cant see how any sane man can take his own or anothers life no matter what the provocation but im not a doctor and thats an extreme view i know anyhow youll agree that if you have frank laws blood in your veins it wont do to marry i havent got it the younger man groaned his gaze turned sullenly downward even granting that i have thats no sign id ever run amuck the way he did you told me just now that you dont know your family history yes what little ive heard isnt very pretty nor very much to the familys credit they were a bad lot i believe frank law had two brothers and a sister had he not yes one of my uncles was a tough hombre im told he notched his gun pretty well he was about the worst man of his day he was shot in dodge city on one of his rampages dave raised shocked and curious eyes you think he was crazy most of those oldtime gunmen would be so considered nowadays some unbelievable stories are told about that uncle of yours the other one disappeared mysteriously i believe so he just walked away from his wife and family and business one day and was never heard of again ellsworth seemed to consider this admission significant now the sister your aunt i think shes somewhere in the east i never saw her she is shes an inmate of an institution the name and address of which i have here ellsworth thrust his finger into the loose pile of documents before him avoiding his callers eyes he continued you cant very well ignore such a family history dave ive never traced it back beyond the last generation but you probably could if you tried in a voice hardly his own dave articulated god this is hideous it is id like to believe that you dont belong to the laws but i cant put much faith in that childhood fancy of yours run it down convince yourself but first go to the girl whoever she is and tell her the facts if shes the right sort no no the words were wrung from daves lips she knows too well how heredity acts shes had one experience eh you say she knows who is she dave dont tell me you mean alaire dave nodded damnation ellsworth leaped to his feet and striding around the desk seized his caller roughly by the shoulder what are you telling me good god alaire a married woman so you cut under ed austin eh momentarily ellsworth lost control of himself his eyes blazed and his fingers tightened painfully what damnable trick have you played on that girl tell me before i choke you for once dave laws passion failed to ignite at the heat of anothers anger he only sat limp and helpless in the judges grasp finally he muttered i played square enough its one of those things that just happen we couldnt help ourselves shell come to you for her divorce the lawyer uttered a shocking oath then its no mere romantic infatuation on her part oh no ellsworth loosed his grip he turned away and began to pace the office floor shaking his head this is unfortunate alaire of all people as if she didnt have enough to bear he turned fiercely upon the cowering figure in the chair saying ill tell her the whole truth myself before she goes any further no oh please let me in my own way dave writhed and sank his face in his hands once more after a while he said im waiting for you to tell me its all a nightmare humph the judge continued his restless pacing i was sorry for you when you came in here and it took all my strength to tell you but now you dont matter at all i was prepared to have you go ahead against my advice but ill see you damned first you have damned me when ellsworth saw the haggard face turned to his he ceased his walk abruptly im all broken up dave he confessed in a gentler tone than he had used heretofore but youll thank me some day law was no longer the big strong confident fellow who had entered the office such a short time before he had collapsed he seemed to have shrunk he was pitifully appealing although there were many things he would have said many questions upon his tongue he could not voice them now and it was with extreme difficulty that he managed to follow the judges words at all after a time he rose and shook ellsworths hand limply mechanically then he shambled out of the office like a sick man he stumbled down the stairs and into the street when he entered his hotel the clerk and some of the idlers in the lobby looked at him queerly but he did not see them all that night dave walked the floor of his room or sat hunched up on the edge of his bed staring at the wall and fighting the fears that preyed upon him he had faith enough in alaire to believe that she would marry him regardless of the facts her kiss that one delirious moment when he had held her to his breast had taught him much and it was in fact this very certainty which made his struggle so hard after all why not he asked himself a thousand times ellsworths fears were surely exaggerated who could say that frank law had passed on his heritage there was at least a chance that he had not and it would require more than a remote possibility more evidence than ellsworth could summon to dismay alaire suppose it should transpire that he was somehow defective what then the signs of his mental failing would give ample warning he could watch himself carefully and study his symptoms he could lead the life of a sentinel perpetually on guard the thing might never come or at the worst it probably would not manifest itself until he was further along in years that it seemed was the family history and in such a case dave was assured of half a life at least ellsworth was altogether too fearful yes and he was too officious by far this was something that did not concern him but such reasoning naturally brought little comfort daves fears would not be put down in common with most men of splendid physique he had a vague contempt for those less perfect disease or deformity had never failed to awaken his pity and he had often argued that defective human beings like unhealthy stock should not be allowed to mate and to perpetuate their weaknesses this eugenic conviction had helped to ease his conscience somewhat during his acquaintance with alaire for he had told himself that ed austin by reason of his inherited vices had sacrificed all right to love and marriage these thoughts came home now to roost what was eds evil heritage compared to his own it was as vinegar to vitriol and yet shining through all daves distress like a faint flickering beacon in a storm was that old doubt of his parentage and to this he finally began to pin his hopes in the day or two that followed his interview with ellsworth it afforded him almost the only comfort he knew for in the end he had to face the truth he could not marry if he were really frank laws son those were dark hours for dave he discharged his duties automatically taking no interest whatever in his work his nights he spent in morose meditation unable to sleep he tramped the hot streets in an effort to fight off his growing nervousness he became irritable despondent his eyes took on the look of an invalids his face aged and grayed physically too he grew very tired for no burden is heavier to bear than that of doubt and indecision one afternoon ellsworth entered his office to find dave waiting for him the young man began in a shaky husky voice i cant stand it judge im going to pieces fast you do look bad yes i dont sleep im so irritable i cant get along up at the courthouse im licked the worst of it is i dont know whether its all imagination or whether you really stirred up that devilish sleeping thing in me anyhow something has got me all i can do is study and analyze and watch and imagine i sit all night thinking thinking until everything gets queer and distorted if i were sane before youve about unbalanced me with your damnable suggestions a few nights of sleep will make you feel better ellsworth said gravely i tried drugs but they made me worse god then my fancies were sick no im going to get out where how im going north to look up the members of my family and learn who i really am i resigned from the ranger force today thats no place for a fellow with a homicidal mania dave youre taking this thing too absolutely and too hard ellsworth declared but dave went on unheeding another reason why i want to get away now is that alaire will expect me to come to her when she sends for me and i wouldnt dare trust myself have you told her written her not yet and i shant until i trace out the last doubt in my own mind in an effort to cheer ellsworth put his arm about the sufferers shoulders im sure youll do the right thing dave he said maybe after all your instinct is true and youre not frank laws boy i hope so for this thing weighs me down as it weighs you but you mustnt let it whip you dont give in and meanwhile above all things try to get some sleep dave nodded and mumbled something then he slouched out leaving the lawyer overcome by a great pity ellsworth had seen men stunned by a court sentence turn away from the bar with that same dumb fixed look of hopelessness in their eyes impulsively he cursed the sense of duty that had prompted him to interfere xxiii the crash the several days following daves unexpected call at las palmas alaire spent in a delightful reverie she had so often wrestled with the question of divorce that she had begun to weary of it and now when she tried to summon energy to consider it anew she found herself as usual reasoning in a circle and arriving at no decision she gave up trying at length and for the time being rested content in the knowledge that she loved and was loved in her heart she knew well enough what her ultimate course would be sooner or later events would force her action yielding to a natural cowardice therefore she resigned herself to dreamy meditations and left the future to take care of itself a week passed while she hugged her thoughts to her breast and then one evening she rode home to learn that ed had returned from san antonio but ed was ill and he did not appear at dinner it had been years since either had dared invade the others privacy and now inasmuch as her husband did not send for her alaire did not presume to offer her services as nurse as a matter of fact she considered this quite unnecessary for she felt sure that he was either suffering the customary aftereffects of a visit to the city or else that he lacked the moral courage to undertake an explanation of his hurried flight from the ranch in either event she was glad he kept to his room heretofore their formal relations had made life at least tolerable to alaire but now she experienced a feeling of guilt at finding herself under the same roof with him oddly enough it seemed to her that in this she wronged dave and not her husband for she reasoned that having given her love to one man her presence in the same house with another outraged that love when austin made his appearance on the day following his return his bleared eyes his puffy pasty cheeks his shattered nerves showed plainly enough how he had spent his time although he was jumpy and irritable he seemed determined by an assumption of high spirits and exaggerated friendliness to avert criticism since alaire spared him all reproaches his efforts seemed to meet with admirable success now eds opinion of women was not high for those with whom he habitually associated were of small intelligence and seeing that his wife continued to manifest a complete indifference to his past actions he decided that his apprehensions had been groundless if alaire remembered the guzman affair at all or if she had suspected him of complicity in it time had evidently dulled her suspicions and he was a little sorry he had taken pains to stay away so long before many days however he discovered that this indifference of hers was not assumed and that in some way or other she had changed ed was accustomed when he returned exhausted from a debauch to seeing in his wifes eyes a strained misery he had learned to expect in her bearing a sort of pitying hopeless resignation but this time she was not in the least depressed on the contrary she appeared happier fresher and younger than he had seen her for a long time it was mystifying when one morning he overheard her singing in her room he was shocked over this phenomenon he meditated with growing amazement and a faint stir of resentment in his breast for he lived a selfcentered life considering himself the pivot upon which revolved all the affairs of his little world to feel that he had lost even the power to make his wife unhappy argued that he had overestimated his importance at length having sufficiently recovered his health to begin drinking again he yielded one evening to an alcoholic impulse and just as alaire bade him good night clumsily sought to force an explanation see here he shot at her whats the matter with you lately he saw that he had startled her and that she made an effort to collect her wandering thoughts youre about as warm and wifely as a stone idol am i any different to what i have always been humph you havent been exactly sympathetic of late here i come home sick and you treat me like one of the help dont you think i have feelings jove im lonesome alaire regarded him speculatively then shook her head as if in answer to some thought in an obvious and somewhat too mellow effort to be friendly ed continued dont lets go on like this alaire you blame me for going away so much but good lord when im home i feel like an interloper you treat me like a cowthief im sorry ive tried to be everything i should im the interloper nonsense if we only got along together as well as we seem to from the outside it wouldnt be bad at all but youre too severe you seem to think a man should be perfect well none of us are and im no worse than the majority why i know lots of fellows who forget themselves and do things they shouldnt but they dont mean anything by it they have wives and homes to go to when its all over but have i youre as glad to see me as if i had smallpox maybe weve made a mess of things but married life isnt what young girls think it is a wife must learn to give and take ive given what have i taken she asked him in a voice that quivered ed made an impatient gesture oh dont be so literal i mean that since were man and wife its up to you to be a little more broadgauge in your views in other words you want me to ignore your conduct is that it im afraid we cant argue that ed within the last few days austins mind had registered a number of new impressions and at this moment he realized that his wife was undoubtedly the most attractive woman physically he had ever known of course she was cold but she had not always been so he had chilled her he had seen the fire die year by year but now the memory of her as she had once been swept over him bringing a renewed appreciation of her charms his recent dissipation had told upon him as heavily as a siege of sickness and this evening he was in that fatuous sentimental mood which comes with convalescence having no fault to find with himself and feeling merely a selfish desire to make more pleasant his life at las palmas he undertook to bend alaire to his will all right dont lets try to argue it he laughed with what he considered an admirable show of magnanimity i hate arguments anyhow id much rather have a goodnight kiss but when he stooped over her alaire held him off and turned her head no she said you havent kissed me for i dont wish to kiss you dont be silly he insisted this suggestion of physical resistance excited his love of conquest and awoke something like the mood of a lover such a lover as a man like ed could be for a moment he felt as if alaire were some other woman than his wife a woman who refused and yet half expected to be overcome therefore he laughed selfconsciously and repeated come now i want a kiss alaire thrust him back strongly and he saw that her face had whitened oddly enough her stubbornness angered him out of all reason and he began a harsh remonstrance but he halted when she cried wait i must tell you something ed its all over and has been for a long time were going to end it end it we cant go on living together why should we so divorce is that it alaire nodded well ill be damned ed was dumfounded isnt this rather sudden he managed to inquire oh no youve suggested it more than once i thought you didnt believe in divorces couldnt stomach em whats happened i have changed my mind humph people dont change their minds in a minute he cried angrily is there some other man now ed austin had no faintest idea that his wife would answer in the affirmative for he had long ago learned to put implicit confidence in her and her life had been so open that he could not imagine that it held a double interest therefore her reply struck him speechless yes ed she said quietly there is another man it was like her not to evade she had never lied to him eds mouth opened his reddened eyes protruded well he stammered well by god then after a moment who is it the greaser or the cowboy he laughed loudly disagreeably it must be one or the other for you havent seen any men except them another man well youre cool about it i am glad you know the truth muttering to himself ed made a short excursion around the room then paused before his wife with a sneer on his lips did it ever occur to you that i might object he demanded alaire eyed him scornfully what right have you to object ed could not restrain a malevolent gleam of curiosity say who is it aint i entitled to know that much as alaire remained silent he let his eyes rove over her with a kind of angry appreciation youre pretty enough to stampede any man he admitted yes and youve got money too ill bet its the ranger so youve been having your fling while i was away hunh were tarred with the same stick you dont really believe that she told him sharply why not youve had enough opportunity i dont see anything of you and havent for years well i was a fool to trust you alaires eyes were very dark and very bright as she said i wonder how i have managed to live with you as long as i have i knew you were weak nasty so i was prepared for something like this but i never thought you were a downright criminal until criminal rot how about that guzman affair you cant go much lower ed and you cant keep me here with you i cant keep you eh he growled well perhaps not i suppose youve got enough on me to secure a divorce but i can air some of your dirty linen oh dont look like that i mean it didnt you spend a night with david law he leered at her unpleasantly then followed a step as she drew back dont you touch me she cried a flush was deepening eds purple cheeks his voice was peculiarly brutal and throaty as he said the decree isnt entered yet and so long as you are mrs austin i have rights yes and i intend to exercise them youve made me jealous and by god he made to encircle her with his arms and was half successful but when alaire felt the heat of his breath in her face a sick loathing sprang up within her and setting her back against the wall she sent him reeling whether she struck him or merely pushed him away she never knew for during the instant of their struggle she was blind with indignation and fury profiting by her advantage she dodged past him fled to her room and locked herself in she heard him muttering profanely heard him approach her chamber more than once then retire uncertainly but she knew him too well to be afraid later that night she wrote two letters one to judge ellsworth the other to dave law jose sanchez rode to the morales house feeling some concern over the summons that took him thither he wondered what could have induced general longorio to forsake his many important duties in order to make the long trip from nuevo pueblo surely it could be due to no lack of zeal on his joses part no the horsebreaker flattered himself that he had made a very good spy indeed that he had been longorios eyes and ears so far as circumstances permitted nor did he feel that he had been lax in making his reports for through rosa he had written the general several lengthy letters and just for good measure these two had conjured up sundry imaginary happenings to prove beyond doubt that senora austin was miserably unhappy with her husband and ready to welcome such a dashing lover as longorio therefore jose could not for the life of him imagine wherein he had been remiss nevertheless he was uneasy and he hoped that nothing had occurred to anger his general but longorio when he arrived at the meetingplace was not in a bad humor having sent rosa away on some errand he turned to jose with a flashing smile and said well my good friend the time has come now jose had no faintest idea what the general was talking about but to be called the good friend of so illustrious a person was flattering he nodded decisively yes beyond doubt he agreed mexico is in a bad way these rebels are growing by the thousands they overrun the country like ants you read the papers eh sometimes when there are enough pictures said jose ha then i doubt if you know what is happening well ill have to tell you our enemies have taken all northern mexico except that part which is under my control but they are pushing toward me from two sides and i prepare to retreat that is not the worst however the gringos are hoping to profit by mexicos distress they are making ready to invade our fatherland and every mexican must fight or become a slave this was indeed news jose began patriotically cursing the whole american people understand i make you my confidant because i think a great deal of you jose the general laid an affectionate hand upon joses shoulder the first time i saw you i said theres a boy after my own heart i shall learn to love that jose and i shall put him in the way of his fortune well i have not changed my mind and the time is come you are going to help me and i am going to help you jose sanchez thrilled with elation from head to foot this promised to be the greatest day of his life and he felt that he must be dreaming you havent tired of rosa eh you still wish to marry her longorio was inquiring yes but of course im a poor man just so i shall attend to that now we come to the object of my visit jose i propose to make you rich enough in one day so that you can marry but first wait exclaimed the horsebreaker i bring you something of value too desiring to render favor for favor and to show that he was fully deserving of the generals generosity jose removed from inside the sweatband of his hat a sealed stamped letter which he handed to his employer yesterday i carried the mail to town but as i rode away from las palmas the senora handed me this with a silver dollar for myself look it is written to the man we both hate longorio took the letter read the inscription and then opened the envelope jose looked on with pleasure while he spelled out the contents when the general had finished reading he exclaimed ho a miracle now i know all that i wish to know then i did well to steal that letter eh diablo yes that brute of a husband makes my angels life unbearable and she flees to la feria to be rid of him good it fits in with my plans she will be surprised to see me there then when the war comes and all is chaos then what ill warrant i can make her forget certain things and certain people longorio nodded with satisfaction you did very well jose the latter leaned forward his eyes bright that lady is rich a fine prize truly she would bring a huge ransom this remark brought a smile to longorios face my dear friend you do not in the least understand he said ransom what an idea he lost himself in meditation then rousing spoke briskly listen in two three days your senora will leave las palmas when she is gone you will perform your work like the brave man i know you to be you will relieve her of her husband jose hesitated and the smile vanished from his face senor ed is not a bad man he likes me he longorios gaze altered and jose fell silent come you are not losing heart eh have i not promised to make you a rich man well the time has arrived seeing that jose still manifested no eagerness the general went on in a different tone do not think that you can withdraw from our little arrangement oh no do you remember a promise i made to you when you came to me in romero i said that if you played me false i would bury you to the neck in an anthill and fill your mouth with honey i keep my promises joses struggle was brief he promptly resigned himself to the inevitable with every evidence of sincerity he assured longorio of his loyalty and denied the least intention of betraying his generals confidence what after all was his mission upon earth if not to serve longorios interests one might have a peaceful heart and still be a man jose was every inch a man he was a very devil when he let himself go and his excellency need have no fears as to the outcome of their plan after all the gringos were enemies and there was no one of them who did not merit destruction pleased with these sentiments and feeling sufficiently assured that jose was now really in the proper frame of mind to suit his purpose longorio took the winding trail back toward sangre de cristo xxiv dave law comes home a few days after she had written to judge ellsworth alaire followed her letter in person for having at last decided to divorce ed she acted with characteristic decision since ellsworth had more than once advised this very course she went to brownsville anticipating his willing support she was greatly amazed therefore to find that he had completely changed his views and to hear him argue strongly against her determination hurt and puzzled at first by this strange lack of sympathy alaire soon began to grow angry and when the judge persisted in his arguments she quarreled with him for the first time in their acquaintance but it was not until she had threatened to secure another attorney that he reluctantly gave in even then making it plain that in meeting her wishes he was acting against his best judgment now alaire had desired ellsworths advice also as to her own immediate plans since it was of course impossible for her longer to share eds roof she had written dave law telling him that she intended to go to la feria there to remain pending the hearing of her suit but later she had come to doubt the wisdom of such a course inasmuch as the war talk grew louder with every day however her attorneys inexplicable change of front and his stubborn opposition to her wishes prevented her from confiding in him any more than was necessary and she returned to las palmas determined to use her own best judgment to be sure she would have preferred some place of refuge other than la feria but she reasoned that there she would at least be undisturbed and that ed even if he wished to effect a reconciliation would not dare to follow her since he was persona non grata in federal mexico nor were her doubts of ellsworths loyalty entirely allayed all in all therefore it seemed to her that the mexican ranch offered her the safest asylum she had counted upon seeing dave during her stay in brownsville and her failure to do so was a grave disappointment the news of his resignation from the force had at first perplexed her then she had thrilled at the thought that his action must have something to do with her that doubtless he too was busied in making plans for their new life she told herself that it was brave of him to obey her injunctions so literally and to leave her unembarrassed by his presence at this particular time it inspired her to be equally brave and to wait patiently for the day when she could welcome him with clean hands and a soul unashamed in the midst of alaires uncertainty of mind it gratified her to realize that dave alone would know of her whereabouts she wondered if he would come to see her he was a reckless headstrong lover and his desires were all too likely to overcome his deliberate resolves she rather hoped that in spite of his promise he would venture to cross the border so that she could see and be near him if only for a day or for an hour the possibility frightened and yet pleased her the conventional woman within her frowned but her outlaw heart beat fast at the thought alaire did not explain her plans even to dolores but when her preparations were complete she took the mexican woman with her and during eds absence slipped away from the ranch boarding the train at jonesville she was in pueblo that night if alaires clash with ellsworth had been trying to her it had been no less painful to the lawyer himself feeling himself bound by his promise to dave he had not dared to tell her the truth consequently he had been hard put to it to dissuade her from taking immediate action when she would not listen he found himself in the most unpleasant position of his life for although he could not but sympathize with her desire to be free from ed austin it distressed him beyond measure to see her riding blindly to a fall more than once after their strained parting he was tempted to go to las palmas and set himself right in her eyes but he managed to hold to his determination and to school himself to await daves return before long however ellsworth found other worries engaging him for it seemed at last that war with mexico was imminent after months of uncertainty the question had come to issue and that lowering cloud which had hung above the horizon took ominous shape and size ellsworth awoke one morning to learn that an ultimatum had gone forth to president potosi that the atlantic fleet had been ordered south and that marines were being rushed aboard transports pending a general army mobilization it looked as if the united states had finally risen in wrath and as if nothing less than a miracle could now avert the longexpected conflict naturally brownsville like other border towns was plunged into a panic and ellsworth as a leading citizen of his community had his hands full in the midst of this excitement and while suspense was at its highest dave law returned ellsworth found him in his office one morning and fell upon the young man eagerly two weeks had worked a shocking change in dave he was gaunt ill his eyes were bright and tired and feverish they had a new expression too which the judge at first could not fathom but which he took to be fear daves brown cheeks had bleached his hands hung loose and unmanageable at his sides ive had a long trip he said somberly months years long it seems to me well thank god youre back tell me what did you find out law closed his eyes wearily he shook his head nothing except verification im sorry i went the law blood is tainted all right it reeks the whole damned outfit were crazy on my mothers side though im healthy enough and there appears to be some mystery or something queer about me as a baby thats all ive discovered so far but ive a relative in san antone a cousin of my mothers who runs a curiostore he deals in mexican jewelry and antiques and all that strange old fellow he says he has a trunkful of stuff that belonged to his family and he has promised to go through it for me then you still hope to prove i havent any hope ive given up why ellsworth asked sharply because i know the truth because im going crazy fact i can see it myself now why boy thats imagination nothing else perhaps dave agreed listlessly im reading everything on the subject of insanity that i can get hold of ellsworth tried to laugh that in itself is enough to unbalance you im moody depressed im getting so i imagine things by and by ill begin to think im persecuted i believe thats how it works already i have hallucinations in broad daylight and im afraid of the dark fancy i dont sleep very often and when i do i wake up in a puddle of sweat shivering and dreams god what dreams i know theyre dreams now but sooner or later i suppose ill begin to believe in em dave sighed and settled lower in his chair i im mighty tired ellsworth clapped him on the back come now a perfectly healthy man could wreck his reason this way you must stop it you must do something to occupy your mind sure thats what brings me home im going to the front to the war yes theyre recruiting a roughrider regiment in san antone i joined yesterday and ive come to get my horse after a time ellsworth said alaire has commenced her action dave took a deep sharp breath and began to tremble weakly i didnt tell her but you must we cant go on like this suppose i just go to war and and dont come back thickly inquired the sufferer that wont do you wont get killed fellows like you never do wouldnt you rather have her know the truth than believe you to be a quitter ellsworth waited a minute do you want me to tell her for you dave law shook his head slowly wearily no ill do it im game id rather she heard it from me blaze jones took the san antonio paper out upon the porch and composed himself in the hammock to read the latest war news invasion troops the stars and stripes those were words that stirred jones deeply and caused him to neglect his work now that his country had fully awakened to the necessity of a war with mexico a necessity he had long felt he was fired with the loftiest patriotism and a youthful eagerness to enlist blaze realized that he was old and fat and nearsighted but what of that he could fight fighting in fact had been one of his earliest accomplishments and he prided himself upon knowing as much about it as any one man could learn he believed in fighting both as a principle and as an exercise in fact he attributed his good health to his various neighborly unpleasantnesses and he had more than once argued that no great fighter ever died of a sluggish liver or of any one of the other ills that beset sedentary peaceloving people nations were like men too much ease made them flabby and blaze had his own ideas of strategy too so during the perusal of his paper he bemoaned the mistakes his government was making why waste time with ultimatums he argued to himself he had never done so experience had taught him that the way to win a battle was to beat the other fellow to the draw hence this diplomatic procrastination filled him with impatience it seemed almost treasonable to one of blazes intense patriotism he was engaged in laying out a plan of campaign for the united states when he became conscious of voices behind him and realized that for some time paloma had been entertaining a caller in the front room their conversation had not disturbed him at first but now an occasional word or sentence forced its meaning through his preoccupation and he found himself listening palomas visitor was a woman and as blaze harkened to her voice he felt his heart sink it was mrs strange she was here again with difficulty blaze conquered an impulse to flee for she was recounting a story all too familiar to him why it seemed as if the whole city of galveston was there and yet nobody offered to help us the dressmaker was saying phil was a perfect hero for the ruffian was twice his size oh it was an awful fight i hate to think of it what made him pinch you paloma inquired heaven only knows some men are dreadful that way why he left a blackandblue mark blaze broke into a cold sweat and cursed feebly under his breath he wasnt drunk either he was just naturally depraved you could see it in his face how did you escape well ill tell you we chased him up across the boulevard and in among the tents and then mrs strange lowered her voice until only a murmur reached the listening man a moment then both women burst into shrill excited laughter and blaze himself blushed furiously this was unbearable it was bad enough to have that woman in jonesville a constant menace to his good name but to allow her access to his own home was unthinkable sooner or later they were bound to meet and then paloma would learn the disgraceful truth yes and the whole neighborhood would likewise know his shame in fancy blaze saw his reputation torn to shreds and himself exposed to the gibes of the people who venerated him he would become a scandal among men an offense to respectable women children would shun him blaze could not bear to think of the consequences for he was very fond of the women and children of jonesville especially the women he rose from his hammock and tiptoed down the porch into the kitchen from which point of security he called loudly for his daughter alarmed at his tone paloma came running what is the matter she asked quickly get her out blaze cried savagely get shed of her her who that varmint father what ails you nothin ails me but i dont want that caterpillar crawlin around my premises i dont like her paloma regarded her parent curiously how do you know you dont like her when youve never seen her oh ive seen her all i want to and i heard her talkin to you just now i wont stand for nobody tellin you bad stories paloma snickered the idea she doesnt get her out and keep her out blaze rumbled she aint right she aint human why what dyou reckon i saw her do the other day makes me shiver now you remember that big bullsnake that lives under the barn the one ive been layin for well you wont believe me but him and her are friends fact i saw her pick him up and play with him whoee the gooseflesh popped out on me till it busted the buttons off my vest she aint my kind of people paloma strange aint no name for her no sir that womans dam near peculiar paloma remained unmoved i thought you knew she used to be a snakecharmer a what there was no doubt about it blazes hair lifted he blinked through his big spectacles he pawed the air feebly with his hands how can you let her touch you i couldnt ill bet she carries a pocketful of dried toads and and keeps live lizards in her hair i knew an old voodoo woman that ate cockroaches get shed of her paloma and well fumigate the house at that moment mrs strange herself opened the kitchen door to inquire is anything wrong misreading blazes expression for one of pain she exclaimed mercy now what have you done to yourself but the object of her solicitude backed away making peculiar clucking sounds deep in his throat paloma was saying this is my father mrs strange you and he have never happened to meet before why yes we have i know you the seamstress exclaimed then a puzzled light flickered in her black eyes seems to me weve met somewhere but ive met so many people she extended her hand and blaze took it as if expecting to find it cold and scaly he muttered something unintelligible ive been dying to see you she told him and thank you for giving me palomas work i love you both for it blaze was immensely relieved that this dreaded crisis had come and gone but wishing to make assurance doubly sure he contorted his features into a smile the like of which his daughter had never seen and in a disguised voice inquired now where do you reckon you ever saw me the seamstress shook her head i dont know but ill place you before long anyhow im glad you arent hurt from the way you called paloma i thought you were im handy around sick people so i listen paloma interrupted theres some one at the front door she left the room blaze was edging after her when he heard her utter a stifled scream and call his name now paloma was not the kind of girl to scream without cause and her cry brought blaze to the front of the house at a run but what he saw there reassured him momentarily nothing was in sight more alarming than one of the depot hacks in the rear seat of which was huddled the figure of a man paloma was flying down the walk toward the gate and phil strange was waiting on the porch as blaze flung himself into view the latter explained i brought him straight here mr jones cause i knew you was his best friend who who is it dave law he must have came in on the noon train anyhow i found him like that the two men hurried toward the road side by side whats wrong with him blaze demanded i dont know hes queer hes off his bean ive had a hard time with him paloma was in the carriage at daves side now and calling his name but law it seemed was scarcely conscious he had slumped together his face was vacant his eyes dull he was muttering to himself a queer delirious jumble of words oh dad hes sick sick paloma sobbed dave dont you know us youre home dave everything is all right now why youd hardly recognize the boy blaze exclaimed then he added his appeal to his daughters but they could not arouse the sick man from his coma he asked me to take him to las palmas strange explained looks to me like a sunstroke youd ought to hear him rave when he gets started paloma turned an agonized face to her father get a doctor quick she implored he frightens me but mrs strange had followed and now she spoke up in a matteroffact tone doctor nothing she said i know more than all the doctors paloma you go into the house and get a bed ready for him and you men lug him in come now on the run all of you ill show you what to do she took instant charge of the situation and when dave refused to leave the carriage and began to fight off his friends gabbling wildly it was she who quieted him elbowing blaze and her husband out of the way she loosed the young mans frenzied clutch from the carriage and holding his hands in hers talked to him in such a way that he gradually relaxed it was she who helped him out and then supported him into the house it was she who got him upstairs and into bed and it was she who finally stilled his babble the poor man is burning up with a fever she told the others and fevers are my long suit get me some towels and a lot of ice blaze who had watched the snakecharmers deft ministrations with mingled amazement and suspicion inquired what are you going to do with ice ice aint medicine im going to pack his head in it godlmighty blaze was horrified do you want to freeze his brain mrs strange turned on him angrily you get out of my way and mind your own business freeze his brain with a sniff of indignation she pushed past the interloper but blaze was waiting for her when she returned a few moments later with bowls and bottles and various remedies which she had commandeered he summoned sufficient courage to block her way and inquire what you got there now maam mrs strange glared at him balefully with an effort at patience she inquired say what ails you anyhow jones swallowed hard understand hes a friend of mine no damned magic goes magic no cockroaches or snakes tongues or mrs strange fingered a heavy china bowl as if tempted to bounce it from blazes head then not deigning to argue she whisked past him and into the sickroom it was evident from her expression that she considered the master of the house a harmless but offensive old busybody for some time longer blaze hung about the sickroom then his presence being completely ignored he risked further antagonism by telephoning for jonesvilles leading doctor not finding the physician at home he sneaked out to the barn and taking palomas car drove away in search of him it was fully two hours later when he returned to discover that dave was sleeping quietly xxv a warning and a surprise dave law slept for twenty hours and even when he awoke it was not to a clear appreciation of his surroundings at first he was relieved to find that the splitting pain in his head was gone but imagined himself to be still in the maddening local train from brownsville by and by he recognized paloma and mrs strange and tried to talk to them but the connection between brain and tongue was imperfect and he made a bad business of conversation it seemed queer that he should be in bed at the joneses and almost ludicrous for mrs strange to support him while paloma fed him in the effort to understand these mysteries he dozed again after interminable periods of semiconsciousness alternating with complete oblivion he roused himself to discover that it was morning and that he felt better than for weeks when he had recovered from his surprise he turned his head and saw mrs strange slumbering in a chair beside his bed from her uncomfortable position and evident fatigue he judged that she must have kept a long and faithful vigil over him a little later paloma pale and heavyeyed stole into the room and daves cheerful greeting awoke mrs strange with a jerk so youre feeling better arent you the latter woman cried heartily yes how did i get here dave asked i must have been right sick and troublesome to you paloma smiled and nodded sick why dave you frightened us nearly to death you were clear out of your head so that was it the breakdown had come sooner than he expected and it had come moreover without warning that was bad bad although daves mind was perfectly clear at this moment he reasoned with a sinking heart that another brainstorm might overtake him at any time he had imagined that the thing would give a hint of its coming but evidently it did not mrs strange broke into his frowning meditation to ask how long since you had a nights sleep i oh it must be weeks umph i thought so you puzzled that pillroller but doctors dont know anything anyhow why he wanted to wake you up to find out what ailed you i threatened to scald him if he did i seem to remember talking a good deal dave ventured i reckon i said a lot of foolish things he caught the look that passed between his nurses and its significance distressed him mrs strange continued thats how we guessed what your trouble was and thats why i wouldnt let that fool doctor disturb you now that youve had a sleep and are all right again im going home and change my clothes i havent had them off for two nights two nights dave stared in bewilderment then he lamely apologized for the trouble he had caused and tried to thank the women for their kindness he was shaky when an hour later he came downstairs for breakfast but otherwise he felt better than for many days and blazes open delight at seeing did him as much good as the food he ate dave spent the morning sunning himself on the porch reading the papers with their exciting news and speculating over the significance of his mental collapse the more he thought of it now the more ominous it seemed one result which particularly distressed him was the change it had wrought in paloma joness bearing for of a sudden the girl had become distant and formal the reason was not far to seek dave could not doubt that the knowledge of his secret had frightened her well that was to be expected he would probably lose all his friends in time it was a bitter thought life would be very dull and flat without friends he wondered how he could bear to see those who loved him turn away to see their liking change to restraint and fear as it threatened to do in palomas case better anything than that there was however one friend who dave knew would not shun him one of whose lasting affection he felt sure and at memory of her he came to his feet montrosa would trust him she had given him her heart and her loyalty would never waver with a clutch at his throat and a little pain in his breast he stumbled down the steps and went in search of her now during daves absence paloma had done her best to spoil the mare and among other marks of favor had allowed her free run of the yard where the shade was cool and the grass fine and where delicious tidbits were to be had from the kitchen for the mere asking in consequence dave did not go far until he was discovered montrosa signaled then trotted toward him with ears and tail lifted her delight was open and extravagant her welcome was as enthusiastic as a horse could make it gone were her coquetry and her airs she nosed and nibbled dave she rubbed and rooted him with the violence of a batteringram and permitted him to hug her and murmur words of love into her velvet ears she swapped confidence for confidence too and then when he finally walked back toward the house she followed closely as if fearful that he might again desert her phil strange met the lovers as they turned the corner of the porch and warmly shook daves hand teeny my wife told me you was better he began so i beat it out here i hung around all day yesterday waiting to see you but you was batty i was pretty sick dave acknowledged mrs strange was mighty kind to me sick people get her goat shes got a way with em and with animals too why rajah the big python with our show took sick one year and hed have died sure only for her same with a lot of the other animals she knows moren any vet i ever saw perhaps i needed a veterinary instead of a doctor dave smiled i guess ive got some horse blood in me see montrosa had thrust her head under his arm and was waiting for him to scratch her ears well i brought you some mail strange fumbled in his pocket for a small bundle of letters explaining blaze gave me these for you as i passed the post office now i wonder if you feel good enough to talk business dave took the letters with a word of thanks and thrust them carelessly into his pocket what seems to be the trouble he inquired you remember our last talk well them mexicans have got me rattled ive been trying everywhere to locate you if you hadnt come home id have gone to the prosecuting attorney or somebody then youve learned something more phil nodded and his sallow face puckered with apprehension rosa morales has been to see me regular dave passed an uncertain hand over his forehead im not in very good shape to tackle a new proposition but what is it weve got to get mrs austin away from here we why if we dont theyll steal her steal her daves amazement was patent are you crazy sometimes i think i am but ive pumped that morales girl dry and i cant figure anything else out of what she tells me her and jose expect to make a lump of quick money jump to mexico get married and live happy ever after take it from me its mrs austin they aim to cash in on why the ideas ridiculous maybe it is and maybe it aint the fortuneteller persisted more than one rich mexican has been grabbed and held for ransom along this river yes and americans too if you can believe the stories anything goes in that country over there you think jose is planning to kidnap her nonsense one man couldnt do such a thing i didnt say he could phil defended himself sulkily remember i told you there was somebody back of him yes i remember but you didnt know exactly who well i dont exactly know yet i thought maybe you might tell me there was a brief silence during which dave stood frowning then he appeared to shake himself free from phils suggestions its too utterly preposterous mrs austin has no enemies shes a person of importance if by any chance she disappeared shes done that very little thing strange declared what shes disappeared anyhow shes gone yesterday when i saw you was laid up and couldnt help me i phoned her ranch somebody answered in spanish and from what i could make out they dont know where she is dave wondered if he had understood strange aright or if this could be another trick of his own disordered brain choosing his words carefully he said do you mean to tell me that shes missing and they havent given an alarm i reckon you didnt understand the message did you strange shrugged maybe i didnt suppose you try you sabe the lingo dave agreed although reluctantly for at this moment he wished nothing less than to undertake a mental effort and he feared in spite of stranges statement that he might hear alaires voice over the wire that would be too much he felt as if he could not summon the strength to control himself in such a case nevertheless he went to the telephone leaving phil to wait when he emerged from the house a few moments later it was with a queer set look upon his face i got em he said shes gone left three days ago where did she go they wouldnt tell me they wouldnt strange looked up sharply wouldnt or couldnt the men eyed each other silently then phil inquired well what do you make of it i dont know she wasnt kidnapped thats a cinch for dolores went with her i think were exciting ourselves unduly the little fortuneteller broke out excitedly the hell we are why do you suppose ive been playing that morales girl i tell you theres something crooked going on dont i know didnt i wise you three weeks ago that something like this was coming off it was plain that phil put complete faith in his powers of divination and at this moment his earnestness carried a certain degree of conviction dave made an effort to clear his tired brain very well he said if youre so sure ill go to las palmas ill find out all about it and where she went if anybody has dared to he drew a deep breath and his listlessness vanished his eyes gleamed with a hint of their customary fire i reckon ive got one punch left in me he turned and strode to his room as dave changed into his service clothes he was surprised to feel a new vigor in his limbs and a new strength of purpose in his mind his brain was clearer than it had been for a long time the last cobweb was gone and for the moment at least he was lifted out of himself as by a strong invigorating drink when he stood in his old boots and felt the familiar drag of his cartridgebelt when he tested his free muscles he realized that he was another man even yet he could not put much faith in phil stranges wordsnevertheless there might be a danger threatening alaire and if so it was time to act phil watched his friend saddle the bay mare then as dave tied his winchester scabbard to its thongs he laughed nervously youre loaded for bear the horseman answered grimly im loaded for jose sanchez if i lay hands on him ill learn what he knows you cant get nothing out of a mexican no ive made filipinos talk believe me i can be some persuasive when i try with that he swung a leg over montrosas back and rode away law found it good to feel a horse between his knees he had not realized until now how long montrosas saddle had been empty the sun was hot and friendly the breeze was sweet in his nostrils as he swept past the smiling fields and out into the mesquite country heat waves danced above the patches of bare ground insects sang noisily from every side far ahead the road ran a wavering course through a deceitful mirage of rippling ponds it was all familiar pleasant it was home black moods were impossible amid such surroundings the chemistry of air and earth and sunshine were at work dissolving away the poisons of his imagination of course daves trouble did not wholly vanish it still lurked in the back of his mind and rode with him but from some magic source he was deriving a power to combat it with every mile he covered his strength and courage increased such changes had come into his life since his last visit to las palmas that it gave him a feeling of unreality to discover no alteration in the ranch he had somehow felt that the buildings would look older that the trees would have grown taller and so when he finally came in sight of his destination he reined in to look behind him he heard the hum of an approaching motor and he turned to behold a car racing along the road he had just traveled the machine was running fast as a long streamer of choking dust gave evidence and dave soon recognized it as belonging to jonesvilles prosecuting attorney as it tore past him its owner shouted something but the words were lost in the automobile with the driver were several passengers and one of these likewise called to dave and seemed to motion him to follow when the machine slowed down a halfmile ahead and veered abruptly into the las palmas gateway dave lifted montrosa to a run wondering what pressing necessity could have induced the prosecuting attorney to risk such a reckless burst of speed dave told himself that he was unduly apprehensive that stranges warnings had worked upon his nerves nevertheless he continued to ride so hard that almost before the dust had settled he too turned into the shade of the palms yes there was excitement here something was evidently very much amiss judging from the groups of ranchhands assembled upon the porch they were clustered about the doors and windows peering in briefly they turned their faces toward law then they crowded closer and he perceived that they were not talking some of them had removed their hats and held them in their hands daves knees shook under him as he dismounted for one sick giddy instant the scene swam before his eyes then he ran toward the house and up the steps he tried to frame a question but his lips were stiff with fright heedless of those in his path he forced his way into the house then down the hall toward an open door through which he saw a room full of people from somewhere came the shrill wailing of a woman the house was full of hushed voices and whisperings dave had but one thought from the depths of his being a voice called alaires name until his brain rang with it a bed was in the room and around it was gathered a group of whitefaced people with rough hands law cleared a way for himself and then stopped frozen in his tracks his arms relaxed his fingers unclenched a great sigh whistled slowly from his lungs before him booted spurred and fully dressed lay the dead body of ed austin dave was still staring at the master of las palmas when the prosecuting attorney spoke to him god this is terrible isnt it he said he must have died instantly who did it we dont know yet benito found him and brought him in he hasnt been dead an hour law ran his eyes over the room and then asked sharply where is mrs austin he was answered by benito gonzales who had edged closer shes not here senor have you notified her benito shrugged there has been no time it all happened so quickly some one interrupted and dave saw that it was the local sheriff evidently it was he who had waved from the speeding machine a few moments before im glad youre here dave for you can give me a hand im going to round up these mexicans right away and find out what they know whoever did it hasnt gone far so you act as my deputy and see what you can learn when dave had regained better control of himself he took benito outdoors and demanded full details of the tragedy with many lamentations and incoherencies the range boss told what he knew ed had met his death within a halfmile of las palmas as he rode home for dinner benito himself on his way to the house had found the body still warm near the edge of the pecangrove he had retained enough sense to telephone at once to jonesville and then benito hardly knew what he had done since then he was so badly shaken by the tragedy what time did it happen it was noon when i came in dave consulted his watch and was surprised to discover that it was now only a few minutes past one it was evident therefore that benito had indeed lost no time and that his alarm had met with instant response now tell me who did it benito flung his hands high god knows some enemy of course but don eduardo had many not that sort of enemies there was nobody who could wish to kill him that is as it is havent you any suspicions no senor you say mrs austin is gone yes where i dont know dave spoke brusquely come benito you must know for your wife went with her are you trying to keep something back no no as god is my judge benito declared i didnt know they were going until the very last and even then dolores would tell me nothing we were having bad times here at las palmas there were stormy scenes yonder in the house senor ed was drinking again you understand the senora had reason to go you think she ran away to escape him exactly dave breathed more easily for this seemed to settle stranges theory the next instant however his apprehensions were doubled for benito added no doubt she went to la feria law uttered an incredulous exclamation not there surely she wouldnt go to la feria at such a time why that country is ablaze americans are fleeing from mexico i hadnt thought of that benito confessed but if she didnt go there where did she go saints above it is a fine condition of affairs when a wife keeps secrets from her husband eh i suppose dolores feared i would tell don eduardo god rest his soul this much i do know however not long ago there came a letter from general longorio offering settlement for those cattle he stole in his governments name dolores told me the senora was highly pleased and was going to mexico for her money it was a mark of longorios favor you understand me hes a great friend an ardent admirer benito winked dolores told me all about that too no i think they went to la feria dave remembered his first conversation with phil strange and the fortunetellers insistence that some powerful person was behind jose sanchez more than three weeks ago strange had forecast something very like murder of ed austin dave felt as if he were the victim of an hysterical imagination nevertheless he forced himself to ask quietly is jose sanchez anywhere about the range boss shrugged i sent him to the east pasture this morning did he go eh so you suspect jose of this god in heaven jose is a wild boy but wait ill ask juan if he saw him yes and victoria too that is victoria you hear squalling in the kitchen wait here benito hurried away leaving dave a prey to perplexity but he was back again in a few moments his face was grave jose did not go to the east pasture he said where is he now no one seems to know law walked to his horse mounted and galloped away benito who watched him saw that he turned toward the river road which led to the las palmas pumpingplant the more dave thought about ed austins death the more certain he became that it was in some way connected with alaires disappearance and the loose end by which the tangle might be unraveled it seemed to him lay in the hands of rosa morales joses sweetheart that sanchez was the murderer dave now had little doubt but since the chance of apprehending him was small he turned his attention to the girl he would make rosa speak he told himself if he had to use force this was no time for gentle methods if she knew aught of alaires whereabouts or the mystery of her departure from las palmas he would find a way to wring the truth from her daves face a trifle too somber at all times took on a grimmer aspect now he felt a slow fury kindling in his breast years of experience had taught him to be always alert even during his moments of deepest preoccupation and so from force of habit when he came to the pumphouse road he carefully scanned it in the dust were fresh hoofprints leading toward the river now he knew this road to be seldom used and therefore he wondered who could be riding it at a gallop in this blistering midday heat a few rods farther on and his quick eye detected something else something that brought him from his saddle out of the rut he picked a cigarette butt the fire of which was cold but the paper of which was still wet from the smokers lips he examined it carefully then he remounted and rode on pondering its significance dave loped out of the thicket and straight across the clearing to the morales house leaving montrosas reins hanging he opened the door and entered without knocking rosa appeared in the opening to another room her eyes wide with fright at this apparition and dave saw that she was dressed in her finest as if for a holiday or for a journey wheres your father he demanded hes gone to sangre de cristo what do you want when did he go this morning early he whos been here since he left rosa was recovering from her first surprise and now her black brows drew together in anger no one has come you are the first and have you no manners to stride into a respectable house dave broke in harshly rosa youre lying jose sanchez has been here within an hour where is he when the girl only grew whiter and raised a hand to her breast he stepped toward her crying answer me rosa recoiled and the breath caught in her throat like a sob ill tell you nothing she said in a thin voice then she began to tremble why do you want jose you know why he killed don eduardo and then be rode here come i know everything lies lies rosas voice grew shrill out of this house i know you it was you who betrayed panfilo and his blood is on your hands assassin with the last word she made as if to retreat but dave was too quick he seized her and for an instant they struggled breathlessly dave had reasoned beforehand that his only chance of discovering anything from this girl lay in utterly terrorizing her and in profiting by her first panic therefore he pressed his advantage he succeeded better than he had dared to hope you know who killed senor ed he cried fiercely the fortuneteller read your plans and there is no use to deny it rosa screamed again she writhed she tried to sink her teeth into her captors flesh in her body was the strength of a fullgrown man and dave could hardly hold her but suddenly as the two scuffled from the back room of the house came a sound which caused dave to release the girl as abruptly as he had seized her it was the clink and tinkle of mexican spurs upon a wooden floor xxvi the watercure without an instants hesitation dave flung himself past rosa and through the inner door jose sanchez met him with a shout the shock of their collision overbore the lighter man and the two went down together arms and legs intertwined the horsebreaker fired his revolver blindly a deafening explosion inside those four walls but he was powerless against his antagonists strength and ferocity it required but a moment for law to master him to wrench the weapon from his grasp and then with the aid of joses silk neckscarf to bind his wrists tightly from the front of the little house came the crash of a door violently slammed as rosa profited by the diversion to save herself when finally jose stood panting and snarling his back to the wall dave regarded him with a sinister contraction of the lips that was almost a grin well he said drawing a deep breath i see you didnt go to the east pasture this morning what do you want of me jose managed to gasp there was a somewhat prolonged silence during which dave continued to stare at his prisoner with that same disquieting expression why did you kill don eduardo he asked i bah who says i killed him jose glared defiance why are you looking at me come take me to jail if you think that will do any good its lucky i rode to las palmas this morning in another hour you would have been across the rio grande with rosa and all her fine clothes eh now you will be hanged well that is how fortune goes the horsebreaker tossed his head and shrugged with a brave assumption of indifference he laughed shortly you can prove nothing yes continued dave and rosa will go to prison too now suppose i should let you go would you help me in ten minutes you could be safe he inclined his head toward the muddy silent river outside would you be willing to help me joses brows lifted whats this you are saying he inquired eagerly i would only ask you a few questions what questions where is senora austin joses face became blank i dont know oh yes you do she started for la feria but did she get there or did longorio have other plans for her youd better tell me the truth for your general cant help you now dave did his best to read the mexicans expression but failed senor eds death means nothing to me he went on but i must know where his wife is and im willing to pay with your liberty in spite of himself his anxiety was plain jose exclaimed ho i understand he was in your way and youre glad to be rid of him well we have no business fighting with each other will you tell me ill tell you nothing for i know nothing come i must know jose laughed insolently laws face became black with sudden fury his teeth bared themselves he took a step forward crying by god you will tell me seizing his prisoner by the throat he pinned him to the wall then with his free hand he cocked longorios revolver and thrust its muzzle against joses body tell me he repeated his countenance was so distorted his expression so maniacal that jose felt his hour had come the latter being in all ways mexican did not struggle instead he squared his shoulders and staring fearlessly into the face above him cried shoot for a moment the two men remained so then dave seemed to regain control of himself and the murder light flickered out of his eyes he flung his prisoner aside and cast the revolver into a corner of the room jose picked himself up cursing his captor eloquently you gringos dont know how to die he said death pah we must die some time and supposing i do know something about the senora do you think you can force me to speak torture wouldnt open my lips law did not trust himself to reply and the horsebreaker went on with growing defiance i am innocent of any crime therefore i am brave but you the blood of innocent men means nothing to you panfilos murder proves that so complete your work make an end of me be still dave commanded thickly but the fellows hatred was out of bounds now and by the bitterness of his vituperation he seemed to invite death dave interrupted his vitriolic curses to ask harshly will you tell me or will you force me to wring the truth out of you jose answered by spitting at his captor then he gritted an unspeakable epithet from between his teeth dave addressed him with an air of finality you killed that man and your life is forfeit so it doesnt make much difference whether i take it or whether the state takes it you are brave enough to die most of you mexicans are but the state cant force you to speak and i can jose sneered oh yes i can i intend to know all that you know and it will be better for you to tell me voluntarily i must learn where senora austin is and i must learn quickly if i have to kill you by inches to get the truth so torture eh good i can believe it of you well a slow fire will not make me speak no a fire would be too easy jose eh without answer dave strode out of the room he was back before his prisoner could do more than wrench at his bonds and with him he brought his lariat and his canteen what are you going to do jose inquired backing away until he was once more at bay im going to give you a drink whisky you think you can make me drunk the horsebreaker laughed loudly but uneasily not whisky water im going to give you a drink of water what capers when youve drunk enough youll tell me why you killed your employer and where general longorio has taken his wife yes and everything else i want to know seizing the amazed mexican dave flung him upon moraless hard board bed and in spite of the fellows struggles deftly made him fast when he had finished and it was no easy job jose lay spreadeagled upon his back his wrists and ankles firmly bound to the head and foot posts his body secured by a tight loop over his waist the rope cut painfully and brought a curse from the prisoner when he strained at it law surveyed him with a face of stone i dont want to do this he declared but i know your kind i give you one more chance will you tell me jose drew his lips back in a snarl of rage and pain and dave realized that further words were useless he felt a certain pity for his victim and no little admiration for his courage but such feelings were of small consequence as against his agonizing fears for alaires safety had he in the least doubted joses guilty knowledge of longorios intentions dave would have hesitated before employing the barbarous measures he had in mind but there was nothing else for it he pulled the canteen cork and jammed the mouthpiece firmly to joses lips closing the fellows nostrils with his free hand he forced him to drink jose clenched his teeth he tried to roll his head he held his breath until his face grew purple and his eyes bulged he strained like a man upon the rack the bed creaked to his muscular contortions the rope tightened it was terribly cruel this crushing of a strong will bent on resistance to the uttermost but never was an executioner more pitiless never did a prisoners agony receive less consideration the warm water spilled over joses face it drenched his neck and chest his joints cracked as he strove for freedom and tried to twist his head out of laws iron grasp the seconds dragged until finally nature asserted herself the imprisoned breath burst forth there sounded a loud gurgling cry and a choking inhalation joses body writhed with the convulsions of drowning as the water and air were sucked into his lungs law was kneeling over his victim now his weight and strength so applied that jose had no liberty of action and could only drink coughing and fighting for air somehow he managed to revive himself briefly and again shut his teeth but a moment more and he was again retched with the furious battle for air more desperate now than before after a while law freed his victims nostrils and allowed him a partial breath then once more crushed the mouthpiece against his lips by and by to relieve his torture jose began to drink in great noisy gulps striving to empty the vessel but the stomachs capacity is limited in time jose felt himself bursting the liquid began to regurgitate this was not mere pain that he suffered but the ultimate nightmare horror of a death more awful than anything he had ever imagined jose would have met a bullet a knife a lash without flinching flames would not have served to weaken his resolve but this slow drowning was infinitely worse than the worst he had thought possible he was suffocating by long black agonizing minutes every nerve and muscle of his body every cell in his bursting lungs fought against the outrage in a purely physical frenzy over which his will power had no control nor would insensibility come to his relief law watched him too carefully for that he could not even voice his sufferings by shrieks he could only writhe and retch and gurgle while the ropes bit into his flesh and his captor knelt upon him like a monstrous stone weight but jose had made a better fight than he knew the canteen ran dry at last and law was forced to release his hold will you speak he demanded thinking that he had come safely through the ordeal jose shook his head he rolled his bulging bloodshot eyes and vomited then managed to call god to witness his innocence dave went into the next room and refilled the canteen when he reappeared with the dripping vessel in his hand jose tried to scream but his throat was torn and strained the sound of his own voice frightened him once more the torment began the tortured man was weaker now and in consequence he resisted more feebly but not until he was less than half conscious did law spare him time to recover jose lay sick frightened inert dave watched him without pity the fellows wrists were black and swollen his lips were bleeding he was stretched like a dumb animal upon the vivisectionists table and no surgeon with lance and scalpel could have shown less emotion than did his inquisitor having no intention of defeating his own ends dave allowed his victim ample time in which to regain his ability to suffer alaire austin had been right when she said that dave might be ruthless and yet the man was by no means incapable of compassion at the present moment however he considered himself simply as the instrument by which alaire was to be saved his own feelings had nothing to do with the matter neither had the sufferings of this mexican therefore he steeled himself to prolong the agony until the murderers stubborn spirit was worn down once again he put his question and again receiving defiance jammed the canteen between joses teeth but human nature is weak for the first time in his life jose sanchez felt terror a terror too awful to be endured and he made the sign he was no longer the insolent defier the challenger but an imploring wretch whose last powers of resistance had been completely shattered his frightened eyes were glued to that devilish vessel in which his manhood had dissolved the fear of it made a woman of him slowly in sighs and whimpers in agonies of reluctance his story came his words were rendered almost incomprehensible by his abysmal fright when he had purged himself of his secret dave promptly unbound him then leaving him more than half dead he went to the telephone which connected the pumping station with las palmas and called up the ranch he was surprised when blaze jones answered blaze it seemed had just arrived summoned by news of the tragedy the countryside had been alarmed and a search for ed austins slayer was being organized call it off dave told him ive got your man blaze stuttered his surprise and incredulity i mean it its jose sanchez and he has confessed i want you to come here quick and come alone if you dont mind i need your help inside of ten minutes jones piloted his automobile into the clearing beside the river and leaving his motor running leaped from the car dave met him at the door of the morales house and briefly told him the story of joses capture say thats quick work the rancher cried admiringly why ed aint cold yet you gave him the watercure eh now i reckoned it would take more than water to make a mexican talk jose was hired for the work he laid for ed austin in the pecan grove and shot him as he passed hired why this hombre needs quick hangin dont he i told em at las palmas that youd rounded up the guilty party so i reckon theyll be here in a few minutes well just stretch this horsewrangler and save the county some expense law shrugged do what you like with him but it isnt necessary hell confess in regulation form im sure i had to work fast to learn what became of mrs austin miz austin whats happened to her daves voice changed there was a sudden quickening of his words theyve got her blaze they waited until they had her safe before they killed ed they who the hell are you talkin about i mean longorio and his outfit hes got her over yonder dave flung out a trembling hand toward the river seeing that his hearer failed to comprehend he explained swiftly hes crazy about her got one of those mexican infatuations and you know what that means he couldnt steal her from las palmas she wouldnt have anything to do with him so he used that old cattle deal as an excuse to get her across the border then he put ed out of the way she went of her own accord and she didnt tell austin because they were having trouble shes gone to la feria blaze la feria then shes in for it dave nodded his agreement for the first time blaze noted how white and set was his friends face longorio must have foreseen what was coming dave went on that countrys aflame americans arent safe over there if war is declared a good many of them will never be heard from he knows that hes got her safe she cant get out blaze was very grave when next he spoke dave this is bad bad i cant understand what made her go why she must have been out of her head but weve got to do something weve got to burn the wires to washington yes and to mexico city we must get the government to send soldiers after her god what have we got em for anyhow washington wont do anything what can be done when there are thousands of american women in the same danger what steps can the government take with the fleet on its way to vera cruz with the army mobilizing and with diplomatic relations suspended those greasers are filling their jails with our people rounding em up for the day of the big break and the state department knows it no longorio saw it all coming hes no fool hes got her shes in there trapped blaze took the speaker by the shoulder and faced him about look here said he im beginnin to get wise to you i believe youre the man in the case when dave nodded he vented his amazement in a long whistle after a moment he asked well why did you want me to come here alone ahead of the others because i want you to know the whole inside of this thing so that you can get busy when im gone because i want to borrow what money you have what you aimin to pull off blaze inquired suspiciously im going to find her and bring her out you why dave you cant get through this is a job for the soldiers but dave hardly seemed to hear him you must start things moving at once he said urgently spread the news get the story into the papers notify the authorities get every influence at work from here to headquarters get your senator and the governor of the state at work ellsworth will help you and now give me your last dollar blaze emptied his pockets shaking his shaggy head the while la feria is a hundred and fifty miles in he remonstrated by rail from pueblo yes but its barely a hundred straight from here you aint got a chance singlehanded youre crazy to try it the effect of these words was startling for dave laughed harshly crazy is the word he agreed its a job for a lunatic and thats me yes ive got bad blood in me blaze bad blood and im taking it back where i got it but listen he turned a sick colorless face to his friend theyll whittle a cross for longorio if i do get through he called to montrosa and the mare came to him holding her head to one side so as not to tread upon her dragging reins im most tempted to go with you blaze stammered uncertainly no somebody has to stay here and stir things up if we had twenty men like you we might cut our way in and out but theres no time to organize and anyhow the government would probably stop us ive got a hunch that ill make it if i dont why its all right the two men shook hands lingeringly awkwardly then blaze managed to wish his friend luck if you dont come back he said with a peculiar catch in his voice i reckon theres enough good texans left to follow your trail ill sure look forward to it dave took the riverbank to sangre de cristo where by means of the dilapidated ferry he gained the mexican side once across he rode straight up toward the village of romero when challenged by an undersized soldier he merely spurred montrosa forward eyeing the sentry so grimly that the man did no more than finger his rifle uncertainly cursing under his breath the overbearing airs of all gringos nor did the rider trouble to make the slightest detour but cantered the full length of romeros dusty street the target of more than one pair of hostile eyes to those who saw him soldiers and civilians alike it was evident that this stranger had business and no one felt called upon to question its nature there are men who carry an air more potent than a bodyguard and dave law was one of these before the village had thoroughly awakened to his coming he was gone without a glance to the right or left without a word to anyone when romero was at his back he rode for a mile or two through a region of tiny scattered farms and neglected garden patches after which he came out into the mesquite for all the signs he saw he might then have been in the heart of a foreign country mexico had swallowed him as the afternoon heat subsided montrosa let herself out into a freer gait and began to cover the distance rapidly heading due west through a land of cactus and dagger of thorn and barb and bramble the roads were unfenced the meadows desolate the huts were frequently untenanted ahead the sky burned splendidly and the sunset grew more brilliant more dazzling until it glorified the whole mean thirsty cruel countryside daves eyes were set upon that riot of blazing colors but for the time it failed to thrill him in that welter of changing hues and tints he saw only red red that was the color of blood it stood for passion lust violence and it was a fitting badge of color for this land of revolutions and alarms at first he saw little else except the hint of black despair to follow but there was gold in the sunset too the yellow gold of ransom that was mexico red and yellow blood and gold lust and license once the riders fancy began to work in this fashion it would not rest and as the sunset grew in splendor he found in it richer meanings red was the color of a womans lips yes and a womans hair the deepening blue of the high sky overhead was the hue of a certain womans eyes a warm soft breeze out of the west beat into his face and he remembered how warm and soft alaires breath had been upon his cheek the woman of his desires was yonder where those colors warred and she was mantled in red and gold and purple for his coming the thought aroused him the sense of his unworthiness vanished the blight fell from him he felt only a throbbing eagerness to see her and to take her in his arms once more before the end with his head high and his face agleam he rode into the west into the heart of the sunset xxvii la feria whats this i hear about war dolores inquired of her mistress a few days after their arrival at la feria they tell me that mexico is invaded and that the american soldiers have already killed more than a thousand women and children who tells you this alaire asked the men everybody dolores waved a hand in the direction of the other ranch buildings our people are buzzing like bees with the news and of course no one cares to work when the americans are coming i shall have to put an end to such talk this morning the word came that the revolution is ended and that the soldiers of both parties are uniting to fight for their liberties they say the gringos are killing all the old people every one in fact except the girls whom they take with them already they have begun the most horrible practices why at espinal doloress eyes were round would you believe it those yankee soldiers ate a baby they roasted the little dear like a cabrito and ate it i tell you it makes wild talk among the peladors do you believe such stories alaire inquired with some amusement umm not altogether but all the same i think it is time we were going home this is home for me dolores yes but now that war there isnt any war and there wont be any however if you are nervous ill send you back to las palmas at once glory of god it would be the end of me these mexicans would recognize me instantly as an american for i have the appearance and the culture you can imagine what would happen to me they would tear me from the train it was nothing except general longorios soldiers that brought us safely through from nuevo pueblo then im glad that he insisted upon sending them with us now tell the ranchhands to put no faith in these ridiculous stories if they wish the truth let them ask general longorio he will be here today and quiet their fears you think he intends to pay us for our cattle yes dolores pondered a moment well perhaps he does it is not his money for that matter he would give all mexico if you asked it tse his love consumes him like a fever alaire stirred uneasily then she rose and went to an open window which looked out into the tiny patio with its trickling fountain and its rank untended plants why do you insist that he loves me she asked all mexicans are gallant and pay absurd compliments its just a way they have he has never spoken a word that could give offense as dolores said nothing she went on hesitatingly i cant very well refuse to see him for i dont possess even a receipt to show that he took those cattle oh you must not offend him dolores agreed hastily or wed never leave mexico alive with which cheering announcement the housekeeper heaved a deep sigh and went about her duties with a gloomy face longorio arrived that afternoon and alaire received him in the great naked living room of the hacienda with her best attempt at formality but her coolness served not in the least to chill his fervor senora he cried eagerly i have a thousand things to tell you things of the greatest importance they have been upon my tongue for hours but now that i behold you i grow drunk with delight and my lips frame nothing but words of admiration for your beauty so i feast my eyes he retained his warm clasp of her fingers seeming to envelop her uncomfortably with his ardor what is it you have to tell me she asked him withdrawing her hand well i hardly know where to begin events have moved so swiftly and such incredible things have happened even now i am in a daze for history is being made every hour history for mexico for you and for me i bring you good news and bad news something to startle you and set your brain in a whirl i planned to send a messenger ahead of me and then i said no this is a crisis therefore no tongue but mine shall apprise her no hand but mine shall comfort her only a coward shrinks from the unpleasant i shall lighten her distress and awaken in her breast new hope new happiness what do you mean alaire inquired sharply you say you bring bad news the general nodded in a way terrible shocking and yet i look beyond the immediate and see in it a blessing so must you to me it spells the promise of my unspoken longings my whispered prayers noting his hearers growing bewilderment he laid a hand familiarly upon her arm no matter how i tell you it will be a blow for death is always sudden it always finds us unprepared death who is dead restrain yourself allow for my clumsiness who please tell me some one very close to you and very dear to you at one time my knowledge of your long unhappiness alone gives me courage to speak alaire raised her fluttering fingers to her throat her eyes were wide as she said you dont mean mr austin yes longorio scrutinized her closely as if to measure the effect of his disclosure senora you are free alaire uttered a breathless exclamation then feeling his gaze burning into her turned away but not before he had noted her sudden pallor the blanching of her lips this unexpected announcement dazed her it scattered her thoughts and robbed her of words but just what her dominant emotion was at the moment she could not tell once her first giddiness had passed however once the truth had borne in upon her she found that she felt no keen anguish and certainly no impulse to weep rather she experienced a vague horror such as the death of an acquaintance or of a familiar relative might evoke ed had been anything but a true husband and her feeling now was more for the memory of the man he had been for the boy she had known and loved than for the man whose name she bore so he was gone and as longorio said she was free it meant much she realized dimly that in this one moment her whole life had changed she had never thought of this way out of her embarrassments she had been prepared in fact for anything except this dead it was deplorable for ed was young once the first shock had passed away she became conscious of a deep pity for the man and a complete forgiveness for the misery he had caused her after a time she faced the newsbearer and in a strained voice inquired how did it happen was it because of me no no rest your mind on that score see i understand your concern and i share your intimate thoughts no it was an accident ordained by god his end was the result of his own folly a gunshot wound while he was drunk i believe now you will understand why i said that i bore tidings both good and evil and why i of all people should be the one to impart them alaire turned questioning eyes upon him as if to fathom his meaning and he answered her with his brilliant smile failing to evoke a response he went on ever since i heard of it i have repeated over and over again it is a miracle it is the will of god come then we know each other so well that we may speak frankly let us be honest and pretend to no counterfeit emotions let us recognize in this only your deliverance and the certainty of that blessed happiness which divine providence offers us both both she repeated dully need i be plainer you know my heart you have read me you understand how i have throttled my longings and remained mute while all my being called to you alaire withdrew a step and her cheeks colored with anger general she exclaimed with some difficulty i am amazed this is no time her indignation rose with the sound of her own voice causing her to stammer taking advantage of her loss of words he hurried on you must pardon my impetuosity but i am a man of tremendous force and my life moves swiftly i am not shackled by conventions they are less than nothing to me if it seems to you that my eagerness carries me away remember that war is upon us and that affairs of moment press me so that i am compelled to move like the lightning with me senora a day is a year the past is gone the present is here the future rushes forward to meet us indeed you forget yourself she said warmly then changing her tone i too must act quickly i must go back at once oh but i have told you only a part of what i came to say surely the rest can wait her voice was vibrant with contempt im in no condition to listen to anything else but longorio insisted wait it is impossible for you to leave here alaire stared at him incredulously it is true mexico is a seething caldron of hate the country is convulsed it would be unsafe for you do you mean to say that war has been declared practically what you are telling me the truth a moment then alaire continued more calmly if that is so there is all the more reason why i should lose no time listen the general was deeply in earnest you have no conception of the chaos out there he waved a comprehensive gesture if the explosion has not come it will come within a few hours that is why i flew to your side battleships are hurrying toward our coast troops are massing against our border and mexico has risen like one man the people are in a frenzy they are out of bounds there is sack and pillage in the cities americans are objects of violence everywhere and the peons are frantic he paused impressively we face the greatest upheaval of history then why are you here alaire demanded this is no place for you at such a moment longorio came closer to her and his voice trembled as he said angel of my soul my place is at your side again she recoiled but with a fervor he had never dared display he rushed on heedlessly i have told you i harken only to my heart that for one smile from you i would behead myself that for your favor i would betray my fatherland that for your kiss i would face damnation well i am here at your side the deluge comes but you shall be unharmed he would not permit her to check him crying wait you must hear me through senora so that you may comprehend fully why i am forced to speak at this time out of this coming struggle i shall emerge a heroic figure now that mexico unites she will triumph and of all her victorious sons the name of luis longorio will be sung the loudest for upon him more than upon any other depends the republics salvation i do not boast i merely state facts for i have made all my plans and tomorrow i put them into effect that is why i cannot wait to speak the struggle will be long but you shall be my guiding star in the hour of darkness under other circumstances the mans magnificent egotism might have provoked a smile and yet for all its grandiloquence there was something in his speech that rang hard and true unquestionably longorio was dangerous a real personality and no mere swaggering pretender alaire felt a certain reluctant respect for him and at the same time a touch of chilling fear such as she had hardly experienced before she faced him silently for a moment then she said am i to understand that you forbid me to leave my own house for the time being exactly what then i am your prisoner no no he made a gesture of denial how ridiculous i merely keep you from certain destruction you cannot go by train because the railroad has suspended public service nor can you ride or drive i tell you senora the people are aroused for the moment you must accept my protection whether you wish to or not tomorrow longorio smiled warmly meaninglyperhaps you will not be in such haste to refuse it or to leave la feria wait until you understand me better then but enough of this you are unstrung you wish to be alone with your thoughts and what i have to say can wait for a few hours in the mean time may i beg the hospitality of your ranch for myself and my men alaire acquiesced mechanically longorio saluted her fingers in his customary manner and then with a look eloquent of things unsaid he went out to see to the comfort of his command alaire sank into the nearest chair her nerves quivering her mind in a turmoil this mexican was detestable and he was far from being the mere maker of audaciously gallant speeches the poetically fervent wooer of every pretty woman she had blindly supposed him his was no sham ardor the man was hotly horribly in earnest there had been a glint of madness in his eyes and he actually seemed to think that she shared his infatuation it was intolerable yet longorio she was sure had an abundance of discretion he would not dare to offer her violence he had pride too and in his way he was something of a gentleman so far she had avoided giving him offense but if once she made plain to him how utterly loathsome to her was his pursuit she was sure that he would cease to annoy her alaire was selfconfident strongwilled she took courage her thoughts turned from her fears to the amazing reality of her widowhood even yet she could not wholly credit the fact that eds wasted life had come to an end and that she was free to make the most of her own alaire remembered her husband now with more tenderness more charity than she would have believed possible and it seemed to her pitiful that one so blessed with opportunity should have worked such havoc with himself and with those near to him doubtless it was all a part of some providential scheme too blind for her to solve perhaps indeed her own trials had been designed to the end that her greater truer love when it did come would find her ripe responsive ready as for this mexican general she would put him in his place alaire was still walking the floor of her chamber when dolores entered at dusk to say that supper was ready and that general longorio was waiting ask him to excuse me she told her servant but longorio himself spoke from the next room saying senora i beg of you to honor me i have much of importance to say and time presses control your grief and give me the pleasure of your company after an instants consideration alaire yielded it was best to have the matter over with once for all xxviii the doors of paradise alaire began the mockery of playing hostess with extreme distaste and as the meal progressed she experienced a growing uneasiness longorios bearing had changed since his arrival he was still extravagantly courteous beautifully attentive he maintained a flow of conversation that relieved her of any effort and yet he displayed a repressed excitement that was disturbing in his eyes there was a gloating look of possession hard to endure despite her icy formality he appeared to be holding himself within the bounds of propriety only by an effort of will and she was not surprised when at the conclusion of the meal he cast restraint aside she did not let him go far with his wooing before warning him i wont listen to you you are a man of taste you must realize how offensive this is let us not deceive each other he insisted we are alone let us be honest do not ask me to put faith in your grief i find my excuse in the extraordinary nature of this situation nothing can excuse indelicacy she answered evenly you transgress the commonest rules of decency but he was impatient what sentiment you did not love your husband you were for years his prisoner through the bars of your prison i saw and loved you dios the first sight of your face altered the current of my life i saw heaven in your eyes and i have dreamed of nothing else ever since well providence opened the doors and set you free god gave heed to my prayers and delivered you to me now you pretend to grieve at your deliverance you ask me to respect the memory of your jailer decency delicacy what are they except artificialities which vanish in times of stress alexander the great caesar napoleon porfirio diaz they were strong purposeful men they lived as i live senora you dally with love alaires face was white with anger as she replied you cause me to forget that you are my guest are you the man i considered you or the man you are reported to be eh are you the gentleman the friend you pretended to be or the vandal whom no woman can trust you treat me as if you were my jailer what do you mean what kind of man are you to take advantage of my bereavement after a moments consideration longorio began haltingly i dont know what kind of man i am for you have changed me so there was a time i i have done things i have scorned all restraint all laws except those of my desires and so perhaps i am a vandal make sure of this however i shall not injure you christ is no more sacred to me than you my hearts treasure you accuse me of indelicacy because i lack the strength to smother my admiration i adore you my being dissolves my veins are afire with longing for you i am mad with the knowledge that you are mine mad caramba i am insane my mind totters i grope my way like a man blinded by a dazzling light i suffer agonies but see i refuse to touch you i am a giant in my restraint the strength of heroes is mine and i strangle my impulses as they are born although the effort kills me senora i await the moment of your voluntary surrender i wait for you he extended his arms and alaire saw that his olive features were distorted with emotion that his hands his whole thin highstrung body were shaking uncontrollably she could summon no coherent words you believed i was a hawk and would seize you eh he queried is that why you continue to shrink well let me tell you something if my tongue will frame the thoughts in my mind my passion is so deep and so sacred that i would not be content with less than all of you your lips would not satisfy mine unless they were hot with love your kisses wet with desire i must have you all and so i wait trembling i say this so badly that i doubt if you understand listen then to possess you by force would be well as if i sacked a cathedral of its golden images and expected to gain heaven by clutching the madonna in my arms senora in you i see the priceless jewel of my life which i shall wear to dazzle the world and without which i shall destroy myself now let me tell you what i can offer you what setting i can build for this treasure marriage with luis longorio alaire could not control a start as if quickened by his intensity the man read her thought you did not imagine that i offered you anything less what was i to think your reputation mother of god breathed the general so that is what you meant a moment ago that is why you refuse my embraces no no other women have feared me and i have laughed in their hair as they tore at my arms but you you will be my wife and all mexico shall bow at your feet he checked her denial with a gesture wait until i tell you the vision i have seen during these days of my despair i see mexico made whole by my hands a land of peace and plenty a people with one name upon their lips the name of longorio the deliverer and you as the first lady of them all you know me for a man of tremendous ability in every line well i know myself too i have measured myself carefully and i have no weakness there is no other like me pancho gomez bah he is a redhanded bandit of no culture candeleria his chief the idol of the ignorant and a dreamer of no force potosi he is president today but what of tomorrow those who surround him are weaklings and he stumbles toward oblivion who will succeed him who will issue from the coming struggle as the dominant figure of mexico who but that military genius who checks the yankee hordes and saves the fatherland i am he fate points the path of glory and i am her man of destiny you see then what i bring you power position riches riches caramba wait until my hands are in the treasury i will load you with gold and jewels and i will make you the richest woman in the world senora i offer you dominion i offer you the presidents palace and chapultepec and with all that i offer you such passionate love as no woman of history ever possessed he paused spent by the force of his own intensity it was plain that he expected an immediate surrender alaires lips parted in the faintest of mocking smiles you have great confidence in yourself she said yes i know myself as no one knows me why do you think i care for you longorios eyes opened his expression plainly showed that he could not imagine any woman in her senses failing to adore him dont you take much for granted alaire insisted the mexican shook his head then his face lightened ah now i see your modesty forbids you to acknowledge your love is that it well i know that you admire me for i can see it all women admire me and they all end by loving me his chest arched imperceptibly with a slender finger he delicately smoothed his black eyebrows alaire felt a wild impulse to laugh but was glad she had subdued it when he continued i am impetuous but impetuosity has made me what i am i act and then mold fate to suit my own ends opportunity has delivered to me my hearts desire and i will not be cheated out of it among the men i brought with me to la feria is a priest he is dirty for i caught him as he was fleeing toward the border but he is a priest and he will marry us tonight alaire managed to gasp surely you are not in earnest indeed i am that is why i insisted that you dine with me this evening i cannot waste more time here for necessity calls me away you shall go as my wife do you think i would remarry on the very day i find myself a widow the world will never know you dare to say that her tone was one of disgust of finality i wonder how i have listened to so much it is horrible you are still a little hysterical and you exaggerate if i had more time i could afford to wait he ogled her with his luminous gaze i would let you play with me to your hearts content and exercise your power until you tired and were ready to surrender alaire raised her head proudly her nostrils dilated her eyes ablaze with hostility this is very humiliating but you force me to tell you that i hate you longorio was incredulous rather than offended he drew himself up to his full height and smiled saying that is impossible then ignoring her impatience come you cannot deceive me the priest is waiting when alaire spoke next it was with an expression and with a tone of such loathing that his yellow face paled your conceit is insufferable she breathed after a brief struggle with himself the mexican cried hoarsely i will not be refused you wish me to tame you eh good you have found your master make your choice then which shall it be surrender or compulsion so you have been lying as i thought compulsion now the real longorio speaks he flung up his hands as if to ward off her fury no have i not made myself clear i shall embrace you only with the arms of a husband for this is not the passion of a moment but of a lifetime and i have myself to consider the wife of mexicos next president must be above reproach there must be no scandal no secrets hidden away for enemies to unearth she must stand before the people as a perfect woman she must lend prestige to his name when i speak of compulsion then i mean the right of a husband alaire uttered an exclamation of disgust and turned away but he intercepted her saying you cannot hold me at bay it is destiny you shall be mine tonight think a moment we are alone in the heart of a country lacking in every law but mine your friends do not know where you are and even if they knew they could not help you your nations protest would avail nothing outside of these walls are enemies who will not let you leave this house except under the protection of my name then i shall never leave it she told him for the first time longorio spoke roughly i lose patience in gods name have i not waited long enough my strength is gone impulsively he half encircled her with his thin arms but she seemed armored with ice and he dropped them she could hear him grind his teeth i dare not lay hands upon you he chattered angel of my dreams i am faint with longing to love you and yet to be denied to feel myself aflame and yet to see you cold to be halted at the very doors of paradise what torture the fellows selfcontrol in the midst of his frenzy frightened alaire more than did his wildest avowals it was in something of a panic that she said one moment you tell me i am safe the next you threaten me you say i am free and yet you coerce me prove your love let me go no no i shall call the priest longorio turned toward the door but halfway across the floor he was halted by a womans shriek which issued from somewhere inside the house it was repeated there was an outburst in a masculine voice then the patter of footsteps approaching down the tiled hallway dolores burst into her mistresss presence her face blanched her hair disordered she flung herself into alaires arms crying senora save me gods curse on the ruffian oh dolores alaire exclaimed what has happened longorio demanded irritably yes why are you yelling like this a man see i one of those dirty peladors look where he tore my dress i warned him but he was like a tiger benito will kill me when he learns calm yourself speak sensibly tell me what happened one of those miserable soldiers who came today pig dolores was shaking her voice was shrill he followed me he has been drinking he followed me about like a cat purring and grinning and saying the most horrible things just now when i went to your room he was waiting in the darkness and he seized me god it was dreadful a soldier one of my men longorio was incredulous alaire turned upon him with a blazing anger in her face is this more of your protection she stormed i give you and your men the freedom of my ranch and you insult me while they assault my women he ignored her accusation inquiring of the elder woman who was the fellow how do i know dolores sobbed he is a a thick black fellow with a scar on his lip like a snarl felipe yes felipe i believe they called him that longorio strode to the end of the livingroom flung open the wooden shutters of a window and leaning far out whistled sharply on his fingers oiga teniente ho you fellows he shouted from the darkness a voice answered a man evidently on guard came running call old pancho the general directed tell him to bring me black felipe the fellow with the torn lip quick yes general came the voice then the metallic rattle of spurs and accoutrements as the sentry trotted away dolores had completely broken down now and alaire was trying to comfort her their guest remained by the window frowning after a time there sounded a murmur of voices then a shuffling of feet in the hall alaires friend the old lieutenant appeared in the doorway saluting behind him were several others here is felipe he announced bring him in a sullen frowning man in soiled uniform was pushed forward and dolores hid her face against her mistresss shoulder is this the fellow longorio inquired dolores nodded well what have you to say for yourself the general transfixed his trooper with a stare then as the latter seemed bereft of his voice why did you enter this house felipe moistened his scarred lips that woman is nice and clean shes not so old either when you come to look at her he grinned at his comrades who had crowded in behind old pancho so let us go outside and learn more about this longorio waved his men before him and followed them out of the room and down the hall and into the night when a moment or two had dragged past dolores quavered what are they going to do with him i dont know anyhow you need not fear there sounded the report of a gunshot deadened indeed by the thick adobe walls of the house yet sudden and loud enough to startle the women when longorio reappeared he found alaire standing stiff and white against the wall with dolores kneeling her face still buried in her mistresss gown give yourself no concern he told them quickly i beg a thousand pardons for felipe henceforth no one will molest you was that a shot alaire inquired faintly yes it is all settled you killed him the general nodded purely for the sake of discipline one has to be firm now your woman is badly frightened send her away so that we may reach an understanding ohh this is frightful alaire gasped i cant talk to you go let me go the man pondered for an instant perhaps that would be better he agreed reluctantly for i see you too are unstrung very well my affairs will have to wait take a few hours to think over what i have told you when you have slept you will feel differently about me you will meet me with a smile eh he beamed hopefully sleep you expect me to sleep please he begged beauty is like a delicate flower and sleep is the dew that freshens it believe me you can rest in all security for no one can come or go without my consent you are cruel to postpone my delight nevertheless i yield to your feelings but star of my life i shall dream of you and of that little priest who waits with the key of paradise in his hands he bowed over alaires cold fingers then stood erect until she and dolores had gone xxix the priest from monclova that was a night of terror for the women although longorios discipline was in some ways strict in others it was extremely lax from some quarter his men had secured a supply of mescal and forgetful of felipes unhappy fate they rendered the hours hideous there were singing and quarreling and a shot or two sounded from the direction of the outbuildings morning found both alaire and dolores sadly overwrought but they felt some relief upon learning that the general had been unexpectedly summoned from his bed at daylight and had ridden to the telegraph office profiting by his absence alaire ventured from her room racking her brain to devise some means of escape but soldiers were everywhere they lolled around the servants quarters they dozed in the shade of the ranch buildings recovering from the nights debauch and an armed sentinel who paced the hacienda road gave evidence that despite their apparent carelessness they had by no means relaxed their vigilance a round of the premises convinced alaire that the place was effectually guarded and showed her the futility of trying to slip away she realized too that even if she managed to do so her plight would be little better for how could she hope to cover the hundred miles between la feria and the rio grande when every peon was an enemy she was standing in one of the open sashless windows when her former protector the old lieutenant bade her good morning and paused to smoke a cigarette well it was a great night wasnt it he began and we have great news this morning we are going to fight you gringos i hope not yes it will probably go hard with you tell me this city of washington is a fine city and very rich is it not oh yes its full of loot eh especially the presidents palace that is good one can never believe all one hears why do you ask alaire was curious i was thinking it would pay us to go there if your soldiers march upon mexico city it would be a brilliant piece of strategy for general longorio to invade the united states would it not it would be funny to capture washington and hold your president for ransom eh very funny alaire agreed dryly how would you go about it pancho shrugged that is the trouble we would have to march around texas i presume around texas yes you see texas is a bad country it is full of barbarians who know how to fight if it were not for texas we would have the united states at our mercy after some consideration he ventured this opinion we could afford to pay the texans for allowing us to ride through their country provided we stole nothing and paid for the cattle we ate well longorio is a great one for schemes he is talking over the telegraph with somebody at this moment perhaps it is the president of texas you are a poor man are you not alaire inquired miserably poor would you like to make a great deal of money dios that is why im a soldier i will pay you well to get me two horses but old pancho shook his head vigorously impossible general longorio is going to marry you we all got drunk last night to celebrate the wedding yes and the priest is waiting i will make you rich ho i wouldnt live to spend a single peso felipe disobeyed orders and the general shot him before he could cross himself boom the poor fellow was in hell in a minute no we will all be rich after we win a few battles and capture some american cities i am an old man i shall leave the drinking and the women to the young fellows and prepare for my old age seeing that she could not enlist panchos aid alaire begged him to fetch the priest you wish spiritual comfort senora perhaps well he doesnt look like much of a priest but probably he will do as for me i dont believe in such things churches are all very well for ignorant people but we mexicans are too intelligent we are making an end of them the priest was a small whitehaired man with a gentle almost timid face and at the moment when he appeared before alaire he was in anything but a happy frame of mind he had undergone he told her a terrible experience his name was omalley he had come from monclova whence the rebels had banished him under threat of death he had seen his church despoiled of its valuables his school closed he himself had managed to escape only by a miracle during his flight toward the border he had suffered every indignity and finally longorio had intercepted him and brought him here practically in chains what a situation what chaos he lamented the land is overrun with bandits there is no law no authority no faith religion is made a mockery the men are becoming infidels and atheists and in many places they will not allow us to give comfort even to their women is it as bad as that father omalley shook his head sadly youve no idea what do you think of a people who forbid the mention of gods name in their schools that is what the revolutionists are doing candeleria claims that the churches are the property of the state he confiscates them and he charges admission he has banished all except a few of us priests and has shamefully persecuted our sisters of mercy oh the outrages mexico is today the blackest spot on the map of christendom his voice broke that is the freedom the liberty the democracy for which they are fighting that is the new mexico and the federals are not a bit better this longorio for instance this wolf he brings me here as his prisoner to solemnize an unholy marriage he treats me like a dog last night i slept in a filthy hovel oh im sorry alaire exclaimed but im half crazed with my own troubles you must come into the house the best i have is yours you shall be as much my guest as i can make you and perhaps you will help me to escape escape the little man smiled mournfully you are watched and guarded and so am i even if you got away from here what then you cant imagine the condition of the country i wont marry him alaire cried with a shudder i wont he cant very well force you to do so but remember these are war times the man is a fiend and he puts no restraint upon his desires if he is madly bent on having you how can you prevent it in normal times he would not dare injure one so prominent as you but now father omalley lifted his hands i only wonder that he suggests a lawful marriage suppose you refuse will he not sacrifice you to his passions he has done worse things after a moments consideration he said of course it is possible that i misjudge him anyhow if you desire me to do so i will refuse to perform the ceremony but im afraid it will just mean ruin for both of us surely he wouldnt harm you the father shrugged what am i an obscure priest many of my brothers are buried in mexico however i shall do as you wish as the day wore on alaire realized even more clearly the fact that she was longorios prisoner his men in spite of their recent debauch kept a very good watch over her and it was plain that they would obey his orders no matter how extreme it occurred to her finally that he was staying away purposely in order to give her a fuller appreciation of her position so that she might beat her wings against the cage until exhausted afternoon came then evening and still longorio did not return father omalley could give scant comfort dolores was a positive trial half distracted alaire roamed through the house awaiting her captors coming steeling herself for their final battle but the delay was trying she longed for the crisis to come that this intolerable suspense might be ended at such an hour her thoughts naturally turned to dave law and she found herself yearning for him with a yearning utterly new his love had supported her through those miserable days at las palmas but now it was a torture she called his name wildly passionately he knew her whereabouts and her peril why did he not come then more calmly she asked herself what he or what any one could do for her how could she look for succor when two nations were at war night had come before she finally gave up and acknowledged the hopelessness of her situation she had fought bravely but with darkness her fears grew blacker she was on the verge of her first breakdown when in the early dusk outside she heard voices and the stamping of horses hoofs the sounds were muffled by the heavy wooden shutters she had taken pains to close and bar but they told her that longorio had returned since it was futile to deny him entrance she waited where she was old panchos voice sounded outside then there came a knock upon the door of the room in which she stood come in she said tensely the lieutenant thrust his head in and removing his hat announced there is someone here to see general longorio on important business he says you will do i yes he says he is one of us pancho was pushed aside the door was flung back and a man strode swiftly into the lamplight he paused blinking as if momentarily blinded and alaire clutched at the nearest chair for support a roaring began in her ears she felt herself sway forward as if the strength had left her knees she heard daves voice faintly he was saying take care of my horse feed and water her well understand when general longorio comes tell him i am waiting here as if in a dream alaire saw the mexican go out closing the door behind him then she saw dave come toward her heard him speak her name felt his arms around her alaire did not swoon but she never could remember very distinctly those first few moments scarcely knowing what she did she found herself clinging to her lover laughing weeping feeling him over with shaking hands that would not be convinced of his reality she was aware of his kisses upon her lips her eyes her hair he was saying something which she could not understand because of that roaring in her ears you heard me calling she told him at last oh i was so frightened she clung closer to him after a time she discovered that she was mechanically nodding and shaking her head at the questions he was putting to her but had only the vaguest idea what they were by and by she began to tell him about longorio speaking in a sort of hypnotic murmur as if her words issued at his mental suggestion and all the time she snuggled against his breast dearest dave held her away in gentle hands i was afraid youd go to pieces like this but i had to break through the best way i could i learned you were here and something about what was going on from the people at the next ranch but i expected to find him here too how did you manage to get here i hardly know i just wouldnt let em stop me this lieutenant wouldnt let me in until i told him i was from monterey with important news i dont remember all i did tell him i tried to get here last night but i had trouble they caught me and i had to buy my way through ive bribed and bullied and lied clear from romero i reckon they couldnt imagine id risk being here if i wasnt a friend it was more daves tone than his words that roused alaire to an appreciation of what he said are you alone she asked in vague dismay then what are we going to do i dont know yet my plans ended here dave you rode in just to find me just to be with me yes and to get him alaire saw his face twitch and realized that it was very haggard very old and tired they lifted my guns a bunch of fellows at the rio negro crossing some of them were drunk and wouldnt believe i was an amigo so i finally had to ride for it cant you take me away she asked faintly what will you do when he comes i reckon ill manage him somehow his grip upon her tightened painfully and she could feel him tremble i was afraid i wouldnt find you i o god alaire he buried his face in her hair i had a terrible scene with him last night he insists upon marrying me i i was hoping youd come how could i when nobody knew where you were didnt you know i wrote you he shook his head then how did you learn from jose i caught him within an hour of the murder and made him tell me everything alaires eyes dilated she held herself away saying breathlessly murder is that what it was he longorio told me something quite different naturally it was he who hired jose to do the shooting ohh alaire hid her face in her hands she looked up again quickly however and her cheeks were white then he wont spare you dave she choked for an instant we must get away before he comes there must be some way of escape think im pretty tired to think im pretty near played out he confessed theyre watching me but theyd let you go now that im here im going to stay until she interrupted crying his name loudly dave yes what is it wait let me think she closed her eyes her brows drew together as if in the labor of concentration when she lifted her lids her eyes were alight her voice was eager i know how i see it he wont dare but you must do what i tell you of course no questions understand when he nodded impatiently she ran to the door and flinging it open called down the hall father father omalley quick then she summoned dolores the priest answered he hurried from his room and with a dazed lack of comprehension acknowledged his swift introduction to dave alaire was keenly alive and vibrant with purpose now dolores too came running and while the men were exchanging greetings her mistress murmured something in her ear then hastened her departure with a quick push turning upon the others alaire explained ive sent for some of the women and theyll be here in a minute father this man has come for me he loves me will you marry us before longorio arrives alaire dave exclaimed she stilled him with a gesture quick will you father omalley was bewildered i dont understand he expostulated nor i echoed dave you dont need to understand i know what im doing ive thought of a way to save us all through daves mind flashed the memory of that thing which had haunted him and made his life a nightmare an incoherent refusal was upon his lips but alaires face besought him it was shining with a strange new ecstasy and he could not bring himself to deny her of what her plan consisted he had only the dimmest idea but he assured himself that it could by no possibility succeed after all what did it matter he asked himself they were trapped this might serve somehow to cheat longorio and alaire would be his wife very well he stammered weakly what are you thinking of i havent thought it all out yet but at that moment dolores returned bringing with her the three blackhaired blackshawled house servants bundling them through the door and ranging them along the wall father omalleys face was puckered he said hesitatingly my dear madam this isnt regular you are not catholics how can i bless you you can marry us legally just the same cant you alaire was breathing rapidly and some part of her eagerness began to thrill her hearers oh yes but then marry us and make haste please please law nodded he could not speak for his mouth was dry a voice within him shouted a warning but he would not listen his heart was beating violently his temples were pounding all the blood of his body seemed centered in his head before the eyes of the four wondering women father omalley married them it seemed to alaire that he would never reach the end although in fact he stumbled through the ceremony swiftly alaire clipped his last words short by crying tell these people so that theyll understand what it all means tell them to remember they have seen a marriage by the church the priest did as he was directed and his audience signified their understanding then dolores led them out xxx the man of destiny now then ill explain said alaire turning to the men longorio declares he wont have me except as his wife and i think he means it he is amazingly egotistical he has tremendous ambitions he thinks this war is his great opportunity and he means to be president hes sure of it he loves me but he loves himself better im sure now dont you see hell have to choose one or the other father omalley did not appear to appreciate the full force of this reasoning my dear he said gravely he can make you a widow again in such times as these men are savages oh but thats not all alaire turned to her newly made husband they let you in and theyll let you out again if you go quickly before its known what weve done dave stared at her in bewilderment i i go and leave you he seemed doubtful of her sanity yes when he laughed shortly alaire cried dave you must dont you see what im driving at if he cant marry me if he finds youre gone and he cant lay hands on you what can he do but let me go dave dear for my sake for the sake of us both youre excited he told her and drew her to himself gently please please she implored you dont know that man said father omalley with conviction but alaire insisted half hysterically now i do thats just it i do know him he is planning the greatest things for himself his head is in the clouds and he darent do the things he used to do thats why i called in those women as witnesses he cant put them out of the way with dave gone ill be safe he cant ignore our marriage but otherwise theres no telling what he may do why hell kill you dave as he killed ed she upturned a face eloquent with pleading wont you do this for me no law declared firmly you wouldnt ask it if you were in your senses get me a gun and ill shoot my way out well go until they stop us but dont ask me to leave you she searched his face eagerly piteously then with a quivering sigh relaxed her tension then weve only made matters worse youve spoiled our only chance father omalley who had been lost in thought spoke up again perhaps you will let me try my wits but first do i understand that it was he who effected the death of mr austin dave recounted as coherently as he could the circumstances of eds death and told how he had learned through jose of longorios intentions as the priest listened a spot of color grew in his cheeks his eyes glowed with indignation he was about to make known what was in his mind when alaire raised her hand and in a strained whisper exclaimed shh listen the heavy door of the hacienda creaked a quick tread sounded on the tiles the door to the livingroom was flung open and longorio entered he was hot and dusty from his ride but with a lovers impetuosity he had made straight for this lighted room for the briefest instant he balanced himself just inside the portal and the smile remained fixed upon his lips then his eyes became ringed with white and he made a swift catlike movement of retreat plainly this was the supremest surprise of his lifetime and he seemed to doubt his senses but he recovered quickly thrusting his head forward he demanded what is this you and you he stared from dave to the priest then back again they all spoke at once but he heard only alaires words he came to find me pancho appeared in the doorway behind longorio saying i heard you ride up sir so i ran to tell you about this fellow but the general cut him short call your men quick he cried in a voice that sent the soldier leaping back into the night alaire was clinging to dave merely clutching him the tighter when he tried to unclasp her hold her movement into the shelter of his rivals arms infuriated longorio who uttered an exclamation and fumbled uncertainly with his holster but his fingers were clumsy he could not take his eyes from the pair and he seemed upon the point of rushing forward to tear them apart dont touch her dont he began cursing in a highpitched voice god what a reckoning then he stamped his feet he wrung his hands he called shrilly at the top of his voice lieutenant ho pancho you fellows quickly under the stress of his excitement the feminine side of his character betrayed itself alaire felt her newly made husband gather himself for a spring he was muttering to her to release him he was trying to push her aside but she held fast with the strength of desperation you cant harm us she declared flinging her words defiantly at the mexican you dare not you are too late father omalley has just married us longorio uttered a peculiar wordless cry of dismay his mouth fell open his arms dropped he went limp all over paralyzed momentarily by surprise and horror his eyes protruded he swayed as if his sight had blurred i said id never marry you she rushed on vibrantly this is the man i love the only man yes and ive learned the truth about you i know who killed mr austin longorio did a very unexpected thing then slowly unconsciously as if the movement were the result of a halfforgotten training he crossed himself but now from the hall at his back came the pounding of bootheels and a half dozen panting troopers tumbled through the door he waved them back and out into the hall again father omalley who had been trying to make himself heard stepped in front of the general and said solemnly take care what you do longorio i have married these people and you cant undo what i have done we are american citizens the laws of civilization protect us the mexican fought for his voice then stammered you are my priest i brought you here i offered to marry her now you force me to damn my soul turning his eyes wildly upon alaire he shouted too late eh you say i am too late it seems that i am barely in time dave added his words to the others you are ten to one but you cant have her he cried defiantly jose sanchez confessed to the murder of mr austin and told how you had got mrs austin to come here the whole thing is known in washington and mexico city by this time the newspapers have it everybody knows you are keeping her as your prisoner and that i have come for her if she is harmed all mexico all the world will know that you are worse than a murderer longorio reached behind his back and slammed the door in the faces of his listening men what is this what did jose confess he inquired sharply he swears you hired him bah the word of a pelador in spite of the mans contemptuous tone dave saw the expression in his face and made a quick decision theres a limit to what you dare to do longorio im unarmed i make no resistance so there is no excuse for violence i surrender to you and claim protection for myself and my wife but longorio was not to be tricked good he cried triumphantly i have been looking forward to something like this and i shall give myself a great pleasure he laid a hand upon the doorknob but before he could turn it the catholic priest had him by the arm and with a strength surprising in one of his stature wrenched him away father omalleys face was white and terrible his voice was deep menacing the hand he raised above longorio seemed to brandish a weapon stop he thundered are you a madman destruction hangs over you destruction of body and soul you dare not separate those whom god hath joined god god the other shrilled i dont believe in him i am a god i know of no other blasphemer roared the little man listen then so surely as you harm these people so surely do you kill your earthly prospects you the first man of mexico the dictator indeed think what you are doing before it is too late is your dream of greatness only a dream will you sacrifice yourself and all your aspirations in the heat of this unholy and impossible passion tonight now you must choose whether you will be famous or infamous glorious or shameful honored or dishonored restrain your hatred and conquer your lust or forego for ever your dreams of empire and pass into oblivion you are a meddler longorio stormed you make a loud noise but i shall rid mexico of your kind we shall have no more of you priests father omalley shook the speaker as a parent shakes an unruly child see you have completely lost your head but i want you to listen to what i am saying whether you are more good than evil god must judge but the people of mexico are good people and they will not be ruled by a man who is wholly bad you have the power to remove this man and this woman yes and this priest who dares to point out the pit at your feet but if you do you will never command another mexican army there is no war we are not your enemies the world knows we are here and it holds you accountable for our safety tomorrow you will have to face the reckoning longorio listened it was plain that he recognized the truth of omalleys words but he was convulsed with rage good he cried i see my dreams dissolve but i am not the first great man to trade an empire for a woman antony the roman general laid his honor in a womans arms i had a shining destiny but mexico will be the sufferer by my betrayal instead of longorio the deliverer i shall be known as longorio the lover the man who gave all omalley interrupted forcefully enough of this come with me i have something more to say to you he flung open the door into the hall and taking the general by the arm fairly dragged him from the room and into the one opposite the lieutenant and his men looked on in amazement shuffling their feet and shifting their rifle butts noisily upon the floor alaire turned an anxious face to dave saying he is wonderful longorio is almost afraid of him yes he may bring him to his senses if he doesnt dave cast his eyes desperately over the room conscious all the time that he was being watched with suspicion by the men outside he stirred restlessly and moistened his lips longorio would be crazy to injure you ten minutes passed fifteen alaire leaned motionless against the table dave paced about followed by the eyes of the soldiers one of the latter struck a match and in the silence it sounded like a gunshot dave started at which the soldiers laughed they began to talk in murmurs the odor of cigarette smoke drifted in to the man and the woman finally the door through which father omalley and longorio had passed opened and the priest emerged he was alone his face was flushed and damp his eyes were glowing he forced the mexicans out of his way and entering the livingroom closed the door behind him well his two friends questioned anxiously ive done all i can the rest is out of our hands the little man sat down heavily and mopped his forehead what does he say he told me to come here and wait i never saw a man so torn so distracted then he is wavering ohh alaire clasped her hands in thanksgiving but the father cautioned her dont be too sanguine he is not afraid of consequences he appears to have no conscience he is without mercy and seems lost to shame i have never met a man quite like him do you know what he feels at this moment chagrin yes mortification raised to the highest pitch and a sort of stupefaction that you should prefer another man to him he cant understand your lack of taste father omalley smiled faintly conceited idiot dave growled his humiliation kills him when i saw that it was useless to appeal to him on moral grounds and that threats were unavailing i took another course something gave me insight into his mind and the power to talk as i have never talked before all in a flash i saw the mans soul laid bare before me and i think i played upon it with some cunning i dont remember all i said for i was inspired but i appealed to his vanity and to his conceit and as i went along i impressed upon him over and over the fact that the world knows we are here and that it trusts him he aspires to the presidency he believes he is destined to be mexicos dictator so i painted a picture that surpassed his own imaginings he would have been suspicious of mere flattery so i went far beyond that and inflamed him with such extravagant visions as only a child or an unblushing egotist like him could accept i swelled his vanity i inflated his conceit for a moment at least i lifted him out of himself and raised him to the heights from beyond the closed door came longorios voice issuing some command to his men a moment passed then he appeared before the three americans he seemed taller thinner more erect and hawklike than ever his head was held more proudly and his chest was fuller a set disdainful smile was graven upon his face he began by addressing his words directly to alaire senora he said i am a man of deep feeling and i scorn deceit therefore i offer no apology for my recent display of emotion if i have seemed to press my advances with undue fervor it is because at heart i am as great a lover as i am a statesman or a soldier but there are other things than love nature constituted me a leader and he who climbs high must climb alone i offered chapultepec as a shrine for your beauty i offered to share mexico with you and i told you that i would not be content with less than all of you well i meant it otherwise i would take you now his voice throbbed with a sudden fierce desire and his long lean hands closed convulsively you must realize that i have the courage and the power to defy the world eh he seemed to challenge denial of this statement but receiving none he went on fixing his brilliant feverish eyes once more upon alaire as a man of sentiment i am unique i am different from any you have ever known i would not possess a flower without its fragrance you did not believe me when i told you that but i am going to prove it all your life you are going to think of me as heroic perhaps no patriot in history ever made a more splendid sacrifice for his country than i make now some day the world will wonder how i had the strength to put aside love and follow the path of duty alaire trusted herself to ask then we are free to go the generals face was swept by a grimace intended for a smile i have ordered your horses to be saddled dave who had with difficulty restrained his anger at the fellows bombast was upon the point of speaking when father omalley took the words out of his mouth would you send this woman out of her own house into a country like like this remember the fortune in cattle you have already taken longorio broke in with a snarl is it my fault that the country is in arms military necessity compels me to remain here i consider myself magnanimous i his voice cracked and he made a despairing violent gesture go before i change my mind dave signaled to the others and alaire slipped away to make herself ready during the uncomfortable silence which succeeded her departure longorio paced the room keeping his eyes resolutely turned away from law do you mean that i too may go omalley inquired what good are you to me snapped the general you will give us safe conduct be still priest longorio glared at the speaker clasping and unclasping his fists behind his back with the sound of hoofs outside alaire and dolores appeared and the mexican straightened himself with an effort adios senora he said with a stiff bow we have had a pleasant friendship and a thrilling flirtation eh i shall never cease to regret that fate interrupted at such an interesting moment adios adios he bowed formally in turn to dave and to the priest then resumed his pacing with his hands at his back and his brow furrowed as if in a struggle with affairs of greater moment than this but when he heard the outside door creak shut behind them his indifference vanished and he halted with head turned in an effort to catch the last sounds of their departure his face was like tallow now his lips were drawn back from his teeth as if in supreme agony a moment and the hoofbeats had died away then longorio slipped his leash he uttered a cry a hoarse halfstrangled shriek that tore his throat he plucked the collar from his neck as if it choked him he beat his breast seizing whatever article his eye fell upon he tore and crushed it he swept the table clean of its queer spanish bricabrac and trampled the litter under his heels spying a painting of a saint upon the wall he ran to it ripped it from its nail and raising it over his head smashed frame and glass cursing all saints all priests and churchly people havoc followed him as he raged about the place wreaking his fury upon inanimate objects when he had wellnigh wrecked the contents of the room and when his first paroxysm had spent its violence he hurled himself into a chair writhing in agony he bit his wrists he pounded his fists he kicked finally he sprawled full length upon the floor clawing at the cool smooth tiles until his nails bled christ o christ he screamed the sound of his blasphemies reached the little group of soldiers who had lingered curiously outside and they listened openmouthed one by one they crossed themselves and stole away into the darkness muttering xxxi a spanish will with a singing heart alaire rode through the night at her husbands side the strain of the last few hours had been so intense the relief at her deliverance so keen that now she felt curiously weak and she kept close to dave comforted by his nearness and secure in the knowledge of his strength although he was unusually taciturn and rode with his chin upon his breast she attributed his silence to fatigue now and then therefore she spurred to his side and spoke softly caressingly at such times he reached for her hand and clung to it dave was indeed weary he was in fact in a sort of stupor and not infrequently he dozed for a moment or two in his saddle yet it was not this which stilled his tongue but a growing sense of guilt and dismay at what he had brought upon himself in a moment of weakness he had done the very thing against which he had fought so bitterly and now he faced the consequences how when where could he find strength to undo his action he asked himself the weight of this question bent his shoulders paralyzed his wits some two hours out from la feria the riders halted at a point where the road dipped into a rocky streambed then as the horses drank dolores voiced a thought that had troubled all of them if that bandit really means to spare us why did he send us away in the night like this she asked i shall be surprised if we are not assassinated before morning he must have meant it alaire spoke with a conviction she did not entirely feel father omalley aroused the finer side of his nature perhaps agreed the priest somewhere in him there is a fear of god but dave was skeptical more likely a fear of the gringo government said he longorio is a fourflusher when he realized he was licked he tried to save his face by a grandstand play he didnt want to let us go then what is to prevent him from well from having us followed alaire inquired nothing dave told her as they climbed the bank and rode onward into the night she said no matter what happens dear i shall be happy for at last one of my dreams has come true he reached out and patted her youve no idea what a coward i was until you came but the moment i saw you all my fears vanished i was like a lost child who suddenly sees her father in your arms i felt perfectly safe for the first time in all my life i think i i couldnt bear to go on without you after this dave found nothing to say they rode along side by side for a time in a great contentment that required no speech then alaire asked dear have you considered how we are going to explain our marriage wont the circumstances explain it perhaps and yet it seems ages since i learned what happened to ed but in reality its only a few hours wont people talk dave caught at the suggestion i see then lets keep it secret for the present i promise not to act like a husband with a little reckless laugh she confessed i im afraid ill find it difficult to be conventional my wife he cried in sharp agony leaning far out he encircled her with his arm then half lifting her from her saddle he crushed his lips to hers it was his first display of emotion since father omalley had united them there were few villages along the road they followed and because of the lateness of the hour all were dark hence the party passed through without exciting attention except from an occasional wakeful dog but as morning came and the east began to glow dave told the priest weve got to hide out during the day or well get into trouble besides these women must be getting hungry i fear there is something feminine about me confessed the little man im famished too at the next rancho they came to they applied for shelter but were denied in fact the owner cursed them so roundly for being americans that they were glad to ride onward a mile or two farther along they met a cart the driver of which refused to answer their greetings as they passed out of his sight they saw that he had halted his lean oxen and was staring after them curiously later when the sun was well up and the world had fully awakened they descried a mounted man evidently a cowboy riding through the chaparral he saw them too and came toward the road but after a brief scrutiny he whirled his horse and galloped off through the cactus shouting something over his shoulder this wont do omalley declared uneasily i dont like the actions of these people let me appeal to the next person we meet i cant believe they all hate us soon they came to a rise in the road and from the crest of this elevation beheld ahead of them a small village of white houses shining from the shelter of a grove the rancheria was perhaps two miles away and galloping toward it was the vaquero who had challenged them thats the rio negro crossing dave announced then spying a little house squatting a short distance back from the road he said wed better try yonder if they turn us down well have to take to the brush omalley agreed yes and we have no time to lose that horseman is going to rouse the town im afraid were in for it dave nodded silently leaving the beaten path the refugees threaded their way through cactus and sage to a gate entering which they approached the strawthatched jacal they had seen a naked boy baby watched them draw near then scuttled for shelter piping an alarm a man appeared from somewhere at sight of whom the priest rode forward with a pleasant greeting but the fellow was unfriendly his wife too emerged from the dwelling and joined her husband in warning father omalley away let me try alaire begged and spurred her horse up to the group she smiled down at the country people saying we have traveled a long way and were tired and hungry wont you give us something to eat well pay you well for your trouble the man demurred sullenly and began a refusal but his wife after a wondering scrutiny interrupted him with a cry rushing forward she took the edge of alaires skirt in her hands and kissed it god be praised a miracle she exclaimed juan dont you see it is the beautiful senora for whom we pray every night of our lives on your knees shameless one it is she who delivered you from the prison juan stared unbelievingly then his face changed his teeth flashed in a smile and sweeping his hat from his head he too approached alaire it is senora i am juan garcia whom you saved and this is inez he declared heaven bless you and forgive me now i know you alaire laughed and slipped down from her saddle this is a happy meeting so you live here and that was little juan who ran away as if we were going to eat him well we are hungry but not hungry enough to devour juanito turning to her companions she explained the circumstances of her first meeting with these good people and as she talked the garcias broke in joyfully adding their own account of her goodness weve fallen among friends alaire told dave and father omalley they will let us rest here i am sure husband and wife agreed in one voice in fact they were overjoyed at an opportunity of serving her and little juan his suspicions partially allayed issued from hiding and waddled forward to take part in the welcome shamefacedly the elder garcia explained his inhospitable reception of the travelers we hear the gringos are coming to kill us and take our farms everybody is badly frightened we are driving our herds away and hiding what we can yesterday at the big obispo ranch our people shot two americans and burned some of their houses they intend to kill all the americans they find so youd better be careful just now a fellow rode up shouting that you were coming but of course i didnt know yes of course were trying to reach the border father omalley told him will you hide us here until we can go on juan courtesied respectfully to the priest my house is yours father can you take care of our horses too and give us a place to sleep dave asked his eyes were heavy he had been almost constantly in the saddle since leaving jonesville and now could barely keep himself awake trust me the mexican assured them confidently if somebody comes ill send them away oh i can lie with the best of them the garcias were not ordinary people and they lived in rather good circumstances for country folk there were three rooms to their little house all of which were reasonably clean the food that inez set before her guests too was excellent if scanty juanito taking the cue from his parents flung himself wholeheartedly into the task of entertainment and since alaire met his advances halfway he began before long to look upon her with particular favor once they had thoroughly made friends he showered her with the most flattering attentions his shyness it seemed was but a pretense at heart he was a bold and enterprising fellow and so as a mark of his admiration he presented her with all his personal treasures first he fetched and laid in her lap a cigarbox wagon with wooden wheels evidently the handiwork of his father then he gave her one by one a highly prized blue bottle a rusty mexican spur and the ruins of what had been a splendid clasp knife there were no blades in the knife but he showed her how to peep through a tiny hole in the handle where was concealed the picture of a dashing spanish bullfighter the appreciation which these gifts evoked intoxicated the little man and roused him to a very madness of generosity he pattered away and returned shortly staggering and grunting under the weight of another and a still greater offering it was a dog a patient hungry dog with very little hair the animal was alive with fleas it scratched absentmindedly with one hind paw even while juanito strangled it against his naked breast but it was the apple of its owners eye and when inez unfeelingly banished it from the house juanito began to squall lustily nor could he be conciliated until alaire took him upon her knee and told him about another boy of precisely his own age and size who planted a magic bean in his mothers dooryard which grew up and up until it reached clear to the sky where a giant lived juanito garcia had never heard the like he was spellbound with delight he held his breath in ecstasy only his toes moved and they wriggled like ten fat brown tadpoles in the midst of this recital garcia senior appeared in the door with a warning conceal yourselves he said quickly some of our neighbors are coming this way inez led her guests into the bedchamber a bare room with a dirt floor from the window of which they watched juan go to meet a group of horsemen inez went out too and joined in the parley then after a time the riders galloped away when alaire having watched the party out of sight turned from the window she found that dave had collapsed upon a chair and was sleeping his limbs relaxed his body sagging poor fellow hes done up father omalley exclaimed yes he hasnt slept for days she whispered help me with the assistance of dolores they succeeded in lifting dave to the bed but he half roused himself lie down dear alaire told him close your eyes for a few minutes were safe now somebody has to keep watch he muttered thickly and tried to fight off his fatigue but he was like a drunken man im not sleepy ill stand guard the priest volunteered and disregarding further protest he helped alaire remove daves coat seeing that the bed was nothing more than a board platform covered with straw matting alaire folded the garment for a pillow as she did so a handful of soiled frayed letters spilled out upon the floor rest now while you have a chance she begged of her husband just for a little while all right he agreed call me in an hour couldnt sleep wasnt time he shook off his weariness and smiled at his wife while his eyes filmed with some emotion there is something i ought to tell you but i cant now not now too sleepy his head drooped again she forced him back he stretched himself out with a sigh and was asleep almost instantly alaire motioned the others out of the room then stood looking down at the man into whose keeping she had given her life as she looked her face became radiant dave was unkempt unshaven dirty but to her he was of a godlike beauty and the knowledge that he was hers to comfort and guard was strangely thrilling her love for ed even that first love of her girlhood had been nothing like this how could it have been like this she asked herself how could she have loved deeply when at the time her own nature lacked depth experience had broadened her and suffering had uncovered depths in her being which nothing else had had the power to uncover stooping she kissed dave softly then let her cheek rest against his her man her man she found herself whispering the words her eyes were wet but there was a smile upon her lips when she gathered up the letters which had dropped from her husbands pocket she wondered with a little jealous twinge who could be writing to him it seemed to her that she owned him now and that she could not bear to share him with any other she studied the inscriptions with a frown noticing as she did so that several of the envelopes were unopened either dave was careless about euch things or else he had had no leisure in which to read his mail one letter was longer and heavier than the rest and its covering sweatstained and worn at the edges came apart in her hands exposing several pages of typewriting in the spanish language the opening words challenged her attention in the name of god amen alaire read involuntarily her eye followed the next line know all men by this public instrument that i maria josefa law of this vicinity alaire started who she asked herself was maria josefa law dave had no sisters no female relatives whatever so far as she knew she glanced at the sleeping man and then back at the writing finding myself seriously ill in bed but with sound judgment full memory and understanding believing in the ineffable mysteries of the holy trinity three distinct persons in one god in essence and in the other mysteries acknowledged by our mother the church so this was a will one of those queer spanish documents of which alaire had heard but who was maria josefa law alaire scanned the sheets curiously and on the reverse side of the last one discovered a few lines also in spanish but scrawled in pencil they read my dear nephew here is the copy of your mothers will that i told you about at the time of her death she was not possessed of the property mentioned herein and so the original document was never filed for record but came to me along with certain family possessions of small value it seems to contain the information you desire yrs affly francisco ramirez the will of daves mother then maria josefa law was that poor woman regarding whose tragic end judge ellsworth had spoken so peculiarly alaire felt not a little curiosity to know more about the mother of the man whose name she had taken accordingly after a moment of debate with herself she sat down to translate the instrument surely dave would not object if she occupied herself thus while he slept the document had evidently been drawn in the strictest form doubtless by some local priest for it ran first i commend my soul to the supreme being who from nothing formed it and my body i order returned to earth and which as soon as it shall become a corpse it is my wish shall be shrouded with a blue habit in resemblance to those used by the monks of our seraphic father st francis to be interred with high mass without pomp alaire mused with a certain reverent pleasure that daves mother had been a devout woman second i declare to have in the possession of my husband franklin law three horses with splendid equipment of saddles and bridles which are to be sold and the proceeds applied to masses for the benefit of my soul i so declare that it may appear third i declare to owe to mrs guillelmo perez about twenty dollars to be ascertained by what she may have noted in her book of accounts so i declare that this debt may be paid as i have ordered fourth in just remuneration for the services of my cousin margarita ramirez i bequeath and donate a silver tray which weighs one hundred ounces seven breeding cows and four fine linen and lace tablecloths so i declare that it may appear fifth i bequeath to my adopted son david offspring of the unfortunate american woman who died in my house at escovedo the share of land alaire reread this paragraph wonderingly then let the document fall into her lap so dave was an adopted son and not actually the child of this woman maria josefa law she wondered if he knew it and if so why he hadnt told her but after all what difference did it make who or what he was he was hers to love and to comfort hers to cherish and to serve for a long time she sat gazing at him tenderly then she tiptoed out and delighted the naked garcia baby by taking him in her arms and hugging him inez thought the beautiful senoras voice was like the music of birds it was growing dark when dave was awakened by cool hands upon his face and by soft lips upon his he opened his eyes to find alaire bending over him you must get up she smiled it is nearly time to go and inez is cooking our supper he reached up and took her in his arms she lay upon his breast thrilling happily with her nearness to him and they remained so for a while whispering now and then trying ineffectually to voice the thoughts that needed no expression why did you let me sleep so long he asked her reproachfully oh ive been napping there in that chair where i could keep one eye on you im terribly selfish i cant bear to lose one minute after a while she said ive made a discovery father omalley snores dreadfully juanito never heard anything like it and it frightened him nearly to death he says the father must be a very fierce man to growl so loudly he says too that he likes me much better than his mother it seemed to dave that the bliss of this awakening and the sweet intimacy of this one moment more than rewarded him for all he had gone through and paid him for any unhappiness the future might hold in store he felt called upon to tell alaire the truth about himself but with her in his arms he had no strength of purpose her every endearment made him the more aware of his weakness again he asked himself when and how he could bear to tell her not now certainly not now when she was trembling under his caresses ive been busy too she was saying i sent juan to the village to learn the news and its not very nice its good we stopped here he says nuevo pueblo has been destroyed and the federal forces are all moving south away from the border so our troubles arent over yet we must reach the river tonight yes by all means juan is going with us as guide you arranged everything while i snoozed eh im ashamed of myself alaire nodded then pretended to frown darkly you ought to be she told him while you were asleep i read your mail and my mail dave was puzzled exactly have you forgotten that your pockets were full of unopened letters oh those they came just as i was leaving jonesville and i havent thought of them since you know i havent had my clothes off im going to read all your love letters she told him threateningly yes and youre going to write all of them too he laughed but she shook a warning finger in his face i told you im a jealous person im going to know all about you past present and future i alaire my darling he cried and his face stiffened as if with pain still in a joyous mood she teased him you had better tremble ive found you out deceiver i know who you really are who am i dont you know dave shook his head really have you never read your mothers will law rose to his elbow then swung his legs to the floor what are you talking about he asked for answer alaire handed him the frayed envelope and its contents he examined it and then said heavily i see i was expecting this it seems ive been carrying it around all this time why dont you read it she insisted theres light enough there by the window i supposed you knew all about it or i wouldnt have joked with you he opened his lips to speak but seeing something in her eyes he stepped to the window and read swiftly a moment and then he uttered a cry alaire he exclaimed hoarsely read this my eyes o god wonderingly she took the sheets from his shaking hands and read aloud the paragraph he indicated fifth i bequeath to my adopted son david offspring of the unfortunate american woman who died in my house at escovedo again dave cried out and knelt at alaires feet his arms about her knees his face buried in her dress his shoulders were heaving and his whole body was racked with sobs shocked frightened alaire tried to raise him but he encircled her in a tighter embrace dave what is it what have i done she implored have i hurt you so it was a long time before he could make known the significance of that paragraph and when he finally managed to tell her about the terrible fear that had lain so heavily upon his soul it was in broken choking words which showed his deep emotion the story was out at last however and he stood over her transfigured alaire lifted her arms and placed them upon his shoulders were you going to give me up for that for a shadow yes i had made up my mind i wouldnt have dared marry you last night but i never expected to see todays sun i didnt think it would make much difference it was more than a shadow alaire it was real i was mad stark staring mad or in a fair way of becoming so i suppose i brooded too much those violent spells those wild moments i sometimes have made me think it must be true i dare say they are no more than temper but they seemed to prove all that ellsworth suspected you must have thought me a very cowardly woman she told him it wouldnt have made the slightest difference to me dave we would have met it together when it came just as well meet everything now you and i together my wife he laid his lips against her hair they were standing beside the window speechless oblivious to all except their great love when dolores entered to tell them that supper was ready and that the horses were saddled xxxii the dawn juan garcia proved to be a good guide and he saved the refugees many miles on their road to the rio grande but every farm and every village was a menace and at first they were forced to make numerous detours as the night grew older however they rode a straighter course urging their horses to the limit hoping against hope to reach the border before daylight overtook them this they might have done had it not been for father omalley and dolores who were unused to the saddle and unable to maintain the pace juan set for them about midnight the party stopped on the crest of a flinty ridge to give their horses breath and to estimate their progress the night was fine and clear outlined against the sky were the stalks of countless sotolplants standing slim and bare like the upright lances of an army at rest ahead the road meandered across a mesa covered with grama grass and black formless blots of shrubbery father omalley groaned and shifted his weight juan tells me well never reach romero by morning at this rate he said and dave was forced to agree i think you and he and alaire had better go on and leave dolores and me to follow as best we can dolores plaintively seconded this suggestion i would rather be burned at the stake than suffer these agonies she confessed my bones are broken the devil is in this horse she began to weep softly go senora save yourself it is my accursed fat stomach that hinders me tell benito that i perished breathing his name and see to it when he remarries that he retains none of my treasures alaire reassured her by saying we wont leave you be brave and make the best of it yes grit your teeth and hold on dave echoed well manage to make it somehow but progress was far slower than it should have been and the elder woman continued to lag behind voicing her distress in groans and lamentations the priest who was made of sterner stuff did his best to bear his tortures cheerfully in spite of their efforts the first rosy heralds of dawn discovered them still a long way from the river and just entering a more thickly settled country daylight came swiftly and juan finally gave them warning we cant go on the danger is too great he told them if the soldiers are still in romero what then have you no friends hereabouts who would take us in dave inquired the mexican shook his head dave considered for a moment you must hide here he told his companions while i ride on to romero and see what can be done i suspect blancos troops have left and in that case everything will be all right suppose they havent alaire inquired all night she had been in the lightest of moods and had steadily refused to take their perils seriously now her smile chased the frown from her husbands face well perhaps ill have breakfast with them he laughed silly i wont let you go she told him firmly and reading the expression in her face he felt a dizzy wonder well find a nice secluded spot then well sit down and wait for night to come well pretend were having a picnic dolores sighed at the suggestion that would be heaven but there can be no sitting down for me garcia who had been standing in his stirrups scanning the long flat road ahead spoke sharply caramba here come those very soldiers now see far away but evidently approaching at a smart gait was a body of mounted men after one look at them dave cried into the brush quick he hurried his companions ahead of him and when they had gone perhaps a hundred yards from the road he took juans winchester saying ride in a little way farther and wait im going back if you hear me shoot break for the river ride hard and keep under cover as much as possible before they could remonstrate he had wheeled montrosa and was gone this was luck he told himself ten miles more and they would have been safe for the rio grande is not a difficult river either to ford or to swim he dismounted and made his way on foot to a point where he could command a view but he had barely established himself when he found alaire at his side go back he told her but she would not and so they waited together there were perhaps a dozen men in the approaching squad and dave saw that they were heavily accoutred they rode fast too and at their head galloped a large man under a widebrimmed felt hat it soon became evident that the soldiers were not uniformed therefore dave reasoned they were not federals but more probably some rebel scouting band from the south and yet he rubbed his eyes and stared again dave pressed forward eagerly incredulously the next instant he had broken cover with a shout alaire was at his side clapping her hands and laughing with excitement the cavalcade halted the big man tumbled from his saddle and came straddling through the high grass waving his hat and yelling blaze you old scoundrel dave cried and seized one of the ranchmans palms while alaire shook the other say were right glad to see youall jones exclaimed we reckoned you might be havin a sort of unpleasantness with longorio so we organized up and came to get you the other horsemen were crowding close now and their greetings were noisy there were the two guzman boys benito gonzales phil strange and a number of jonesvilles younger and more adventurous citizens in the midst of the tumult benito inquired for his wife and dave relieved his anxiety by calling dolores and father omalley then in answer to the questions showered upon him he swiftly sketched the story of alaires rescue and their flight from la feria when he had finished blaze jones drew a deep breath were mighty glad you got out safe but youve kicked the legs from under one of my pet ambitions i sure had planned to nail longorios hide on my barn door yes and youve taken the bread out of the mouths of the space writers and sob sisters from here to hudsons bay miz austin your pictures in every newspaper in the country and believe me its the worst atrocity of the war war father omalley had joined the group now and he asked has war been declared not yet but weve got hopes to alaire blaze explained ellsworths in washington wavin the stars and stripes and singin battle hymns but i reckon the government figures that the original of those newspaper pictures would be safe anywhere well weve got our own ideas in jonesville so some of us assembled ourselves and declared war on our own hook these gentlemen blaze waved his hand proudly at his neighbors constitute the jonesville guards the finest body of american men that has invaded mexican soil since me and dave went after ricardo guzmans remains blamed if i aint sorry you sidetracked our expedition it was evident from the words of the others that the jonesville guards were indeed quite as heedless of international complications as was their commander one and all were highly incensed at longorios perfidy and had alaire suggested such a thing it was patent that they would have ridden on to la feria and exacted a reckoning from him such proof of friendship affected her deeply and it was not until they were all under way back toward romero that she felt she had made her appreciation fully known when she reflected that these men were some of the very neighbors whom she had shunned and slighted and whose honest interest she had so habitually misconstrued all these years it seemed very strange that they should feel the least concern over her it gave her a new appreciation of their chivalry and their worth it filled her with a humble desire to know them better and to strengthen herself in their regard then too the esteem in which they held dave her husband gratified her intensely it made no more difference to them than to her that he was a poor man a man without authority or position they evidently saw and loved in him the qualities which she saw and loved and that was as it should be they were gentle and considerate men too as she discovered when they told her bit by bit what had happened during her absence she learned much to her relief that eds funeral had been held and that all the distressing details of the inquiry had been attended to jose sanchez it appeared had confessed freely although her new friends made plain their indignation at the manner of eds taking off they likewise let her know that they considered his death only a slight loss either to her or to the community not one of them pretended it was anything except a blessing the journey drew to an end very quickly romero deserted now by its garrison stirred and stared sleepily at the invaders but concerned itself with their presence no more than to wonder why they laughed and talked so spiritedly plainly these gringos were a barbarous race of people what with their rushing here and there and with their loud senseless laughter god had wisely placed them beyond the rio grande said the citizens of romero the crossing was made alaire found herself in texas once again and it seemed to her that the sun had never been so bright the air so clear the sky so high the world so smiling as here and now the men who had ridden forth to seek her were smiling too and they were shaking her hands and congratulating her even the guzman boys who were shy in the presence of american ladies were wishing her the best of fortune and the greatest of happiness blaze jones was the last to leave with especial emphasis upon her name he said miz austin paloma and me would like to have you come to our house and stay until you feel like goin back to las palmas when alaire declined with moistened eyes explaining that she could not well accept his invitation he signified his understanding were goin to see a lot of you just the same he promised her cause we feel as if you sort of belonged to us theres a lot of good people in this part of texas and them that aint so good god and the rangers is slowly weedin out we dont always know the ones we like best until something happens to em but if youd heard the prayers the folks of jonesville have been sayin lately youd know you was our favorite then with a meaning twinkle in his eye he told her gravely it seems a pity that i aint younger and betterlookin i would sure cut short your grief then he raised his hat and rode away chuckling alaire turned to dave in dismay he knows she cried im afraid they all know but dont worry theyll respect our wishes father omalley had ridden on ahead with benito and dolores dave and alaire followed leisurely now that the moment of their parting was at hand they lingered by the way delaying it as long as possible feeling a natural constraint at what was in their minds how long will it be he asked her finally how long before i can really have you for my own alaire smiled into his eyes not long but youll be patient wont you dear he took her hand in his and they rode on silently a song in the heart of each of them the end
