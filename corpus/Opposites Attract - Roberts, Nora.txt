 advantage starbuck isnt it always asher mused for a moment the large arena held that humming silence peculiar to indoor sports events there was an aroma of roasted peanuts and sweat the overhead lights heated the scent somewhat pleasantly while the crush of bodies added enforced camaraderie a small child sent up a babbling complaint and was hushed seated several rows back at midcourt asher wolfe watched ty starbuck tennis master gypsy eternal boy of summer and former lover she thought again as she had several times during more than two hours of play that hed changed just how wasnt yet completely clear more than three years had passed since shed seem him in the flesh but he hadnt aged or thickened or lost any of his characteristic verve rarely over the years had she watched a televised match it was too painful too many faces were familiar with his the most strictly avoided if asher had chanced to come across a writeup or picture of him in the sports pages or in a gossip column she had immediately put it aside ty starbuck was out of her life her decision asher was a very decisive woman even her decision to come to the u s indoor tennis championship had been a coolheaded one before making this trip she had carefully weighed the pros and cons in the end logic had won she was getting back into the game herself on the circuit meetings with ty would be unavoidable she would see him now jetting the press her colleagues and fans see clearly that there was nothing left of what had been three years before ty would see too and she hoped fervently so would she ty stood behind the baseline preparing to serve his stance was the same she mused as was his sizzling concentration he tossed the ban up coming back and over with the wicked lefthanded serve that had become synonymous with his name a starbuck asher heard the explosion of his breath that forced the power into it she held her own a lesser player than the frenchman grimalier would never have gotten a racket on the ball his return was quick force meeting force and the rally began the crowd grew noisier as the ball smashed and thudded echoes bounced crazily there were cries of encouragement shouts of appreciation for the prowess of the two players tys basic entertainment value hadnt decreased since asher had been out of the game fans adored or detested him but they never never ignored him nor could she though she was no longer certain which category she fell into every muscle of his body was familiar to her every move every expression her feelings were a confused jumble of respect admiration and longing which swirled to reach a vortex of pain sharply remembered still she was caught up in him again ty starbuck demanded every last emotion and didnt really give a damn if it was love or hate both men moved quickly their eyes riveted on the small white sphere backhand forehand drop shot sweat poured down unheeded both the game and the fans demanded it a tennis buff wanted to see the effort the strain wanted to hear the grunts and whistling breaths wanted to smell the sweat despite her determination to remain dispassionate asher found herself watching ty with the undiluted admiration shed held for him for more than ten years he played with nonchalant flash contradictory terms but there it was strength agility form he had them all he had a long umber body seemingly elastic until the muscles flowed and bunched his sixtwo height gave him an advantage of reach and he could twist and turn on a dime he played like a fencer asher had always thought a swashbuckler graceful sweeps lunges parries with an almost demonic glint in his duskgray eyes his face was that of the adventurer narrow rakish with a hint of strong bone vying with an oddly tender mouth as always his hair was a bit too long flowing wild and black around a white sweatband he was a setup and held advantage but he played as though his life depended on this one point that hadnt changed asher thought as her heart pounded at double time she was as involved in the match as if she were the one with the racket in her hand and the sweat rolling over her skin her palms were slick her own muscles tight tennis involved its onlookers starbuck absorbed them that hadnt changed either ty smashed the ball crosscourt at the sideline it careened away even as the frenchman dove toward it asher sucked in her breath at the speed and placement of the ball wide the line judge said dispassionately a loud complaint poured out of the crowd asher fixed her eyes on ty and waited for the explosion he stood breathing hard from the punishing rally his eyes fixed on the judge the crowd continued to roar disapproval as deuce was called slowly his eyes still on the judge ty swiped his wristband over his brow his face was inscrutable but for his eyes and his eyes spoke volumes the crowd quieted to a murmur of speculation asher bit hard on her bottom lip ty walked back to the baseline without having uttered a sound this was the change asher realized with a jolt control her breath came out slowly as the tension in her shoulders diminished in years past ty starbuck would have hurled abuse and an occasional racket snarled implored the crowd for support or berated them now he walked silently across the service court with temper smoldering in his eyes but he held it in check this was something new behind the baseline ty took his time took his stance then cracked an ace like a bullet from a gun the crowd screamed for him with a quiet insolent patience he waited while the scoring was announced again he held advantage knowing him and others like him asher was aware that his mind was occupied with his next move the ace was already a memory to be taken out and savored later he still had a game to win the frenchman connected with the next serve with a blazing forehand smash the volley was sweating furious and blatantly male it was all speed and fire two pirates blasting at each other across a sea of hardwood there was the sound of the ball hitting the heart of the racket the skid of rubber soles on wood the grunts of the competitors as they drew out more force all drowned beneath the echoes of cheers the crowd was on its feet asher was on hers without even being aware of it neither man gave quarter as the seconds jumped to a minute and a minute to more with a swing of the wrist the frenchman returned a nearly impossible lob that drove him behind the baseline the ball landed deep in the right court with a forceful backhand ty sent the ball low and away from his opponent ending the twoandahalfhour match three sets to one starbuck was the us indoor tennis champion and the crowds hero asher let the enthusiasm pour around her as ty walked to the net for the traditional handshake the match had affected her more than shed anticipated but she passed this off as professional admiration now she allowed herself to wonder what his reaction would be when he saw her again had she hurt him his heart his pride the pride she mused that she could believe the heart was a different matter he would be angry she concluded she would be cool asher knew how to maintain a cool exterior as well as she knew how to smash an overhead lob shed learned it all as a child when they met she would simply deploy his temper she had been preparing for the first encounter almost as religiously as she had been preparing to pick up her profession again asher was going to win at both after he had finished with the showers and the press she would make it a point to seek him out to congratulate him and to present the next test it was much wiser for her to make the first move for her to be the one prepared confident she watched ty exchange words with grimalier at the net then ty turned his head very slowly very deliberately with no searching through the crowd no hesitation his eyes locked on hers the strength of the contact had her drawing in a sharp unwilling breath his eyes held no wavering her mouth went dry then he smiled an unpleasant direct challenge asher met it more from shock than temerity as the crowd bellowed his name starbuck echoed from the walls like a litany ten seconds fifteen he neither blinked nor moved for a man of action he had an uncanny ability for stillness boring into hers his eyes made the distance between them vanish the smile remained fixed just as ashers palms began to sweat he turned a full circle for the crowd his racket above his head like a lance they adored him hed known asher thought furiously as people swarmed around her he had known all along that she was there her anger wasnt the hot logical result of being outmaneuvered but small silver slices of cold fury ty had let her know in ten seconds without words that the game was still on and he always won not this time though she told herself she had changed too but she stood where she was rooted staring out at the now empty court her thoughts were whirling with memories emotions remembered sensations people brushed by her already debating the match she was a tall reedslim figure tanned gold from hours in the sun her hair was short sculptured and mistyblond the style flattered while remaining practical for her profession over three years of retirement asher hadnt altered it her face seemed more suited to the glossy pages of a fashion magazine than the heat and frenzy of a tennis court a weekender one might think looking at her elegant cheekbones in an oval face not a pro the nose was small and straight above a delicately molded mouth she rarely thought to tint makeup on the courts was a waste of tune as sweat would wash it away her eyes were large and round a shade of blue that hinted at violet one of her few concessions to vanity was to darken the thick pale lashes that surrounded them while other women competitors added jewelry or ribbons and bows to the court dress asher had never thought of it even off the court her attire leaned toward the simple and muted an enterprising reporter had dubbed her the face when she had been eighteen shed been nearly twentythree when she had retired from professional play but the name had stuck hers was a face of great beauty and rigid control on court not a flicker of expression gave her opponent or the crowd a hint of what she was thinking or feeling one of her greatest defenses in the game was her ability to remain unruffled under stress the standard seeped into her personal life asher had lived and breathed tennis for so long that the line of demarcation between woman and athlete was smudged the hard unbendable rule imposed by her father was ingrained into her privacy first and last only one person had ever been able to cross the boundary asher was determined he would not do so again as she stood staring down at the empty court her face told nothing of her anger or turmoil or the pain she hadnt been prepared for it was calm and aloof her concentration was so deep that the leader of the small packet of people that approached her had to speak her name twice to get her attention shed been recognized she discovered though asher had known it was inevitable it still gave her a twist of pleasure to sign the papers and programs thrust at her she hadnt been forgotten the questions were easy to parry even when they skirted close to her relationship with ty a smile and doubletalk worked well with fans asher wasnt naive enough to think it would work with reporters that she hoped was for another day as she signed and edged her way back asher spotted a few colleagues an old foe a former doubles partner a smattering of faces from the past her eyes met chuck princes tys closest friend was an affable player with a wrist of steel and beautiful footwork though the silent exchange was brief even friendly asher saw the question in his eyes before she gave her attention to the next fan the words out she thought almost grimly as she smiled at a teenage tennis buff asher wolfes picking up her racket again and theyd wonder and eventually ask if she was picking up ty starbuck too asher chuck moved to her with the same bouncy stride he used to cross a court in his typical outgoing style he seized her by the shoulders and kissed her full on the mouth hey you look terrific with a laugh asher drew back the breath his greeting had stolen from her so do you it was inevitably true chuck was average in almost every way height build coloring but his inner spark added appeal and a puckish sort of sexuality hed never hesitated to exploit it goodnaturedly no one knew you were coming chuck complained easing her gently through the thinning crowd i didnt know you were here until his voice trailed off so that asher knew he referred to the ten seconds of potent contact with ty until after the match he finished he gave her shoulder a quick squeeze why didnt you give someone a call i wasnt entirely sure id make it asher allowed herself to be negotiated to a clear spot in a rear hallway then i thought id just melt into the crowd it didnt seem fair to disrupt the match with any theprodigalreturns business it was a hell of a match the flash of teeth gleamed with enthusiasm i dont know if ive ever seen ty play better than he did in the last set three aces he always had a deadly serve asher murmured have you seen him from anyone else the blunt question would have earned a cold stare chuck earned a quick grimace no i will of course but i didnt want to distract him before the match asher linked her fingers an old nervous habit i didnt realize he knew i was here distract starbuck she thought with an inner laugh no one and nothing distracted him once he picked up his game racket he went crazy when you left chucks quiet statement brought her back deliberately she unlaced her fingers im sure he recovered quickly because the retort was sharper than she had intended asher shook her head as if to take back the words how have you been i saw an ad with you touting the virtues of a new line of tennis shoes howd i look sincere she told him with a quick grin i nearly went out and bought a pair he sighed i was shooting for macho as the tension seeped out of her asher laughed with that face she cupped his chin with her hand and moved it from side to side its a face a mother could trust foolishly she added shh he glanced around in mock alarm not so loud my reputation your reputation suffered a few dents in sydney she recalled what was that three seasons ago the stripper exotic dancer chuck corrected righteously it was merely an exchange of cultures you did look kind of cute wearing those feathers with another laugh she kissed his cheek fuchsia becomes you we all missed you asher he patted her slim strong shoulder the humor fled from her eyes oh chuck i missed you everyone all of it i dont think i realized just how much until i walked in here today asher looked into space at her own thoughts her own memories three years she said softly now youre back her eyes drifted to his now im back she agreed or will be in two weeks the foro italico asher gave him a brief smile that was more determination than joy ive never won on that damn italian clay im going to this time it was your pacing the voice from behind her had ashers shoulders stiffening as she faced chuck her eyes showed only the merest flicker of some secret emotion before they calmed when she turned to ty he saw first that his memory of her beauty hadnt been exaggerated with time and second that her layer of control was as tough as ever so you always told me she said calmly the jolt was over she reasoned with the shock of eye contact in the auditorium but her stomach muscles tightened you played beautifully ty after the first set they were no more than a foot apart now neither could find any changes in the other three years it seemed was barely any time at all it occurred to asher abruptly that twenty years wouldnt have mattered her heart would still thud her blood would still swim for him it had always would always be for him quickly she pushed those thoughts aside if she were to remain calm under his gaze she couldnt afford to remember the press were still tossing questions at him and now at her as well they began to crowd in nudging asher closer to ty without a word he took her arm and drew her through the door at his side that it happened to be a womans rest room didnt faze him as he turned the lock he faced her leaning lazily back against the door while asher stood straight and tense as he had thirty minutes before ty took his time studying her his eyes werent calm they rarely were but the emotion in them was impossible to decipher even in his relaxed stance there was a sense of force a storm brewing asher met his gaze levelly as he expected and she moved him her power of serenity always moved him he could have strangled her for it you havent changed asher youre wrong why could she no longer breathe easily or control the furious pace of her heart am i his brows disappeared under his tousled hair for a moment well see he was a very physical man when he spoke he gestured when he held a conversation he touched asher could remember the brush of his hand on her arm her hair her shoulder it had been his casualness that had drawn her to him and had driven her away now as they stood close she was surprised that ty did not touch her in any way he simply watched and studied her i noticed a change she countered you didnt argue with the referees or shout at the line judge not once her lips curved slightly not even after a bad call he gave her a lightly quizzical smile i turned over that leaf some time ago really she was uncomfortable now but merely moved her shoulders i havent been keeping up total amputation asher he asked softly yes she would have turned away but there was nowhere to go over the line of sinks to her left the mirrors tossed back her reflection and his deliberately she shifted so that her back was to them yes she repeated its the cleanest way and now im going to play again asher responded simply his scent was reaching out for her that familiar somehow heady fragrance that was sweat and victory and sex all tangled together beneath the placid expression her thoughts shot off in a tangent nights afternoons rainy mornings hed shown her everything a man and woman could be together opened doors she had never realized existed he had knocked down every guard until he had found her oh god dear god she thought frantically dont let him touch me now asher linked her fingers together though his eyes never left hers ty noted the gesture and recognized it he smiled in rome asher controlled the urge to swallow in rome she agreed to start ill go in unseeded it has been three years hows your backhand good automatically she lifted her chin better than ever very deliberately ty circled her arm with his fingers ashers palms became damp it was always a surprise he commented the power in that slender arm still lifting weights yes his fingers slid down until they circled the inside of her elbow it gave him bitter pleasure to feel the tiny pulse jump erratically so he murmured softly lady wickerton graces the courts again ms wolfe asher corrected him stiffly ive taken my maiden name back his glance touched on her ringless hands the divorce is final quite final three months ago pity his eyes had darkened with anger when he lifted them back to hers a title suits you so well i imagine you fit into an english manor as easily as a piece of wedgwood drawing rooms and butlers he murmured then scanned her face as if he would memorize it all over again you have the looks for them the reporters are waiting for you asher made a move to her left in an attempt to brush by him tys fingers clamped down why asher hed promised himself if he ever saw her again he wouldnt ask it was a matter of pride but pride was overwhelmed by temper as the question whipped out stinging them both why did you leave that way why did you run off and marry that damn english jerk without a word to me she didnt wince at the pressure of his fingers nor did she make any attempt to pull away thats my business your business the words were hardly out of her mouth before he grabbed both her arms your business wed been together for months the whole damn circuit that year one night youre in my bed and the next thing i know youve run off with some english lord his control slipped another notch as he shook her i had to find out from my sister you didnt even have the decency to dump me in person decency she tossed back i wont discuss decency with you ty she swallowed the words the accusations shed promised herself never to utter i made my choice she said levelly i dont have to justify it to you we were lovers he reminded her tightly we lived together for nearly six months i wasnt the first woman in your bed you knew that right from the start yes i knew she fought the urge to beat at him with the hopeless rage that was building inside her i made my choice then just as i made one later now let me go her cool cultured control had always fascinated and infuriated him ty knew her better than anyone even her own father certainly better than her exhusband inside she was jelly shuddering convulsively but outwardly she was composed and lightly disdainful ty wanted to shake her until she rattled more much more he wanted to taste her again obliterate three years with one long greedy kiss desire and fury hammered at him he knew that if he gave in to either hed never be able to stop the wound was still raw were not finished asher but his grip relaxed you still owe me no defensive outraged she jerked free no i dont owe you anything three years he answered and smiled the smile was the same biting challenge as before you owe me three years and by god youre going to pay he unlocked the door and opened it stepping back so that asher had no choice but to meet the huddle of reporters headon asher how does it feel to be back in the states its good to be home what about the rumors that youre going to play professionally again i intend to play professionally beginning with the opening of the european circuit in rome more questions more answers the harsh glare of a flash causing light to dance in front of her eyes the press always terrified her she could remember her fathers constant instructions dont say any more than absolutely necessary dont let them see what youre feeling theyll devour you churning inside asher faced the pack of avid reporters with apparent ease her voice was quiet and assured her fingers were locked tightly together with a smile she glanced quickly down the hall searching for an escape route ty leaned negligently against the wall and gave her no assistance will your father be in rome to watch you play possibly an ache a sadness carefully concealed did you divorce lord wickerton so you could play again my divorce has nothing to do with my profession a halftruth a lingering anger smoothly disguised are you nervous about facing young rackets like kingston and old foes like martinelli im looking forward to it a terror a well of doubt easily masked will you and starbuck pair up again fury briefly exposed starbucks a singles player she managed after a moment you guysll have to keep your eyes open to see if that changes with his own brand of nonchalance ty slipped an arm around ashers rigid shoulders theres no telling what might happen is there asher her answer was an icy smile youve always been more unpredictable than i have ty he met the smile with one of his own have i leaning down he brushed her lips lightly flashbulbs popped in a blaze of excitement even as their lips met so did their eyes her were twin slits of fury his grimly laughing and ripe with purpose lazily he straightened the face and i have some catching up to do in rome a reporter cracked ty grinned and quite deliberately drew asher closer thats where it started chapter two contents prev next rome the colosseum the trevi fountain the vatican ancient history tragedy and triumphs gladiators and competition in the foro italico the steaming italian sun beat down on the modernday competitors just as it had on those of the empire to play in this arena was a theatrical experience it was sun and space there were lush umbrella pines and massive statues to set the forum apart from any other on the circuit beyond the stadium wooded hills rose from the tiber within its hedge trimmings ten thousand people could chant shout and whistle italian tennis fans were an emotional enthusiastic and blatantly patriotic lot asher hadnt forgotten nor had she forgotten that the foro italico had been the setting for the two biggest revelations in her life her consuming love for tennis her overwhelming love for ty starbuck she had been seven the first time she had watched her father win the italian championship in the famed campo central of course she had seen him play before one of her earliest memories was of watching her tall tanned father dash around a court in blazing white jim wolfe had been a champion before asher had been born and a force to be reckoned with long after her own lessons had begun at the age of three with her shortened racket she had hit balls to some of the greatest players of her fathers generation her looks and her poise had made her a pet among the athletes she grew up finding nothing unusual about seeing her picture in the paper or bouncing on the knee of a davis cup champion tennis and travel ruled her world she had napped in the rear of limousines and walked across the pampered grass of wimbledon she had curtsied to heads of state and had her cheek pinched by a president before she began attending school she had already crossed the atlantic a half dozen times but it had been in rome a year after the death of her mother that asher wolfe had found a lifes love and ambition her father had still been wet and glowing from his victory his white shorts splattered with the red dust of the court when she had told him she would play in the campo central one day and win perhaps it had been a fathers indulgence for his only child or his ambition or perhaps it had been the quietly firm determination he saw in sevenyearold eyes but ashers journey had begun that day with her father as her guide and her mentor fourteen years later after her own defeat in the semifinals asher had watched starbucks victory there had been nothing similar in the style of her father and the style of the new champion jim wolfe had played a meticulous game cold control with the accent on form starbuck played like a fireball all emotion and muscle often asher had speculated on what the results would be if the two men were to meet across a net where her father brought her pride ty brought her excitement watching him she could understand the sense of sexuality onlookers experienced during a bullfight indeed there was a thirst for blood in his style that both alarmed and fascinated ty had pursued her doggedly for months but she had held him off his reputation with women his temper his flamboyance and nonconformity had both attracted and repulsed her though the attraction was strong and her heart was already lost asher had sensibly listened to her head until that day in may hed been like a god a powerful mythological warrior with a strength and power that even the biased italian crowd couldnt resist some cheered him some cheerfully cursed him hed given them the sweat they had come to see and the show ty had taken the championship in seven frenzied sets that night asher had given him both her innocence and her love for the first time in her life she had allowed her heart complete freedom like a blossom kept in the sheltered controlled climate of a hothouse she took to the sun and storm wildly days were steamier and more passionate nights both turbulent and tender then the season had ended now as asher practiced in the early morning lull on court five the memories stirred sweet and bitter as old wine fast rides on back roads hot beaches dim hotel rooms foolish laughter crazy loving betrayal if you dream like that this afternoon kingstons going to wipe you out of the quarterfinals at the admonishment asher snapped back sorry you should be when an old lady drags herself out of bed at six to hit to you asher laughed at thirtythree madge haverbeck was still a force to be reckoned with across a net small and stocky with flyaway brown hair and comfortably attractive features she looked like an ad for homebaked cookies she was in fact a worldclass player with two wimbledon championships a decade of other victories that included the wightman cup and a wicked forehand smash for two years asher had been her doubles partner to their mutual satisfaction and success her husband was a sociology professor at yale whom madge affectionately termed the dean maybe you should sit down and have a nice cup of tea asher suggested while tucking her tongue in her cheek this games rough on middleaged matrons after saying something short and rude madge sent a bullet over the net light and agile asher sprang after it her concentration focused her muscles went to work in the drowsy morning hum the ball thudded on clay and twanged off strings madge wasnt a woman to consider a practice workout incidental she hustled over the court driving asher back to the baseline luring her to the net hammering at her by mixing her shots while asher concentrated on adjusting her pace to the slow frustrating clay for a fast aggressive player the surface could be deadly it took strength and endurance rather than speed asher thanked the endless hours of weight lifting as she swung the racket again and again the muscles in the slender arm were firm after watching one of ashers returns scream past madge shifted her racket to her left hand youre pretty sharp for three years off face asher filled her lungs with air ive kept my hand in though madge wondered avidly about ashers marriage and years of selfimposed retirement she knew her former partner too well to question kingston hates to play the net its her biggest weakness i know asher slipped the spare ball in her pocket ive studied her today shes going to play my game shes better on clay than grass it was a roundabout way of reminding asher of her own weakness she gave madge one of her rare open smiles it wont matter next week im playing center court slipping on a warmup jacket madge gave a hoot of laughter havent changed much have you bits and pieces asher dabbed at sweat with her wristband what about you howre you going to play fortini my dear madge fluffed at her hair ill simply overpower her asher snorted as they strolled off the court you havent changed either if youd told me you were coming back madge put in wed be playing doubles fishers good and i like her but i couldnt make the decision until i was sure i wouldnt make a fool of myself slowly asher flexed her racket arm three years madge i ache she sighed with the admission i dont remember if i ached like this before we can trade legs any time you say face remembering asher turned with a look of concern hows the knee better since the surgery last year madge shrugged i can still forecast rain though heres to a sunny season im sorry i wasnt there for you madge hooked her arm through ashers in easy comradeship naturally i expected you to travel six thousand miles to hold my hand i would have if asher trailed off remembering the state of her marriage at the time of madges surgery recognizing guilt madge gave asher a friendly nudge with her elbow it wasnt as big a deal as the press made out of course she added with a grin i milked it for a lot of sympathy the dean brought me breakfast in bed for two months bless his heart then you came back and demolished rayski in new york yeah madge laughed with pleasure i enjoyed that asher let her gaze wander over the serene arena quiet but for the thud of balls and hum of bees i have to win this one madge i need it theres so much to prove to whom myself first asher moved her shoulders restlessly shifting her bag to her left hand and a few others starbuck no dont answer madge continued seeing ashers expression out of the corner of her eye it just sort of slipped out what was between ty and me was finished three years ago asher stated deliberately relaxing her muscles too bad madge weathered ashers glare easily i like him why stopping madge met the direct look hes one of the most alive people i know ever since he learned to control his temper he brings so such emotion to the courts its good for the game you dont have a stale tournament when starbucks around he also brings that same emotion into his friendships yes asher agreed it can be overwhelming i didnt say he was easy madge countered i said i liked him he is exactly who he is there isnt a lot of phony business to cut through to get to starbuck madge squinted up at the sun i suppose some of it comes from the fact that we turned pro the same year did our first circuit together anyway ive watched him grow from a cocky kid with a smart mouth to a cocky man who manages to keep that wicked temper just under the surface you like him for his temper partly the mild homeylooking woman smiled starbucks just plain strung right asher hes not a man you can be ambivalent about youre either for him or against him it was as much inquiry as statement saying nothing asher began to walk again ambivalence had never entered into her feeling for ty on his way home from his own practice court ty watched them more accurately he watched asher while she remained unaware of him he could take in every detail the morning sun glinted down on her hair her shoulders were strong and slender her gait long leggy and confident he was grateful he could study her now with some dispassion when he had looked out and had seen her in the stands two weeks before it had been like catching a fast ball with his stomach shimmering waves of pain shock anger one sensation had raced after the other he had blown the first set then he had done more than pull himself together he bad used the emotions against his opponent the frenchman hadnt had a chance against tys skill combined with three years of pentup fury always he played his best under pressure and stress it fed him with asher in the audience the match had become a matter of life and death when she had left him shed stolen something from him somehow the victory had helped him regain a portion of it damn her that she could still get to him tys thoughts darkened as the distance between them decreased just looking at her made him want he had wanted her when she had been seventeen the sharp sudden desire for a teenager had astonished the then twentythreeyearold ty he had kept a careful distance from her all that season but he hadnt stopped wanting her he had done his best to burn the desire out by romancing women he considered more his style flamboyant reckless knowledgeable when asher had turned twentyone ty had abandoned common sense and had begun a determined almost obsessive pursuit the more she had evaded him the firmer she refused the stronger his desire had grown even the victory tasted first in rome hadnt lessened his need his life which previously had had one focus then had realigned with two dominating forces tennis and asher at the time he wouldnt have said he loved tennis but simply that it was what and who he was he wouldnt have said he loved asher but merely that he couldnt live without her yet he had had to when shed left him to take another mans name a title and a feather bed ty thought grimly he was determined to make asher wolfe pay for bringing him a pain he had never expected to feel by turning left and altering his pace ty cut across her path apparently by chance hi madge he gave a brunette a quick grin flicking his finger down her arm before turning his attention fully to asher hiya starbuck madge glanced from the man to the woman and decided she wasnt needed hey im late she said by way of explanation then trotted off neither asher nor ty commented from somewhere in the surrounding trees asher heard the high clear call of a bird nearer at hand was the slumberous buzz of bee and dull thud of balls on court three someone cursed fluently but asher was conscious only of ty beside her just like old times he murmured then grinned at her expression you and madge he added asher struggled not to be affected the setting had too many memories she hit to me this morning i hope i dont have to face her in the tournament you go against kingston today yes he took a step closer in her minds eye asher saw the hedge beside her with ty directly in her path dignified retreat was impossible for all her delicacy of looks asher didnt run from a battle she linked her fingers then dragged them apart annoyed and you play devoroux his acknowledgment was a nod is your father coming no the answer was flat and brief ty had never been one to be put off by a subtle warning why hes busy she started to move by him but succeeded only in closing the rest of the distance between them maneuvering was one of the best aspects of tys game ive never known him to miss one of your major tournaments in an old habit he couldnt resist nor she prevent he reached for her hair you were always his first order of business things change she responded stiffly people change so it seems his grin was sharp and cocky will your husband be here exhusband asher tossed her head to dislodge his hand and no funny as i recall he was very fond of tennis casually he set down his bag has that changed too i need to shower asher had drawn nearly alongside of him before ty stopped her his hand slipped to her waist too quickly and too easily how about a quick set for old times sake his eyes were intense that oddly compelling color that was half night and half day asher remembered how they seemed to darken from the pupils out when he was aroused the hand at her waist was widepalmed and longfingered a concert pianists hand but it was rough and worked the strength in it would have satisfied a prizefighter i dont have time asher pushed to free herself and connected with the rockhard muscles of his forearm she pulled her fingers back as though shed been burned afraid there was mockery and a light threat with the overtones of sex her blood heated to the force she had never been able to fully resist ive never been afraid of you and it was true enough she had been fascinated no he spread his fingers drawing her an inch closer fears one of the popular reasons for running away i didnt run she corrected him i left before you did she added silently for once she had outmaneuvered him you still have some questions to answer asher his arm slid around her before she could step back ive waited a long time for the answers youll go on waiting for some he murmured in agreement but ill have the answer to one now she saw it coming and did nothing later she would curse herself for her passivity but when he lowered his mouth to hers she met it without resistance time melted away he had kissed her like this the first time slowly thoroughly gently it was another part of the enigma that a man so full of energy and turbulence could show such sensitivity his mouth was exactly as asher remembered warm soft full perhaps she had been lost the first time he had kissed her drawn to the fury captured by the tenderness even when he brought her closer deepening the kiss with a lowthroated groan the sweetness never diminished as a lover he excelled because beneath the brash exterior was an underlying and deeprooted respect for femininity he enjoyed the softness tastes and textures of women and instinctively sought to bring them pleasure in lovemaking as an inherent loner it was another contradiction that ty saw a lover as a partner never a means to an end asher had sensed this from the first touch so many years ago now she let herself drown in the kiss with one final coherent thought it had been so long her arm which should have pushed him away curved up his back instead until her hand reached his shoulders her fingers grasped at him unhesitatingly she pressed her body to his he was the one man who could touch off the passion she had so carefully locked inside the only man who had ever reached her core and gained true intimacy the meeting of minds as well as of bodies starved for the glimpses of joy she remembered asher clung while her mouth moved avidly on his her greed for more drove away all her reserve and all her promises oh to be loved again truly loved with none of the emptiness that had haunted her life for too long to give herself to take to know the pure searing joy of belonging the thoughts danced in her mind like dreams suddenly remembered with a moan a sigh she pressed against him hungry for what had been the purpose of the kiss had been to punish but hed forgotten the hotblooded passion that could spring from the cool contained woman had forced all else from his mind but need he needed her still needed her and was infuriated if they had been alone he would have taken her and then faced the consequences his impulses were still difficult to control but they werent alone some small part of his mind clung to reality even while his body pulsed she was soft and eager everything he had ever wanted all he had done without ty discovered he had gotten more answers than hed bargained for drawing her away he took his time studying her face who could resist the dangerous power of a hurricane the wicked primitive rumblings of a volcano she stared at him teetering between sanity and desire her eyes were huge and aware her lips parted breathlessly it was a look he remembered long nights in her bed hurried afternoons or lazy mornings she would look at him so just before loving hot and insistent desire spread then closed like a fist in his stomach he stepped back so that they were no longer touching some things change he remarked and some things dont he added before turning to walk away there was time for deep breathing before asher took her position for the first serve it wasnt the thousand pairs of eyes watching around the court that had her nerves jumping it was one pair dark brown and intense seventyeight feet away stacie kingston age twenty hottest newcomer to the game in two years she had energy force and drive along with a fierce will to win asher recognized her very well the red clay spread out before her waiting because she knew the importance of mastering the skittish nerves and flood of doubts she continued to take long deep breaths squeezing the small white ball asher discovered the true meaning of trial by fire if she won here where she had never won before three years after she had last lifted a racket professionally she would have passed the test rome it seemed would always be her turning point because it was the only way she blocked out the past blocked out tomorrow and focused wholly on the contest tossing the ball up she watched the ascent then struck home her breath came out in a hiss of effort kingston played a strong offensive game a studied meticulous player she understood and used the personality of clay to her advantage forcing asher to the baseline again and again asher found the dirt frustrating it cut down on her speed she was hurrying defending herself the awareness of this only made her rush more the ball eluded her bouncing high over her head when she raced to the net dropping lazily into the forecourt when she hugged the baseline unnerved by her own demons she doublefaulted kingston won the first game breaking ashers serve and allowing her only one point the crowd was vocal the sun ferocious the air was thick with humidity from the other side of the hedge asher could hear the games and laughter of schoolchildren she wanted to throw aside her racket and walk off the court it was a mistake a mistake her mind repeated to have come back why had she subjected herself to this again to the effort and pain and humiliation her face was utterly passive showing none of the turmoil gripping the racket tightly she fought off the weakness she had played badly she knew because she had permitted kingston to set the pace it had taken asher less than six minutes from first service to defeat her skin wasnt even damp she hadnt come back to give up after one game nor had she come back to be humiliated the stands were thick with people watching waiting she had only herself flicking a hand at the short skirt of her tennis dress she walked back to the baseline crouched she shifted her weight to the balls of her feet anger with herself was forced back fear was conquered a cool head was one of her greatest weapons and one she hadnt used in the first game this time she was determined this time the game would be played her way she returned the serve with a drop shot over the net that caught kingston off balance the crowd roared its approval as the ball boy scurried across the court to scoop up the dead ball lovefifteen asher translated the scoring in her head with grim satisfaction fear had cost her the first game now in her own precise way she was out for blood kingston became more symbol than opponent asher continued to draw her opponent into the net inciting fierce volleys that brought the crowd to its feet the roar and babble of languages did not register with her she saw only the ball heard only the effortful breathing that was hers she ended that volley with a neatly placed ball that smacked clean at the edge of the baseline something stirred in her the hot bubbling juice of victory asher tasted it reveled in it as she walked coolly back to position her face was wet now so she brushed her wristband over her brow before she cupped the two service balls in her hand only the beginning she told herself each game was its own beginning by the end of the first set the court surface was zigzagged with skid marks red dust streaked the snowy material of her dress and marked her shoes sweat rolled down her sides after thirtytwo minutes of ferocious play but shed taken the first set sixthree adrenaline was pumping madly though asher looked no more flustered than a woman about to hostess a dinner party the competitive drives she had buried were in complete control part of her sensed starbuck was watching she no longer cared at that moment asher felt that if she had faced him across the net she could have beaten him handily when kingston returned her serve deep asher met it with a topspin backhand that brushed the top of the net charging after the ball she met the next return with a powerful lob the sportswriters would say that it was at that moment when the two women were eye to eye that asher won the match they remained that way for seconds only without words but communication had been made from then asher dominated forcing kingston into a defensive game she set a merciless pace when she lost a point she came back to take two the aggressiveness was back the coldblooded warfare the sportswriters remembered with pleasure from her early years on the court where starbuck was fire and flash she was ice and control never once during a professional match had asher lost her iron grip on her temper it had once been a game among the sportswriters waiting for the face to cut loose only twice during the match did she come close to giving them satisfaction once on a bad call and once on her own poor judgment of a shot both times she stared down at her racket until the urge to stomp and swear had passed when she had again taken her position there had been nothing but cool determination in her eyes she took the match sixone sixtwo in an hour and fortynine minutes twice she had held kingstons service to love three times she had served aces something kingston with her touted superserve had been unable to accomplish asher wolfe would go on to the semifinals she had made her comeback madge dropped a towel over ashers shoulders as she collapsed on her chair good god you were terrific you destroyed her asher said nothing covering her face with the towel a moment to absorb sweat i swear youre better than you were before she wanted to win asher murmured letting the towel drop limply again i had to win it showed madge agreed giving her shoulder a quick rub nobodyd believe you havent played pro in three years i hardly believe it myself slowly asher lifted her face to her old partner im not in shape yet madge she said beneath the din of the stillcheering crowd my calves are knotted i dont even know if i can stand up again madge skimmed a critical glance over ashers features she couldnt detect a flicker of pain bending she scooped up ashers warmup jacket then draped it over ashers shoulders ill help you to the showers i dont play for a half hour you just need a few minutes on the massage table exhausted hurting asher started to agree then spotted ty watching her his grin might have been acknowledgment of her victory but he knew her asher reflected knew her inside as no one else did no thanks ill manage effortfully she rose to zip the cover around her racket ill see you after you beat fortini asher no really im fine now head high muscles screaming she walked toward the tunnel that led to the locker rooms alone in the steam of the showers asher let herself empty weeping bitterly for no reason she could name chapter three contents prev next it was the night after her victory in the semifinals that asher confronted ty again she had kept herself to a rigorous schedule of practice exercise press and play her pacing purposely left her little time for recreation practice was a religion morning hours were spent in the peaceful treeshaded court five grooving in polishing her footwork honing her reflexes exercise was a law pushups and weight lifting stretching and hardening the muscles good press was more than a balm for the ego press was important to the game as a whole as well as the individual player and the press loved a winner play was what the athlete lived for pure competition the testing of the skills of the body the use of the skills of the mind the best played as the best dancers danced for the love of it during the days of her second debut asher rediscovered love in her one brief morning meeting with ty she had rediscovered passion only her fierce concentration on her profession kept her from dwelling on a need that had never died rome was a city for lovers it had been once for her asher knew that this time she must think of it only as a city for competition if she was to survive the first hurdle of regaining her identity lady wickerton was a woman she hardly recognized she had nearly lost asher wolfe trying to fit an image how could she recapture herself if she once again became starbucks lady in a small club in the via sistina where the music was loud and the wine was abundant asher sat at a table crowded with bodies elbows nudged as glasses were reached for liquor spilled and was cheerfully cursed in the second and final week of the italian open the tension grew but the pace mercifully slowed rome was noise fruit stands traffic outdoor cafes rome was serenity cathedrals antiquity for the athletes it was days of grueling competition and nights of celebration or commiseration the next match was a persistent shadow over the thoughts of the winners and the losers as the music blared and the drinks were poured they discussed every serve every smash and error and every bad call rome was blissfully indolent over its reputation for bad calls long a dark lanky australian brooded into his wine that ball was inside by two inches two bloody inches you won the game michael madge reminded him philosophically and in the second game of the fifth set you had a wide ball that wasnt called the australian grinned and shrugged it was only a little wide he brought his thumb and forefinger close together at the goodnatured razzing of his peers what about this one his gesture was necessarily shortened by the close quarters as he lifted a drink toward asher she beats an italian in the foro italico and the crowd still cheers her breeding asher returned with a mild smile the fans always recognize good breeding michael snorted before he swallowed the heavy red wine since when does a bloody steamroller need breeding he countered you flattened her to emphasize his point he slammed a palm down on the table and ground it in yeah her smile widened in reminiscent pleasure i did didnt i she sipped her dry cool wine the match had been longer and more demanding than her first with kingston but her body had rebelled a bit less afterward asher considered it a double victory tia conway will go for your jugular he said pleasantly then called to his countrywoman at a nearby table hey tia you gonna beat this nasty american a dark compact woman with striking black eyes glanced over the two women measured each other slowly before tia lifted her glass in salute asher responded in kind before the group fell back to its individual conversations with the music at high volume they shouted to be heard but words carried only a foot a nice woman michael began off the court on it shes a devil off she grows petunias and rosemary her husband sells swimming pools madge chuckled you make that sound like a misdemeanor i bought one he said ruefully then looked back at asher she was listening with half an ear to the differing opinions on either side of her of a match by two players still if i played mixed doubles id want face for a partner asher acknowledged this with a curious lift of a brow tia plays like a demon but you have better court sense and he added as he downed more wine better legs for this madge punched him in the shoulder what about me you have perhaps the best court sense of any female worldclass player michael decided slowly but he continued as madge accepted her due with a regal nod you have legs like a shotputter a roar of laughter rose up over madges indignation asher leaned back in her chair enjoying the loosening freedom of mirth as madge challenged michael to show his own and be judged at that moment ashers eyes locked with tys her laughter died unnoticed by her companions hed come in late and alone his hair was unruly as though he had ridden in a fast car with the top down even completely relaxed dressed in jeans his hands in his pockets some aura of excitement swirled around him in the dim light his face was shadowed all hollows and planes with his eyes dark and knowing no woman could be immune to him a former lover was helpless not to remember what magic his mouth could perform asher sat still as a stone marble pale and elegant in the rowdy smokecurtained bar she couldnt forget any more than she could stop wanting all she could do was refuse as she had three years before without taking his eyes from hers ty crossed the room skirted crowded tables he had asher by the arm drawing her to her feet before the rest of the group had greeted him well dance it was a command formed in the most casual tones as on court ashers decision had to be made in a tenth of a second to refuse would have incited speculative gossip to agree meant she had her own demons to deal with id love to she said coolly and went with him the band played a slow ballad at earsplitting volume the vocalist was flat and tried to make up for it by being loud someone knocked a glass off a table with a splintering crash there was a pungent scent of spilled wine a bricklayer argued with a mexican tennis champion on the proper way to handle a topspin lob someone was smoking a pipe filled with richly sweet cherry tobacco the floorboards were slightly warped ty gathered her into his arms as though she had never been away the last time we were here he murmured in her ear we sat at that corner table and drank a bottle of valpolicella i remember you wore the same perfume youre wearing now his lips grazed her temple as he drew her closer asher felt the bones in her legs liquefy the muscles in her thighs loosen like sunwarmed petals her heartbeat was a light uncertain flutter against his do you remember what we did afterward we walked the two hoarsely spoken words seemed to shiver along his skin it was impossible to keep his mouth from seeking small tastes of her until sunrise his breath feathered intimately at her ear the city was all rose and gold and i wanted you so badly i nearly exploded you wouldnt let me love you then i dont want to go back asher tried to push away but his arms kept her pressed tight against him it seemed every line of his body knew every curve of hers why because you might remember how good we were together ty stop it she jerked her head back a mistake as his lips cruised lazily over hers well be together again asher he spoke quietly the words seemed to sear into the tender flesh of her lips even if its only once for old times sake its over ty the claim was a whisper the whisper unsteady is it his eyes darkened as he pressed her against him almost painfully remember asher i know you inside out did your husband ever find out who you really are did he know how to make you laugh how he added in a low murmur to make you moan she stiffened the music whirled around them fast now with an insistent bass beat ty held her firmly against him barely swaying at all i wont discuss my marriage with you i damn well dont want to know about your marriage he said the word as if it were an obscenity as his fingers dug into the small of her back fury was taking over though hed sworn he wouldnt let it he could still get to her yes yes that was a fact he knew but no more than she could still get to him why did you come back he demanded why the hell did you come back to play tennis her fingers tightened on his shoulder to win anger was growing in her as well it appeared be was the only man who could make her forget herself enough to relinquish control i have every right to be here every right to do what i was trained to do i dont owe you explanations you owe me a hell of a lot more it gave him a certain grim satisfaction to see the fury in her eyes he wanted to push wanted to see her anger youre going to pay for the three years you played lady of the manor you dont know anything about it her breath came short and fast her eyes were nearly cobalt i paid starbuck i paid more than you can imagine now ive finished do you understand to his surprise her voice broke on a sob quickly she shook her head and fought back tears ive finished paying for my mistakes what mistakes he demanded frustrated he took her by the shoulders what mistakes asher you she drew in her breath sharply as if stepping back from a steep edge oh god you turning she fought her way through the swarm of enthusiastic dancers even as she sprang out into the sultry night ty whirled her around let me go she struck out blindly but he grabbed her wrist youre not going to walk out on me again his voice was dangerously low not ever again did it hurt your pride ty emotion erupted from her blazing as it could only from one who constantly denied it did it hurt your ego that a woman could turn her back on you and choose someone else pain ripped through him and took over i never had your kind of pride asher he dragged her against him needing to prove he had some kind of power over her even if it was only physical the kind you wear so that no one can see youre human did you run because i knew you because in bed i could make you forget to be the perfect lady i left because i didnt want you completely unstrung she shouted pounding with her free hand i didnt want he cut her off with a furious kiss their tempers soared with vivid passion anger sizzled in two pairs of lips that clung because they were helpless to do otherwise there was never any choice when they were together it had been so almost from the first and the years had changed nothing she could resist him resist herself for only so long the outcome was inevitable suddenly greedy asher pressed against him here was the sound and the speed here was the storm here was home his hair was thick and soft between her questing fingers his body rockhard against the firmness of hers his scent was his offcourt fragrance something sharp and bracing that shed always liked the first taste was never enough to satisfy her so she probed deeper into his mouth tongue demanding teeth nipping in the way he himself had taught her a loud crash of brass from the band rattled the windows behind them asher heard only tys moan of quiet desperation between the shadows and the moonlight they clung passion building old needs merging with new her breath trembled into the night as he took a crazed journey of her face his hands slid up until his thumbs hooked gently under her chin it was a familiar habit one of his more disarming asher whispered his name half in plea half in acceptance before his mouth found hers again he drew her into him slowly inevitably while his fingers skimmed along her cheekbones the more tempestuous the kiss the more tender his touch asher fretted for the strong sure stroke of his hands on her body full circle she thought dizzily she had come full circle but if once before in rome she had been frightened when his kisses had drained and exhilarated her now she was terrified please ty asher turned her head until her brow rested on his shoulder please dont do this i didnt do it alone he muttered slowly she lifted her head i know it was the vulnerability in her eyes that kept him from dragging her back to him just as it had been her vulnerability all those years before that had prevented him taking her he had waited for her to come to him the same would hold true this time he realized cursing potently under his breath ty released her youve always known how to hold me off havent you asher knowing the danger had passed she let out an unsteady breath selfpreservation ty gave an unexpected laugh as his hands dove for his pockets it might have been easier if youd managed to get fat and ugly over the last three years i wanted to think you had a hint of a smile played on her mouth so his moods could change she thought just as quickly as ever should i apologize for not accommodating you probably wouldnt have made any difference if you had his eyes met hers again then roamed her face just looking at you it still takes my breath away his hands itched to touch he balled them into fists inside his pockets you havent even changed your hair this time the smile bloomed neither have you you still need a trim he grinned you were always conservative you were always unconventional he gave a low appreciative laugh one she hadnt heard in much too long youve mellowed he decided you used to say radical youve mellowed asher corrected him it used to be true with a shrug he glanced off into the night i used to be twenty age starbuck sensing a disturbance asher automatically sought to soothe it inevitably he brought his eyes back to hers its a young game ready for your rocking chair asher laughed forgetting caution as she reached up to touch his cheek though she snatched her hand away instantly his eyes had darkened i she searched for a way to ease the fresh tension you didnt seem to have any problem smashing bigelow in the semifinals hes what twentyfour it went to seven sets his hand came out of his pocket casually he ran the back of it up her throat you like it best that way her felt her swallow quickly nervously though her eyes remained level come back with me asher he murmured come with me now it cost him to ask but only he was aware of how much i cant wont he countered from down the street came a highpitched stream of italian followed by a bellow of laughter inside the club the band murdered a popular american tune she could smell the heatsoaked fragrance of the windowbox geraniums above their heads and she could remember remember too well the sweetness that could be hers if she crossed the line and the pain ty asher hesitated then reached up to grasp the hand that lingered at her throat a truce please for our mutual benefit she added when his fingers interlaced possessively with hers with us both going into the finals we dont need this kind of tension right now save it for later he brought her reluctant hand to his lips watching her over it then we pick this up in paris i didnt mean we deal now or later face but we deal he grinned again tasting challenge tasting victory take it or leave it youre just as infuriating as ever yeah the grin only widened thats what keeps me number one on an exasperated laugh asher let her hand relax in his truce starbuck he let his thumb glide back and forth over her knuckles agreed on one condition sensing her withdrawal he continued one question asher answer one question she tried to wrest her hand away and failed what question she demanded impatiently were you happy she became very still as quick flashes of the past raced through her head you have no right i have every right he interrupted im going to know that asher the truth she stared at him wanting to pit her will against his abruptly she found she had no energy for it no she said wearily no he should have felt triumph and instead felt misery releasing her hand he stared out at the street ill get you a cab no no ill walk i want to walk ty watched her move into the flood of a streetlight and back into the dark then she was a shadow disappearing the streets were far from empty traffic whizzed by at the pace that seemed the pride of european cities small fast cars and daredevil taxis people scattered the sidewalks rushing toward some oasis of nightlife still ty thought he could hear the echo of his own footsteps perhaps it was because so many feet had walked the roman streets for so many centuries ty didnt care much for history or tradition tennis history perhaps gonzales gibson perry these names meant more to him than caesar cicero or caligula he rarely thought of his own past much less of antiquity ty was a man who focused on the present until asher had come back into his life he had thought little about tomorrow in his youth he had concentrated fiercely on the future and what he would do if now that he had done it ty had come to savor each day at a time still the future was closing in on him and the past was never far behind at ten he had been a hustler skinny and streetwise he had talked his way out of trouble when it was possible and slugged his way out when it wasnt growing up in the tough south side of chicago ty had been introduced to the seamier side of life early hed tasted his first beer when he should have been studying rudimentary math what had saved him from succumbing to the streets was his dislike and distrust of organized groups gangs had held no appeal for ty he had no desire to lead or to follow still he might have chosen a less honorable road had it not been for his unquestioning love for his family his mother a quiet determined woman who worked nights cleaning office buildings was precious to him his sister four years his junior was his pride and selfassumed responsibility there was no father and even the memory of him had faded before ty reached midchildhood always he had considered himself the head of the family with all the duties and rights that it entailed no one corrected him it was for his family that he studied and kept on the right side of the law though he brushed the line occasionally it was for them that he promised himself when he was still too young to realize the full extent of his vow to succeed one day he would move them out buy them a house bring his mother up off her knees the picture of how hadnt been clear only the final result the answer had been a ball and racket ada starbuck had given her son a cheap nylonstringed racket for his tenth birthday the gift had been an impulse she had been determined to give the boy something other than the necessary socks and underwear the racket such as it was had been a gesture of hope she could see too many of her neighbors children fall into packs ty she knew was different a loner with the racket he could entertain himself a baseball or football required someone to catch or pass now ty could use a concrete wall as his partner and so he did at first for lack of something better to do in the alley between apartment buildings he would smash the ball against a wall scrawled with spray paint didi loves frank and other less romantic statements littered his playing field he enjoyed setting his own rhythm enjoyed the steady thud thump smash he could make when he became bored with the wall he began haunting the neighborhood playground courts there he could watch teenagers or middleaged weekenders scramble around the courts he hustled pennies retrieving balls deciding he could do better than the people he watched ty badgered an older boy into a game his first experience on a court was a revelation a human forced you to run sent balls over your head or lined them at you with a speed a stationary wall couldnt match though he lost handily ty had discovered the challenge of competition and the thirst to win he continued to haunt the courts paying more attention to details he began to select the players who took the game seriously possessing quite a bit of charm even at that age ty talked himself into more games if someone took the time to teach he listened and adjusted the advice to suit his own style and he was developing a style it was rough and untutored with the flash the sportwriters would later rave about just a spark his serve was a far cry from a grown starbucks but it was strong and uncannily accurate he was still awkward as growing boys are but his speed was excellent more than anything else his fierce desire to win had his game progressing when the cheap racket simply disintegrated under constant use ada raided the household budget and bought ty another of the hundreds of rackets he had used in his career some costing more than his mother had made in a week ty had never forgotten that first one he had kept it initially from childhood sentiment then as a symbol he carved out a name for himself in the neighborhood by the time he was thirteen it was a rare thing for anyone child or adult to beat ty starbuck on the courts he knew his game he had read everything he could get his hands on tennis as a sport its history its great players when his contemporaries were immersed in the progress of the white sox or the cubs ty watched the wimbledon matches on the flickering black and white tv in his apartment he had already made up his mind to be there one day and to win again it was ada who helped the hand of fate one of the offices she cleaned belonged to martin derick a lawyer and tennis enthusiast who patronized a local country club he was an offhandedly friendly man whose late hours brought him in contact with the woman who scrubbed the hall outside his door he called her mrs starbuck because her dignity demanded it and would exchange a word of greeting on his way in or out ada was careful to mention her son and his tennis abilities often enough to intrigue and not often enough to bore ty had come by his shrewdness naturally when martin casually mentioned he would be interested in seeing the boy play ada told him there was an informal tournament set for that saturday then she hurriedly arranged one whether curiosity or interest prompted martin to drive to the battered south side court the results were exactly as ada hoped tys style was still rough but it was aggressive his temper added to the spark and his speed was phenomenal at the end of a set martin was leaning against the chainlink fence at the end of the match he was openly cheering two hours on the manicured courts of his club had never brought him quite this degree of excitement ideas humming in his brain he walked over to the sweaty gangly teenager you want to play tennis kid ty spun the racket as he eyed the lawyers pricey suit you aint dressed for it he gave the smooth leather shoes a mild sneer martin caught the insolent grin but focused on the intensity of the boys eyes some instinct told him they were champions eyes the ideas solidified into a goal you want to play for pay ty kept spinning the racket wary of a hustle but the question had his pulse leaping yeah so this time martin smiled at the deliberate rudeness he was going to like this kid god knew why so you need lessons and a decent court he glanced at tys worn racket and equipment what kind of power can you get out of plastic strings defensive ty tossed up a ball and smashed it into the opposing service court not bad martin decided mildly youd do better with sheep gut tell me something i dont know martin drew out a pack of cigarettes and offered one to ty he refused with a shake of his head taking his time martin lit one then took a long drag those thingsll mess up your lungs ty stated idly tell me something i dont know the lawyer countered think you can play on grass ty answered with a quick crude expletive then sliced another ball over the net pretty sure of yourself im going to play wimbledon ty told him matteroffactly and im going to win martin didnt smile but reached into his pocket he held out a discreet expensively printed business card call me monday he said simply and walked away ty had a patron the marriage wasnt made in heaven over the next seven years there were bitter arguments bursts of temper and dashes of love ty worked hard because he understood that work and discipline were the means to the end he remained in school and studied only because his mother and martin had a conspiracy against him unless he completed high school with decent grades the patronage would be removed as to the patronage itself ty accepted it only because his needs demanded it but he was never comfortable with it the lessons polished his craft good equipment tightened his game he played on manicured grass welltended clay and wood learning the idiosyncrasies of each surface every morning before school he practiced afternoons and weekends were dedicated to tennis summers he worked parttime in the pro shop at martins club then used the courts to hone his skill by the time he was sixteen the clubs tennis pro could beat him only if ty had an off day his temper was accepted it was a game of histrionics women found a certain appeal in his lawlessness ty learned of female pleasures young and molded his talent there as carefully as he did his game the only break in his routine came when he injured his hand coming to the defense of his sister ty considered the twoweek enforced vacation worth it as the boy jess had been struggling with had a broken nose he traveled to his first tournament unknown and unseeded in a lengthy gritty match heralded in the sports pages he found his first professional victory when he lost ty was rude argumentative and brooding when he won he was precisely the same the press tolerated him because he was young brilliant and colorful his rise from obscurity was appreciated in a world where champions were bred in the affluent select atmosphere of country clubs before his nineteenth birthday ty put a down payment on a threebedroom house in a chicago suburb he moved his family out when he was twenty he won his first wimbledon title the dream was realized but his intensity never slackened now walking along the dark streets of rome he thought of his roots asher made him think of them perhaps because hers were so markedly different there had been no back alleys or street gangs in her life her childhood had been sheltered privileged and rich with james wolfe as a father her introduction to tennis had come much earlier and much easier than tys at four she had a custommade racket and had hit balls on her fathers private courts her mother had hired maids to scrub floors not been hired out to scrub them at times ty wondered if it was that very difference that had attracted him to her then he would remember the way she felt in his arms backgrounds were blown to hell yet there was something about her reserve that had drawn him that and the passion he had sensed lay beneath the challenge yes ty admitted with a frown he was a man who couldnt resist a challenge something about the cool distant asher wolfe had stirred his blood even when she had been little more than a child hed waited for her to grow up and to thaw out he reminded himself ruefully turning a corner without direction ty found himself approaching one of romes many fountains the water twinkled with light gaiety while he watched wishing his blood were as cool god how he wanted her still the need grated against pride infuriating and arousing him he would have taken her back that night even knowing she had been another mans wife shared another mans bed it would have been less difficult to have thought about her with many lovers than with one husband that damn titled englishman whose arms she had run to straight from his own why the question pounded at him how many times in those first few months had he relived their last few days together looking for the key then hed layered over the hurt and the fury the wound had healed jaggedly then callused ty had gone on because he was a survivor hed survived poverty and the streets and the odds with an unsteady laugh he raked a hand through his thick mop of hair but had he really survived asher he knew he had taken more than one woman to bed because her hair was nearly the same shade her voice nearly the same tone nearly always nearly now when he had all but convinced himself that what he remembered was an illusion she was back and free again ty laughed her divorce meant nothing to him if she had still been legally tied to another man it would have made no difference he would still have taken her this time he determined hed call the shots he was out of patience he would have her again until he decided to walk away challenge strategy action it was a course he had followed for half his life taking out a coin he flipped it insolently into the rippling waters of a fountain as if daring luck to evade him it drifted down slowly until it nestled with a hundred other wishes his eyes skimmed the streets until he found the neon lights of a tiny bar he wanted a drink chapter four contents prev next asher had time to savor her title as italian womans champion on the flight between rome and paris after the match she had been too exhausted from nearly two hours of unrelenting competition to react she could remember madge hugging her the crowd cheering for her she could remember the glare of flashbulbs in her face and the barrage of questions she had forced herself to answer before she all but collapsed on the massage table then the celebrations had run together in a blur of color and sound interviews and champagne too many faces and handshakes and hugs too many reporters now as the plane leveled reaction set in shed done it for all of her professional career the italian clay had beaten her now now her comeback was viable she had proven herself every hour of strain every moment of physical pain during the last six months of training had been worth it at last asher could rid herself of all the lingering doubts that she had made the right decision though there had been no doubts about her choice to leave eric she mused feeling little emotion at the dissolution of her marriage a marriage asher remembered that had been no more than a polite play after the first two months if she had ever made a truly unforgivable mistake it had been in marrying lord eric wickerton all the wrong reasons asher reflected as she leaned back in her seat with her eyes closed even with her bitter thoughts of eric she could never remove the feeling of responsibility for taking the step that had legally bound them he had known she hadnt loved him it hadnt mattered to him she had known he wanted her to fit the title of lady she hadnt cared at the time the need to escape had been too overpowering asher had given eric what he had wanted a groomed attractive wife and hostess she had thought he would give her what she needed in return love and understanding the reality had been much much different and almost as painful as what she had sought to escape arguments were more difficult she had discovered when two people had no mutual ground and when one felt the other had sinned she wouldnt think of it wouldnt think of the time in her life that had brought such pain and disillusionment instead she would think of victory michael had been right in his assessment of tia on the court she was a small vibrant demon who played hard and never seemed to tire her skill was in picking holes in her opponents game then ruthlessly exploiting them on court she wore gold a thin chain around her neck swinging hoops at her ears and a thick clip to tame her raven hair her dress was pastel and frilled she played like an enraged tigress both women had run miles during the match taking it to a full five sets the last one had consisted of ten long volatile games with the lead shooting back and forth as quickly as the ball never had it been more true that the match wasnt over until it was over and when it was over both women had limped off the court sweaty aching and exhausted but asher had limped off with a title nothing else mattered looking back at it asher found herself pleased that the match had been hard won she wanted something the press would chatter about something they would remember for more than a day or two it was always news when an unseeded player won a world title even considering ashers record as it was her past only made her hotter copy she needed that now to help keep the momentum going with italy behind her paris was next the first leg of the grand slam she had won there before on clay the year she had been starbucks lady as she had with eric asher tried to block ty out of her mind characteristically he wasnt cooperative we pick this up in paris the words echoed softly in her head part threat part promise asher knew him too well to believe either was idle she would have to deal with him when the time came but she wasnt naive or innocent any longer life had taught her there werent any easy answers or fairytale endings shed lost too much to believe happyeverafter waited at the end of every love affair as she had once believed it had waited for her and ty they were no longer the prince and princess of the courts but older and asher fervently hoped wiser she was certain he would seek to soothe his ego by trying to win her again her body if not her heart remembering the verve and depth of his lovemaking asher knew it wouldnt be easy to resist him if she could have done so without risking her emotions asher would have given ty what he wanted for three colorless years she had endured without the passion he had brought to her life for three empty years she had wondered and wanted and denied but her emotions werent safe on a sigh asher allowed herself to feel she still cared not a woman to lie to herself asher admitted she loved ty had never once stopped loving him it had never been over for her and deep within she carried the memory of that love it brought guilt what if he had known she thought with the familiar stir of panic how could she have told him asher opened her eyes and stared blindly through the sunlight it was as harsh and unforgiving as the emotions that raged through her would he have believed would he have accepted before the questions were fully formed asher shook her head in denial he could never know that she had unwittingly married another man while she carried tys child or that through her own grief and despair she had lost that precious reminder of her love for him closing her eyes asher willed herself to sleep paris was much too close ty ty pausing in the act of zipping the cover on his racket ty turned pleasure shot into his eyes in a quick move he dropped his racket and grabbed the woman who had run to him holding her up he whirled her in three dizzying circles before he crushed her against him her laughter bounced off the air in breathless gasps youre breaking me she cried but hugged him tighter ty cut off her protest with a resounding kiss then held her at arms length she was a small woman nearly a foot shorter than he nicely rounded without being plump her graygreen eyes were sparkling her generous mouth curved in a dazzling smile she was a beauty he thought had always been a beauty love surrounded him he tousled her hair dark as his own but cut in a loose swinging style that brushed her shoulders jess what are you doing here grinning she gave his ear a sisterly tug being mauled by the worlds top tennis player ty slipped an arm around her shoulders only then noticing the man who stood back watching them mac keeping his arm around jess ty extended a hand ty how are you fine just fine mac accepted the handshake and careful greeting with light amusement he knew how ty felt about his little sister the little sister who was now twentyseven and the mother of his child when he had married jess over two years before mac had understood that there was a bond between brother and sister that would not be severed an only child he both respected and envied it two years of being inlaws had lessened tys caution with him but hadnt alleviated it of course mac mused ruefully it hadnt helped that he was fifteen years jesss senior or that he had moved her across the country to california where he headed a successful research and development firm and then he preferred chess to tennis hed never have gotten within ten yards of jessica starbuck if he hadnt been martin dericks nephew bless uncle martin mac thought with a glance at his lovely adored wife ty caught the look and relaxed his grip on his sister wheres pete he asked making the overture by addressing mac rather than his sister mac acknowledged the gesture with a smile with grandma theyre both pretty pleased with themselves jess gave the bubbling laugh that both men loved hardly more than a year old and he can move like lightning moms thrilled to chase him around for a few weeks she sends her love she told ty you know how she feels about long plane flights yeah he released his sister to retrieve his bag and racket i talked to her just last night she didnt say anything about your coming we wanted to surprise you smug jess hooked her hand into macs mac thought paris was the perfect place for a second honeymoon she sent her husband a brief but ultimate look their fingers tightened the trick was getting her away from pete for two weeks he gave ty a grin you were a bigger incentive than paris bending he kissed the top of his wifes head she dotes on pete no i dont jess disagreed then grinned well i wouldnt if pete werent such a smart baby mac began to unpack an old favored pipe shes ready to enroll him in harvard next year jess responded dryly so youre going in as top seed she continued giving her full attention to her brother was there some strain around his eyes she wondered then quickly discounted it martins proud enough to bust i was hoping he might make it out for the tournament ty glanced toward the empty stands funny i still have a habit of looking for him before a match he wanted to be here if there had been any way for him to postpone this trial but jess trailed off and smiled mac and i will have to represent the family ty slung the bag over his shoulder youll do fine where are you staying at the jesss words came to a stop as she spotted a slender blonde crossing an empty court a short distance away reaching up she brushed at her brow as if pushing aside an errant strand of hair asher she murmured ty twisted his head asher wasnt aware of them as chuck was keeping her involved in what appeared to be a long detailed description of a match yes ty said softly asher he kept his eyes on her watching the movements of her body beneath the loosely fitting jogging suit didnt you know she was here yes i jess broke off helplessly how could she explain the flurry of feelings that she experienced in seeing asher wolfe again the years were winked away in an instant jess could see the cool blue eyes hear the firmly controlled voice at the time thered been no doubt in her mind about right and wrong even the chain reaction that had begun on a hazy september afternoon had only served to cement jesss certainty now thered been a divorce and asher was back she felt her husbands warm palm against hers right and wrong werent so clearly defined any longer a bubble of nausea rose as she turned to her brother he was still watching asher had he loved her did he still what would he do if he ever learned of his sisters part in what had happened three years before jess found the questions trembling on her tongue and was afraid of the answers ty his eyes were dark and stormy a barometer of emotion something in them warned jess to keep her questions to herself surely there would be a better time to bring up the past she had both a sense of reprieve and a feeling of guilt beautiful isnt she he asked lightly where did you say you were staying and because hes eighteen and played like a rocket in the qualifying rounds theyre muttering about an upset chuck tossed a tennis ball idly squeezing it when it returned to his palm i wouldnt mind if he werent such a little twerp asher laughed and snatched the ball as chuck tossed it again and eighteen she added he gave a snort he wears designer underwear for gods sake his mother has them dry cleaned down boy asher warned goodnaturedly youll feel better once you wipe him out in the quarterfinals youth versus experience she added because she couldnt resist chuck twisted a lock of her hair around his finger and pulled you meet rayski he commented i guess we could call that two old pros asher winced your point she conceded so whats your strategy for this afternoon to beat the tar out of him chuck responded instantly then grinned as he flexed his racket arm but if he gets lucky ill leave it up to ty to smash him in the semis or the finals asher bounced the ball on the clay her fingers closed over it then released it again youre so sure ty will get to the finals money in the bank he claimed this is his year i swear ive never seen him play better pleasure for his friend with the light lacing of envy gave the statement more impact hes going to be piling up titles like dominoes asher said nothing not even nodding in agreement as chuck sought to prove his point by giving her a replay of tys qualifying match a breeze stirred sending blossoms drifting to the court at her feet it was early morning and the stade roland garros was still drowsily charming and quiet the thump of balls was hardy noticeable in a few hours the fourteen thousand seats around the single center court would be jammed with enthusiasts the noise would be human and emotional accented by the sounds of traffic and squealing brakes on the highway that separated the stadium from the bois de boulogne asher watched the breeze tickle a weeping willow as chuck continued his rundown in this first week of the games tennis would be played for perhaps eleven hours a day so that even the firstround losers used the courts enough to make the trip worthwhile it was considered by most pros the toughest championship to win like ty asher was after her second victory paris ty was there nowhere she could go that wasnt so firmly tied in with memories of him in paris theyd sat in the back of a darkened theater necking like teenagers while an ingmar bergman film had flickered on the screen unnoticed in paris he had doctored a strained muscle in her calf pampering and bullying so that she had won despite the pain in paris they had made love and made love and made love until they were both weak and exhausted in paris asher had still believed in happy endings fighting off memories asher glanced around the stadium her eyes locked with jesss separated by a hundred yards both women endured a jolt of shock and distress they stared unable to communicate unable to look away hey its jess chuck interrupted himself to make the announcement he waved then grabbed ashers hand to drag her with him lets go say hi panicked asher dug in her heels no i i have to meet her mind was devoid of excuses but she snatched her hand from chucks you go ahead ill see you later over chucks protest she dashed in the opposite direction breathless asher found herself in the jardin des plantes with its sweet mingling scents little plaques and poetry it seemed an odd setting for jangled nerves making an effort to calm herself she slowed her pace silly to run she told herself no she corrected herself stupid but she hadnt been prepared to see tys sister the one person who knew all the reasons to have confronted jess then when her mind was already so crowded with ty would have been disastrous steadying asher told herself she just needed a little time to prepare and it had been obvious jess had been just as stunned as she at the moment asher was too busy calming herself to wonder why she wouldnt couldnt think about the last time shed seen jessica starbuck that hot close indian summer afternoon it would be too easy to remember each word spoken in the careless disorder of the hotel room asher had shared with ty she would remember the hurt the frantic packing then her irrevocable decision to go to eric oh ty had been right she had run away but she hadnt escaped so little had changed in three years and so much her heart had remained constant with a sigh asher admitted it had been foolish to believe she could take back what she had given so long ago ty starbuck was her first lover and the only man she had ever loved a child had been conceived then lost before it could be born shed never forgiven herself for the accident that had taken that precious fragile life from her perhaps more than a lack of love and understanding it had been the loss of tys child that had destroyed any hope for her marriage and if the child had lived she asked herself wearily what then could she had kept it from him could she have remained the wife of one man while bearing the child of another asher shook her head no she would no longer dwell on possibilities shed lost ty his child and the support of her own father there could be no greater punishments to face she would make her own future the touch of a hand on her shoulder had her whirling around asher stared up at ty her mind a blank her emotions in turmoil a hush seemed to spread over the garden so she could hear the whisper of air over leaves and blossoms the scent that reached her was sweet and heady like a first kiss he said nothing nor did she until his hand slid down her arm to link with hers worried about the match almost afraid he would sense them asher struggled to push all thoughts of the past aside concerned she amended nearly managing a smile rayskis top seed youve beaten her before and shes beaten me it didnt occur to her to remove her hand from his or to mask her doubts slowly the tension seeped out of her through the link of hands ty felt it they had stood here before and the memory was sweet play her like you played conway he advised their styles are basically the same with a laugh asher ran her free hand through her hair thats supposed to be a comfort youre better than she is he said simply and earned an astonished stare smiling he brushed his fingers carelessly over her cheek more consistent he explained shes faster but youre stronger that gives you an advantage on clay even though it isnt your best surface at a loss asher managed a surprised well youve improved ty stated as they began to walk your backhand doesnt have the power it should have but it worked pretty well on conway asher interrupted testily could be better its perfect she disagreed rising to the bait before she caught his grin her lips curved before she could stop them you always knew how to get a rise out of me youre playing kilroy she went on ive never heard of him hes been around only two years surprised everyone in melbourne last season he slipped an arm around her shoulders in a gesture so familiar neither of them noticed whats that flower asher glanced down ladys slipper silly name cynic he shrugged i like roses thats because its the only flower you can identify without thinking she leaned her head on his shoulder i remember going in to take a bath one night and finding youd filled the tub with roses dozens of them the scent of her hair reminded him of much more by the time we got around to clearing them out it took over an hour her sigh was wistful it was wonderful you could always surprise me by doing something absurd a tub of ladys slippers is absurd he corrected a tub of roses is classy her laughter was quick and appreciative her head still rested on his shoulders we filled everything in the room that could pass for a vase including a bottle of ginger ale sometimes when i she cut herself off abruptly realizing she would say too much when you what ty demanded as he turned her to face him when she only shook her head he tightened his grip would you remember sometimes in the middle of the night would you wake up and hurt because you couldnt forget truth brought tension to the base of her neck in defense asher pressed her palms against his chest ty please i did he gave her a frustrated shake that knocked her head back oh god i did ive never stopped wanting you even hating you i wanted you do you know what its like to be awake at three oclock in the morning and need someone and know shes in another mans bed no no dont she was clinging to him her cheek pressed against his her eye tightly shut ty dont dont what he demanded as he drew her head back dont hate you dont want you hell i cant do anything else his eyes blazed into her dark with fury hot with passion she could feel the race of his heart compete with hers abandoning pride she pressed her lips to his at the instant of contact he stood still neither giving nor taking on a moan she drew him closer letting her lips have their way a shudder coursed through him an oath ripped out then he was responding demanding exciting why had he tried to resist nothing was clear to him as her lips raced crazily over his face wasnt this what he wanted to have her again to prove he could to purge his system of her once and for all motives dimmed in desire there was only asher the sweet taste of her her scent more heady more seductive than the garden of flowers he couldnt breathe and not fill himself on her so he surrendered to the persuading lips and soft body that had haunted his dreams dragging his lips from hers only a moment ty pulled her through the fragile branches of a willow the sun filtered through the curtain of leaves giving intermittent light in the cool dimness his mouth sought hers again and found it yielding the blood pounded in his veins he had to know if her body was the same unchanged during the years hed been denied her as his hand took her breast he groaned she was small and firm and familiar through the material of her jacket he felt the nipple harden in quick response impatient he tugged the zipper down then dove under her shirt until he found the smooth tender flesh that had always made him feel his hands were too rough yet she didnt draw away as his calluses met her she pressed against him her moan was not one of discomfort but of unmistakable pleasure trembling her fingers reached for his hair he could feel the urgency in them just as he could taste it on her heated lips he broke his kiss only to change angles then deepened it allowing his tongue to drink up all the dark flavors of her mouth against his palm her heart thudded wildly but only his fingers moved to arouse her slowly his other hand journeyed to her hip to mold the long slender bone he was lost somewhere between yesterday and today the heavy fragrance of flowers still wet with morning dew was more seductive than perfume half dreaming ty took his mouth to her throat he heard her sigh float off on the scented air was she dreaming too was the past overlapping this moment for her as well as for him the thoughts drifted into his mind then out again before they could be answered nothing mattered but that he was holding her again from far off came a ripple of laughter ty brought his mouth back to ashers a rapid smattering of french drifted to him ty drew her closer until their bodies seemed fused footsteps and a giggle like a dreamer he sensed the intrusion and swore against it for another moment he clung drawing on her lingering passion when he released her asher was breathless and swaying wordlessly he stared down at her with eyes nearly black with emotion her lips were parted swollen from his and he gave in to need and kissed her one long last time gently now slowly to store up every dram of sweetness this time she trembled her breath coming harsh and fast like a divers who breaks surface after a long submersion disoriented she gripped his arms how long had they been there she wondered it could have been seconds or days all she was sure of was that the longing had intensified almost beyond control her blood was racing in her veins her heart pounding desperately she was alive so alive and no longer certain which path she would take tonight ty murmured bringing her palm to his lips the vibration shot up her arm and into her core ty asher shook her head as she tried to draw her hand away his fingers tightened tonight he repeated i cant seeing the temper shoot into his eyes asher covered their joined hands with her free one ty im frightened the quiet admission killed his anger he let out a weary sigh damn you asher saying nothing she wrapped her arms around his waist pressing her cheek to his chest automatically ty reached to smooth her hair his eyes closed im sorry she whispered i was frightened of you once before it seems to be happening again and i love you she told him silently as much as ever more she realized more because of the years of famine asher he held her away from him she felt the passion swirling around him i wont promise to wait for you to come to me this time i wont promise to be gentle and patient things arent the same she shook her head but in agreement no things arent the same it might be better much better for both of us if we just stayed away from each other ty laughed shortly we wont if we tried asher began i wont she let out a breath of exasperation youre pressuring me damn right before she could decide whether to laugh or to scream she was in his arms again do you think i dont feel pressured too he demanded with a sudden intensity that kept asher from answering every time i look at you i remember the way things were for us and drive myself crazy trying to figure out why you left me do you know what that does to me she gripped his upper arms with strong hands you have to understand i wont go back whatever happens to us now begins now no questions no whys she saw the anger boiling in his eyes but kept hers level i mean that ty i cant give you explanations i wont dig up the past you expect me to live with that i expect nothing she said quietly the tone caused him to look deeper for the answers she refused to give and ive agreed to nothing not yet you ask for too much he bit off as he released her too damn much she wanted to go to him go back to his arms and beg him to forget the past perhaps it was possible to live for the moment if one wanted to badly enough it might have been pride that stopped her or the deeply ingrained survival instinct she had developed since that longago september afternoon when she had fled from him and the prospect of pain asher laced her fingers together and stared down at them yes i know im sorry ty well only hurt each other tense and tormented he turned back ive never wanted to hurt you asher not even when i thought i did the ache spread so quickly she almost gasped from it isnt that what jess had said that day hed never want to hurt you never want to hurt you asher could hear the words echoing inside her head neither of us wanted to she murmured both of us did isnt it foolish to do it again look at me the command was quiet and firm bracing herself asher obeyed his eyes were locked on hers those dark penetrating eyes that conveyed such raw feeling gently he touched her cheek without hesitation her hand rose to cover his now he whispered ask me again a long shuddering breath escaped oh ty i was so sure i could prevent this so sure i could resist you this time and now now im not sure of anything she shook her head before he could speak again dont ask now give us both some time he started to protest then managed to restrain it hed waited three years a bit longer wouldnt matter some time he agreed lowering his hand but as she started to relax he took her wrist the grip was neither gentle nor patient the next time asher i wont ask she nodded accepting then we understand each other his smile was a trifle grim that we do ill walk you back he drew her through the curtain of leaves chapter five contents prev next fifth set seventh game at the baseline ty crouched ready to spring for michaels serve the air was heavy the sky thick with rainthreatening clouds so that the light was dreary ty didnt notice he didnt notice the stadium full of people some dangling through the railing some hanging from the scoreboard he didnt notice the shouts and whistles that were either for or against him tennis was a game of the individual that was what had drawn him to it there was no one to blame for a loss no one to praise for a win but yourself it was a game of motion and emotion both of which he excelled in he had looked forward to meeting michael in the semis the australian played a hot passionate game full of dramatic gestures furious mutters and pizzazz there were perhaps five competitors ty fully respected michael being one of them wanting to win was only a step below wanting a challenge a fight hed grown up scrapping now the racket was merely an extension of his arm the match was a bout the bout was one on one it had never would never be only a game the australian was a set up with his momentum still flowing tys only thought at the moment was to break his serve and even the match thus far he had spotted no weaknesses in his opponents game like a boxer he watched for the opening he heard the sound of the ball hitting the sweet spot of the racket before it rocketed toward him it landed deep in the corner of the service court beautifully placed tys mind and body moved as one as he sprang for the return defense offense strategy all had to be formulated in a fraction of a second strength had to be balanced with form both men sprinted over the court for the rally faces glowing with concentration and sweat the roar of the crowd rose to meet the distant thunder thus far the ratio had been nearly ten to one in favor of ground strokes ty decided to alter the pace and go with power using a vicious lefttoright slice he shook michaels balance ty blasted away at the attempted passing shot barely shortening his backswing michael couldnt reach the backhand volley let alone return it lovefifteen shaking the damp hair back from his face ty returned to the baseline a woman in the crowd called out what could have been a congratulations or a proposition tys french wasnt strong enough to decipher the phrase michaels serve sent up a puff of smoke before his return was over the net ty was at midcourt and waiting a testing ground stroke a sharp return a tricky topspin a slice michaels decision to try to lob over ty was a mistake the smoking smash careened off the court and into the grandstands lovethirty michael walked a complete circle cursing himself before he took his position again casting off impatience ty waited crouched swaying side to side unblinking he was ready both players exploited angles and depths with ground strokes there was a long patient rally as each watched for the chance to smash a winner it might have been pure showmanship if it hadnt been for the sounds of exertion coming from the two players a upi photographer had his motor drive humming as he recorded the game he framed ty arms extended for balance legs spread for the stretch face fierce it crossed his mind as he continued to snap that he wouldnt want to face that american on any playing field gracefully with an elegance belied by his expression ty executed a backhand with a touch of underspin michaels return thudded against the net loveforty angry and shaken michael punched his first serve into the net having no choice at game point he placed his next serve carefully ty went straight for the volley and took the net the exchange was fast and furious the players moving on instinct the crowd screaming in a mixture of languages tys wrist was locked the ball whipped from racket to racket at terrifying speed there were bare seconds between contact making both men anticipate flight rather than see it changing tactics in the wink of an instant ty brought the racket face under at the moment of impact with a flick of a wrist he dropped a dump shot over the net risky experts would say gutsy fans would claim ty would ignore both game and set oh mac jess leaned back and expelled a long breath id nearly forgotten what it was like to watch ty play you watched him just a few weeks ago he pointed out using a damp handkerchief to wipe his neck the wish for his airconditioned office flitted only briefly into his mind on television jess returned thats different being here cant you feel it i thought it was the humidity laughing jess shook her head always down to earth mac thats why i love you her smile seemed to open just for him it could still make his blood sing then i intend to stay there he murmured kissing her knuckles feeling her hand tense he looked up puzzled her eyes were aimed over his shoulder curious he turned spotting a few tennis faces he recognized among them was asher wolfe it was on her that his wifes gaze was locked thats the former lady wickerton isnt it he asked casually shes stunning yes jess tore her eyes away but the tension in her fingers remained yes she is she won her match this morning well have an american going into the womens finals jess said nothing as mac stuffed the handkerchief back into his pocket she was away from the game for a while wasnt she yes intrigued by his wifes flat answer mac probed didnt she and ty have something going a few years back it was nothing with a nervous swallow jess prayed she spoke the truth just a passing thing shes not tys type ashers very cool much more suited to wickerton than to ty he was attracted to that for a while thats all she moistened her lips and it was obvious she wasnt serious about him otherwise shed never have married wickerton so quickly she was making ty unhappy very unhappy i see mac murmured after a moment jess had spoken too quickly and too defensively studying his wifes profile he wondered i suppose tys too involved in his career to be serious about a woman yes the look jess gave him was almost pleading yes hed never have let her go if hed been in love with her tys too possessive and proud he reminded her quietly i dont think hed run after any woman no matter how he felt about her feeling her stomach roll jess said nothing she turned to watch her brother take the position for his first serve instead of the hazy afternoon she saw a brilliant morning instead of the clay of roland garros she saw the newly empty grass courts of forest hills ty was leaning over the rail staring out at center court she had a fanciful thought that he looked like the captain of a ship with his eyes on the open endless sea in her world she loved no one more than him could conceive of loving no one more he was brother and father and hero hed provided her with a home clothes and an education asking nothing in return as a result she would have given him anything crossing to him she slipped her arm around him nestling her head in the crook of his shoulder thinking about this afternoon she murmured he was slated to face chuck prince in the finals of the us open hmm distracted ty shrugged no not really it must feel odd to compete against your closest friend you must forget youre friends for a couple hours ty returned he was brooding she sensed it and unhappy there was no one including her mother jess felt more loyalty to her grip around him tightened ty what is it just restless have you fought with asher absently he tousled her hair no i havent fought with asher he lapsed into silence for so long that jess began to suspect he wasnt telling the entire truth she was already worried about him and asher the relationship had lasted longer than was habitual for ty jess saw ashers reserve as coldness her independence as indifference she didnt hang on ty as other women did she didnt listen raptly to every word he spoke she didnt adore him do you ever think back jess he asked suddenly think back to when we were kids his eyes skimmed over the manicured courts but didnt see them that crummy apartment with the paper walls the demarcos next door screaming at each other in the middle of the night the stairwell always smelled of old garbage and stale sweat the tone of his voice disturbed her seeking comfort as much as to comfort she turned her face into his chest not often i guess i dont remember it as well as you i hadnt turned fifteen when you got us out i wonder sometimes if you can ever escape that if you can ever really turn your back on it his eyes were focused on something jess couldnt see she strained to share the vision old garbage and stale sweat he repeated quietly i cant forget that i asked asher once what smell she remembered most from her childhood she said the wisteria that hung over her bedroom window ty i dont understand he swore softly neither do i you left all that behind she began i left it he corrected her that doesnt mean i left it behind we were having dinner last night wickerton stopped by the table and started a conversation about french impressionists after five minutes i didnt know what the hell they were talking about jess bristled she knew because ty had sent her to college she knew because he had provided the opportunity you should have told him to get lost with a laugh ty kissed her cheek that was my first thought abruptly he sobered then i watched them they understand each other speak the same language it made me realize there are some fences you just cant climb you could if you wanted to maybe i dont he let out a long breath i dont really give a damn about french impressionists i dont give a damn about the mutual friends they have that are distant cousins of the queen of england or who won at ascot last month storm warnings were in his eyes but he shrugged even if i did i wouldnt fit into that kind of life because id always remember the garbage and sweat asher has no business encouraging that man jess stated heatedly hes been following her around since paris ty gave a grim laugh she doesnt encourage or discourage drawing room conversation he murmured ingrained manners shes different from us jess ive known that all along if shed tell him to get lost she couldnt tell anyone to get lost any more than she could sprout wings and fly shes cold shes different ty returned immediately but without heart he cupped his sisters chin in his hand you and me were the same everythings up front if we want to shout we shout if we want to throw something we throw it some people cant then theyre stupid this time his laugh was warm and genuine i love you jess throwing her arms around him she hugged him fiercely i cant bear to see you unhappy why do you let her do this to you frowning ty stroked her hair ive been trying to figure that out maybe maybe i just need a shove in the right direction jess held him tighter searching her mind for the answer seventh set tenth game the crowd was as vocal as enthusiastic and as hungry as it had been an hour before leaning forward in his seat his eyes glued to the ball chuck sat between asher and madge youve got something riding on this one dont you cowboy madge commented dryly though her own heart was pumping chuck would face the winner in the finals its the best match ive seen in two years his own face was damp his own muscles tense the ball traveled at such speeds it was often only a white blur asher spoke to neither of them her objectivity had been long since destroyed ty enthralled her both men possessed the raw athletic ability competitors admired and envied both were draining the others resources without mercy but it was ty always ty who ripped the emotion from her she could admire michael admit his brilliance but he didnt cause that slow churning ache in her stomach had she not once been tys lover had she not even known him would she still be so drawn controlled rage how was it a woman raised in such an ordered sheltered existence would be pulled irresistibly to a man with such turbulent passion opposites attract she wondered no that was much too simple sitting in the crowded stadium asher felt the thrill of desire as clearly as though she had been naked in his arms she felt no shame it was natural she felt no fear it was inevitable years made up of long unending days vanished what a waste of time she thought suddenly no a loss she corrected herself a loss of time nothings ever wasted tonight the decision came to her as effortlessly as it had the first time tonight they would be together and if it was only once if once was all he wanted it would have to be enough the long wait was over she laughed out loud in relief and joy chuck sent her an odd look hes going to win asher said on a second laugh leaning on the rail she rested her chin on her folded hands oh yes hes going to win there was a dull ache in his racket arm that ty ignored the muscles in his legs promised to cramp the moment he stopped moving he wouldnt give in to them any more than he would give in to the man across the net one thing hadnt changed in twenty years he still hated to lose a point away from the match he played no less tigerishly than he had in the first game the rallies had been long and punishing the ball whistled sweat dripped for the last twenty minutes ty had forsaken artistry for cunning it was working power for power they were in a dead heat so that ty chose to outmaneuver the australian he worked him over the court pacing him some might say stalking him the game went to deuce three times while the crowd grew frantic an ace gave him advantage a screeching bullet that brought ty the final impetus he needed then ty played him hotbloodedly the men drove from side to side their faces masks of effort and fury the shot came that hed been waiting for michaels awesome backhand drove crosscourt to his southpaw forehand the ball came to ty at waist level michael didnt even have to see the return to know it was over game set and match the heat hit him then and the fatigue it took an effort not to stagger simply to have fallen to his knees would have been a relief he walked to the net michael took his hand then draped his free arm around tys shoulder damn you starbuck he managed breathlessly you nearly killed me ty laughed using his opponent for balance a moment you too i need a bloody drink michael straightened giving ty a glazed grin lets go get drunk youre on turning they separated victor and vanquished to face the press the showers and the massage tables ty grabbed the towel someone handed him nodding at the questions and congratulations being hurled at him behind the cloth he could hear the click and whirl of cameras he was too weary to curse them someone was gathering his rackets he could hear the clatter of wood on wood the strength that had flowed freely through him only moments before drained exhausted he let the drenched towel fall his eyes met ashers so blue he thought her eyes are so blue and cool and deep he could drown in them blissfully the unbearable heat vanished as though someone had opened a window to a fresh spring breeze congratulations when she smiled his fatigue slid away strangely it wasnt desire that replaced it but comfort sweet simple comfort thanks he took the racket bag from her their hands barely brushed i suppose the press is waiting for you inside the short retort ty made was both agreement and opinion on a low laugh she stepped closer can i buy you dinner the quirk of his brow was the only indication of surprise sure ill meet you at seven in the lobby of the hotel all right starbuck what do you feel was the turning point of the match what strategy will you use playing prince in the finals ty didnt answer the reporters didnt even hear them as he watched asher weave her way through the crowd from overhead jess watched with a small fluttering sensation of deja vu ty got under the stream of the shower fully dressed he let the cool water sluice over him while he stripped a reporter from world of sports leaned against a tiled wall scribbling notes and tossing questions naked with his clothes in a soggy heap at his feet ty answered always he handled the press naturally because he didnt give a damn what they printed he knew his mother kept a scrapbook but he never read the articles or interviews lathering the soap over his face with both hands he washed the sticky sweat away someone passed him a plastic jug of fruit juice with the water streaming over him he guzzled it down replacing lost fluid the weakness was seeping back and with it the pain he made his way to the massage table by instinct then collapsed onto it strong fingers began to work on him questions still hammered in his ear but now he ignored them ty simply closed his eyes and shut them out a line of pain ran up his calf as the muscles were kneaded he winced and held on knowing relief would follow for ten agonizing minutes he lay still while his body was rubbed and pounded he began to drift like a mothers memory of the pain of childbirth his memory of the pain began to dim he could remember winning and he could remember dark blue eyes with those two visions tangling in his mind he slept the floor of the lobby was marble white marble veined with pink madge had commented that it would be the devil to keep clean her husband had dryly commented that she wouldnt know one end of the mop from the other asher sat listening to their comfortable banter while she told herself she wasnt nervous it was sixfifty shed dressed carefully choosing a simple crepe de chine as pale as the inside of a peach her hair fluffed back from her face exposing the tiny pearl and coral drops at her ears her ringless fingers were interlaced where are you eating asher brought her attention back to madge a little place on the left bank there was an enthusiastic violinist she remembered ty had once passed him twenty american dollars and cheerfully told him to get lost at the bellow of thunder madge glanced toward the lobby doors youre going to play hell getting a cab tonight she leaned back have you seen ty since the match no chuck said both he and michael were sleeping on the tables like babies a chuckle escaped as she crossed strong short legs some industrious stringer for a french paper got a couple of classic shots athletes in repose her husband mused it kind of blows the toughguy image asher smiled thinking how young and vulnerable ty looked in sleep when the lids closed over those dramatic eyes he reminded her of an exhausted little boy it was the only time the frenetic energy stilled something stirred in her if the child had lived hurriedly she censored the thought hey isnt that tys sister asher turned her head to see jess and mac crossing the lobby yes their eyes met leaving no choice gripping her husbands hand jess walked across the white marble hello asher jess a quick moistening of lips betrayed nerves i dont think you know my husband mackenzie derick lady wickerton asher wolfe she replied smoothly taking macs hand are you related to martin my uncle mac informed her do you know him the smile brought warmth to her eyes very well she made the rest of the introductions with a natural poise mac approved of cool yes he mused remembering his wifes description but with an underlying vibrancy perhaps a man would discern more quickly than another woman he began to wonder if jesss opinion of tys feelings was accurate are you a tennis fan mr derick asher asked him mac he supplied only by marriage and no i dont play much to uncle martins disgust asher laughed appreciating the humor in his eyes a strong man she thought instantly his own man he wouldnt take second place to ty in his wifes life martin should be satisfied having cultivated one champion her eyes drifted to jess who was sitting straight and tense beside madge is your mother well yes yes moms fine though she met the cool clear gaze her fingers began to pleat the material of her skirt shes at home with pete pete our son ashers throat constricted mac noticed with some surprise that her knuckles whitened briefly on the arm of her chair i didnt know youd had a baby ada must be thrilled to have a grandchild the pressure on her heart was unbearable her smile was casual how old is he she made herself ask fourteen months as the tension built in one woman it flowed out of the other jess was already reaching into her purse for her wallet i swear he never walked he started out running mom says hes like ty he has his coloring too she was offering a picture asher had no choice but to accept it there was some of his father in him the shape of the face but the starbuck genes were strong the babys hair was dark and thick like his mothers like tys the eyes were large and gray asher wondered if she could actually feel the air of perpetual motion around the child or if she imagined it another baby would have had dark hair and gray eyes hadnt she pictured the face countless times hes beautiful she heard herself say in a calm voice you must be very proud of him when she handed the snapshot back her hands were perfectly steady jess thinks he should wait until hes twelve before he runs for president asher smiled but this time mac didnt find the reflected warmth in her eyes has ty bought him a racket yet you know him very well mac observed yes she looked back at jess steadily tennis and his family come first always i hate to admit it madge put in with a sigh but i can remember a dozen years ago when this one was a skinny teenager chewing her fingernails at every one of tys matches now youre a mother jess grinned holding out her hands for inspection and i still bite my nails at tys matches it was asher who saw him first but then her senses were tuned for him ty stepped off the elevator dressed in slim black slacks and a smokegray shirt he wouldnt have chosen the shirt because it matched his eyes so perfectly asher knew he wore it because it would have been the first thing his hand had grabbed from the closet he wore clothes with the casual style of one who gave no thought to them and still looked marvelous a disciplined body and trained grace made it inevitable his hair had been combed but defied order he paused briefly even in stillness communicating motion ashers heartbeat was a dull quick thud oh theres ty jess sprang up hurrying across the lobby to meet him i didnt get to congratulate you you were absolutely wonderful though his arm slipped around her jess saw that his eyes had drifted over her head without turning she knew who they focused on asher didnt see nor did she speak well starbuck you earned your pay today madge commented the dean and i are going to the lido to hold michaels hand tell him i lost three pounds on the court today he spoke to her lightly enough but his eyes never left ashers i dont think thats going to make him feel a hell of a lot better she returned giving her husband a nudge as she rose well were off to fight for a taxi anyone going our way as a matter of fact mac began picking up the hint easily jess and i were on our way out too want a lift ty madges husband gave her an offended look as she ground her heel into his foot but he shut his mouth firmly when madge shot him a deadly glance even to a man who rarely comprehended subtleties it became obvious there were things being said without words the little group had simply ceased to exist for ty and asher after a hard look at the silent couple the dean straightened his glasses and grinned at his wife i guess not huh youre so quick babe madge began shepherding the rest toward the doors anyone know some french obscenities its the best way to get a cab in the rain asher rose slowly from behind her she could hear the ding of a bell on the desk and the whoosh of the storm as the doors were opened then quickly closed for a moment ty thought she looked like something that should be enclosed in glass not to be touched not to be soiled she reached out her hand when he took it it was warm flesh and blood in unspoken agreement they turned away from the doors and walked to the elevator chapter six contents prev next they didnt speak but then they didnt need to with one hand still holding hers ty pushed the button for his floor the elevator began its silent rise once the hand in his trembled lightly he found it unbearably exciting the numbers above their heads flashed ponderously until at last the car stopped when the doors slid open they stepped into the carpeted hall together asher heard the key jingle against loose change as ty reached into his pocket she heard the click of the lock before he released her hand the choice was still hers she stepped out of the light into the dimness of the room it smelled of him that was her first thought the air carried tys lingering fragrance something sharp something vital something she had never forgotten all at once her nerves began to jump the poise that had carried her this far fell away searching for something to say she wandered the room it was untidy with a shirt thrown here shoes tossed there she knew if she opened the closet she would find a neat stack of rackets the only semblance of order instead she moved to the window rain ran like tears down the glass its going to storm all night as if to accent her words lightning split the sky asher counted to five then heard the thunder answer hundreds of lights spread through the darkness the city was there crowded moving distant staring through the wet glass she waited for ty to speak silence the patter of rain on the window the distant hum of traffic another moan of thunder unable to bear it asher turned he was watching her the small bedside lamp threw both light and shadow into the room his stance was neither relaxed nor threatening and she understood he had given her a choice before she entered now he wouldnt let her go a bridge had been burned asher felt nothing but relief that the decision was already made but her fingers were numb as she reached to loosen the thin belt at her waist crossing to her ty laid his hands over hers stopping the movement asher stared up at him unsure as nervous as the first time without speaking he took her face in his hands to study her he wanted to remember her this way in shadowed light with the fury of a storm at her back her eyes were dark with traces of fear traces of desire in a gesture of surrender her arms had dropped to her sides but he didnt want surrender perhaps she had forgotten as he lowered his head ty watched her lids shut her lips part in anticipation gently he kissed her temple then the other then the delicate curve of an eyebrow without haste his eyes closed he reacquainted himself with her face through taste and touch her lips beckoned but he nibbled along the line of her jaw on the hollow of her cheek his thumb brushed her bottom lip as he whispered kisses over her face he remembered every curve her breath shuddered out as he kissed the corners of her mouth he brushed his over it retreating when asher sought more pressure there was only the fleeting promise of more with a moan she gripped his forearms hed waited for the strength hed waited for the demands again he touched his lips to hers allowing his tongue a brief taste now her arms wrapped possessively around him now passion exploded mouth against mouth lightning flashed illuminating them as one form in the ageless wonder of lovers undress me she whispered breathlessly hardly able to speak as her lips fused again and again with his i want you to undress me in answer he lowered the zipper slowly allowing his fingers to trail along her bare skin he found more silk something thin and fragile the dress slithered down her body to lie at her feet growing impatient asher worked her hands between them to deal with the buttons of his shirt while her mouth continued to cling to his she felt the hard muscle the line of ribs the mat of hair a moan wrenched from her out of deep desperate need the thighlength chemise was too much of a barrier longing for the intimacy of flesh against flesh asher reached to draw down the strap again ty stopped her dont rush he murmured then tore at her control with a deep lingering kiss the pressure was hard and demanding the lips soft and heated come to bed in a haze she let him lead her felt the mattress give under her weight then his anticipation shivered along her skin the light she whispered as he circled her throat with his hand tys eyes met hers i need to see you thunder exploded as his mouth crushed down on hers when she would have hurried he set the pace languorous sleepy enervating it seemed her lips alone would pleasure him enough for a lifetime she was so soft so moist far from pliant asher moved against him inviting insisting her urgency excited him but ty chose to savor over the silk his hands roamed to trace her shape from thigh to breast the peaks strained against the sheer material he took his mouth to her shoulder catching the narrow strap of the silk with his teeth inch by inch he lowered it until her flesh was exposed to him she was firm and creamywhite in contrast to the tan of her arms and shoulders so lovely he whispered while his fingertip brought down the second strap when she was naked to the waist his mouth ranged down slowly though with her hands in his hair she urged him down with lips parted ty sought the peak of her breast asher arched pressing him down she wanted him to be greedy wanted to feel the rough scrape of his tongue when she did she could no longer be still her body vibrated with the beat of a hundred tiny pulses desire raw and primitive tore through her with the power to obliterate all but one thought she was woman he was man seeking pleasure asher moved under him letting her hands roam he abandoned gentleness because she wanted none it had always driven him wild when her passion was unleashed she had no inhibitions no shame when the came together like this she was all fire and as dangerous as the lightning in the night sky ty wasnt even aware of his control slipping away hardpalmed hands run bruisingly over tender skin short manicured nails dug into strong shoulders his breathing was ragged when he tore the garment from her she gave him no time to view her nakedness her fingers were busy struggling to remove the last barrier of his clothing their frantic movements took them over the bed tangling in the sheets her skin was damp and trembling but her hands were so strong and so certain there could be no more waiting a pain stabbed into him as he entered her it was sharp then sweet he thought he heard her cry out as she had that first night when he had taken her innocence then she was wrapped around him legs arms her mouth fastened on his the storm crashed directly overhead they rose with it his hand lay lightly on her breast asher sighed had she ever known such pure contentment she wondered no not even when they had been together before then she hadnt known what it would be like to do without him she shuddered then moved closer cold ty drew her to him until her head rested on the curve of his shoulder a little wheres my chemise devoured she laughed flinging her arms around him as though she would never let go free she thought how wonderful to be free to love to laugh supporting herself on his chest she stared down into his face for once his eyes were calm a faint smile curved his lips beneath her his breathing was even and slow to match hers to match her mind repeated they had always been like two halves of the same whole oh god i missed you ty on those words she buried her face against his throat empty empty she thought it seemed like a lifetime of emptiness had been wiped away with an hour of fulfillment asher no no questions no questions wildly she rained kisses over his face just feel just be with me i need to laugh tonight the way we used to he stopped her hurried movements by taking her head in his hands there was a plea in her eyes and a light trace of desperation no he didnt want to see that now pushing away the questions that drummed in his head he smiled at her i thought you were going to buy me dinner relief washed over her before she grinned i have no idea what youre talking about you asked me for a date tossing her head back she arched an elegant brow i asked you youve been out in the heat too long starbuck dinner he repeated rolling her over until he loomed above her as far as i can tell youve already eaten a sixtydollar silk chemise are you still hungry for an answer he lowered his mouth to her neck and bit none too gently laughing she tried to twist away food he muttered i have to eat remembering a weakness she found the spot on his ribs and squeezed his body jerked giving her the opportunity to slither away she was giggling like a girl when he grabbed her and pulled her back how many people know the indomitable starbuck is ticklish she demanded when he pinned her arms over her head what would the press pay to find out about the same as theyd pay to find out elegant asher wolfe has a heartshaped birthmark on her very attractive bottom asher considered this a moment even she decided her smile slanted seductively do you really want to go out to eat desire fluttered lightly in the pit of his stomach as he looked down at her the light angled across her face accenting the smooth glowing skin and darkened eyes the thunder was a distant rumble now but he felt it vibrate in his head theres always room service he murmured tasting her lips he kept her arms pinned as he dropped light teasing kisses over her face nestling in the vulnerable curve of her neck he used his tongue to stir and arouse ty she moaned unable to struggle against the captivity make love to me his chuckle was low and he was pleased oh i am this time he whispered into her ear we wont hurry hours love his tongue darted to her ear making her squirm in agonized delight hours and hours then he shifted bringing her close to his side cradling her he felt her heart pounding against him when he reached for the phone asher glanced up puzzled food he reminded her she gave a weak laugh i should have remembered your stomach comes first his hand grazed over her breast not necessarily her nipple was already taut he flicked his thumb over it lazily ty with a kiss he silenced her champagne he said into the phone while driving asher mad with careless strokes and fondling dom perignon caviar he went on sending her a questioning look that she was powerless to answer beluga he gave her a light kiss running his hand down to the flat of her stomach she quivered turning into him legs tangled as he brushed his lips over her shoulder cold shrimp he bit her tender bottom lip mmm thatll do yes for two as he dropped the phone back on its cradle asher found his mouth in a desperate yearning kiss food excites you he mumbled against the hungry lips struggling not to take her instantly he ran his hand to her hip kneading warm flesh i want you her voice was low and throaty her hands questing i want you now shh slow patient his stroking aroused rather than subdued relax theres time i want to see you again he drew away from her really see you she was burning for him now she lay naked and vulnerable under his gaze as she watched his eyes darkened grew stormy her breathing quickened when she reached out he took her hand burying his lips in the palm youre more beautiful than ever he said huskily it shouldnt be possible ive looked at you so many times and have been afraid to touch no asher pulled him to her until they were heart to heart im never more alive than when you touch me with a sigh ty nestled down until his head rested between her breasts asher combed her fingers through his hair as contentment layered over desire today when i watched you playing michael i wanted you sitting there surrounded by thousands of people in the middle of the afternoon all i could think about was being with you like this she gave a gurgle of laughter wicked thoughts such wonderfully wicked thoughts so your invitation to dinner carried an ulterior motive in your weakened condition i knew youd be a pushover though i had thought id have to take you out and ply you with food and wine first and if id refused id have come up with something else grinning he lifted his head what asher shrugged i could have come up here and seduced you before youd gotten your strength back hmm i almost wish id said no too late i have you now i could get stubborn slowly she smiled i know your weaknesses she whispered running a fingertip up the nape of his neck his shudder was quick and uncontrollable leaning up she took his face in her hands lazily she rubbed her lips over his then deepened the touch into a kiss a long draining taste that left him weak her tongue glided over his then retreated asher on an oath he crushed her beneath him savaging her mouth with a need that had risen so quickly it left him dazed he didnt hear the discreet knock on the door nor did he understand her murmurs the door she managed ty its room service what the door laying his forehead on hers he struggled to recapture his control theyre awful damn quick he muttered he found he was trembling how could he have forgotten that she could make him tremble after letting out a long breath he rose asher pulled the sheets up to her chin and watched him cross to the closet a beautiful body she thought both proud and admiring long and lean with a network of muscle she looked her fill as he rummaged through his closet for a robe strong shoulders trim waist narrow hips and long legs an athletes body or a dancers he was made to compete he shrugged into the robe belting it carelessly grinning he turned to her ashers heart lodged in her throat ty youre so beautiful his eyes widened in astonishment torn between amusement and masculine discomfort he headed for the door good god he said making asher smother a giggle she brought her knees up to her chest as he signed the check at the door in some ways she mused he was a little boy to his way of thinking the word beautiful applied only to a woman or to an ace hed be more insulted than complimented having it applied to himself yet she saw him that way not only physically he was a man capable of lovely gestures a man unashamed of his deep love for his mother unafraid to show tenderness he had no cruelty in him though on the court he was unmerciful his temper was explosive but he was incapable of holding a grudge asher realized that it was his basic capacity for feeling that she had missed most of all and still he had never in all their closeness in all the months of intimacy told her that he loved her if he had once said the words she would never have left him where have you gone asher turned her head to see him standing beside a tray a bottle of champagne in his hands quickly she shook her head and smiled again nowhere she cocked her head at the bottle all that just for us he walked to the bed and sat on the edge did you want some too the cork came off with a resounding pop as she cuffed his shoulder with an easy stretch he rolled the tray toward them here hold the glasses without ceremony he poured champagne until it nearly ran over the rims ty itll spill on the bed better be careful then he advised as he set the bottle back in the ice he grinned as she sat crosslegged balancing two glasses in her hands the sheet was held in place over her breasts by arms pressed tightly to her sides she returned the grin with a glance of exasperation arent you going to take one oh i dont know hooking a finger under the sheet he nudged it downward exposing creamy flesh ty cut it out ill spill it better not we have to sleep here he urged the sheet a trifle lower frustrated asher looked from glass to glass wine swayed dangerously this is a dirty trick starbuck yeah i like it asher narrowed her eyes im going to pour both glasses into your lap terrible waste he decided kissing her its good stuff i always found it strange he began lazily kissing her face as he spoke that i was bred for beer and you were bred for champagne but you havent any head for it i have a perfectly good head for champagne chuckling he brushed his lips over her throat i remember one very memorable night when we shared a bottle three glasses make you crazy i like you crazy thats absurd the lift of brow challenged him without hesitation asher brought a glass to her lips losing the sheet as she drank it ty watched the linen pool into her lap before she drained the last drop thats one asher announced lifting the second glass ty plucked it from her fingers lets spread it out a little he advised amused he drank more conservatively then reached for the tray of caviar you like this stuff mmm suddenly hungry asher spread a generous amount on a toast point ty settled down to the bowl of cold shrimp and spicy sauce here its good though he allowed her to feed him a bite he wrinkled his nose overrated he stated this is better he popped a shrimp into ashers mouth s wonderful she agreed with a full mouth then chose another i didnt know i was so hungry ty filled her glass again could anyone else imagine her he wondered sitting naked in bed licking sauce from her finger did anyone else know how totally open she could be she was talking now in fits and starts as she ate replaying her match ty let her ramble pleased just to hear her voice to see her animation she was satisfied with her serve worried about her backhand volley publicly she chose her words with care and made certain there were few of them if a reporter could see her now ty mused hed wear a pencil down to the nub she was full of joy and doubt fear and selfcongratulation words tumbled out without discretion her face was animated her hands gestured by the time she had slowed down her second glass was empty perhaps she was completely happy because she wasnt even aware of the sensation she was simply at ease completely herself comfortably full she toyed with the last of the caviar are you worried about playing chuck in the finals ty bit into a shrimp why he was always good asher began frowning a bit but hes developed over the past few years grinning ty tilted more wine into her glass dont you think i can beat him she sent him a long considering look you were always good too thanks after setting the caviar on the tray he stretched lengthwise on the bed chuck plays a bit like my father did asher mused very clean very precise his talents polished rather than raw like mine yes that raw athletic ability is something every competitor envies my father used to say that you had more natural talent than any player hed seen in his career over the rim of her glass she smiled down at him yet he always wanted to smooth out your form then there were your antics on the court ty laughed kissing her knee through the sheet it used to drive him crazy i imagine hed be more pleased if he saw you play now and you ty countered how would he feel if he saw you play now asher shifted her eyes from his to stare into her glass he wont why as if to erase the question she lifted her hand ty please asher he said quietly grasping her fingers youre hurting if she could have held it back she would have but the words tumbled out i let him down he wont forgive me hes your father and he was my coach unable to comprehend ty shook his head what difference does that make all the difference the pain slipped out as if to numb it she swallowed more wine please not tonight i dont want anything to spoil tonight her fingers had tightened on his one by one ty kissed them until he felt the tension relax nothing could over their joined hands dark intense eyes met hers spontaneously her pulse began to race i never got you completely out of my mind he confessed too many things reminded me a phrase a song silence there were times alone at night i would have sworn i heard you breathing in the quiet beside me the words moved her hurt her ty those were yesterdays we can start now now he agreed but well have to deal with yesterday sooner or later though she opened her mouth to disagree she knew later then right now i dont want to think about anything but being with you he grinned brushing a stray curl from her cheek its difficult to argue with that dont get cocky she told him then tossed off the rest of her champagne that was three asher said haughtily and im not the least affected ty had no trouble recognizing the signs the flushed cheeks the glowing eyes and misty smile whatever she might say he knew the champagne was swimming in her head and when they loved again she would be soft and strong and passionate he found himself wanting to simply look at her for a few minutes more once they touched the fire would take them want another he offered sure wisely he filled her glass only halfway before he replaced the bottle i caught your interview today ty commented it was on while i was changing oh asher shifted to lie on her stomach propping herself on her elbows howd i do hard to say it was all in french she laughed adjusting her position so that she could take another sip id forgotten how about a translation he asked things like mademoiselle wolfe do you find any changes in your style after your temporary retirement and i said something like i feel ive tightened my serve she chuckled into her wine i didnt mention that my muscles beg for me to give them a break after two sets he asked how i felt about playing the young miss kingston in the finals and i refrained from punching him in the mouth that was diplomatic ty answered slipping the glass from her fingers im a hell of a diplomat asher agreed rolling over on her back she looked up at him he lounged just behind her so that she had to tilt her head at an odd angle to make eye contact you stole my glass yes i did after seeing it on the tray ty gave the wheeled table a slight shove did we finish dinner reaching up and back she locked her arms around his neck weve definitely finished dinner he allowed her to urge him down until his mouth hovered above hers got any suggestions about what we should do now she liked the strangeness of having his face upside down over hers playfully she nipped at his lip no do you got a deck of cards uhuh then i guess well have to make love she gave a rich low laugh before she kissed him again all night just to pass the time its something to do rainy nights are so boring eyes dancing she nodded mmm yes lets make the best of it her lips were curved in a smile as his met them but they parted eagerly she found it strangely seductive to have his tongue meet hers this way on a gurgle of laughter she closed her teeth gently capturing him in response he trailed his fingers over her breast until her moan freed him i get dizzy kissing you upside down asher murmured i like you dizzy leaning forward he trailed moist kisses over her throat the tip of his tongue picked up her flavor then lingered over it he could feel pulse beats both with his hand and his lips finding the curve of his neck vulnerable asher began to give him the same pleasure he was bringing her i want to touch you she complained i cant touch you this way but he continued to explore from where he was enjoying the freedom his hands had over her body the scent of the rich sauce still lingering in the air and the zing of champagne clung to two tongues as they joined the mattress groaned quietly as she shifted then she was on her knees pressed body to body in a quick move she had stripped the robe from him so he was as naked as she with a half laugh half sigh she ran her palms up his strong back entwined enchanted neither noticed that the rain had ceased inside the quiet room pleasure built strong thigh pressed against strong thigh hungry lips sought hungry lips their passion was equal their needs the same together they lay down soft sighs became moans before long gentle caresses became demanding both seemed desperate to touch and be touched to have their own weaknesses exploited with instinctive understanding they held back the final gift the inner fire built dampening their flesh but still they lingered over each other there was so much to make up for so much time to recapture though passion was flaring this thought hovered in the back of both their minds tonight was a fresh beginning they wanted all of it asher thought her lungs would burst the combination of wine and passion buzzed in her head a laugh smoky with desire floated from her as he gasped her name she wanted to tempt him torment him give to him his stomach was hard and flat with muscle yet the touch of her fingertip could make it quiver asher had forgotten this sense of power and exulted in it her small hands could make him weak her shapely serious mouth could drive him wild the power shifted so abruptly she was helpless he found her greatest vulnerability and used his tongue to destroy her last vestige of control half wild she called for him struggling to have more desperate to have all arching she pressed him closer cresting on a wave of delight that had no chance to recede she thrashed as if in protest yet arched again in invitation as she built toward a higher peak ty slid up her body greedy she drew him inside of her hearing his gasp for breath before there was only feeling later they still clung together damp spent fulfilled he shifted only to turn out the light in the midnight darkness they molded to each other drifting toward sleep youll move in with me the murmur was a statement rather than a question asher opened her eyes before she answered she could just see the outline of his face yes if you want me i never stopped wanting you without the light he didnt see the flicker of doubt in her eyes before he slept chapter seven contents prev next she was afraid of london lady wickerton had lived there hostessing parties in the elegant threestory house in grosvenor square attending the ballet at the royal opera house the theater in drury lane shopping on the west end lady wickerton had played bridge with members of parliament and had sipped tea at buckingham palace lady wickerton had been a quiet dutiful wife a woman of intelligence breeding and control she had nearly suffocated in london perhaps if ty hadnt come between jim wolfes daughter and eric wickertons wife asher would have accepted her role with ease shed wanted to had struggled to too much passion simmered inside her it had been there all of her life but the months with ty had liberated it controlling something dormant was entirely different from harnessing something that pulsed with life there had not even been her profession as an outlet for the energy that drove her coming back to london was the most difficult step yet there she would not only have to face memories of ty but the ghost of a woman she had pretended to be it was all so familiar westminster abbey trafalgar square the smells the voices even the anticipation of wimbledon couldnt block them out there would be faces here that would remember the coolly elegant lady wickerton and there would be questions publicly she would remain aloof distant and uninformative asher felt she owed eric that much she would simply refuse to discuss her marriage or its demise her early training her years of following her fathers rules would serve her now more than ever she would give them tennis with two straight championships now under her belt asher would have been spotlighted in any case it was up to her to sway the press away from her personal life toward her professional resurgence what was growing between her and ty was still too fragile to be shared happiness she had nearly forgotten how simple and overwhelming the feeling was lazy midnight talks crazy loving quiet walks they shared a hotel room and made it home for the days and nights they were there she felt as much a gypsy as he and was content to be so once she had looked for roots stability commitment shed learned that they meant nothing without the fullness of love his spontaneity had always fascinated her this time asher would resolve the lingering fear of it and enjoy arent you dressed yet at the question asher stopped tying her tennis shoe and glanced up ty stood in the doorway between the small parlor and bedroom fully dressed impatient he frowned at her his hair fell over his forehead as unruly as ever and still slightly damp from the his shower waves of love radiated through her nearly asher tossed back not everyone can move quickly in the morning you know especially on six hours sleep the frown became a grin something keep you up he caught the shoe she hurled at him in one hand his eyes never leaving her face apparently the late night hadnt affected him he looked well rested and full of barely controlled energy you can always take a nap after morning practice awfully pleased with yourself this morning arent you am i still grinning he came toward her tossing her shoe lightly it probably has something to do with trouncing that british kid in the quarterfinals yesterday oh lifting a brow asher looked up at him is that all youre pleased about what else let me have my shoe she demanded so i can throw it at you again did you know you have a poor morning attitude he asked holding the shoe out of reach did you know youve been insufferable ever since you won the french she countered sweetly remember its only one quarter of the grand slam he moved the shoe farther out of reach as she made a grab for it for you too face he reminded her the rests on grass in an attempt to hold him still asher grabbed the waistband of his warmup pants the womans insatiable he sighed diving he pinned her beneath him on the bed ty stop laughing asher pushed against him as he nuzzled at her neck well be late for practice oh youre right giving her a quick kiss he rolled away from her well asher muttered as she sat up you didnt take much persuading even as she started to tidy her hair she was spun back into his arms her startled exclamation was smothered by his lips long deep infinitely tender smolderingly passionate his arms circled her asher felt her bones soften then dissolve her head fell back inviting him to take more cradling her ty went on a slow exploration of her mouth for the moment he enjoyed the sense of total domination if they continued he knew she would begin her own demands then it would be power for power the knowledge excited him still he laughed against her lips there was time a lifetime you awake yet he asked her as he ran a hand lightly over her breast mmmhmm good lets go after setting her on her feet he gave ashers bottom a friendly pat ill get you for that she promised needs stirred inside her not quite under control i certainly hope so with an easy smile ty slipped an arm around her shoulders you need to work on your backhand volley he began as they walked from the room insulted asher tossed her head back what are you talking about if youd shorten your swing a bit more shorten your own swing she retorted and while youre at it she continued you werent exactly mr speed yesterday gotta save something for the finals asher snorted as she punched the elevator button your conceit never wavers confidence ty contradicted he liked seeing her this way relaxed but ready to laugh or to slap back briefly he wondered if she realized she was even more beautiful when she forgot caution what about breakfast what about it want to grab some eggs after practice she slid her eyes to his as the doors opened is that your best offer ty lifted a brow as he followed her into the elevator asher exchanged a polite nod with a middleaged couple in tweed maybe youd like to take up where we left off last night ty lounged against an elevator wall as asher gaped at him what did you say your name was again asher could feel two pairs of shocked and interested eyes boring into her back misty she replied allowing a trace of cockney to color her voice will you spring for champagne again mr starbuck it was ever so good he recognized the light of challenge in her eyes and grinned so were you sweetie when the doors opened to the lobby the older couple moved out reluctantly asher punched ty in the arm before she followed in less than an hour they were both concentrating on form and speed and the capricious bounces a ball could take on grass was she playing better asher wondered as she sprang for madges slice she felt looser less encumbered indeed she felt as though losing were not even a possibility at wimbledon she could forget the city of london instead she could remember the qualifying games at roehampton with their anythinggoes attitude both bad language and rackets had flown it was a contrast to the elegance and glamour of wimbledon here both the players and the crowd were steeped in tradition hydrangeas against a backdrop of rich green grass ivycovered walls limos and chauffeurs colors were soothing mauve and green as if time itself had sobered them here spectators would be wellmannered quiet between points applauding after them even those in standing room would behave or the chair judge would tell them politely to quiet down no one hung from the scoreboards at wimbledon it was as revered as the changing of the guards as english as doubledecker buses there was no doubt as one gazed around the immaculately tended velvet lawns the pampered roses the dollhouse kiosks and the stands that could accommodate more than twentyfive thousand that wimbledon was tennis it was here former players migrated to it was here future players aspired to asher remembered ty telling her about watching the matches one longago july fourth and making a vow he had kept it not once but four times more than anything she had wanted before asher wanted them to both walk away from centre court as champions behind the baseline asher stood with a racket and a ball staring off into space had enough madge called out hmm what ashers head snapped around seeing madge standing with her legs spread hand on hips had her laughing i suppose i have i was daydreaming from opposite ends of the court they walked toward their bags and jackets no sense asking if youre happy madge began conversationally you look absolutely miserable floating two inches off the ground that obvious huh i wont pretend not to be pleased madge added smugly ive always thought you two made a great team going to make it official i no were just taking it one day at a time asher kept her eyes lowered as she packed her racket marriage is just a formality after all and pigs fly madge countered calmly when asher glanced up with a cautious smile she went on for some yes youre right not for you face why did you stay in an unhappy marriage for three years when asher started to speak madge lifted a hand because to you marriage is a promise and you dont break promises i failed once she began oh all by yourself isnt that being a bit selfabsorbed impatient madge settled her hands on her hips again listen you arent going to let one mistake keep you from being happy are you i am happy asher assured her punctuating the statement by touching madges shoulder tys all ive ever wanted madge i cant risk losing him again her brow puckered in confusion but you left him asher not the other way around id already lost him she said flatly asher i dont its a new day she interrupted then took a deep breath of scented morning air a fresh start i know what mistakes i made and have no intention of repeating them there was a time in my life that i thought i had to come first before this holding up the small white ball asher examined it before anything i looked on tennis as a competitor his family as a rival that was stupid dropping the ball into a can asher closed it thats funny madge mused there was a time in my life i thought the deans work came first he thought the same about me it wasnt true in either case with a smile asher slung her bag over her shoulder ty wont ever forget that tennis took him out of that tenement maybe he shouldnt thats the thing that brings fire to his game she knows him so well in some ways madge thought and not at all in others and what bring the ice to yours fear asher answered before she thought for a moment she gave madge a blank look then shrugged saying it aloud made it seem rather unimportant fear of failure or exposure laughing she began to walk thank god youre not a reporter the gravel crunched underfoot as they moved down the path it was a sound asher associated with the tidiness of english courts remind me to tell you sometime what goes through my head five minutes before a match with a sigh asher hooked her arm through her old partners lets hit the showers there was no dream asher slept as deeply as a child with no worries no nagging fears the curtains were drawn closed so that the afternoon sun filtered through lazily traffic sounds muffled through it coming as a quiet drone she wore only a short terry robe and lay on top of the spread ty would come back to wake her so that they could spend some time sightseeing before nightfall because they were both scheduled to play the following day they would go to bed early the knock on the door wakened her sitting up asher ran a hand through her tousled hair hed forgotten his key she thought groggily she stepped from the dim bedroom into the brighter parlor wincing against the change of light absently she wondered what time it was as she opened the door shock took a moment to penetrate eric she whispered asher he gave her what was nearly a bow before he elbowed his way into the room did i wake you i was napping she closed the door trying to recover her scattered wits he looked the same she thought naturally he would eric would see no reason to change he was tall slim with a military carriage he had a sharpfeatured european face a bit haughty and remote dark blond hair was cut and groomed to indicate wealth and conservatism light eyes in a pale face both romantic intelligent and cold asher knew that his mouth could twist into a hard line when he was crossed as a suitor he had been charming as a lover meticulous as a husband hed been unbearable she drew herself straight he was no longer her husband i didnt expect to see you eric no he smiled did you think i wouldnt drop by while you were in town lost a bit of weight asher competition tends to do that years of training had her gesturing toward a chair please sit down ill get you a drink there was no reason to be upset by him now she told herself no need to feel fear or guilt divorced couples managed to be civilized more often then not eric asher thought with a grim smile was a very civilized man have you been well she poured his scotch neat then added ice to perrier for herself quite well and you yes your family doing wonderfully eric accepted the glass she offered then eyed her over the rim and your father he watched for the flash of pain and was satisfied as far as i know hes fine quite consciously asher drew on the mask as she sat still hasnt forgiven you for giving up your career her eyes were level now and expressionless im sure youre aware he hasnt mindful of the crease in his pants eric crossed his legs i thought perhaps now that youre competing again he allowed the sentence to die asher watched the bubbles rise in her glass but left them untasted he no longer acknowledges me she said flatly im still paying eric she lifted her eyes again does that satisfy you he drank leisurely for a moment it was your choice my dear your career for my name for your silence asher corrected i already had your name and another mans child in your belly ice clinked against ice as her hands shook quickly she controlled the tremor one would have thought it would have been enough that i lost the child she murmured did you come all this way to remind me i came eric said as he leaned back to see how my exwife was adjusting youre victorious on the courts asher and as lovely as ever she didnt speak as his eyes roamed the room apparently you didnt waste too much time picking up with your old lover my mistake was in leaving him eric we both know that im very very sorry he sent her an icy look your mistake was in trying to pass his bastard off on me furious and trembling asher sprang to her feet i never lied to you and by god ill never apologize again he remained seated swirling liquor does he know yet her color drained dramatically enough to make him smile genuinely hate ate at him no i see he doesnt how interesting i kept my word eric though her hands were laced tightly together ashers voice was strong as long as i was your wife i did everything you asked of me he acknowledged this with a slight nod her honesty hadnt been enough nor had her three years of penance but youre not my wife any longer we agreed the marriage was intolerable for both of us what are you afraid hed do eric mused frowning up at the ceiling hes a very physical man as i remember with a primitive sort of temper lowering his eyes he smiled again do you think hed beat you asher gave a short laugh no youre very confident he murmured what exactly are you afraid of wearily she dropped her hands to her sides he wouldnt forgive me eric any more than you have i lost the child i lost my father my selfesteem ill never lose the guilt i hurt nothing but your pride eric havent i suffered enough for that perhaps perhaps not rising he stepped toward her she remembered the scent of his crisp dignified cologne very well perhaps the most perfect punishment might be in never knowing your secret is safe ill make you no promises asher it astonishes me that i was ever naive enough to think of you as a kind man eric she said softly justice he returned toasting her revenge has little to do with justice he shrugged an elegant shoulder all in your viewpoint my dear she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of breaking down of weeping of screaming or begging instead asher stood perfectly still if youve said all youve come to say id like you to go of course after finishing off the liquor he set down the glass sleep well darling dont bother ill let myself out eric turned the doorknob and found himself face to face with ty nothing could have pleased him more ty noted his cold satisfied smile before his gaze shifted to asher standing in the center of the room she seemed frozen there was anguish and he thought fear in her eyes her face was deadwhite and still even as he wondered what it was she feared ty took in the rest of her appearance the tousled hair the brief robe and exposed skin had rage boiling in him asher could feel it from where she stood his eyes whipped back to erics there was murder in them get the hell out of here just on my way eric said equably though he had inched back against the door in instinctive defense his last thought as he shut it behind him was that asher would bear the brunt of the fury in tys eyes that alone had made it worth the trip the room vibrated with the silent storm asher didnt move it seemed ty would stare at her for eternity the trembling was difficult to control but she forced herself if she made light of the incident perhaps so would he what the hell was he doing here he just dropped by i suppose to wish me luck the lie sliced at her cozy crossing to her ty caught the lapel of her robe in his hand dont you usually dress for visitors asher then again i suppose it isnt necessary for exhusbands ty dont dont what he demanded though he struggled against the words the accusations the feelings he knew it was a losing battle against the unknown he would always attack wouldnt it be better form to meet him somewhere else its a little sticky here isnt it the cold sarcasm hurt more than his fury would have with so much to hide she could only shake her head ty you know theres nothing between us you know what the hell do i know he shouted grasping the other lapel dont ask dont question then i walk in and find you entertaining the bastard you left me for i didnt know he was coming she gripped his arms for balance as he nearly lifted her off her feet if he had called i would have told him to stay away you let him in enraged he shook her why despair rather than fear clutched at her would you be happier if i had slammed the door in his face yes damn it i didnt she pushed at him now as furious as he i let him in i gave him a drink make what you like of it i cant stop you did he want you back he demanded ignoring her struggles is that why he came what does it matter impotently she slammed her fists into his chest its not what i want she threw back her head her eyes burning then tell me tell me now why you married him when she tried to pull away he dragged her back ill have that much asher and ill have it now because i thought he was what i needed she cried out roaring in her ears was the anger the fear she had felt for eric and was he to prevent her from striking out ty grasped her wrist no she jerked but couldnt free herself frustration added to an almost unreasonable fury no i was miserable i was trapped her voice was both strong and harsh i paid in ways you cant imagine there wasnt a day i was happy does that satisfy you she did something he had never seen her do before she wept his grip on her wrists loosened as he watched tears flood her eyes and spill onto her cheeks never in all the years hed known her had he seen that kind of torment on her face tearing herself from his grip asher fled into the bedroom slamming the door at her back she wanted peace she wanted privacy the grief had hit her unexpectedly if the tears hadnt clogged her throat she would have told him about the baby the words had been there ready to spill out in anger then speech had been impossible now she needed to weep it out ty stared at the closed door for a long time the wrenching sound of sobbing came to him it was a reaction he hadnt expected his anger was justified as were his questions anger for anger he could have comprehended but the pain he heard was altogether different having come from a family of women he understood womans tears over the years hed done his share of comforting and soothing but these sobs were hot and bitter and asher never wept jess cried easily quiet feminine tears his mother wept with joy or silent sadness these he could handle a shoulder could be offered a few sympathetic words a teasing comment instinctively he knew none of those were the prescription for raw grief he still had questions he still had anger but the sounds from the bedroom forced him to put them aside ty recognized when tears were used as a weapon or a defense these were being torn from her unwillingly dragging a hand through his hair he wondered if it was eric or himself who was responsible for them or something he knew nothing about cursing softly he went to the door and opened it she lay curled on the bed in a ball of misery her body shook when he touched her she jerked away saying nothing ty lay down beside her gathering her close for another moment she fought him alone her tears were not to be observed not to be shared private ty dealt with her struggles by merely holding her tighter in arms that were both strong and gentle im not going anywhere he murmured with no more protest asher clung to his comfort and let her grief run its course it had grown dark and her body was weak there were no more tears left in her tys arms were strong around her beneath her damp cheek she could hear the steady beat of his heart gently almost absently his fingers stroked the base of her neck shed nearly told him asher closed her eyes too weary to feel fear or regret if she could have summoned up the energy she would have been grateful for the tears that had prevented her confession i lost your baby would he be holding her now if those words had spilled out what good would it do to tell him she asked herself why make him grieve for something he had never known and grieve he would she knew after the anger passed it came to her suddenly that it wasnt only fear that kept the secret locked inside her she couldnt bear to see ty hurt as she had hurt how could she explain to him about eric without dragging up old bitterness opening old wounds ty hadnt wanted her any longer jess had made that abundantly clear but eric had it had been her pride that had turned to eric then her sense of duty that had kept her with him perhaps if she had been stronger after the accident she would never have made those promises to him asher had floated to consciousness on a wave of pain what reason was there to wake up and hurt she thought groggily sleep sleep was so peaceful she remembered the shouting the fall the swimming darkness the baby tys baby panic the panic pierced by lethargy her eyelids seemed weighted with lead but she forced them open even as she reached a protective hand to her stomach stern and cold erics face floated in front of her eyes the baby she managed through dry lips dead tearing burning grief replaced the pain no moaning she closed her eyes again oh god no my baby not my baby ty listen to me asher eric spoke briskly for three days he had waited while asher drifted in and out of consciousness she had lost the baby and a great deal of blood once she had nearly slipped away but he had willed her to live the love he had once felt had turned to resentment that bordered on hate she had deceived him made a fool of him now he would have his payment my baby the babys dead he said flatly then gripped her hand look at me she obeyed with eyes glazed with sorrow youre in a private clinic the reason for your being here will never be known beyond the front doors if you do what i say eric a spark of hope flickered with what strength she had asher tightened her fingers on his are they sure couldnt there be a mistake please you miscarried the servants will be discreet as far as anyone knows weve slipped away for a few days i dont understand she pressed her hand against her stomach as if to make the truth a lie the fall i fell down the stairs but an accident he stated making the loss of the child sound like a broken glass insidiously the pain slipped through ty asher moaned shutting her eyes youre my wife and will remain so until i say differently eric waited until her eyes focused on him again would you have me call your lover and tell him you married me while carrying his child no she could only whisper the word ty she ached for him he was lost to her as lost as the child theyd made together then youll do as i say youll retire from professional tennis i wont have the press speculating about the two of you and dragging my name through the mud youll behave as i expect lady wickerton to behave i will not touch you he continued with a trace of disgust any physical desire i felt for you is gone we will live in the manner i designate or your lover will hear from me about this game you played is this understood what did it matter how she lived asher asked herself she was already dead yes ill do whatever you want please leave me alone now as you wish he rose when youre stronger youll give an official press release on your retirement your reason will be that you have no more time for tennis or any desire for a career that would take you away from your husband and your adopted country do you think it matters to me she whispered just let me alone let me sleep your word asher she gave him a long last look before she wearily closed her eyes my word eric and she had kept it she had tolerated erics pleasure when her father had turned away from her she had ignored his discreet but frequent affairs for months she had lived like a zombie doing as she was bid when the layers of grief began to peel away his hold remained through guilt and threats when she had begun to come to life again asher had bargained for her freedom nothing was more important to eric than his reputation she held his many women in one hand he held the knowledge of tys child to the other theyd made an uneasy agreement now he was back asher mused perhaps because she was making a success of her life again still she felt he would keep his silence if only to ensure a hold over her once he spoke all ties were severed or if she spoke she remembered the look on tys face when he had seen her with eric explanations would never be accepted now perhaps the day would come when they fully trusted each other when the memory of betrayal would be dimmed shed been silent for some time by the steadiness of her breathing she might have been sleeping ty knew she was awake and thinking what secrets was she holding from him he wondered and how long would it be before the air between them was finally cleared he wanted to demand but her vulnerability prevented him more than anything else he didnt want to risk her slipping behind the wall she could so easily erect better he murmured she sighed before he felt the faint movement of her head as she nodded there was one thing she could settle between them one thing she could make him understand ty he means nothing to me do you believe that i want to believe it suddenly intense she sat up and leaned against his chest if she could give him nothing else she could give him this i feel nothing for eric not even hate the marriage was a mistake from the start it was nothing more than a facade then why its always been you she said before she crushed her mouth to his always you she pressed her lips to his throat passion erupting in her as swiftly as the tears i stopped living for so long and now her mouth ran wildly over his face i need you now only you her mouth met his fervently saying more than words her ardor touched off his own there was no need for questions now or for answers she pulled the shirt from him eager to touch pressing her lips to heated flesh she heard him groan though her hands moved swiftly to undress him her lips loitered lingering to arouse with her tongue she left a moist trail of fire his body was a pleasure to her hard muscle long bones taut flesh delighting in him she sought new secrets if she nibbled at his waist his breathing grew shallow his fingers gripped her hair if she moved her palm along his thigh his moan vibrated with need giddy with power she ran a crazed trail from stomach to chest her lips hungry and seeking he struggled to pull the robe from her as she caught his earlobe between her teeth low sultry laughter drove him wild neither heard the seam rip as he tugged the terry cloth from her limber and quick she made it impossible for him to grant them both the final relief her lovemaking tormented and thrilled him while her agility held him off now he demanded grasping her hips asher for gods sake no no no she murmured then cut off his oath with a searing kiss she found the torture exquisite though her own body begged for fulfillment she wanted to prolong it as his hands slid over her damp skin she arched back reveling in his touch she belonged and always would to the man who could release her fires neither was in control each a slave to the other she wanted nothing more than to be bound to him here in a dark room with the sound of her own breathing raging in her ears in the sunlight with the secrets of the night still humming between them for always beneath her his body was hot and moist and moving the rhythm seduced her everything warm everything giving flowed through her thoughts vanished memories dimmed now there was only now the allpowerful greedy present this time when he gripped her hips she made no attempt to stop him her head fell back in complete abandonment as they joined the moan was rich and deep and from both of them as one they were catapulted up beyond pleasure into ecstasy chapter eight contents prev next asher had driven in limousines all her life as a child shed ridden behind a chauffeur named george in a shiny maroon car with smoked glass and a builtin bar george had remained the family driver though the cars had changed an elegant white rolls a sturdy blue mercedes lady wickertons driver had been peter and the car had been an old discreet gray daimler peter had been as silent and as efficient as the car asher felt no thrill at being driven in the long black limo toward wimbledon as they passed through roehampton she watched the scenery tidy healthy trees trimmed shrubs orderly flowers in a few hours she would be in centre court aching sweating and winning this was the big prize credibility prestige press they were all at wimbledon once before she and ty had taken the championships and led the dancing at the wimbledon ball in that year of her life that had brought complete joy and complete misery now she would play her old foe maria rayski with all the verve and all the cunning she had at her disposal though shed thought her life had begun to come to order with her first win asher now realized shed been wrong the turning point was today here in the arena that was synonymous with her profession she would play her best here on the surface she knew best in the country in which she had lived like a prisoner perhaps true confidence would begin after this match was over she thought of ty the young boy who had once vowed to play and win now in the lush interior of the limo asher made a similar vow she would have a championship season reestablish asher wolfe for asher wolfe then she would be ready to face the woman the woman would face the only man who mattered the crowds waited for her and other arriving players the greetings were enthusiastic roaming spectators sipped champagne and nibbled on strawberries and cream signing autographs asher felt light confident ready nothing she thought could mar such a day the fourth of july the brilliant sunshine the scent of garden flowers she remembered other wimbledons so little had changed fans mingled with players chatting laughing the atmosphere was one of an informal tea parry with the promise of a spectacle but she could feel the nerves they were there just under the bonhomie in the young players the veterans doubles and singles finalists mixing among them were rock stars and celebrities millionaires and landed gentry asher saw faces from the past players from her fathers generation for them it was a reunion nostalgia tradition there were people she had entertained in grosvenor square for them it was a social event the dress was summergardenparty chic picture hats and pastels because yesterdays had to be faced asher greeted former acquaintances asher how lovely to see you again what a sweet little outfit how strange it is not to see you at the club anymore there was speculation thinly manners she dealt with it calmly as she had during her three years of marriage wheres that old man of yours turning asher clasped two large hands warmly stretch mcbride you havent changed a bit of course he had when hed first tickled ashers chin hed been thirty his face had been unlined his hair untouched with gray hed won nearly every major championship there was to win twice around though he was still tall and nearly as lean as he had been in his prime the twenty years showed on his face you always told a lie beautifully grinning he kissed her cheek wheres jim in the states she answered keeping her smile bright how have you been stretch just fine got five grandchildren and a nice string of sporting goods stores on the east coast he patted her hand dont tell me jim isnt going to be here he hasnt missed it in forty years it was a struggle not to show the pain much less not to feel it as far as i know he wont be im awfully glad to see you again i havent forgotten that you taught me the dump shot pleased he laughed use it on maria today he advised i love to see americans win at wimbledon tell your old man hello for me take care stretch her smile evaded the promise she couldnt give with a parting kiss he moved away turning asher found herself face to face with lady daphne evans the striking brunette had been one of erics more discreet dalliances and one of ashers more difficult trials her eyes automatically cooled though her voice was scrupulously polite daphne you look exquisite asher daphne skimmed cool eyes over ashers brief tennis dress down long bare legs to her court shoes you look different how odd to find you an athlete odd asher countered ive always been an athlete tell me how is your husband the thrust was parried with a quick laugh miles is in spain on business as it happens eric escorted me today though her stomach churned her face remained composed erics here yes of course meticulously daphne adjusted the brim of her rosepink hat you dont think hed miss this wimbledon do you long mink lashes swept down then up again were all very interested in the results will we see you at the ball darling naturally well i must let you mingle mustnt i thats traditional best of luck with a flash of a smile daphne swirled her skirts and was gone asher fought the nausea but began to nudge her way through the crowd all she wanted was the comparative peace of the a locker rooms the day ahead promised to be enough of a fight without contending with ghosts with a few smiles and mechanically gracious greetings she made her way out of the main throng a few moments to herself that was what she needed before the stands began to fill before her strength and abilities were put to the test she knew eric well enough to be certain he had asked daphne to seek her out yes he would want to be sure she knew he was there before the match as she slipped into the locker room asher noticed her hands were shaking she couldnt allow it in thirty minutes she would have to be in complete control when she walked onto the court asher was careful not to look into the crowd it would be easier on her nerves if the people who watched and cheered remained anonymous as she attempted to empty her mind of all but the first game asher watched maria rayski on her own side of the court rayski paced gesturing occasionally to the crowd tossing comments her nerves were undisguised it was always so asher mused rayski chewed her hails cracked her knuckles and said the first thing that came into her mind in a wary sort of fashion asher had always liked her at five foot ten she was tall for a woman and rangy with a deadly stretch fatalistically asher recalled she had a habit of badgering her opponent well she decided as she chose her game racket rayskis histrionics might just keep her mind off who was and who was not in the stands she eyed the television camera dispassionately with the wonder of technology the match would be relayed to the states with only a brief delay would her father even bother to watch she wondered silently she walked to the baseline for the first serve there was no cautious testing in the first games rayski went straight for the jugular both were fast players and while rayski was more aggressive asher was a better strategist a ball could take ungodly bounces on grass particularly the lush grass of wimbledons centre court to defend to attack required instinct and timing it also required complete concentration the lead jockeyed back and forth during the first set as the players gave the fourteen thousand spectators the show theyd come to see over the elegant centuryold court they sweated gritted their teeth and scrambled not for the enjoyment of those who paid to see but for the game rayski tossed an occasional taunt over the net between rallies asher might have been deaf for all the response she gave she had her rhythm nothing was going to interfere with it she placed her ground strokes with deadly precision charged the net for short angling volleys both her form and her energy seemed at perfect peak everything changed when the women took their seats for the toweloff before the third set because she had forgotten about everything but the game ashers defenses were lowered an inadvertent glance up in the stands had her eyes locking with erics a slow icy smile spread over his face as he lifted a hand in salute or reminder what the devils wrong with her ty asked himself he shifted closer to the edge of his seat and studied asher with narrowed eyes shed just dropped two games straight the second one on a double fault true rayski was playing superbly but so had asher until the third set she was playing mechanically now as if the life had gone out of her too often she was missing basic shots or failing to put anything extra on a return rayskis serve was not her strongest weapon yet she was repeatedly breezing service winners past asher if he didnt know her better he would have sworn asher was tanking the match but asher wasnt capable of deliberately losing carefully ty watched for signs of an injury a strained muscle or twisted ankle would explain the change in her she gave no sign of favoring a leg the composure on her face was as perfect as a mask too perfect ty reflected as the third game went to fifteenlove something was definitely wrong but it wasnt physical disturbed he quickly scanned the crowd there were dozens of faces he knew some by name some by reputation there was an awardwinning actor hed once played a celebrity tourney with ty had found him an earthy man with a credible forehand he recognized the ballet star because asher had once dragged him to see the firebird beside the ballerina was a countrywestern singer with a crossover hit ty passed over them looking for an answer he found it sitting near the royal box there was a cool satisfied smile on erics face as he watched his exwife beside him a thin flashy woman in a rosecolored hat looked bored rage rose in ty instantly his first instinct was to yank eric up by his fivehundreddollar lapels and rearrange the expression on his face with his fists son of a bitch he muttered already rising the hand that grasped his wrist was strong where are you going madge demanded to do something i shouldve done three years ago still clinging to his arm madge twisted her head to follow the direction of his eyes oh boy she said under her breath through her fingertips she could feel tys temper only briefly did she consider the personal satisfaction she would gain from letting ty do what he wanted hold on she snapped between her teeth listen to me punching him out isnt going to do anything for asher the hell it wont he retorted you know why hes here to upset her madge managed calmly enough obviously hes succeeding go talk to her a strong man might have cringed from the blazing look ty turned on her madge merely arched a brow you want to start a fight starbuck do it after the match ill referee right now use your head his control didnt come easily madge watched him struggle for it lose it then finally win though his eyes were still stormy the hand under hers relaxed if talking doesnt work he said flatly im going to break him in half ill hold your coat she promised before ty slipped away knowing hed have only a moment ty decided to use words sparingly and make them count after losing the game without making a point asher slumped into her chair she didnt see ty waiting for her what the hells wrong with you her head jerked up at the harsh tone nothing she was tired already defeated as she mopped at the sweat on her face youre handing the match to rayski on a platter leave me alone ty going to give him the satisfaction of watching you fall apart in front of fourteen thousand people face there was sarcasm without a trace of sympathy in his voice he noted the quick almost indiscernible flash in her eyes hed wanted to see it always she played better if there was anger beneath the ice i never thought id see you tank a match go to hell whirling she stalked back to the baseline nobody she thought as she waited for rayski to take position nobody accused asher wolfe of tanking rayski crouched in her pendulum receiving stance while asher gave the ball a few testing bounces tossing it she drew back her racket and lunged the effort of the serve came out in a force of breath the finely pulverized chalk at the baseline rose on contact without giving the ace a thought asher took her stance for the next serve her anger had teeth she could feel it gnawing at her a photographer zoomed in on her face and captured the contradictory placid expression and frosted eyes temper was energy asher flew across the court striking the ball as if it were the enemy yet her battle was sternly controlled no one watching her would realize that she cursed ty with each stroke no one but ty himself satisfied he watched her turn her fury on her opponent oh she was fabulous to see he thought those long slim legs the strong shoulders her form was so smooth so precise yet beneath was that excitement that smoldering passion she was as she played he mused and wanted her no one but he knew just how reckless she could be just how abandoned the thought had desire moving through him she was the woman all men fantasized about part lady part wanton and his ty told himself fiercely only his after watching asher fire a backhand volley past rayski he glanced up erics smile was gone as if sensing the scrutiny the englishman looked down the two men studied each other as the crowd applauded ashers game ty laughed softly insolently then walked away though the match held close to the last point the impetus ty had instilled in her carried asher to the win she was polite even charming as she accepted the wimbledon plate inside she was raging the joy of victory couldnt penetrate the fury and resentment she was feeling ty had turned the tide of her emotions away from eric and onto himself she wanted to shout she smiled and raised her trophy for the crowd to see she wanted to scream politely she allowed the army of cameras to snap her fatigue didnt touch her the ache in her arm might not have existed at last freeing herself from the press and wellwishers she simmered under the shower and changed determination made her remain at wimbledon to watch tys match stubbornness made her refuse to admire his game eric was forgotten ashers only thought was to vent her fury at the first possible moment it took five hard sets and two and a half hours before ty could claim his own trophy asher left the stadium before the cheers had died he knew shed be waiting for him even before ty slipped the key in the lock he knew what to expect he looked forward to it his adrenaline was still flowing neither the shower nor the massage had taken it from him wimbledon always affected him this way as long as he played winning there would be his first goal now the demanding games behind him the win still sweet he felt like a knight returning home victorious from the wars his woman waited but she wouldnt throw herself into his arms she was going to scratch at him oh yes he was looking forward to it grinning ty turned the knob he had no more than shut the door behind him than asher stormed out of the bedroom congratulations face he said amiably looks like i get first dance at the ball how dare you say those things to me in the middle of the match she demanded eyes glittering she advanced on him how dare you accuse me of tanking ty set his bag and rackets on a chair what do you call what you were doing losing quitting he corrected her you might as well have put up a sign ive never quit he lifted a brow only for three years dont you dare throw that in my face raising both hands she shoved him instead of being offended he laughed it pleased him enormously that he could rattle her control you did good he reminded her i couldnt take a chance on your losing he gave her cheek an affectionate pinch i didnt want to open the ball with maria you conceited overconfident louse she shoved him again gramaldi almost took you i wish he had she shouted the lie at him you could use a good kick in the ego with the intention of storming back into the bedroom she whirled catching her wrist ty spun her back around arent you going to congratulate me no aw come on face he grinned appealingly give us a kiss for an answer asher balled her hand into a fist ducking the blow ty gripped her waist and slung her over his shoulder i love it when youre violent he said huskily as she pulled his hair to her own surprise and annoyance she had to choke back a laugh then youre going to get a real charge out of this she promised kicking wildly as he threw her on the bed even though her reflexes were quick ty had her pinned beneath him in seconds breathless she struggled to bring her knee up to his weakest point not that violent wisely he shifted to safety she twisted squirmed and struggled you take your hands off me soon as im finished he agreed slipping a hand under the blouse that had come loose from her waistband refusing to acknowledge the sensation of pleasure asher glared at him dont you touch me i have to touch you to make love to you his smile was reasonable and friendly its the only way i know how i will not laugh she ordered herself as the gurgle rose in her throat she was angry furious she reminded herself ty recognized the weakening and capitalized on it your eyes get purple when youre mad i like it he kissed her firmly shut mouth why dont you yell at me some more i have nothing more to say to you asher claimed haughtily please go away but we havent made love yet lightly be rubbed his nose against hers refusing to be charmed she turned her head away we arent going to wanna bet with one swift move he ripped her blouse from neck to waist ty shocked asher gaped at him her mouth open i nearly did that when you were on centre court today you should be glad i waited before she could react he tore her shorts into ragged pieces thinking he might have gone mad asher stayed perfectly still something wrong he asked as his hand moved to cup her breast ty you cant tear my clothes i already did soft as a feather his hand roamed down to her stomach want to tear mine no her skin was beginning to quiver she tried to shift away and found herself held prisoner i made you angry her head cleared long enough for her to glare at him yes and angry enough to win he murmured trailing his lips along her throat and when i watched you i nearly exploded from wanting you all that passion simmering just under the surface and i know what its like when it escapes she gave a little moan as his fingers stroked the point of her breast but tried to cling to reality you had no business saying i was tanking i didnt say that i only planted the idea when he lifted his head the look in his eyes had her drawing in a quick breath did you think id stand by and watch him get to you like that no man gets to you asher no man but me with a savage kiss he cut off all words all thoughts it always surprised asher that ty could project such raw sexuality in black tie conservative formal dress could do nothing to alter his air of primitive masculinity the material could cover the muscles but it couldnt disguise the strength there had been times asher had wondered if it was his earthiness that had drawn her to him glimpsing him in a room filled with elegantly attired men and women she knew it was more than that it was all of him every aspect from temper to humor that had made her his the wimbledon ball was as traditional as the tournament the music the lights the people it was always an evening to remember for its beauty and tastefulness asher counted the hours until it would be over scolding herself she tuned back into the conversation of her dance partner shed always enjoyed a party always found pleasure in quiet wellrun affairs but now she wished she and ty could have shared a bottle of wine in their room she didnt want the spotlight this evening but candlelight over the heads of the other dancers her eyes met tys it took only one brief glance to know that his thoughts mirrored hers love threatened to drown her youre a lovely dancer miss wolfe as the music ended asher smiled at her partner thank you her smile never wavered as it ran through her head that she had completely forgotten the mans name i was a great fan of your fathers you know the man cupped a hand under her elbow to lead her from the dance floor the golden boy of tennis with a sigh he patted ashers hand of course i remember his early days before you were born wimbledon has always been his favorite dad loved the tradition and the pomp asher added with a smile seeing the second generation here is good for the soul in a courtly gesture he lifted her hand to his lips my best to you miss wolfe jerry how are you a stately woman in silk brocade swept up to them lady mallow eric wickertons sister was as always elegant ashers spine stiffened lucy what a pleasure she offered her fingers to be kissed sending asher a brief glance as she did so jerry brians been searching for you to say hello hes just over there well then if you ladies will excuse me having dispatched him lucy turned to her former sisterinlaw asher youre looking well thank you lucy she gave ashers simple ivory sheath a brief survey thinking that if she had worn something so basic she would have blended in with the wallpaper on asher the muted color and simple lines were stunning lucy gave her a candid stare and are you well a bit surprised asher lifted a brow yes quite well and you i meant that as more than small talk lucys hesitation was brief as was her glance to determine if they could be overheard theres something ive wanted to say to you for a long time stiffening asher waited i love my brother lucy began i know you didnt i also know that throughout your marriage you did nothing to disgrace him though he didnt return the favor the unexpected words had asher staring lucy loving him doesnt blind me asher she continued briskly my loyalty is with eric and always will be yes i understand that lucy studied ashers face a moment then she seemed to sigh i gave you no support when you were my brothers wife and i wanted to offer my apologies touched asher took her hand theres no need eric and i were simply wrong for each other i often wondered why you married him lucy mused still searching ashers face at first i thought it was the title but that had nothing to do with it something seemed to change between you so soon after you were married hardly two months ashers eyes clouded for only a moment under lucys direct gaze i wondered if youd taken a lover but it became very obvious in a short time that it was eric not you who was dallying just as its become obvious that theres been only one man in your life her gaze shifted asher didnt have to follow it to know it rested on ty knowing that hurt eric knowing that eric should never have married you lucy sighed again a bit indulgently but then hes always wanted what belonged to someone else i wont speak of that but ill tell you now what i should have told you long before i wish you happiness on impulse asher kissed her cheek thank you lucy smiling she glanced over at ty again your taste asher has always been exquisite ive envied it though its never been right for me its time i joined brian as she turned away asher touched her hand if i wrote you would you be uncomfortable id be very pleased lucy moved away silks rustling smiling asher realized she had been right wimbledon was her turning point another layer of guilt had been lifted she was coming closer to discovering who she was and what she needed feeling a hand on her arm she turned to smile at ty who was that an old friend asher lifted a hand to his cheek dance with me theres no other way i can hold you until we can be alone chapter nine contents prev next asher knew she had made great strides when pressure from the press no longer tightened her nerves her habitual terror of saying the wrong thing or saying too much faded she still had secrets before coming to australia shed promised herself a moratorium whatever decisions had to be made would wait for the moment she wanted to concentrate on happiness happiness was ty and tennis there were good memories in australia wins losses good tennis the people were relaxed casual the friendliness was exactly what asher needed after the tension of england aussies remembered the face and welcomed her for the first time since her comeback asher found the winning taking second place to the enjoying the change in her was noticeable even during the early rounds her smiles came more frequently though her play was no less intense and concentrated the air of being driven was fading from the first row of the stands ty watched her in early morning practice hed just completed two hours of his own now his legs stretched out he studied her from behind the protection of tinted glasses shed improved he mused not only as an athlete he remembered how important athletic ability was to her the fact that she was a strategist and a craftsman had never been enough always she had striven to be recognized as a good athlete and so she would be he thought as she raced to the net to slap a return with her twofisted backhand perhaps in some ways the years of retirement had toughened her his face clouded a moment consciously he smoothed the frown away this wasnt the time to think of that or to dwell on the questions that still plagued him whys so many whys hammered at him yet he recognized that she was grabbing this time to be carefree hed give her that he would wait but when the season was over hed have his answers when her laughter floated to him he forgot the doubts it was a rich warm sound heard all too rarely leaning back ty chugged down cold fruit juice and looked around him if wimbledon was his favorite stadium the grass of kooyong was his favorite surface it was as hard as a roadbed and fast a ball bounced true here unlike other grass courts even at the end of the season when the courts were worn and soiled the surface remained even even after a deluge of rain the australian grass was resilient kooyong was a treasure for the fast for the aggressive ty was ready for just such a match through halfclosed eyes he watched asher she was ready too he decided and ever more ready to enjoy it a smile touched his mouth whatever questions there were whatever answers nothing could harm what was between them now noting the practice session was winding up ty jumped lightly down to the court how about a quick game madge shot him a look and continued to pack up her rackets forget it hotshot he grabbed a racket from her bouncing a ball lightly on the strings spot you two points with a snort madge snatched the ball dropping it into the can take him on asher she suggested he needs a lesson catching her tongue between her teeth asher studied him head to head she decided you serve asher waited until he had taken his receiving position cupping two balls in her hand she sent him a smile been a while hasnt it starbuck last time we played you never got to game point he gave madge a wink sure you dont want that handicap her ace answered for her as pleased as he was surprised ty sent her a long look removing the tinted glasses he tossed them to madge not bad face his eyes followed the trail of the next serve he sent it to the far corner to brush the service line ty liked nothing better than to watch asher run the range of her backhand was limited but perfectly placed he was on it in a flash the last time they had played he had beaten her handily even while holding back now he scented challenge asher lined the ball straight at him hard and fast pivoting ty slammed it back the ball whistled on her return with a powerful swing ty sent her to the baseline then nipped her return so that the ball brushed the net and died in the forecourt fifteenall ty feigned a yawn as he went back to position narrowing her eyes asher served the rally was a study in speed and footwork she knew he was playing with her moving her all over the court aware that she was no match for his power she chose to catch him off guard the ball thudded she raced it soared she followed the sounds of rackets cutting air had a steady almost musical sound a rhythm was set patiently she adhered to it until she sensed ty relaxing abruptly she altered the pacing and slapped the ball past him getting crafty he muttered getting slow old timer she retorted sweetly ty slammed her next serve crosscourt after the bounce it landed somewhere in the grandstands under her breath asher swore pungently did you say something not a thing disgusted asher shook her hair back as she readied to serve she caught the look in tys eyes they rested not on her ball or racket but on her mouth alls fair she mused with a secret smile slowly and deliberately she moistened her lips with the tip of her tongue taking a long preliminary stretch she served distracted ty was slow to meet the ball asher had little trouble blowing the return past him game point she said softly sending him an intimate smile keeping her back to him she bent to pick up a fresh ball taking her time about it she could almost feel tys eyes run up the long length of her legs smoothing a hand down her hip she walked back to the baseline ready he nodded dragging his eyes away from the subtle sweep of her breasts when his eyes met hers he read an invitation that had his pulse racing his concentration broken he barely returned her serve the rally was very short victorious asher let out a hoot of laughter before she walked to the net your game seemed to be a bit off starbuck the jibe and the laughter in her eyes had him wanting to strangle her and devour her cheat he murmured as he walked to meet her at the net ashers look was guileless and she was faintly shocked i have no idea what youre talking about the words were hardly out of her mouth when she was pulled against him her lips crushed under his laughter and desire seemed to bubble in her simultaneously without being aware of it she dropped her racket and clung to him youre lucky i dont toss you on the ground here and now he mumbled against her mouth whats lucky about that enchanted asher strained against him how was it possible for one kiss to make her head swim ty drew back inches only his whole body was throbbing for her dont tempt me do i she asked huskily damn you asher you know just how much his voice shook delighting her she found she needed him to be as vulnerable as she im never sure she whispered dropping her head to his chest his heart was beating too rapidly ty tried to fight down the impossible surge of need not the time not the place his sanity stated control was necessary you were sure enough to use a few tricks to distract me lifting her head asher smiled at him distract you how took your time picking up that ball didnt you she seemed to consider a moment why ive seen chuck do the same thing playing against you it never seemed to make any difference she let out a whoop of surprise as he lifted her up and over the net next time ill be ready for you face after giving her a brief bruising kiss he dropped her to her feet you could play naked and i wouldnt blink an eye catching her lip between her teeth she sent him a teasing glance wanna bet before he could connect his racket with her bottom she dashed away the locker room wasnt empty as asher walked in but the crowd was thinning with the fifth rounds completed there were fewer contenders and therefore fewer bodies she was looking forward to her match that afternoon with a hot newcomer who had hopped up in the rankings from one hundred and twentieth to fortythird in one year asher had no intention of strolling into the finals even the pressure of grand slam potential couldnt mar her mood if ever there was a year she could win it asher felt it was this one she greeted a towelclad tia conway as the australian emerged from the showers both women knew they would face each other before the tournament was over asher could hear a laughing argument taking place over the sound of running water as she started to remove her warmup jacket she spotted madge in a corner the brunette sat with her head leaning back against the wall her eyes shut she was pale despite her tan and there were beads of perspiration on her brow asher rushed over to kneel at her feet madge opening her eyes slowly madge sighed who won for a moment asher went blank oh i did i cheated smart girl madge whats wrong god your hands are like ice no its nothing she let out a breath as she leaned forward youre sick let me no ive finished being sick after a weak smile madge swiped the sweat from her brow ill be fine in a minute you look terrible you need a doctor asher sprang to her feet ill call someone before she could move madge had her hand ive seen a doctor every sort of nightmare went through ashers head in stark terror she stared at her friend oh god madge how bad ive got seven months as asher swayed madge caught her arm tightly good grief asher im pregnant not dying stunned asher sank to the bench pregnant shh quickly madge glanced around id like to keep this quiet for a while damn morning sickness catches me off guard at the worst times letting out a shaky breath she relaxed against the wall again the good news is its not supposed to last long i dont madge i dont know what to say how about congratulations shaking her head asher gripped both of madges hands in hers is this what you want are you kidding on a half laugh madge leaned against ashers shoulder i might not look too happy at the moment but inside im doing cartwheels ive never wanted anything so badly in my life she sat silently for a moment her hand still in ashers you know during my twenties all i could think about was being number one it was great being there the wrightman cup wimbledon dallas all of it i was twentyeight when i met the dean and still ambitious as hell i didnt want to get married but i couldnt live without him as for kids i thought hell theres plenty of time for that later always later well i woke up one morning in the hospital with my leg screaming at me and i realized i was thirtytwo years old id won just about everything i thought i had to win and yet something was missing for the better part of my life ive floated around this old world from court to court team tennis proam tourneys celebrity exhibitions you name it until the dean there was nothing but tennis for me even after him it was the biggest slice of the pie youre a champion asher said softly yeah madge laughed again yeah by god i am and i like it but you know what when i looked at the snapshot of tys nephew i realized that i wanted a baby the deans baby more than id ever wanted a wimbledon plate isnt that wild she let the statement hang in silence a moment as both women absorbed it this is going to be my last tournament and even while thats hurting i keep wishing it was over so i could go home and start knitting booties you dont know how to knit asher murmured well the dean can knit them then ill just sit around and get fat twisting her head to grin at asher madge saw the tears hey whats this im happy for you asher muttered she could remember her own feelings on learning of her pregnancy the fear the joy the nausea and elation shed wanted to learn to sew then it had been over so quickly you look overjoyed madge commented brushing a tear away i am really she caught madge to her in a viselike hug youll take care of yourself wont you dont overdo or take any chances sure something in the tone had the seed of a thought germinating asher did you did something happen when you were married to eric asher held her tighter for a moment then released her not now maybe someday well talk about it how does the dean feel about all this madge gave her a long measuring look the nonanswer was answer enough so she let it lay he was all set to take out a fullpage ad in world of sports she stated ive made him wait until i officially retire theres no need to retire madge you can take a year or two off lots of women do not this one stretching her arms to the ceiling madge grinned im going out a winner ranked fifth when i get home im going to learn how to use a vacuum cleaner ill believe that when i see it you and ty are invited to my first homecooked dinner great asher kissed her cheek well bring the antacid not nice madge mused but wise hey face she continued before asher could rise i wouldnt want this to get around but her eyes were suddenly very young and she looked very vulnerable im scared right out of my socks ill be almost thirtyfour by the time this kid makes an appearance ive never even changed a diaper firmly asher took madges shoulders and kissed both of her cheeks youre a champion remember yeah but what do i know about chicken pox madge demanded kids get chicken pox dont they and braces and corrective shoes and and mothers who worry before theres anything to worry about asher finished youre already slipping right into the slot hey youre right rather pleased with herself madge rose im going to be great youre going to be terrific lets get a shower youve got a doubles match this afternoon with feelings mixed and uncertain asher rode the elevator to her hotel room late that afternoon she had won her round with the young upstart from canada in straight sets sixtwo sixlove there was little doubt that asher had played some of the finest tennis in her career in court one but she didnt think of that now her mind kept drifting back to her interlude with madge and from there back to her thoughts on learning of her own pregnancy would ty have wanted to take out fullpage ads or would he have cursed her like eric would he have accused her of deceit of trickery now that they were being given a second chance would he want marriage and children what was it jess had said that day she wondered ty will always be a gypsy and no woman should ever expect to hold him yet asher had expected to hold him and despite all her vows was beginning to expect it again her love was so huge so consuming that when she was with him it was simply impossible to conceive of doing without him and perhaps because she had once briefly carried his child inside her the need to do so again was overwhelming could a woman tame a comet she asked herself should she for thats what he was a star that flew full of speed and light he wasnt the prince at the end of the fairy tale who would calmly take up his kingdom and sit on a throne ty would always search for the next quest and the next woman asher wondered recalling jesss words again shaking her head she told herself to think of today today they were together only a woman who had lived through change after change hurt after hurt could fully appreciate the perfection of a moment others might not recognize it but asher did and the moment was hers she unlocked the door to their suite and was immediately disappointed he wasnt there even had he been sleeping in the other room she would have sensed him the air was never still when ty was around tossing her bag aside she wandered to the window the light was still full as the sun had only just began to set perhaps they would go out and explore melbourne find one of the tiny little clubs with loud music and laughter shed like to dance twirling in a circle asher laughed yes she would like to dance to celebrate for madge and for herself she was with the man she loved a bath she decided a long luxurious bath before she changed into something cool and sexy when she opened the door to the bedroom asher stopped and stared in astonishment balloons red yellow blue pink and white they floated throughout the room in a jamboree of color heliumfilled they rose to the ceiling trailing long ribbons there were dozens of them round oval thin and fat it was as if a circus had passed hurriedly through leaving a few souvenirs grasping a ribbon asher drew one down to her while she continued to stare they were three layers deep she saw in astonishment at least a hundred of them bumping against one another her laughter came out in a quick burst that went on and on who else would think of it who else would take the time not flowers or jewelry for ty starbuck at that moment she could have floated to the ceiling to join the gift he had given her hi she turned to see him lounging in the doorway in a flash asher had launched herself into his arms the single balloon still grasped in her hand oh youre crazy she cried before she found his lips with hers with her arms wrapped around his neck her legs around his waist she kissed him again and again absolutely insane me he countered youre the one standing here surrounded by balloons its the best surprise ive ever had better than roses in the bathtub tossing her head back she laughed even better than that i thought about diamonds but they didnt seem like as much fun as he spoke he moved towards the bed and they dont float asher put in looking up at the ceiling of colorful shapes good point ty conceded as they fell together onto the bed got any ideas how we should spend the evening one or two asher murmured the balloon she held drifted up to join the others lets do both he stopped her laugh with a soft kiss that became hungry quickly oh god ive waited all day to be alone with you when the seasons over well find someplace an island another planet anyplace where theres no one but us anyplace she whispered in agreement while her hands tugged at his shirt passion soared swiftly tys needs doubled as he sensed hers she was always soft always eager for him if the pounding of his blood would have allowed he would have revered her but the force of their joined desire wouldnt permit reverence clothes were hastily peeled away a blouse flung aside a shirt cast to the floor overhead the balloons danced while they savored each other the scent of victory seemed to cling to both of them mixed with the faint fragrance of soap and shampoo from the postgame showers her lips tasted warm and moist and somehow of himself as much as of her when there was nothing to separate them they tangled together their bodies hot and throbbing with questing hands he moved over territory only more exciting in its familiarity he could feel reason spin away into pure sensation soft here firm there her body was endless delight the warmth of her breath along his skin could make him tremble her moan as he slipped his fingers into her made him ache with openmouthed kisses he trailed over her seeking the hot heady flavor of her flesh it seemed to melt into him filling him to bursting when she arched offering everything ty felt a surge of power so awesome he almost feared to take her too strong he thought hazily he was too strong and was bound to hurt her he felt he could have lifted the world without effort yet she was drawing him to her with murmuring pleas there was no control in madness she stole his sanity with her smooth skin and soft lips there were no more pastel colors from frivolous balloons now there was gleaming silver and molten reds and pulsing blacks whirling and churning into a wild kaleidoscope that seemed to pull him into its vortex gasping her name ty thrust into her the colors shattered seeming to pierce his skin with a multitude of shards and in the pain was indescribable pleasure when he was spent nestled between her breasts asher gazed up at the darkening ceiling how could it be she wondered that each time they were together it was different sometimes they loved in laughter sometimes in tenderness at other times with a smoldering passion this time there had been a taste of madness in their loving did other lovers find this infinite variety this insatiable delight in each other perhaps the two of them were unique the thought was almost frightening what are you thinking ty asked he knew he should shift his weight from her but found no energy to do so i was wondering if it should be so special each time im with you he laughed kissing the side of her breast of course it should im a special person dont you read the sports section she tugged his hair but tenderly dont let your press go to your head starbuck you have to win a few more matches before you wrap up the grand slam he massaged the muscles of her thigh so do you face im only thinking as far ahead as the next game she said she didnt want to think of forest hills or the states or the end of the season madge is pregnant she said half to herself what like a shot tys head came up madge is pregnant asher repeated she wants to keep it quiet until the australian open is over id be damned he exclaimed old madge shes only a year older than you asher stated defensively causing him to laugh again its an expression love absently he twined one of ashers curls around a finger how does she feel about it shes thrilled and scared her lashes lowered shielding her expression a moment shes going to retire were going to have to throw her one hell of a party rolling onto his back he drew asher close to his side after a moment she moistened her lips and spoke casually do you ever think about children i mean it would be difficult wouldnt it combining a family with a profession like this its done all the time depends on how you go about it yes but all the traveling the pressure he started to pass it off then remembered how she had lived her childhood though he had never sensed any resentment in her he wondered if she felt a family would be a hindrance to her career physically a baby would prevent her from playing for some time and shed already lost three years he reflected with an inner sigh ty pushed the idea of their children out of his mind there was time after all i imagine its a hassle to worry about kids when youve got a tournament to think of he said lightly a players got enough trouble keeping track of his rackets with a murmured agreement asher stared into space in the thin light of dawn she shifted brushing at a tickle on her arm something brushed over her cheek annoyed asher lifted her hand to knock it away it came back with a softly uttered complaint she opened her eyes in the gray light she could see dozens of shapes some hung halfway to the ceiling others littered the bed and floor sleepy she stared at them without comprehension irritated at having been disturbed she knocked at the shape that rested on her hip it floated lazily away balloons she realized turning her head she saw that ty was all but buried under them she chuckled muffling the sound with her hand as she sat up he lay flat on his stomach facedown in the pillow she plucked a red balloon from the back of his head he didnt budge leaning over she outlined his ear with kisses he muttered and stirred and shifted away asher lifted a brow a challenge she decided after brushing the hair from the nape of his neck she began to nibble on the exposed flesh ty she whispered we have company feeling a prickle of drowsy pleasure ty rolled to his side reaching for her asher placed a balloon in his hand unfocused his eyes opened what the hell is this were surrounded asher told him in a whisper theyre everywhere a half dozen balloons tipped to the floor as he shifted to his back after rubbing his face with his hands he stared good god with that he shut his eyes again not to be discouraged asher straddled him ty its morning uhuh i have that talk show to do at nine he yawned and patted her bottom good luck she planted a soft nibbling kiss on his lips i have two hours before i have to leave s okay you wont bother me wanna bet she asked silently reaching out she trailed her fingers up his thigh maybe ill sleep a bit longer mmmhmm slowly she lay on top of him nuzzling her lips at her throat im not bothering you am i hmm she snuggled closer feeling her breasts rub against his soft mat of hair cold she mumbled and moved her thigh against his turn down the air conditioning ty suggested brows lowered asher lifted her head tys eyes met hers laughing and not a bit sleepy with a toss of her head asher rolled from him and tugged on the blanket though her back was to him she could all but see his grin hows this wrapping an arm around her waist he fit his body to hers she gave him a shrug as an answer warmer he asked as he slid his hand up to cup her breast the point was already taut her pulse already racing ty moved sinuously against her the air conditionings too high she said plaintively im freezing ty dropped a kiss at the base of her neck ill get it he rose moving to the unit it shut off with a dull mechanical thud with a teasing remark on the tip of his tongue he turned in the fragile morning light she lay naked in the tumbled bed surrounded by gay balloons her hair rioted around a face dominated by dark sleepy eyes the faintest of smiles touched her lips knowing inviting challenging all thoughts of joking left him her skin was so smooth and touched with gold like a fist in the solar plexus desire struck him and stole his breath as he went to her asher lifted her arms to welcome him chapter ten contents prev next asher how does it feel being only three matches away from the grand slam im trying not to think about it youve drawn stacie kingston in the quarterfinals shes got an ohforfive record against you does that boost your confidence stacies a strong player and very tough id never go into a match with her overconfident her hands folded loosely asher sat behind the table facing the lights and reporters the microphone in front of her picked up her calm steady voice and carried it to the rear of the room she wore her old team tennis jacket with loose warmup pants and court shoes around her face her hair curled damply theyd barely given her time to shower after her most recent win at forest hills before scheduling the impromptu press conference the cameras were rolling taping her every movement recording every expression one of the print reporters quickly scribbled down that she wore no jewelry or lipstick did you expect your comeback to be this successful asher gave a lightningfast grin here then gone something she would never have done for the press even two months before i trained hard she said simply do you still lift weights every day have you changed your style this tune around i think ive tightened a few things up she relaxed considering of all the people in the room only asher was aware that her outlook toward the press had changed there was no tightness in her throat as she spoke no warning signals to take care flashing in her brain improved my serve particularly she continued my percentage of aces and service winners is much higher than it was three or four years ago how often did you play during your retirement not often enough will your father be coaching you again her hesitation was almost too brief to be measured not officially she replied evasively have you decided to accept the offer of a layout in elegance magazine asher tucked a lock of hair behind her ear news travels fast laughter scattered around the room i havent really decided she continued at the moment im more concerned with the us open who do you pick to be your opponent in the finals id like to get through the quarters and semis first lets say who do you think will be your strongest competition tia conway asher answered immediately their duel in kooyong was still fresh in her mind three exhausting sets three tie breakers in two grueling hours shes the best allaround woman player today what makes you say that tia has court sense speed strength and a big serve yet youve beaten her consistently this season but not easily what about the mens competition would you predict the us will have two grand slam winners this year asher fielded the question first with a smile i think someone mentioned that there were still three matches to go but i believe its safe to say that if starbuck continues to play as hes played all season no one will beat him particularly on grass as its his best surface is your opinion influenced by personal feelings statistics dont have any feelings she countered personal or otherwise asher rose effectively curtailing further questioning a few more were tossed out at random but she merely leaned toward the mike and apologized for having to end the meeting as she started to slip through a rear door she spotted chuck nicely done face and over she breathed what are you doing here keeping an eye on my best friends lady he said glibly as he slipped an arm around her shoulders ty thought it would be less confusing if he kept out of the way during your little teteatete with the members of the working press for heavens sake asher mumbled i dont need a keeper dont tell me chuck flashed his boynextdoor smile ty had it in his head the press might badger you tilting her head asher studied his deceptively sweet face and what were you going to do if they had strongarm em he claimed while flexing his muscle though i might have been tempted to let them take a few bites out of you after that comment about nobody beating ty didnt you hear they were naming a racket after me asher circled his waist with her arm sorry friend i call em like i see em stopping he put both hands on ashers shoulders and studied her his look remained serious even when she gave him a quizzical smile you know face you really look good she laughed well thanks i think did i look bad before i dont mean you look beautiful that never changes i mean you look happy lifting a hand to the one on her shoulder asher squeezed i am happy it shows in ty too briefly he hesitated then plunged ahead listen i dont know what happened between you two before but chuck asher shook her head to ward off questions but he continued i want you to know i hope you make it this time oh chuck shutting her eyes she went into his arms so do i she sighed so do i i asked you to keep an eye on her ty said from behind them i didnt say anything about touching oh hell chuck tightened his hold dont be so selfish secondseeds need love too glancing down at asher he grinned can i interest you in lobster tails and champagne sorry she kissed his nose somebody already offered me pizza and cheap wine outclassed again with a sigh chuck released her i need somebody to hit with tomorrow he told ty okay six oclock court three you buy the coffee well flip for it chuck countered before he sauntered away alone asher and ty stood for a moment in awkward silence while an airplane droned by overhead the awkwardness had cropped up occasionally on their return to the states it was always brief and never commented on in the few seconds without words each of them admitted that full truths would soon be necessary neither of them knew how to approach it so ty began as the moment passed how did it go easily asher returned smiling as she stood on tiptoe to kiss him i didnt need the bodyguard i know how you feel about press conferences how oh he combed her hair with his fingers terrifieds a good word with a laugh she held out her hand as they started to walk was a good word asher corrected him im amazed i ever let it get to me there was one problem though what i was afraid id faint from starvation she sent him a pitiful look from under her lashes someone did mention pizza didnt they yeah he grinned catching her close and cheap wine you really know how to treat a woman starbuck asher told him in a breathless whisper well go dutch he added before he pulled her toward the car twenty minutes later they sat together at a tiny round table there was the scent of rich sauce spice and melted candles from the jukebox in the corner poured an endless succession of popular rock tunes at a volume just below blaring the waitresses wore bib aprons sporting pictures of grinning pizzas leaning her elbows on the scarred wooden table asher stared soulfully into tys eyes you know how to pick a class joint dont you stick with me face he advised ive got a hamburger palace picked out for tomorrow you get your own individual plastic packs of catsup her lips curved up making him want to taste them leaning forward he did the table tilted dangerously you two ready to order snapping her wad of gum the waitress shifted her weight to one hip pizza and a bottle of chianti ty told her kissing asher again small medium or large small medium or large what pizza the waitress said with exaggerated patience medium ought to do it twisting his head ty sent the waitress a smile that had her pulling back her shoulders thanks well that should improve the service asher considered as she watched the woman saunter away whats that asher studied his laughing eyes never mind she decided your ego doesnt need any oiling ty bent his head closer to hers as a defense against the jukebox so what kind of questions did they toss at you the usual they mentioned the business from elegance are you going to do it she moved her shoulders i dont know it might be fun and i dont suppose it would hurt the image of womens tennis for one of the players to be in a national fashion magazine its been done before asher conquered a grin and arched her brows instead do you read fashion magazines starbuck sure i like to look at pretty women i always thought jocks tended to favor other sorts of magazines for that he gave her an innocent look what sorts of magazines ignoring him asher went back to his original question theyre playing up this grand slam business for all its worth bother you as he laced their fingers together he studied them there was an almost stunning difference in size and texture often hed wondered how such an elegant little hand could be so strong and why it should fit so perfectly with his a bit asher admitted enjoying the rough feel of his skin against hers it makes it difficult to go into a match thinking of just that match what about you i know youre getting the same kind of pressure the waitress brought the wine giving ty a slow smile as she set down the glasses to ashers amusement he returned it hes a devil she thought and he knows it i always look at playing a game at a time one point at a time he poured a generous amount of wine in both glasses three matches is a hell of a lot of points but youd like to win the grand slam raising his glass he grinned damn right he laughed into her eyes as he drank of course martins already making book on it im surprised hes not here asher commented analyzing every volley hes coming in tomorrow with the rest of the family ashers fingers tightened on the stem of her glass the rest of the family yeah mom and jess for sure mac and pete if it can be arranged the chianti was heavy and mellow ty relaxed with it youll like pete hes a cute kid she mumbled something into her wine before she swallowed martin had been there three years ago along with tys mother and sister both she and ty had gone into the us open as top seeds both had been hounded by the press the two of them had shared meals then too and a bed so much was the same terrifyingly so but there had been so much in between thered been no small boy with tys coloring then no small boy with that air of perpetual energy to remind her of what was lost asher felt the emptiness inside her then the ache as she did each tune she thought of the child misinterpreting her silence ty reached over to take her hand asher you still havent spoken to your father what disoriented she stared at him a moment no no not since not since i retired why dont you call him i cant thats ridiculous hes your father she sighed wishing it were so simple ty you know him hes a very stringent man very certain of whats right and whats wrong when i left tennis i did more than disappoint him i wasted what hed given me ty answered with a short explicit word that made her smile from his viewpoint thats the way it was she went on as jim wolfes daughter i had certain responsibilities in marrying eric and giving up my career i shirked them he hasnt forgiven me how do you know that he demanded his voice was low under the insistent music but rich with annoyance if you havent spoken to him how can you be sure how he feels now ty if his feelings had changed wouldnt he be here she shrugged wishing they could have avoided the subject for a while longer i thought at first that when i started playing again it might make the difference it hasnt but you miss him even that wasnt so simple to ty family meant something warm and loving and eternal hed never understand that asher looked not so much now for her fathers presence or even his love but simply his forgiveness id like him to be here she said finally but i understand his reasons for not coming her brow clouded for a moment with a realization that had just come to her before i played for him to please him to justify the time and effort he put into my career now i play for myself and you play better ty put in perhaps thats one of the reasons with a smile she lifted his hand to her lips perhaps thats one of them heres your pizza the waitress plopped the steaming pan between them they ate amid noise and their own casual chatter even the pressure of the upcoming matches had no effect on ashers mood the cheese was hot and stringy making ty laugh as she struggled against it the contents of the squat bottle of chianti lowered as they drank leisurely content to let the meal drag on tennis was forgotten while they spoke of everything and nothing at all a group of teenagers poured in laughing and rowdy to feed another succession of quarters into the jukebox why am i so happy to be in this loud crowded room she wondered the cooling pizza and lukewarm wine were as appealing as the champagne and caviar they had shared in paris it was ty the place never mattered when she was with him abruptly it occurred to asher that it was herself as well she was being herself there werent any guards or the need for any ty was the only man shed ever been close to who required none from her her father had wanted her to be perfect his glass princess all through her youth she had done everything in her power to please him with eric she had been expected to be the cool wellmannered lady wickerton a woman who could discuss art and politics intelligently she was to have been like crystal manyfaceted elegant and cold all ty had ever expected her to be was asher he accepted her flaws even admired them because he had wanted her to be herself shed been able to be just that not once in all the time she had known him had he ever demanded that she fit a pattern or requested that she conform to any standards but her own impulsively she reached over to take his hand then pressed it to her cheek there was warmth against warmth flesh against flesh whats this for he asked allowing his fingers to spread for not wanting glass his brows drew together in confusion am i supposed to know what that means no laughing asher leaned closer have you drunk enough wine that your resistance is down and youll be easily seduced a slow smile spread more than enough then come with me asher ordered it was late when ty lay sleepless beside asher curled close her hand caught loosely in his she slept deeply drugged with loving and fatigue her scent hung in the air so that even in the dark ty could visualize her a small alarm clock ticked monotonously at his left its luminous dial glowing twelve twentyseven his mind was far too active for sleep he sensed as he knew asher did that the idyll was nearly over they were back where they had once ended and questions would not be put off too much longer impatience gnawed at him unlike asher ty looked for the end of the season only then would the time be right for answers and explanations he was not used to biding his time and the strain was beginning to tell even tonight under the laughter he had understood her wordless request that he not probe the question of her father ty mused shifting the pillow to brace his back she was more unhappy about the estrangement than she admitted it showed in her eyes it was incomprehensible to him that members of a family could turn away from one another his thoughts drifted to his mother to jess there was nothing either of them could do he wouldnt forgive hed never be able to bear the thought of being responsible for their unhappiness could a father feel any different about a daughter an only daughter a muchloved daughter ty reflected he could remember jim wolfes pride in asher ty had often sat beside him during one of ashers matches in her early days as a pro then consistently during her last year even in such a private man the adoration had showed it wasnt possible to believe it had been only for the athlete and not for the woman surprisingly jim had accepted tys relationship with his daughter no ty corrected approved hed seemed to enjoy seeing them together once ty recalled he had gone as far as outlining his expectations to ty of their future at the time ty had been both amused and annoyed at the fatherly interference what plans he had had for a future with asher had still been vague then when they had crystallized in his mind it had been too late frowning ty glanced down at her in the pale shaft of moonlight her face seemed very fragile her hair was a silvery insubstantial cloud around it a wave of longing swamped him so that he had to fight the need to wake her and satisfy himself that she was there for him his feelings for her had always been mixed wild desire unbearable tenderness traces of fear there had been no other woman who had ever brought him such sharp and conflicting emotions watching her sleep he felt the need to protect there should be no shadow of unhappiness in her eyes when they opened how many obstacles would they have to overcome before they were really together he wondered there was one he might remove himself perhaps the time had come to take the first step on impulse ty slipped from the bed and into the sitting room it took only moments by phone to travel from coast to coast dropping into a chair ty listened to the faint crackling on the wire before it began to ring wolfe residence in the two words ty recognized the trained voice of a servant jim wolfe please its ty starbuck one moment please ty sat back keeping one ear trained on the adjoining bedroom he heard two distinct clicks as one extension was lifted and the other replaced starbuck the quiet cautious voice was instantly recognizable jim how are you well a bit surprised by the late night call jim wolfe settled behind his desk ive been reading quite a bit about you its been a good year you were missed at wimbledon that makes five for you there and three for asher he returned pointedly there was a moment of complete silence your slice volleys cleaner than it once was jim i called to talk about asher then we have nothing to say for a moment the cool calm statement left ty speechless in a flood fury took over just a damn minute i have plenty to say your daughters battled her way back to the top shes done it without you im aware of that do you have a point yes i have a point ty retorted ive never seen anyone work as hard as she has these past few months and it hasnt been easy dealing with the pressure the press the constant questions on why her father isnt in the stands while she wins championship after championship asher knows my feelings jim said flatly theyre no concern of yours whatever concerns asher concerns me so jim picked up a slim gold pen from the desk and carefully examined it were back to that yes we are if youve decided to resume your relationship with asher its your business ty he flung the pen back onto the desk and its my business if i dont for gods sake jim ty began heatedly shes your daughter you cant turn your back on your own child like father like daughter jim murmured what the hell does that mean frustrated ty rose to pace dragging the phone with him asher wiped her child out of existence ive done the same all movement stopped ty felt something freeze in him as his knuckles turned white on the receiver what child she turned her back on everything i taught her jim went on not hearing tys harshly whispered question the daughter i knew couldnt have done it the words and the anger that accompanied them had been held in for years now they came bursting out i tried to understand why she married that pale excuse for a man even tried to resign myself to her throwing away her career but some things i wont forgive if the life she chose to live was worth the price of my grandchild shes welcome to it enraged at letting his feelings pour out so openly jim slammed down the receiver three thousand miles away ty stood staring at nothing with infinite care he placed the phone back on the table too many thoughts were whirling in his head too many questions and halfanswers he had to think to take his time silently he walked back into the bedroom and dressed he wanted to shake her awake and demand an explanation he wanted to wait until he had a grip on himself torn ty sat on a chair and stared at the still form in the bed asher slept so peacefully her quiet breathing hardly stirred the air a child ashers child but there was no child ty reasoned if lord and lady wickerton had produced an offspring there would have been some mention of it in the press an heir was never kept secret dragging a hand through his hair ty shifted besides he reasoned if asher had had a child where was it struggling to overcome the jealousy at imagining ashers bearing another mans child ty went over his conversation with jim wolfe again asher wiped her child out of existence his fingers tightened on the arms of the chair as he stared at her sleeping form abortion without warning a storm of emotion took over that he had to systematically fight back until his pulse leveled all attempts to think of the word with an open mind were futile he couldnt rationalize it not when it was asher not when the child was part of her could the woman he thought he knew have made that kind of choice for what purpose was it possible that the social life she had sought had been more important than as bitterness filled him ty shook his head he wouldnt believe it of her controlled yes there were times asher could be infuriatingly controlled but never calculating jim had been talking in riddles he decided thered never been a child there couldnt have been he watched asher stir with a soft murmur she shifted toward the emptiness beside her where ty should have been he sensed the moment she woke the moonlight gleamed on her arm as she lifted it brushing her fingers at the hair that curled around her face she placed her hand on his pillow as if testing it for warmth not trusting himself he said nothing if only she would go back to sleep until he had resolved his feelings he could still taste the bitterness at the back of his throat but she wouldnt sleep although groggy asher sensed tension in the air tys emotions were always volatile enough to be felt tangibly somethings wrong somethings wrong hammered in her brain ty she called again and a hint of fear touched the word asher had struggled to a sitting position before she saw him the moonlight was enough to allow her to see that his eyes were dark and fixed on her face it was also enough to let her see that they were cold her pulse began to race couldnt you sleep she asked struggling to convince herself it was all her imagination no asher laced her fingers together as she swallowed you should have woke me why we we could have talked could we cold anger filled him we can talk as long as i dont ask any questions you dont want to answer shed been expecting the showdown but not like this his resentment was already wrapping around her still he had a right and shed put him off too long ty if its answers you want ill give them to you just like that he snapped rising just ask and youll answer nothing more to hide asher stung by his tone she stared up at him it wasnt a matter of hiding ty not really i needed time we needed time why was that asher he asked in a tone that was uncharacteristically cool she felt a shudder zip down her spine why was time so important there were things i wasnt sure youd understand like the baby if he had slapped her asher couldnt have been more stunned even in the moonlight he could see her face go white her eyes grew huge and dark and desperate how the words wouldnt form though they raced around in her mind asher seemed incapable of forcing any through her lips how had he found out who had told him how long had he known eric she managed though the name threatened to strangle her eric told you sharp disappointment cut through him somehow he had hoped it hadnt been true that she had conceived and rejected another mans child so its true he exclaimed turning from her ty stared through the window at the darkness he found he couldnt be logical or objective it was one thing to understand the concept of freedom of choice and another to apply it to asher ty i she tried to speak all of her worst fears were hurtling down on her the gulf between them was already tangible and threatening to widen if only she had been able to tell him in her own way in her own time ty i wanted to tell you myself there were reasons why i didnt at first and then asher shut her eyes then i made excuses i suppose you thought it was none of my business her eyes flew open again how can you say that what you do with your life when youre married to one man isnt the concern of another even when he loves you simultaneous flashes of pain and joy rushed through her you didnt she whispered didnt what you didnt love me he gave a brief laugh but didnt turn back to her no of course i didnt thats why i couldnt stay away from you thats why i thought of you ever every moment asher pressed the heel of her hand between her eyes why now she thought wildly why is it all happening now you never told me this time he turned yes i did furiously she shook her head you never said it not once even once would have been enough in concentration his brows drew together she was right he decided hed never said the words hed shown her in every way he knew how but hed never said the words neither did you he blurted speaking his thoughts she let out a breath that was perilously close to a sob i was afraid to damn it asher so was i for a long tense moment they stared at each other had she been that blind had she need words so badly that she hadnt seen what hed been giving her the words would never have come easily to him because they meant everything for ty a declaration of love wasnt a casual phrase but a declaration of self asher swallowed a tremor wanting her voice to be strong i love you ty ive always loved you and im still afraid as she held out a hand he glanced down at it but made no move to accept it dont turn away from me now she thought of the child she had lost please dont hate me for what i did he couldnt understand but he could feel it seemed love for her justified anything crossing to her ty took the offered hand and brought it to his lips itll be better when weve talked this out we need to start clean asher yes she closed her hand over their joined ones i want that too oh ty im so sorry about the baby her free arm wrapped around his waist as she dropped her head on his chest the relief she thought the relief of at last being able to share it with him i couldnt tell you before when it happened i didnt know what to do i didnt know how youd feel i dont know either he answered i felt so guilty she shut her eyes tight when jess showed me that picture of your nephew i could almost see how the baby would have looked i always knew he would have had your hair your eyes mine for a moment nothing seemed to function his mind his heart his lungs then in a torrent everything came together mine asher gave an involuntary cry as he crushed her fingers in his before she could speak he had her by the shoulders digging into her flesh his eyes alone brought her icecold terror the baby was mine her mouth moved to form words but nothing came out confusion and fear overtook her but hed already known she thought desperately no no he hadnt erics baby her mind flashed hed thought it was erics baby answer me damn you he was shaking her now violently limp as a rag doll asher made no protest and sought no defense both would have been futile was it my baby was it mine she nodded too numb to feel the pain he wanted to strike her looking at her face ty could almost feel the sensation of his hand stinging against it and hed want to keep striking her until rage and grief could no longer be felt reading his thoughts in his eyes asher made no move to protect herself for an instant his fingers tightened on her arms with a violent oath he hurled her away hardly daring to breathe she lay on the bed and waited you bitch you had my child in you when you married him he flung the words at her struggling not to use his fists did he make you get rid of it when he found out or did you take care of it so you could play the lady without encumbrances she wasnt aware that her breathing was ragged or that she was trembling her mind was too numb to take in more than half of his words all she understood was the fury of his feelings i didnt know i didnt know i was pregnant when i married eric you had no right to keep this from me towering over her he reached down to yank her to her knees you had no right to make a decision like that when the child was mine ty shut up damn you he shoved her away knowing neither of them was safe if they remained together theres nothing you can say nothing that could make me even want to look at you again he strode from the room without a second glance the sound of the slamming door echoed over and over in ashers mind chapter eleven contents prev next ty took the quarterfinals in straight sets most said he played the finest tennis in his career on that hazy september afternoon ty knew he wasnt playing tennis he was waging war hed gone onto the court full of vengeance and fury almost pummeling his opponent with the ball his swing was vicious his aim deadly the violence showed in his face in the grim set of his mouth in the eyes that were nearly black with emotion it wasnt the winning or losing that mattered to him but the release of the physical aspect of the temper that hed barely controlled the night before when he struck he struck brutally always moving the motion itself was a threat hed often been called a warrior but the description had never been more true as if scenting blood he hounded his opponent then ground him mercilessly into the ground tys only disappointment was that the match didnt last longer there hadnt been enough time to sweat out all of his fury he wondered if there would ever be enough time in the stands there were differing reactions as he stalked off the courts name of god ada ive never seen the boy play better martin derick beamed like a new father his voice was hoarse from cheering and cigarettes a pile of butts lay crushed at his feet did you see how he massacred that italian yes ohho two matches more and our boys going to have a grand slam martin squeezed adas workworn hands between his two smooth ones nothings going to stop him now in her quiet steady way ada stared down at the court shed seen more than tys victory thered been fury in her sons eyes outrage hurt she recognized the combination too well shed seen it in a little boy whod been teased because his father had deserted him then hed used his fists to compensate today ada mused hed used a racket as martin recounted every serve and smash ada sat silently and wondered what had put that look back in her sons eyes mom jess leaned close so that her voice wouldnt carry somethings wrong with ty isnt it id say somethings very wrong with ty jess rubbed her cheek against petes wishing his powdery scent would calm her giggling he squirmed out of her arms and dove towards his father asher wasnt in the stands today ada lifted her eyes to her daughters jess had mentioned perhaps too casually that ty was seeing asher wolfe again ada had hardly needed the information once she had heard asher was competing again shed known what the results would be the only time she had ever seen ty truly devastated had been when asher had married the polished british lord his rage and threats had been expected but they turned to a brooding that had concerned her a great deal more yes i noticed ada replied then shes got a match of her own on the next court and not for a half hour jess cast another worried glance around at the people who filled the stands she should have been here since she wasnt there must be a reason a fresh tremor of unease ran up jesss back mom ive got to talk to you alone can we go get a cup of coffee without question ada rose you fellas keep pete entertained she ordered tousling her grandsons hair jess and ill be back in a few minutes youre going to tell her mac spoke softly as he touched his wifes hand yes yes i need to bouncing his son on his knee he watched them melt into the crowd after they had settled at a table ada waited for her daughter to begin she knew jess was marking time ordering coffee speculating on the chances of rain ada let her ramble an orderly eventempered woman she had learned the best way to deal with her emotional offsprings was to ride out the storm eventually jess stopped stirring her coffee and lifted her eyes to her mothers mom do you remember when we were here three years ago how could she forget ada thought with a sigh that was the year ty had won the us open then barely had time to savor it before the world had crumbled around his ears yes i remember asher left ty and married eric wickerton when ada remained silent jess lifted her coffee cup and drank as if to fortify herself it was my fault she blurted out ada took the time to taste her own coffee deciding it wasnt half bad for restaurant brew your fault jess how i went to see her in quick jerks jess began to shred her napkin shed thought it would be easier now that she had told mac everything but with her mothers gaze steady and patient on hers she felt like a child again i went to her hotel room when i knew ty wouldnt be there after pressing her lips together she let the confession come out in a burst i told her ty was tired of her i told her he he was bored im surprised she didnt laugh in your face ada commented quickly jess shook her head i was convincing she went on maybe because i was convinced it was the truth and i i was sympathetic remembering how well she had played the role of reluctant messenger tore at her oh god mom when i look back and remember the things i told her how i said them anguished her eyes met her mothers i told her ty thought she and eric were suited to each other there was enough truth in that but i turned it around to give her the impression that ty was hoping eric would take her off his hands and i defended ty telling asher hed never want to hurt her that he was really very concerned that shed gotten in over her head i i made it seem as though ty had asked my opinion on the best way to untangle himself from an affair he had no more interest in jess ada stopped the movement of her nervous daughters hands with her own why did you do such a thing ty wasnt happy id talked to him just the night before and he was so down so unsure of himself id never seen ty unsure of himself her fingers began to move restlessly under her mothers it seemed so clear to me that asher was wrong for him hurting him i was convinced i had to save him from being hurt more leaning back ada let her gaze drift the west side tennis club was respectfully dingy very american perhaps that was why shed always liked it it was noisy the long island rail road ran alongside competing with helicopters planes and road traffic ada had never completely gotten used to the relative quiet of suburbia after a lifetime in the inner city now she sat back absorbing the noise trying to think of the right words it occurred to her that parenting didnt stop when children became adults perhaps it never stopped at all ty loved asher jess i know jess stared down at the shredded paper napkin i didnt think he did i thought if hed loved her he would have been happy and if she had loved him she would have well she would have acted like all the other women who hung around him do you think ty would have loved her if she had been like all the other women jess flushed amazing herself and amusing her mother it was a bit disconcerting to think of the tiny whitehaired ada starbuck mother grandmother knowing about passion it wasnt until after i met mac that i realized love doesnt always make you smile and glow jess went on keeping her eyes lowered there are times when i was miserable and confused over my feelings for mac and i began to remember that last talk i had with ty before i went to see asher i realized how alike ty and i are how the stronger our feelings are the more moody we can become on a deep breath she met her mothers gaze levelly i tried to rationalize that asher wouldnt have left ty that she wouldnt have married eric if she had really cared and that if he had ty wouldnt have let her go pride can be just as strong as love the things you said to asher made her feel unwanted and betrayed i imagine that ty would have spoken to you about it if the situation had been reversed i would have scratched her eyes out and told her to go to hell adas laugh was a warm young sound yes you would then youd have gone to the man you loved and used your claws on him ashers different yes miserable jess pushed her untouched coffee aside ty always said so mom when they got back together i was so guilty and frightened then i was relieved and now i can tell somethings gone wrong again as she had as a child jess gave her mother a long pleading look what should i do strange ada mused that her children wanted to pamper her on one hand thrusting dishwashers and fancy jewelry on her while on the other they still looked to her for all the answers youll have to talk to both of them ada said briskly then youll have to back off and let the two of them work it out you might be able to heal what you did three years ago but you can do nothing about whats between them now if they love each other you made a decision for them once ada pointed out dont make the same mistake again she hadnt been able to sleep she hadnt been able to eat only the promise she had made to herself never to quit again forced asher onto the court purposely she remained in the dressing room until the last moment to avoid the fans who wandered the walkways and mingled with players it would take more effort than she could have summoned to smile and make small talk when she came outside the humidity hit her like a fist shaking off the weakness asher went directly to her chair she heard the applause but didnt acknowledge it she couldnt afford to even before she began asher knew her biggest problem would be concentration her arms ached her whole body ached and she felt bonedeep exhausted pain was something she could ignore once the match was under way but she wasnt sure she could ignore the jellied weakness inside her the feeling that someone had punched a yawning hole in the center of her life still wearing her warmup jacket she took a few experimental swings asher cursing the interruption she glanced over at chuck concern touched his eyes as he stepped toward her hey you dont look good are you sick im fine he studied the shadowed eyes and pale cheeks like hell if i come out on the court im well enough to play she returned exchanging one racket for another ive got to warm up baffled chuck watched her stalk onto the court it took only a moment of study to see that she wasnt in top form chuck moved away to find ty he was in the showers his eyes closed under the spray hed been curt and brief with the press and even briefer with his colleagues he wasnt in the mood for congratulations anger lay curled inside him undiminished by the physical demands he had placed on himself he needed more a sparring match a marathon run anything to pump the poison out of his system though he heard chuck call him ty remained silent and kept his eyes shut ty will you listen to me somethings wrong with asher taking his time ty stepped back so that the water beat on his chest slowly he opened his eyes so so astonished chuck gaped at him i said somethings wrong with asher i heard you she looks sick chuck continued certain that ty didnt comprehend i just saw her she shouldnt be playing today she looks awful ty fought the instinctive need to go to her he could remember vividly the scene the night before with a flick of the wrist he shut off the shower asher knows what shes doing she makes her own decisions too stunned to be angry chuck stared at him hed never seen ty look cold any more than hed ever seen asher look furious until today what the devils going on here he demanded i just told you your womans sick ty felt the tightening in his belly and ignored it shes not my woman grabbing a towel he secured it lightly around his waist after dragging a hand through his hair chuck followed ty into the locker room hed known since that morning when he and ty had practiced together that something was wrong accustomed to his friends mercurial moods he had dismissed it assuming ty and asher had had a lovers quarrel but no lovers quarrel would make ty indifferent to ashers health look if you two have had a fight thats no reason i said shes not my woman tys voice was deadly calm as he pulled on jeans fine chuck snapped then if the fields clear i might just try my luck he was slammed back against the lockers feet dangling as ty grabbed his shirt in both hands jerking him up coolly chuck looked into the stormy eyes not your woman friend he said softly tell that to somebody who doesnt know you breathing hard ty struggled against the need to strike back the hours of violent tennis hadnt drained the anger or the grief without a word he dropped chuck to his feet then snatched a shirt from his locker are you going out there chuck demanded somebody should stop her before she makes whatevers wrong with her worse you know damn well she isnt going to listen to me dont push me ty dragged the shirt over his head before he slammed the locker door this time chuck kept his silence he heard the tremor in tys voice and recognized that the emotion wasnt anger only once before had he seen his friend this torn apart it had been asher then as it was obviously asher now with warring loyalties he reached out okay you want to talk about it no clenching his fists ty fought to regain his control no just go on out keep an eye on her she was fighting and losing asher had used almost all her reserve of energy to take the first set to a tie breaker the ultimate loss had taken its emotional toll kingston was a crafty enough player to sense her opponents flagging stamina and capitalized on it precision was nothing without strength ashers strength was ebbing quickly the noise played havoc with her concentration already playing below par she needed the sound of the ball hitting the racket engines drowned it out denying her the sense of hearing on the brittle grass the ball jumped skidded and stopped top speed was necessary and she didnt have it unable to prevent himself ty came to the edge of the tunnel to watch immediately he could see that chuck hadnt exaggerated she was too pale too slow instinctively he took a step forward restraining himself was more difficult than going on but he stopped cursing her even as he cursed himself shed made her own choice she herself had cut off any right he had to influence her from where he stood he could hear her labored breathing see the strain she fought to keep from her face at the twinge of fresh pain he turned away from the court with a blind determination that was more nerves than power asher had taken the second set to threeall her face shone with sweat weakened asher knew that she would have to find a hole in kingstons game soon and have the wit and stamina to exploit it grit was a weapon but not weapon enough against power precision and cunning at double break point asher prepared to serve again if she could pull this one out shed have a chance if kingston broke her serve the match was as good as over concentrate concentrate she ordered herself as she gave the ball a few testing bounces she counted each one trying to calm herself tys furious accusing words hammered in her brain his face enraged and stricken floated in front of her eyes tossing the ball asher drove at it with her racket fault she shut her eyes and cursed control she ordered herself if she lost control now she lost everything as she took an extra moment the crowd began to hum in speculation come on face lets see what youre made of gritting her teeth asher put everything she had left into the serve the ace brought a roar of approval she wasnt beaten yet but her next serve was soft slapping it back to her kingston incited a hard punishing rally asher battled by instinct all reserve depleted her eyes her mind were fixed on the ball and the ball only dodging after a slice she skidded barely meeting it with her racket as she stumbled she went down to her knees crumbling into a ball of exhaustion and pain someones hands hooked under her armpits pulling her to her feet asher pushed them away blindly to stagger to her chair come on asher chuck toweled off her streaming face talking to her as she drew in ragged straining breaths come on babe youre not in any shape to be out here today ill help you inside no she shook off his hand no i wont forfeit rising she dropped the towel to the ground im going to finish helpless chuck watched her fight a losing battle asher slept for almost twentyfour hours straight her body recharged as she lay motionless in the bed she had shared so recently with ty the loss of the match and the grand slam meant little shed finished her pride was whole because she had refused to give up because she had managed to face the reporters after the match and give them a calm accounting when they had speculated on the state of her health shed told them shed been fit to play she would give no excuses for losing if there was blame it lay within herself that was the primary rule of the game on returning to her room asher only took time to strip to her underwear before falling exhausted onto the bed sleep came immediately hours later she didnt hear the door open or tys footsteps as he crossed to the bedroom to look at her asher lay flat on her stomach across the spread something he knew she did only when absolutely depleted her breathing was deep a heavy sound of fatigue the hands he had thrust in his pockets balled into fists his emotions were pulling in too many directions she shouldnt be allowed to do this to him he thought furiously she shouldnt make him want to hurt and protect at the same time walking to the window he remained silent for a quarter of an hour listening to her breathe before he left her ty drew the drapes closed so that the sunlight wouldnt disturb her when asher awoke a full day had passed the aches made themselves known keeping her mind a blank she ran a hot tub as the water lapped over her she slipped into a half doze asher heard the knock on the door and ignored it the phone rang but she didnt open her eyes disturbed jess replaced the receiver after ten full rings where could asher be she wondered she knew asher was still registered at the hotel but she hadnt answered the phone or the door in more than a day shed tried to tell ty but he simply wouldnt listen any more than hed listened to her attempts at confession her conscience plagued her she hadnt tried hard enough jess berated herself shed been so afraid of losing tys love she had allowed him to brush her off when she tried to talk to him well no more she determined checking her watch jess calculated that ty would be preparing for the days match she cursed then fretted then made herself a promise when it was over win or lose she was going to corner her brother and make him listen until shed told him everything now that the vow had been made jess discovered that the waiting wasnt easy in the stands she marked time ty played with the same fierce anger she had observed in his quarterfinal match it was just as effective beneath her pride in him was the constant thought that her brother might turn away from her after hed heard her out but jess sat patiently through the match and through the press conference shed left it to her mother to persuade martin to go back to the hotel instead of dragging ty off for a replay of the match like a tennis groupie jess waited for ty to emerge from the locker room then pounced ty i need to talk to you im talked out jess he patted her hand then removed it from his arm i want to get out of here before the next sportswriter latches onto me fine ill drive youll listen look jess now ty annoyed ty stalked to the car for the first time in his life he wished his family hadnt come hed managed to avoid them for the most part using fatigue or practice as excuses his mother knew him too well and her silence questioned him constantly martin was ecstatic wanting to analyze every volley and shower praise and the hardest of all was watching pete darting here and there babbling laughing reminding ty of something that might have been look jess im tired just get in she interrupted tersely ive already put this off for too long they slammed their doors simultaneously not a very auspicious start she mused as she merged with traffic but shed never finish if she didnt begin okay ive got some things to tell you and id like you to hear me out before you say anything unless i want to hitch a damn ride back i dont have much choice do i she sent him a worried look dont hate me ty oh come on jess ashamed of wishing her away he gave her hair a quick tousle i might be mad at being shanghaied but im not going to hate you just listen she started staring straight ahead she began at first ty paid little attention she was hopping back to the summer he had first been with asher he started once to interrupt not wanting to be reminded jess shook her head fiercely and silenced him with strained patience ty sat back and watched the passing scenery when jess told him that she had gone to see asher his brows lowered his concentration focused listening to her pouring out the things she had said tys tired of you he doesnt know exactly how to end things without hurting you his rage built swiftly jess felt the fury swirling and barely paused for breath she seemed to have no reaction to anything i said she was very cool totally in control of herself it just seemed to reinforce what i thought of her stopping for a light jess swallowed quickly i didnt understand how anyone could have strong feelings and not express them not then after i met mac i realized when the light changed she gunned the motor with a jerk of her foot then stalled the engine on a frustrated oath she started the car again as ty remained silent when i looked back on it jess continued after a shaky breath i remember how pale she got how quiet it wasnt indifference but shock she listened to everything i said never raising her voice or shedding a tear i must have hurt her terribly her voice broke and she waited for him to speak but there was nothing but thick vibrant silence i had no right ty jess continued quickly i know that i wanted i wanted to help to pay you back somehow for everything youd done for me at the time i thought i was telling her the things you couldnt bring yourself to id convinced myself oh i dont know jess made a quick gesture with her hand before she gripped the gear shift maybe i was even jealous but i didnt think you loved her and i was so sure she didnt love you especially when she married so quickly because tears were forming she pulled over to the side of the road ty to tell you im sorry isnt enough but i dont have anything else the silence in the car vibrated for the space of three heartbeats what made you think you could play god with my life ty demanded in a sudden burst that had her jolting who the hell put you in charge forcing herself to meet his eyes jess spoke quietly theres nothing you can say to me i havent said to myself but youre entitled do you have any idea what you did to my life she shuddered involuntarily yes i was going to ask asher to marry me that night the night i got back and found you in our room the night you told me shed gone off with wickerton oh god ty choking back a sob jess laid her head on the steering wheel i never thought i never realized she meant that much to you she was everything i wanted dont you understand everything i was half crazy because i wasnt sure shed say yes he drummed his fist against the dash and god im still not sure ill never be sure the anguish in his voice made jess straighten ty if youd go see her if youd no he thought again of the child his child there are other reasons now ill go jess began i can no the word whipped out at her causing jess to swallow the rest of the sentence stay away from her all right she agreed unsteadily if thats the way you want it thats the way i want it you still love her jess asked ty turned his head so that his eyes met his sisters yes i love her that isnt always enough jess i dont think id ever be able to forget forget she prompted when he trailed off forget what something she took from me angry energy built up again grinding at his nerves ive got to walk ty jess stopped him with a tentative hand on the arm as he jerked open the door of the car do you want me to go away back to california i can make up an excuse even leave pete and mac here for the rest of the tournament i wont stay for the finals if it upsets you do what you want he told her shortly he started to slam the door of the car when he caught the look in her eyes hed protected her all of his life too long to change now love was rooted in him its history jess he said in calmer tones past history forget it turning ty walked away hoping hed be able to believe his own words chapter twelve contents prev asher sat on the bed to watch the mens singles championship the television commentary barely penetrated as she judged and dissected each stroke and volley for herself she couldnt go to the stadium but nothing would prevent her from watching ty compete on the closeups she studied his face carefully yes some strain showed she noted but his concentration was complete his energy was as volatile as ever perhaps more so for that she could be grateful each time they replayed a shot in slow motion asher could fully appreciate the beauty of his form muscles rippled as he stretched feet left the turf in a leap for more power he was a raw athlete with anger simmering just under the discipline the graphite racket was no more than an extension of the arm that was whipping the ball harder and harder as always his hair flew around the sweatband dramatic and unruly his eyes were dark with a rage barely contained was it the game that drove him she wondered the insatiable thirst to win or were there other emotions pushing him this time if there were it was easy to see that they added to the impetus he was an explosion heating up a storm rumbling just overhead asher knew him well enough to recognize that his control balanced on a very thin edge but it made his game all the more exciting his topspin drove to chucks backhand and was returned power for power a slice a lob an overhead turned the wrong way chuck pivoted sprinted but had no chance to return the call was late judging tys ball long his head whipped around to the judge his eyes deadly asher shuddered when the camera zoomed in so that the undisguised fury seemed aimed directly at her for a moment they seemed to stare into each others eyes disgust warred with temper before he turned to resume his receiving stance crouched like a cat his eyes intense he waited asher let out an unsteady breath ty was judging the bounce with uncanny accuracy if it threatened to die he was under it when it chose to soar he got behind it with unrelenting challenge he charged the net he baited chuck dared him and time after time outwitted him his game was all aggression and power starbuck at his best she thought with undiminished pride he could demoralize even a seasoned pro like chuck with a lightningfast return that lifted chalk from the service line with each swing she could hear the grunt of exertion and the swish of air how she wanted to be there he wouldnt want her she wouldnt soon forget that look of rage and disgust he had turned on her too much like the one his video image had projected a man like starbuck had no ambivalent emotions it was love or hate shed felt them both shed been cut out of his life she had to accept that she had to quit asher asked herself suddenly her chin rose was that what she was doing again she looked back at the screen as the camera zoomed in on tys face his eyes were opaque and dangerous before he went into a full stretch for his serve the force of her feelings attacked her she loved and wanted and needed no damn it rising asher cursed him no if she was going to lose she was going down fighting just as she had on the courts he wouldnt brush her out of his life so easily this time briefly shed forgotten that she no longer aimed her actions at pleasing those around her perhaps he didnt want to see her but that was just too bad he would see her and he would listen just as she snapped off the set a knock sounded on her door battling impatience asher went to answer her expression changed from grim determination to wonder dad asher jim met her stunned expression with an unsmiling nod may i come in he hadnt changed she thought wildly he hadnt changed at all he was still tall and tanned and silveryblond he was still her father her eyes filled with love and tears oh dad im so glad to see you grasping his hand she drew him into the room then the awkwardness set in sit down please while gesturing to a chair asher sought something to fill the gap shall i order up something to drink some coffee no he sat as she suggested and looked at his daughter she was thinner he noted and nervous as nervous as he was himself since tys phone call hed done little but think of her asher he began then sighed please sit down he waited until she settled across from him i want to tell you im proud of the way youve played this season his voice was stiff but she expected little else thank you im most proud of the last match you played asher gave him a small smile how typical that it was tennis he spoke of first i lost you played he countered right down to the last point you played i wonder how many people who watched knew that you were ill i wasnt ill asher corrected him automatically if i came on court then you were fit he finished before he shook his head i drummed that into you well didnt i a matter of pride and sportsmanship she said quietly giving him back the words he had given her again and again during her training jim lapsed into silence frowning at the elegant hands that lay folded in her lap shed always been his princess he thought his beautiful golden princess hed wanted to give her the world and hed wanted her to deserve it i didnt intend to come here to see you if the statement hurt she gave no sign what changed your mind a couple of things most particularly your last match rising asher walked to the window so i had to lose to have you speak to me again the words came easily as did the light trace of bitterness though love had remained constant she found no need to give him unvarnished adulation any longer all those years i needed you so badly i waited hoping youd forgive me it was a hard thing to forgive asher he rose too realizing his daughter had grown stronger he wasnt sure how to approach the woman she had become it was a hard thing to accept she countered in the calm voice he remembered that my father looked at me as athlete first and child second thats not true isnt it turning she fixed him with a level stare you turned your back on me because i gave up my career not once when i was suffering did you hold out a hand to me i had no one to go to but you and because you said no i had no one at all i tried to deal with it i tried to accept your decision to marry that man though you knew how i felt about him the unexpected guilt angered him and chilled his voice i tried to understand how you could give up what you were to play at being something else i had no choice she began furiously no choice his derision was sharp as a blade you made your own decision asher your career for a title just as you made it about the child my grandchild please she lifted both hands to her temples as she turned away please dont have you any idea how much and how often ive paid for that moment of carelessness carelessness stunned into disbelief jim stared at the back of her head you call the conception of a child carelessness no no her voice trembled as it rose the loss if i hadnt let myself get upset if i had looked where i was going i never would have fallen i never would have lost tys child what as the pain slammed into his stomach jim sank into the chair fallen tys child tys he ran a hand over his eyes as he tried to sort it out suddenly he felt old and frail and frightened asher are you telling me you miscarried tys child yes wearily she turned back to face him i wrote you i told you if you wrote i never received the letter shaken jim held out a hand waiting until she grasped it asher eric told me you aborted his child for an instant the words their meaning failed to penetrate her look was blank and vulnerable enough to make him feel every year of his age a calculated abortion of your husbands child he said deliberately when she swayed he gripped her other hand he told me youd done so without his knowledge or permission he seemed devastated i believed him asher as she went limp he drew her down to her knees in front of him i believed him oh god her eyes were huge and dark with shock her fathers fingers trembled in hers he phoned me from london he sounded half mad i thought with grief he said that you hadnt told him until after it was done that you had told him you wanted no children to interfere with the life you intended to build as lady wickerton too numb for anger asher shook her head i didnt know even eric could be so vindictive so cruel it all began to make horrid sense her letters to her father hadnt been answered eric had seen that they were never mailed then when she had phoned him jim had been cold and brief hed told her that he could never resolve himself to her choice asher had assumed he meant her rejection of her career he wanted me to pay she explained as she dropped her head on her fathers lap he never wanted me to stop paying gently jim cupped her face in his hands tell me everything ill listen as i should have a long time ago she started with jess leaving nothing out including her final stormy estrangement from ty jims mouth tightened at her recounting of the accident and the hospital scene with eric listening he cursed himself for being a fool and now ty as realization struck her she paled ty thinks eric must have told him id had an abortion no i told him you confused asher pressed her fingers to the headache in her temple but how he called me a few nights ago he wanted to convince me to see you i told him enough to make him believe the lie just as id believed it that night when i woke up asher remembered oh my god when he realized it had been his baby the things he was saying i couldnt think at the time she shut her eyes no wonder he hates me color flooded back into her face i have to tell him the truth and make him believe it scrambling up she dashed for the door ill go to the club i have to make him listen i have to make him understand the match must be nearly over jim rose on unsteady legs his daughter had been through hell and he had done nothing but add to it youll never catch him there frustrated asher looked at her watch i dont know where hes staying releasing the doorknob she went to the phone ill just have to find out asher awkward unsure jim held out his hand forgive me asher stared into his face as she replaced the receiver ignoring the hand she went into his arms it was nearly midnight when ty reached the door of his room for the past two hours hed been drinking steadily celebrating it wasnt every day you won the grand slam he reminded himself as he searched for his keys and it wasnt every day a man had a half dozen women offering to share their beds with him he gave a snort of laughter as he slid the key into the lock and why the hell hadnt he taken one of them up on it none of them was asher he shook away the thought as he struggled to make the doorknob function no he simply hadnt wanted a woman ty told himself it was because he was tired and had had too much to drink asher was yesterday the hotel room was dark as he stumbled inside if he was right about nothing else he was right about having too much to drink through glass after glass ty had told himself the liquor was for celebrating not for forgetting the kid from the chicago slum had made it to the top in spades the hell with it he decided tossing his keys into the room with a thud they landed on the carpet swaying a bit he stripped off his shirt and threw it in the same direction now if he could just find his way to the bed without turning on a light hed sleep tonight hed sleep with enough liquor in his system to anesthetize him thered be no dreams of soft skin or dark blue eyes tonight as he fumbled toward the bedroom a light switched on blinding him with a pungent curse ty covered his eyes balancing himself with one hand on the wall turn that damn thing off he muttered well the victor returns triumphant the quiet voice had him lowering the hand from his eyes asher sat primly in a chair looking unruffled soft and utterly tempting ty felt desire work its way through the alcohol what the hell are you doing here and very drunk she said as if he hadnt spoken rising she went to him i suppose you deserve it after the way you played today should i add my congratulations to the host of others get out he pushed away from the wall i dont want you ill order up some coffee she said calmly well talk i said get out catching her wrist he whirled her around before i lose my temper and hurt you though her pulse jumped under his fingers she stood firm ill leave after we talk do you know what i want to do to you he demanded shoving her back against the wall do you know that i want to beat you senseless yes she didnt cringe as his fury raged down on her ty if youll listen i dont want to listen to you the image of her lying exhausted on the bed raced through his mind get out while i can still stop myself from hurting you i cant she lifted a hand to his cheek ty her words were cut off as he pressed her back into the wall for an instant she thought he would strike her then his mouth came down on hers bruising savage he forced her lips apart thrusting his tongue deep as she struggled his teeth ground against hers as though to punish them both there was the faint taste of liquor reminding her he had drink as well as anger in his system when she tried to turn her head he caught her face in his hand not gently in the touch she remembered but viselike he could smell her the soft talc the lightly sexy perfume and the fear she made a small pleading sound before she stopped fighting him without being aware of what he did he lightened the grip to a caress his lips gentled on hers tasting savoring mumbling her name he trailed kisses over her skin until he felt the essence of her flowing back into him god how hed missed her i cant do without you he whispered i cant he sank to the floor drawing her down with him he was lost in her the feel the taste the fragrance his mind was too full of asher to allow him to think sensation ruled him trembling along his skin to follow the path of her fingers it was as if she sought to soothe and arouse him at once he was helpless to resist her or his need for her as if in a trance he took his lips over her missing nothing as his hunger seemed insatiable her quickening breaths were like music setting his rhythm the air grew steamier as his hands homed in on secrets that made her moan her body shuddered into life no longer gentle but demanding she tangled her fingers in his hair and guided him to sweet spaces hed neglected then ever greedy ever giving she drew him back to her mouth her tongue toyed with his lips then slid inside to drink up all the flavors his head swimming he answered the kiss the need for her was unreasonable but ty was beyond reason without her thered been an emptiness that even his fury couldnt fill now the void was closing she was in his blood in his bone so essential a part of him he had been able to find no place of separation now there was no will to do so under him she was moving inviting entreating he whispered a denial against her mouth but his pounding blood took control he was inside her without being aware of it then all sensations spiraled together in an intensity that made him cry out and it was her name he spoke in both ecstasy and in despair drained ty rolled from her to stare at the ceiling how could he have let that happen he demanded how could he have felt such love found such pleasure in a woman he had vowed to amputate from his life he wondered now if hed ever find the strength to stay away from her life with her and life without her would be two kinds of hell ty reaching over asher touched his shoulder dont without looking at her he rose get dressed for gods sake he muttered as he rugged on his own jeans with trembling hands who had used whom he wondered do you have a car sitting up asher pushed her hair out of her face hair she remembered that only moments before he had been kissing no ill call you a cab that wont be necessary in silence she began to dress i realize youre sorry that this happened im damned if ill apologize he snapped i wasnt asking you to she told him quietly i was going to say that im not sorry i love you and making love with you is only one way to show it she managed after three attempts to button her blouse when she looked up he was at the window his back to her ty i came here to tell you some things you must know when im finished ill go and give you tune to think about them cant you understand i dont want to think anymore its the last thing ill ask of you all right in a gesture of fatigue she rarely saw in him he rubbed both hands over his face the liquor had burned out of his system by the anger or the passion he wasnt sure but he was cold sober maybe i should tell you first that what jess said to you three years ago was her own fabrication i didnt know anything about it until the other day when she told me what shed done in her own way she was trying to protect me i dont understand what youre talking about turning he gave her a grim smile did you really think i was tired of you looking for a way out wondering how i could ditch you without raising too much fuss or interfering with my career asher opened her mouth to speak then shut it again how strange that the words still hurt and made her defensive obviously you did and if i did she countered everything she said fit youd never made a commitment to me thered never been any talk about the future on either side he reminded her asher pushed away the logic if youd once told me or perhaps you were uncertain enough of your own feelings that when jess dumped that on you you ran right to wickerton even though you were carrying my baby i didnt know i was pregnant when i married eric she saw him shrug her words away in fury she grabbed both of his arms i tell you i didnt know perhaps if i had known before i would have simply gone away i dont know what i would have done i was already terrified you were growing tired of me before jess confirmed it and where the hell did you get a stupid idea like that youd been so moody so withdrawn everything she said made sense if i was moody and withdrawn it was because i was trying to work out the best way to ask asher wolfe miss society tennis to marry starbuck from the wrong side of the tracks asher took an uncertain step toward him you would have married me i still have the ring i bought you he answered a ring she repeated stupidly youd bought me a ring for some inexplicable reason the thought of it stunned her more than anything else id planned to try a very conventional proposal and if that didnt work maybe a kidnapping she tried to laugh because tears were entirety too close it would have worked if youd told me you were pregnant ty i didnt know damn it she pounded once against his chest do you think i would have married eric if i had known it was weeks afterward that i found out why the hell didnt you tell me then do you think i wanted to get you back that way the old pride lifted her chin and i was married to another man id made him a promise a promise that meant more than the life of the child wed made together he retorted bitterly a promise that let you walk into one of those antiseptic clinics and destroy something innocent and beautiful and mine the image was too ugly the truth too painful flying at him asher struck him again and again until he pinned her hands behind her back and mine she shouted at him and mine or doesnt my part matter you didnt want it his fingers closed like steel as she tried to pull away but you didnt have the decency to ask me if i did couldnt you bear the thought of carrying part of me inside you for nine months dont ask me what i could bear she wasnt pale now but vivid with fury i didnt have an abortion she spat at him i miscarried i miscarried and nearly died in the process would you feel better if i had god knows i tried to miscarried his grip shifted from her wrists to her shoulders what are you talking about eric hated me too she shouted when i learned i was pregnant and told him all he could say was that id deceived him id tried to trick him into claiming the baby after youd refused me nothing i said got through to him we argued and argued we were near the steps and he was shouting all i wanted to do was get away her hands flew up to cover her face as she remembered again all too clearly i didnt look i only ran then i was falling i tried to stop but my head hit the railing i think then i dont remember anything until i woke up and the baby was gone somehow he could see it as vividly as though it were being played on film in front of his eyes oh god asher when he tried to take her in his arms she pulled away i wanted you but i knew youd never forgive me it didnt seem to matter anymore so i did what eric wanted to force back the tears she pressed her fingers to her eyes i didnt want you to know i couldnt have stood it if you had known when you didnt want me lowering her hands she looked at him dryeyed i paid for losing your baby ty for three years i did without everything that mattered to me and i grieved alone i cant mourn any longer no going to the window he flung it up as if he needed air there was no breeze nothing to relieve the burning that he felt youve had years to deal with it ive had days and shed had no one he thought years with no one ty took several long breaths how badly were you hurt puzzled by the question she shook her head what were you badly hurt the question was rough and turbulent when she remained silent he turned when you fell how bad was it i i lost the baby i asked about you she stared without comprehension no one had asked her that not even her father looking into tys ravaged face she could only shake her head again damn it asher did you have a concussion did you break any bones you said you almost died the baby died she repeated numbly crossing to her he grabbed her shoulders you he shouted dont you know that youre the most important thing to me we can have a dozen babies if you want i need to know what happened to you i dont remember very much i was sedated there were transfusions the full impact of his words penetrated slowly the anguish in his eyes was for her ty burying her face against his chest she clung all thats over i should have been with you he drew her closer we should have gone through that together just tell me you love me say the words you know that i do he cupped her chin to force her head back i love you he saw the first tear fall and kissed it away dont he pleaded no more tears face no more grieving she held him close again until the fullness left her chest no more grieving she repeated and lifted her face he touched it gently fingertips only i hurt you we let other people hurt us she contradicted never again how could we be stupid enough to almost lose it all twice he wondered aloud no more secrets asher she shook her head no more secrets a third chance ty i work best under pressure he brushed his lips over her temple double break point face im on a winning streak you should be celebrating i did my share not with me she gave him a light kiss full of promise we could go to my place pick up a bottle of champagne on the way we could stay here he countered and worry about the champagne tomorrow it is tomorrow she reminded him then weve got all day he began to pull her toward the bedroom wait a minute snatching her hand away she stepped back id like to hear that conventional proposal now come on asher he made another grab for her hand but she eluded him i mean it flustered he stuck his hands into his pockets you know i want you to marry me thats not a conventional proposal she folded her arms and waited well she began when he remained silent should i write you a cheat sheet you say something like asher i know what im supposed to say he muttered id rather try the kidnapping laughing she walked over and twined her arms around his neck ask me she whispered letting her lips hover an inch from his will you marry me asher the lips held tantalizingly near his curved but she remained silent his eyes dropped to them lingered then rose to hers well im thinking it over she told him i was hoping for something a bit more flowery maybe some poetry or the wind was knocked out of her as he hefted her over his shoulder yes thats good too she decided i should be able to let you know in a few days from the height he dropped her she bounced twice before she settled on the bed or sooner she decided as he began unbuttoning her blouse shut up she cocked a brow dont you want to hear my answer well get the license tomorrow i havent said and the blood tests i havent agreed his mouth silenced her in a long lingering kiss as his body fit unerringly to hers of course asher sighed i could probably be persuaded
