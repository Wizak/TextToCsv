 chapter silver deathsheads there was a frozen stony expression on the tall mans face and his dark eyes rolled and jerked with unease his hands were drawn pale and bard at his sides these signs should have told an experienced observer that the man was worried and scared but there were no experienced observers among the stenographers and clerks in the office of seven seas so the glances they gave the tall man were merely the bootlicking smiles of employees who had about as much spirit as rabbits a person with spunk did not work long with seven seas because paine l winthrop the owner was a coldblooded driver of the old school an industrial emperor who looked upon those under him as vassals had paine l winthrop lived a hundred years earlier he would have kept a retinue of slaves and beaten them often maybe clarence sparks had an inkling that something was awry clarence was a billing clerk for seven seas which operated transatlantic freight boats and had no connection with winthrops shipyards which was also controlled by paine l winthrop and which built freight steamers clarence was a rabbit like the rest of those who worked for seven seas but clarence also had sharp wits good afternoon commodore winthrop said clarence winthrops only claim to the designation of commodore was that he held such an office in an exclusive yacht club but he liked the title and the canny clarence knew it winthrop seemed not to hear he walked stiffly mechanically from the corridor door to his private office and his face was rigid his eyes busy his hands hard and gray the old wolf grunted clarence some day somebody is going to give winthrop what he has coming to him clarence was a prophet a great deal more of a prophet than he knew paine l winthrop entered his office turned the key in the door then tried the knob to make sure it was locked he stuffed a corner of a silk handkerchief into the keyhole using a match for the purpose he pulled off his topcoat and laid it along the bottom of the door after these two precautions he seemed to feel that no one would eavesdrop striding stiffly to the window he looked down at the street forty floors below pedestrians there resembled ants paine l winthrop ordinarily got a thrill out of the view because he liked to think of other people as ants but now the view made him shiver one of new yorks frequent fogs was mushroomed over the city especially thick out over the nearby east river but less dense here in the wall street sector winthrop shivered again and jerked a cord which closed the slats of the venetian blind seating himself at his desk be hugged a telephone close and dialed with a trembling forefinger he missed his number the first time through nervousness but got it on the second attempt before speaking he drew out a costly watch and noted that it lacked only a few minutes of being four in the afternoon evidently he recognized the voice which answered at the other end of the wire for no names were exchanged your ttime is almost up he said shakily the other did not respond immediately and paine l winthrop seemed on the verge of repeating his warning then a coarse angry whisper came over the line winthrop you are passing up a chance of becoming one of the richest men alive said the distant speaker i am passing up a chance of landing in the electric chair winthrop snapped listen winthrop the other said earnestly i have explained to you very there is no object in arguing said the shipping magnate i may be a hard business man and i may be a skinflint and a slave driver as some people have called me but i stay within the law early in my youth i learned that was the best policy the distant whispering voice took on a menacing quality you are already too deep in this to back out winthrop it pointed out we have used your shipyard winthrop flinched as if he had been seized with an inner chill in the region of his spine but his forbidding face remained set and determined i was deceived he grated i thought the thing being built in my shipyard was for a foreign government i think i can convince the authorities of that it seems that i made a mistake in taking you into my confidence said the whisper winthrop snapped you certainly did i should have turned the matter over to the silver deathsheads as the newspapers so dramatically term them retorted the other the mention of silver deathsheads had the effect of nearly causing winthrop to drop the receiver the man peered about as if fearing some grisly menace might be in the room with him then he got a grip on himself there is no more to be said he stated grimly i have given you a chance to disband the silver deathsheads and destroy the the thing that was built in my shipyard you refuse therefore i shall now call the police his voice charged with desperate excitement had risen to a yell that had considerable volume the sound penetrated through the door of the private office despite the precautions which winthrop had taken in stuffing the keyhole and covering the crack at the bottom of the door clarence sparks at his desk outside heard he hesitated eying the door longing to listen then summoning his nerve he shuffled over to the water cooler which was beside the door of the private office he could listen from there inside the office winthrop screamed i am going to call the police and tell them all about the silver deathsheads i am going to tell who is apparently their chief and i am going to tell whose devilish brain is actually behind all of this the coarse whisper over the telephone said i can promise that you will not live long enough to do that winthrop winthrop was squirming perspiring he shouted killing me will not help i have a blueprint showing some of your working methods i have given it to my secretary and i have told her the whole story you are bluffing winthrop snarled the whispering one i am not winthrop barked my secretary will give the whole story to the police if anything happens to me now will you give this all up or do i call the police call them if you dare suggested the other i will winthrop banged the receiver up shaky and pallid clarence sparks backed from the door he had overheard too much for his peace of mind he was in the same boat with the young man who was fishing for minnows and caught a shark the fact that clarence sparks was backing away from the door undoubtedly saved his life there was a cataclysmic crash the door of winthrops private office exploded to fragments the whole partition wall caved part of the ceiling came thundering down forty stories below on the street an earsplitting crack of sound caused people to look up it was like the lash of a stupendous thunderbolt after one glance upward the pedestrians cried out in terror and began to run a cloud of bricks mortar and twisted steel was falling down the side of the skyscraper giving at first the impression that the whole great building was coming to pieces a moment later to those farther up the street it was evident that a great cavity had been blown in the side of the fogpiercing edifice debris fell to the sidewalk with a great uproar three parked cars fortunately unoccupied were crushed and a prowling taxicab was partially wrecked the driver of the hack slightly cut and bruised got out and ran squawling that there had been an earthquake following the fall of the debris there was a brittle jangling of dropping glass all over the neighborhood for windows had been blown out by the blast numerous people were cut others had narrow escapes then came several moments of almost complete silence the quiet was so complete that the droning of an airplane over the nearby river could be heard then as the plane swept away there was the sound of a motor boat also on the river the presence of the plane and the motor boat on the river at that particular instant came to the attention of a number of persons and was later to become a fact of significance the tension following the explosion snapped women screeched and had hysterics more stoic souls peered up in the fog and observed the yawning hole in the side of the skyscraper where the private office of paine l winthrop had been policemen came running and ambulance sirens wailed bedlam reigned chapter the archer in silver the building housing paine l winthrops shipping company the seven seas was not the most imposing in the wall street sector but it narrowly missed that designation penthouses ornamented the tops of most of the skyscrapers in the district and this one was no exception the penthouse on this building was a pretentious affair with numerous glass walls which afforded the occupant full sunlight most of the glass had been shattered by the blast below in fact it was a miracle that the whole structure had not gone down with a resultant vast loss of life one of the penthouse rooms contained many work benches and these supported racks holding innumerable test tubes retorts microscopes mixing trays pestles and bottled chemicals that the benches had supported this array would be more correct for most of the stuff was now on the floor several small chemical fires had started a remarkablelooking man was picking himself up from the mess of glass and liquids he jumped up and down and emitted a roar for he had been slightly burned by a vial of acid the roar and the way the fellow bounced about gave the impression of a great angry ape the mans appearance did little to detract from the impression he had practically no forehead his thick musclegnarled arms were longer than his legs and his skin was leathery and covered with bristles which resembled rusty nails his mouth was so unnaturally large that it looked as if there had been an accident in the assembling of his pleasantly ugly face habeas the apish man bellowed a pig came galloping into view squealing excitedly an almost incredibly grotesque specimen of the porker family as homely in his way as was the man who had called him the shote had long doglike legs a scrawny body an inquisitive snout and ears almost large enough to serve as wings dang it habeas the homely chemist grinned i was afraid that dude lawyer had thrown a grenade at you some one seemed to be trying to open a nearby door loud kicks sounded wood crunched and the door fell inward the man who came through was slender waspish and attired to the height of sartorial perfection he had a high forehead the mobile mouth of an orator in one hand he gripped a thin black cane which was slightly separated at a joint near the handle thus disclosing the object to be a sword cane with a razorsharp blade the welldressed man glared at the homely chemist his expression that of a gentleman who had just found a toad on his breakfast table monk i always did know you would blow us up with some of your idiotical chemical experiments he snapped this was nothing if not libel the apish man monk was lieut col andrew blodgett mayfair and conceded by those who knew to be one of the greatest of living chemists his head which did not look as if it had room for a thimbleful of brains harbored a fabulous amount of chemical and electrochemical lore monk glared at the dapper newcomer the shyster lawyer heard from he growled that was another libel the dressy gentleman was brig gen theodore marley brooks better known as ham one of the most astute lawyers ever to get his sheepskin from harvard a strange pair these two they were always together yet no one could remember either one having spoken a civil word to the other those who knew however could cite a number of instances when each had risked his life to save the other men farfamed in their professions both of them yet they were known to the comers of the earth for another reason known as two members of a group of five who were assistants to a man who was probably the most famed adventurer of all time monk and ham were aides of doc savage the man of bronze the man of mystery the being of fabulous accomplishments who was almost a legend to the general public but who was the synonym for terror and justice to those who preyed upon their fellow men ham flourished his sword cane what was that that quake search me said monk whose voice in repose was remarkably small and querulously childlike seizing a fire extinguisher monk went to work on the chemical blazes he resented this damage to his laboratory for it was one of the most complete in existence exceeded only by those maintained by the man of bronze doc savage who was himself a greater chemist than monk habeas corpus monks pet pig backed away from the flames saw he was getting near ham and hastily shied off habeas and ham did not get along together ham had repeatedly threatened to make breakfast bacon out of habeas the fires doused monk cast aside the extinguisher lets find out what happened he said a good idea coming from a strange source ham stated unkindly and they went out the pig habeas they left behind the elevators were not operating probably due to the damage wrought by the blast and they had to walk down it did not take them long to reach the scene of the detonation they were efficient these two men accustomed to scenes of violence through their long association with doc savage doc seemed to exist always in the shadow of peril and destruction without delay they went to work to ascertain the cause of the explosion and there they ran up against a profound puzzle as well as a gruesome scene paine l winthrop was dead no doubt of that as it was necessary for the ambulance surgeons to assemble the scattered parts of his body on a stretcher before it could be carried away several of the seven seas office employees had been injured a broken arm received by a stenographer as she was knocked over her desk was the most serious others were only lacerated and bruised monk and ham put quick inquiries about the cause of the blast no one could give a reply of value except paine l winthrops head clerk who was quite sure there had been no bomb since she had left the private office only shortly before the arrival of her boss before monk and ham could locate fragments of whatever had caused the detonation a swarm of policemen and newspaper reporters arrived the officers herded every one to an office one floor below it having been decided that the skyscraper was in no danger of falling the office in which those who had been on the explosion scene were concentrated was the headquarters of a firm dealing in imported antiques and art works adjoining the office were numerous stock rooms holding pictures armor pieces of ancient furniture weapons costumes and like articles these were all antiques the newspaper reporters descended upon monk and ham both were highpressure copy for it was known that they were members of doc savages group of aides and doc was frontpage news all seven days of the week is doc working on this a journalist connected with a tabloid demanded no said monk irked because the locust swarm of scribes were keeping ham and himself from investigating keep doc out of it the tabloid reporter ran to a telephone and informed his city editor two of the famous doc savages men are on the spot and working on the mystery explosion they deny that doc himself is interested but we dont need to mention that docs name in this will make it all the bigger our pals monk growled modern newspapers function with breathtaking speed and while the reporters were still harassing monk and ham extra editions of their sheets arrived monk snatched one of these and retired with ham to a stock room the walls of which were hung with the work of old masters to see how much doc had been brought into the affair they expected to see the blast story occupying a whole page of the tabloid but to their surprise it divided honors with another yarn i say said ham who affected a pronounced harvard accent whenever he thought of it those silver deathshead beggars have been acting again they read the big black headlines and the news story below them the thing was almost childishly dramatic as written silver deathsheads strike mystery men rob armored car get a quarter million in loot vanish as usual the terror in silver is with new york again at three oclock this afternoon these frightful men of mystery shot down the drivers and guard of an armored truck in the streets of manhattan and took in cash accounts of the number of robbers vary some spectators say there were twenty others claim only five or six the robbers escaped in a fast car and evaded police pursuit in the waterfront section of the east river the thieves wore silvercolored suits and weird silver hoods which made their beads resemble skulls this description tallies with the gang which has committed other robberies and murders and which is known to the police as the silver deathsheads the last crime committed by the silver deathsheads was the coldblooded sinking of the liner avallancia pride of the transatlantic company in new york harbor bedford burgess gardner president of the transatlantic company has not been able to explain what motive could have been behind the sinking of the avallancia wild stuff commented monk typical newspaper sensationalism ham clipped agreeing with monk because he still resented being questioned by the reporters silver deathsheads imagine that what rot too melodramatic to have much foundation in truth monk added i doubt if there are really any men called the silver deathsheads this particular tabloid colors its news to beat the band the two men had been making no effort to pitch their voices low and a number of the seven seas office employees huddled in the room of the antique dealer overheard what was being said among those who could not help but catch the words was clarence sparks mention of the silver deathsheads caused clarence to stiffen visibly then look undecided he hesitated mustering up his nerve as yet he had not told any one of what he had overheard outside the door of paine l winthrops private office but hearing monk state his belief that there were no such individuals as silver deathsheads apparently moved clarence to speak he sidled over to monk and ham you you gentlemen are mistaken he said hesitantly monk squinted at the receding chin and the nonetoorobust physique of sparks you know something he asked clarence sparks moistened his lips nervously i i hope this wont get me into trouble he muttered monk and ham were both intensely interested spill it monk directed the seven seas billing clerk swelled his thin chest with a full breath of resolution i was eavesdropping outside paine l winthrops door he said in a voice which excitement made loud i heard him make the telephone call which was directly responsible for his death blazes monk exploded then it was a murder huh clarence sparks clenched his fists and said it certainly was who was winthrop talkin to monk demanded to the secret mastermind of the silver deathsheads clarence gulped for the love of mud said monk what was his name clarence sparks almost yelled i heard winthrop say over the telephone that it was that was the last word clarence sparks spoke although not the last sound he made for his mouth suddenly flew open to its widest and let a terrific scream rip out it was as if the scream had burst out destroying his vocal cords the yell rasped and was unnatural clarence sparks put his arms stiffly above his head in the manner of an aboriginal saluting the sun then he turned slowly trembling and on tiptoe when he had his back to monk and ham they could see the feathered shaft of the arrow which protruded from his back because clarence sparks was thin and poorly his body made a clattering sound as it fell to the floor after he fell the stiffness seemed to go out of his thin frame his head rolled over slackly until his cheek pressed the floor and with a bubbling rush scarlet came from iris mouth and nostrils but monk and ham were not watching the phenomena incidental to death they were staring at the archer who had discharged the arrow an archer in silver a being so grotesque of appearance that they were held stunned chapter the archer quest the archer was not a large man if he was a man he was shorter than ham who was not tall and he was also scrawny with thin arms and gnarled legs his garb was the strange the gripping thing it was silver the cloth was of the metallic stuff such as is used to make the stage costumes of show girls and it was cut in one garment a coverall there was a hood over the head also of silver elastic and tight fitting because eye and mouth openings were dark against the shiny metallic hood the affair had the aspect of a deathshead a silver skull a costly wrist watch adorned one of his pipestem arms the silver archer stood in the door of an adjacent office holding a heavy medieval bow evidently one of the antiques which filled the rooms he dropped the how it thumping loudly as it fell then he leaped backward the movement snapped monk and ham out of their trance they dived headlong in pursuit but the killer slammed the door a key clinked among the tumblers doc savages two aides flinging against the panel found it solidly resistant so there isnt any such thing as the silver deathsheads ham snapped monk knotted an enormous bristlecovered fist and grated you were the first one to get that idea you nitwit shyster then monk grimaced and hit the door panel with his fist the wood splintered gave a trifle it splintered more extensively under a second blow then collapsed making a bole large enough to pass the apish chemists hairy hand standing well clear of the door monk groped for the key found it in place and unlocked the panel he shoved it open ham started through sword cane in hand wait stupid monk growled and shoved the dapper lawyer back from a holster so cleverly padded under an armpit that it was unnoticeable monk drew a weapon bearing close resemblance to an overgrown automatic pistol but it was no automatic it was a supermachine pistol product of doc savages mechanical genius a weapon which fired at an incredible speed discharging instead of regulation lead slugs thinwalled composition bullets which carried an anaesthetic compound producing quick harmless unconsciousness machine pistol in hand monk jumped through the door considering that a murderer had just entered the room his act might have seemed reckless but monk wore a bulletproof vest which protected his entire body and he knew gunmen of the modern type do not often shoot at a mans head ham trailed the homely chemist he too wore one of the bulletproof vests which were so light and thin as to be unnoticeable under their clothing and was not at all uncomfortable these vests were also a product of doc savages mechanical skill both men jerked up inside the room their jaws sagged their eyes roving widened in amazement well im a camels uncle monk breathed whered he go ham shook his head slowly and turned his sword cane in his hands for their quarry was nowhere in the room both the outer windows were down and the lawyer knew that this skyscraper had a wall sheer and smooth impossible for even a socalled human fly to scale by ordinary methods monk charging around the room jerked a rectangle of expensive tapestry from the wall scowled when he saw there was no aperture back of it and flipped the carpet up nowhere was there a trapdoor the windows are unlocked ham pointed out but that bird in silver couldnt have monk swallowed the rest ran to a window and wrenched it up he looked out seemed stunned but said nothing ham leaped to his side together they peered down we must be getting very dumb ham said disgustedly speak for yourself monk growled then placed a hand on the window sill and vaulted through the opening out into space without hesitating ham followed instinctively using care not to disrupt the neat hang of his garments it was a rare occasion when ham forgot his clothing perhaps six feet below the window was a wide ledge for the moment the two men had forgotten that the skyscraper was set back pyramid fashion at intervals and that one of these setbacks was at the level of the seven seas offices the killer must have fled by this route after closing the window behind him to confuse his pursuers monk pointed he went this way city grime was smeared on the roof of the setback soot and dust which retained footprints plainly the two men followed the tracks around the skyscraper they disappeared into a window on the opposite side monk and ham clambered through the window and found themselves among mops buckets and windowwashing paraphernalia the room was obviously one used by janitors there was no trace of the weirdly garbed slayer a corridor was beyond the store room this being deserted for the moment not until monk emitted an angry roar did any one appear then two policemen popped out of the offices of seven seas whats going on here snapped an officer whered that killer go monk demanded the cop gulped killer say whatre you talking about and that was the first inkling the police had of the slaying of unfortunate clarence sparks for the meekspirited billing clerk was dead the arrow having punctured his heart they found that out when they examined him where the killer had gone remained a mystery through the course of the next fifteen minutes then an excited call came up from the basement regions a fireman had been found knocked senseless in the basement monk and ham hurried down the fireman had thick blond hair and that had possibly preserved his life for the blow he had received over the head judging by the bruise had been terrific a policeman was waiting for a doctor to revive the fellow let me do it said ham i have an infallible system ham unsheathed his sword cane and the onlookers say that the tip was coated for a few inches with a brownish substance which was slightly sticky this was a drug mixture which produced senselessness when a victim was pricked with a finger tip ham removed a bit of the drug from the sword and applied it to the tongue of the unconscious fireman the stuff in small quantities was a stimulant but if administered in quantity produced senselessness the fireman revived almost at once what happened to you ham demanded aye not bane know mumbled the fireman feeling his blond head who hit you ham persisted he bane a feller all dressed up in shiny suit was the reply aye just see him then bop he hit me with gun the room where they stood was a concrete inferno far below the street where the great oilburning boilers roared generating steam for the radiators and hot water for the washrooms moved by a thought he was sharp in spite of monks habit of terming him a nitwit shyster ham went over and peered into one of the fire boxes he started violently moved to use his sword to probe in the heat then changed his mind and employed a cleaning bar out of the fire box ham brought a crinkled mass that had once been silver metallic cloth the suit the murderer was wearing he declared then it is some one in the building monk growled the fellow burned his rig because the police have the doors blocked and are not letting any one out unnoticed a man was standing in the background near the door he was a scrawny fellow bedecked with grease stains and dirt garbed in the green coveralls which the janitors of the building wore it was because he was one of the janitors that he was receiving no attention he deserved attention no hint of the fact showed on his features but he was catching every word that was being said he had a stupid face anyway it was almost without a jaw being round with small features and having a sickly gray color his whole head was very much like an old white rubber ball which had been handled with grimy fingers he wore a costly wrist watch the fellow glanced over his shoulder as if anxious to get out of the boiler room shortly he did leave but he took his time so that no suspicion was attached to his departure finding his way to a telephone he called a number a voice a coarse whispering voice obviously disguised answered this aint goin so hot said the man in janitor regalia what is wrong bugs asked the whispering voice two of doc savages men are snooping around reported bugs his round pale face close to the transmitter the whispering one swore i saw that in an extra edition of a tabloid newspaper what on earth got those two involved in the affair one of them named monk has a chemical laboratory on top of the building bugs advised this called forth more sibilant profanity if i had known one of doc savages men had a place on the building we would have used other methods on old winthrop grated the distant whisper doc savage is the last man on earth we want on our necks at this stage of the game savage is almost inhuman he is a mechanical wizard a scientific genius and a man as strong as hercules and he applies all of his abilities to helping other people out of trouble he goes in for big stuff something like we are pulling would be his meat boss bugs muttered theres somethin else what a clerk mustve been listenin outside old winthrops door when well you know and he overheard stuff i dont know how much because i croaked him before he could tell it all to doc savages two men you damned fool snarled the other there was nothing said in that telephone talk which would give me away how was i to know that bugs whined i was afraid he had a line on us i had my silver outfit on and i got hold of an old how and arrow and let him have it oh you idiot the whispering man groaned right in front of two men who are as brainy as they come doc savage does not have any mental blanks working for him like i seem to have aw bugs mumbled i got away banged a fireman over the head and burned my silver outfit so they couldnt find any finger prints or where it was made or maybe trace the cloth several seconds of silence followed this the distant mastermind seemed to be giving deep thought to the affair bugs impatient at the delay began speaking if we just hadnt bumped old winthrop he said that was that was necessary the distant voice finished for him winthrop was a man who would not hesitate to swindle an orphan if it could be done legally that fooled me the old nut had his own screwy idea of honor or maybe he was afraid of the law anyway he was going to tell the police all about us and he knew plenty especially about the job we had done in his shipyard well savages two men are snooping bugs muttered whatre we gonna do about that let it ride huh they aint got a line to go on theyll get a line dont worry grated the whisperer doc savages men are wizards and that fellow savage himself is positively inhuman we must do something what bugs wanted to know after a pause the other said listen to this following that there was a chain of rapid commands bugs mumbling frequently that he understood an expression of evil pleasure overspread his unhealthy moon of a face as he heard the plans unfolded he consulted his remarkably highpriced wrist watch that oughta fix em he grinned finally hanging up he made his way back through the corridor labyrinths of the great building until he located monk and ham lurking in the background unnoticed he kept an eye on doc savages two aides bugs was waiting for something and he eyed the watch often as for monk and ham they had given up all hope of the blond fireman furnishing any valuable information the fellow had seen only a grotesque figure in silver the ashes of the silver garment a shapeless sediment of metal and cinders furnished no clue even doc couldnt learn anything from this monk complained indicating the garment ham started to nod then refrained since agreeing with monk on any subject was against his policy were killing time snapped the dapper lawyer why dont we go upstairs and look over the explosion scene the police have done that monk grunted they have not found what caused the blast ham pointed out that seemed to settle the question and they started mounting stairs the elevators not yet being in working order the skyscraper had not one basement but three one below the other and the boilers were in the lowermost level deep in the solid bed rock of manhattan island and probably below the surface of the nearby east river which at this point was very wide actually a neck of new york harbor the two men reached the second basement and encountered a police officer the cop had the rank of lieutenant but he was deferential for monk and ham held honorary police stations far above his own doc savage and all of his men held these honorary commissions issued out of gratitude for past services in aiding the law enforcement agencies of the city we have learned something reported the lieutenant i knew you gentlemen would want all information as quickly as we got it shoot monk invited the police officer explained rapidly we are entirely mystified as to the cause of the explosion which killed winthrop although a more intensive search may turn up some clue we are overlooking no bets the blast might have been a bomb launched in some manner from a plane in checking up we learned that a plane was flying over the river very near the building at the time of the explosion too there was a man on the river in a motor boat no one paid attention to bugs who was loitering within earshot any way of identifying the plane monk asked the policeman you would be surprised how people notice things like that when something grabs their attention replied the officer i suppose some persons wondered if the plane had dropped a bomb anyway we have several witnesses who got the number on the lower wing surface of the plane great grunted monk youre checking you bet and moreover two or three dock workers identified the motor boat which was on the river there was one man in the boat and he may have seen the plane drop a bomb its pretty foggy monk pointed out the officer nodded fumbled in a uniform pocket and produced a notebook he thumbed through the leaves gilbert stiles is the owner of the plane according to the check we made on the numbers he said stiles keeps the plane for his personal pleasure the man in the boat was a fisherman named he stumbled over the pronunciation named gugillello bellondi or something like that the flier lives on eightyfifth street in jackson heights and the fisherman on sand street in brooklyn bugs who had overheard all of this turned surreptitiously fumbled out a sheet of paper and a pencil stub and put down the name of gilbert stiles and gugillello bellondi he added data on their residences bugs did not put much trust in his memory monk and ham accompanied by the police lieutenant mounted the stairs into the topmost basement we had better ring doc in on this monk suggested eying ham ham said i had the same idea before you did in the skyscraper lobby were a number of telephone booths monk entered one of these found the outside connections undisturbed by the blast and called the number of doc savages headquarters the headquarters was a strange aerie on the eightysixth floor of the most impressive skyscraper in uptown new york and the bronze man spent much of his leisure there actually doc savage allowed himself no leisure in the accepted sense all of his time being spent in research in experiments in study there was a fabulously equipped library and laboratory in the headquarters doc asked monk the question was unnecessary doc savage had a remarkable voice one which was powerful yet controlled modulated giving the impression of almost eerie strength unmistakable that voice i just saw an extra edition of the newspaper said doc savage was your laboratory damaged by the explosion some monk admitted but that isnt what i called about doc there is something underhanded going on down here we do not involve ourselves in anything the police can handle doc reminded i figured youd be interested monk explained you see its a queer business all along first theres nothing to show what caused the explosion or if there is they havent found it yet then a guy in silver murdered clarence sparks a winthrop employee what is this doc asked sharply a bird dressed up in a sort of silver coverall suit and a silver mask shot sparks with a bow and arrow just as we were about to question the fellow sparks seemed to know something did the killer resemble the strange silverclothed figures who have recently committed a series of big robberies and who also sunk the transatlantic companys liner avallancia doc questioned sure said monk i think he was one of the gang doc savage was silent a moment as if engaged in thought then a weird a most unusual sound came from the telephone receiver it was a sound defying description it was a most unmusical trilling a whistle and yet not a whistle possessing a throaty exotic quality it ran up and down the musical scale but without adhering to a definite time it might have been a wind whistling with ghostly quality through a ships rigging or it might have been the song of some strange jungle bird monk stiffened as be heard the sound he had heard the eerie note many times before it was the sound of doc savage the small unconscious thing which the bronze man did in moments of mental excitement it usually came before some startling development often it marked docs discovery of some obscure fact which was later to possess great significance monk doc said have you noticed anything queer about the robberies these socalled silver deathsheads have been committing monk began well their silver disguises not that doc told him there is one strange point about the robberies themselves have you noticed no said monk what is it a number of men have been killed in the course of the thefts doc stated sure but men are often killed during robberies in each case these men were prominent doc explained patiently and on one or two occasions the thefts during which they were shot down were of a trivial nature i can give you one very good example lets have it monk requested two weeks ago a gang of the silver deathsheads seven of them to be exact held up a small filling station on long island doc announced the filling station was very small and never had more than a few dollars on hand but a limousine had just driven into the station to fill up with gas it was occupied by a wealthy man named kirkland le page he was shot and killed the filling station attendant was lying on the floor of his station at the time and did not see what provoked the shooting le page was driving his car himself i remember said monk kirkland le page was vice president of transatlantic company owners of the liner avallancia which was later sunk by the silver deathsheads doc stated blazes exploded monk theres something big behind this exactly doc agreed monk stood silently in the telephone booth mentally turning over what doc savage had just revealed the homely chemist nodded slowly to himself he would have been willing to bet that doc had been on the verge of investigating the weird silver deathsheads even if this afternoons explosion had not occurred monk opened his mouth to speak further but things began to happen there was a stifled yell from the lobby behind monk where ham and the policeman stood feet pounded on the lobby floor there was another yell a shot banged monk tried to turn his shoulder spread was vast the telephone booth small at first he did not make it he squirmed to get around the booth had glass windows with a jangling crash these caved in glass showered monk the homely chemist got a flash of a hand encased in a silver glove the hand held a heavy automatic silver glove and weighty gun were all that monk saw the weapon lashed for his head he sought to duck the booth was too small and the automatic came down full on the top of his nubbin of a head monk slumped and never felt the gun club down on his head twice again the blows murderously vicious chapter two silver murders doc savage heard the ugly sounds of the blows upon monks head for there had been no time for the homely chemist to replace the telephone receiver and telephones are sensitive doc listened closely the noise had been distinct enough to tell what had happened over the wire came scuffling sounds grunts which meant that monks bulk was being hauled from the booth then the telephone receiver in the booth must have been replaced there was a click with silence afterward doc savage had been bending over an expensively inlaid table as he conversed with monk he straightened and his tremendous physical build was apparent to its fullest the telephone the massive table seemed to shrink beside him yet it was only in comparison to these objects that his full proportions were evident so symmetrically was his giant frame developed that seen at a distance and away from objects to which his size might be compared he appeared no larger than other men but he would never be mistaken for another this herculean figure his bronze motif prevented that his skin remarkably fine of texture had been turned a rich bronze hue by countless tropical suns and his hair straight and fitting like a metallic skull cap was of a bronze color only slightly darker his face was regular the lineaments having an unusual quality of handsomeness hut in no sense possessing the somewhat effeminate prettiness often found in very handsome men the most striking feature however was his eyes they were slightly weird like pools of flakegold stirred continually by tiny whirlwinds they held an almost hypnotic quality a compelling power the room where this amazing bronze man stood was the outer office of his headquarters and held only comfortable chairs and a massive safe adjacent was the library with its thousands of scientific volumes and the laboratory with an array of equipment nearly without equal doc whipped into the corridor his movements apparently unhurried but his speed great a special elevator a fast lift installed for his own use lowered him eightysix floors to the skyscraper basement there he kept several automobiles all of special construction in a garage the existence of which was unknown to all but a few the bronze mans skyscraper establishment had cost a small fortune yet its expense was scarcely a drop from his reservoir of wealth doc possessed an almost unlimited source of funds a treasure trove as unusual as the bronze man himself scarcely three minutes after disaster befell monk doc savage was on the street in an expensive but unostensible roadster he touched a dash button under the hood a siren began wailing traffic police heard and opened a way for him doc went down broadway and for a long time the speedometer needle swayed above seventy miles an hour he drove with an uncanny skill the roadster was fitted with shortwave radio receivingandtransmitting apparatus ordinarily doc savage would have used this to get in touch with the other three members of his group of five assistants but three of his aides were not at present in new york william harper johnny littlejohn the expert on archaeology and geology was in london filling a special lecture engagement at a famous university major thomas j long tom roberts electrical wizard extraordinary was in europe collaborating in experiments with another electrical expert on a device which was long toms pet dream an apparatus which when perfected could be used to kill insects with ultrashort sonic or electric waves this would be an inestimable boon to farmers colonel john renny renwick famous engineer was in south africa halfway around the world overseeing construction of a particularly difficult hydroelectric plant a project in which the engineer had a financial interest for the first time in many months doc savage would have to go into action without the aid of three of his remarkable group of five men each of whom was a master in some profession several blocks from the scene of the strange explosion in the office building doc switched off the siren a crowd milled in front of the building itself there were signs of excitement doc parked at the end of the block and hurried forward intent on learning what had befallen monk and ham he caught snatches of conversation from the crowd they came in an armored truck gasped a man a woman was telling a friend did you notice how they were dressed silvercolored suits those silver masks on their faces gasped the friend ugh hideous doc went on and heard a fat colored fellow in a bus boys uniform exclaim dem silver lads done lit out of heah in the same truck dat dey came in boy did yoah see dem two men they was draggin when they up an left asked a brother bus boy yassuh agreed the first dem two was daid if yoah asks me doc savages remarkable bronze features did not change expression that did not mean he was unconcerned for he schooled himself until he possessed an uncanny control over his own emotions a lieutenant of police the same individual to whom monk and ham had been talking answered the question doc encountered the officer in front of the building the cop saluted briskly it was the silver deathsheads the policeman explained before doc could put a query they drove right through the crowd in an armored car ran down two spectators they rushed in clubbed down the guard at the door and seized monk and ham it happened so quickly that we could do nothing although i did manage to fire one shot did they harm monk and ham doc demanded the lieutenant shivered slightly at the grim sound of the giant bronze mans voice both were clubbed over the head he said thickly ham was caught beside me the silver devils came up behind us monk was in the telephone booth and did not get out in time how badly were they clubbed doc questioned the officer moistened his lips pretty hard i dont know if they are alive they were dragged away what about the armored truck doc asked armored trucks are not extremely common on new york streets this one was a steel payroll truck the policeman replied it was stolen we learned from a company which makes a business of delivering pay rolls it was taken only a few minutes before the raid here you assemble information very quickly doc told the officer good work was the truck followed the policeman grimaced im sorry to say that it got away completely of course every radio patrol car in the city is now looking for it we expect a report at any minute it cannot escape doc savage did not rush off on any wild chase of his own in search of the armored truck he knew the efficiency of the metropolitan police he had in fact served in a consulting capacity when the present radio car system was inaugurated a vehicle as prominent as the armored truck would not get far before it was discovered the bronze mans first move was to examine the semimolten silver mass which monk and ham had found in the basement fire box a small bag was brought from docs roadster with chemicals taken from the bag doc tested the silver coin silver he announced eh the police lieutenant was puzzled the cloth is interwoven with fine wire made from molten silver dollars doc explained does that prove anything the officer queried only that the criminals must be making the garments themselves which indicates that some of them are highly skilled metalsmiths said the bronze man if the disguises had been purchased it is almost certain that a different grade of silver would have been used the policeman nodded not greatly surprised for he knew the amazing detective ability possessed by doc savage he was slightly abashed however when doc went upstairs to the explosion scene and almost at once turned up the cause of the blast doc did not expend much time on the wreckage itself except to apply chemical tests to some of the powder stains the work of trinitrotoluene he stated huh asked the officer tnt doc elaborated the famous world war explosive oh the bronze man dug into the office walls probing pits made by bits of wreckage and brought out after some work several bits of steel he assembled these studied them we found some of that metal and sent it to a specialist for an opinion said the officer we hoped it would tell us what caused the blast whether it was a bomb or not it was a highexplosive threeinch shell doc said good night the lieutenant exploded you dont mean a cannon ball you might call it that doc assured him except that this was a very modern demolition shell from a threeinch artillery piece but where was it fired from yelled the officer there was an interruption while a sergeant came in with a report that the armored truck had been found a radio car bad come upon the truck abandoned on the water front of the east river no trace of the sinister men in silver garments had been found in the vicinity of the truck nor were there finger prints no one could be found who had seen the truck being abandoned finding it doesnt help us a bit the police lieutenant groaned i would not say that doc told him yes the other queried but how is this going to help according to the newspapers the men in silver robbed another armored truck earlier in the day and took a quarter of a million dollars in cash doc pointed out of course police followed them doc reminded yes and lost them the officer did not finish but swore and snapped his fingers violently exactly doc said the police lost trace of them around the water front of the east river in the same vicinity in which this armored truck was found to be exact the lieutenant shouted ill have every square inch of that area combed do it unobtrusively doc requested of course the officer agreed we will use plainclothes officers and put a flock of stool pigeons to work weve got a swell lot of stool pigeons theyre in nearly every crook hangout in the city youd be surprised what they can turn up do you wager doc asked bet sure on sure things want to bet me that your stool pigeons wont turn up a thing the bronze man asked what makes you think they wont the cop demanded these are not ordinary crooks doc told him and i doubt very much if robberies such as the armored truck holdup this afternoon are the real motive behind the organization of men who use the silver disguises the police lieutenant considered then said ill bet you fifty that the stool pigeons turn up something the winner to contribute the fifty to the police death benefit fund doc said sure a police messenger ran into the room he was animated breathless gugillello bellondi was just murdered by a guy in silver he yelled doc savage demanded who is gugillello bellondi a fisherman who was in a boat in the river at the time of the explosion said the police lieutenant we thought he might have seen the plane flying overhead drop a bomb and we sent a man over to talk to him and our man found him dead said the messenger a woman saw a fellow in a silver suit run out of guglilello bellondis room just before the cop got there the killer got away the lieutenant wailed so far he has the messenger admitted ruefully doc savage put in any line on the plane yes i forgot to tell you the lieutenant pulled out his notebook the flier was gilbert stiles who lives on eightyfifth street in jackson heights what house number doc asked the policeman furnished that information started to ask a question but did not doc savage was already whipping for the door the bronze man reached his roadster once again traffic police opened a lane and the trip north to queensboro bridge thence along northern boulevard to jackson heights was made in astounding time jackson heights was an apartment residential suburb near the north shore of long island not far out there were grass plots around some of the apartments a few trees in the parkways down the center of a street or two doc did not stop directly in front of gilbert stiless home but parked in an adjacent side street under the lazy droop of a weeping willow he swung along the sidewalk reached the corner made a move at turning but instead of doing so continued on with long steps and stopped when he was sheltered behind a parked car docs move was urged by discovery of a man standing beside a shiny blue sedan down the street near where gilbert stiles lived the man was scrawny with traces of grease stain on his bands and face his face was a sickly gray hue resembling a white ball which had been mauled in unclean hands during the past doc savage had visited monks skyscraper chemical laboratory frequently and in doing so had occasionally seen members of the janitorial force the bronze man never forgot a face the man down the street was one of the janitors of monks skyscraper doc bad no way of knowing the individual was bugs murderer of clarence sparks after watching bugs for a moment unobserved doc concluded something was not resting easily on the fellows mind bugs squirmed he smoked innumerable cigarettes he walked about and be glanced frequently at a tall brick apartment building before which the blue sedan stood he even got into the sedan but remained only a moment and climbed out again bugs stood scowling at the apartment house then his pasty face took on an expression of resolve and he went inside doc savage whipped back to his roadster the rumble seat jumped open at his touch upon a button and he dipped in a hand withdrew a small box to which stout spring clamps were secured then he ran to the blue car employing the spring clamps on the box doc clipped the container to the chassis of the car in a spot where it was not likely to be noticed then be followed bugs into the apartment house there was a spanishtype lobby with ornate columns fake iron balconies and a rather threadbare carpet bugs was nowhere in sight nor was there a directory of the tenants to be seen the elevator was automatic you got in and pushed a button marked with the floor to which you wished to be lifted doc listened the lift was running these apartment buildings were all similar in construction doc leaped around a comer found stairs which ran to the basement descended them and located the master electric fuse board he could still hear the low whine of the elevator the sound stopped doc took out the fuse in the power circuit the cage would remain where it was now the bronze man ran up flight after flight of stairs the elevator car was on the sixth floor which happened to be the top story a long hallway was lined with numbered doors doc stood perfectly still listening the bronze man possessed remarkable hearing he used a special scientific device giving forth sound waves above and below the usual audible ranges to develop his aural organs this was a part of a daily twohour routine of intensive exercise which be had not neglected since childhood the exercises were responsible for his physical development for there reposed in his great bronze frame a strength that to many seemed incredible down the corridor a doorknob rattled doc whipped back a niche it probably housed an incinerator door offered concealment he pressed into that he heard the door open feet scuffed doc counted at least six persons all men the clicking of womens high heels are distinctive and there were none of those one man walked far in the lead of the others an instant later the fellow appeared it was bugs he saw doc savage he could not very well help it his eyes flew wide stark horror contorted his face savage he bawled watch out then bugs clawed at his clothing for a gun doc moved with dazzling suddenness flashing out of the niche he drove a fist so that there would be no lasting damage he struck lightly but the blow slammed bugs back against the wall knocking him instantly unconscious the gun he had tried to get into action skidded over the floor tiling doc now faced down the corridorfaced weird inhuman figures forms garbed in grotesque silver garments the footstep count had been good there were five of them bugss yell had warned them three had drawn guns the weapons gushed flame and raised earsplitting thunder in the corridor there was a touch of the unearthly in the speed with which doc savage got back into the niche only fabulous muscles carefully conditioned could manage such blinding motion the bullets missing him gouged plaster off the walls and knocked glass from a window at the corridor end rush him a man in silver squawled thell with that uii i another growled shots almost drowned the words and it was doubtful if the man in charge realized his name had been called uii but doc caught it and filed it mentally for future investigation should he escape he was in a tight spot it was his policy never to carry a gun and he had none now but he did have some of the scientific devices which he used one of these be employed now a hand dipped into a pocket and came out with what might have been mistaken for a glass marble this was actually a thinwalled glass globe and the liquid inside was a chemical concoction which vaporized instantly into an anaesthetic gas the gas was unique in that its effects were immediate and it became ineffective within less than a minute so that doc holding his breath could escape the potent stuff while the unwary breathing it were rendered senseless doc threw the anaesthetic ball rarely had these gas balls failed to catch foes by surprise but this was an exception doc waited holding his breath to escape the vapor but his enemies gave no sign of succumbing they did not however call out again and the clatter of their feet retreated a door slammed they had fled ahead of the gas doc knew from past experience just how quickly a man can shoot at an unexpected target and knew he could get a fleeting glimpse of the corridor without great danger of being shot he looked out the hallway was empty the silver men had gone back into an apartment doc stepped out into the hall ah instant later he flashed backward into the niche for a door had opened and a metal object slightly smaller than a baseball had sailed through no doubt the silver man who hurled it intended for it to stop beside doc but the thing had too much momentum it clattered past then it exploded the concussion almost disrupted the bronze mans eardrums clouds of plaster gushed the big apartment house trembled the ceiling lifted split and came down with a thundering clamor the floor collapsed for some distance doc secure in the niche unhit was enveloped in a cloud of smoke plaster particles and splinters the grenade had been powerful directly in front of him the floor was gone fallen down into the hall below bugss body had been blown back out of sight toward the end of the uproar the door down the hall opened again get him asked the voice which belonged to ull it was a shrill querulously whanging tone uii was not the one looking into the corridor it fixed im said another voice the whole damn corridor is blown to pieces at that point a loud agonized groan sounded whos that asked ull bugs said the other hes butchered up some let me take care of that uii suggested a moment later there was a single deliberate shot and after that the groans no longer ground out hes taken care of said ull what next grunted the other down the fire escape all of you ordered ull weve got to beat the cops away from here doc savage gave ull and his sinister silver aides a few minutes to be on their way the bronze man did not want any more of those grenades thrown women were screaming children crying in the apartment below although it was unlikely that any had been hurt when he considered sufficient time had elapsed doc stepped out of the niche bugs was a slack figure torn a little by the blast and with a bullet hole drilling his head just above the ears ull had made a cold accurate shot in ascertaining that his followers did not live to talk evidently uil had not wanted a wounded man on his hands during the getaway doc shoved open the door through which the grenade had been hurled he stood just inside strange flakegold eyes resting on the deep leather chair in the center of the apartment living room there was a man in the chair but not a living man for his body was stiffly erect probably held that way by the blade of the long knife which had gone through his chest and well into the chair back a book had fallen to the floor beside the dead man and was open at the fly leaf so that the name written there could be deciphered gilbert stiles the name read chapter rapid pace doc savage rested a hand on the mans wrist where there should have been a pulse had he been alive but there was no throb this aviator had been flying over the river when the explosion occurred in paine l winthrops office he must have seen something the fisherman in the boat on the river must have seen the same thing and both had been killed before they could talk or be questioned how had the silver fiends gotten their names doc had a suspicion he had no way of knowing how right it was that bugs was responsible for this but bugs had paid for his part motor roar came up from the street throbbed then receded doc savage did not look out they might see him and it was just as well if they thought him dead for they might become careless the blue car had vanished when the bronze man did glance through the window he stepped out on the fire escape and ran down lightly swiftly and made for his roadster he did not waste time but there was no wild haste in his movements the sudden life in the oil gauge and ammeter was almost all that told when the roadster engine started so silently did it operate the car moved at a touch on the accelerator it was equipped with the most modern of automatic clutches doc touched one of innumerable buttons on the dash then he turned a knurled knob static noises came from a radio speaker under the dash these became terrific as a street car was passed and as doc continued to adjust the knob snatches of voice and telegraph were heard a radio fan would have realized that the bronze man was fishing through the ultrashortwave bands seeking some particular transmitter after a time regular buzzes short dashes repeated at threesecond intervals whizzed from the speaker they were not unlike train signals except more widely spaced and they kept coming steadily doc turned the knob to the right the signals faded he turned back to the left and they faded again setting the knob at the loudest point he eyed a dial above which bore close likeness to a compass card a pointer on this indicated almost due west doc savage drove west the apparatus he had just employed was a radio compass the tiny loop of which was in the roadster rear and operated from the knob by remote control this compact radio directional device was one which doc employed for many uses for instance his five men when working with him used cars which also had transmitters and these were left on at all times by simply turning the directional compass knob doc could locate the nearest of these cars the radio compass had another use as well doc savage had perfected tiny mechanical shortwave transmitters which batteries self contained were little larger than a cigar box these sent out a series of buzzing sounds attached to the containers were clamps by which they could be affixed to various convenient objects doc had as a matter of precaution attached one of the transmitters to the azure sedan the bronze man overlooked few chances in the perilous life he led chances could not be overlooked from time to time a twist of the directional knob as the buzzing signals faded brought the sounds in loud again and gave a check on the direction being taken by the blue machine the chase led to manhattan island downtown to the vehicular tunnel under the hudson thence along the elevated roadway and after a few miles down into a manufacturing district it ended close to the water front when doc savage sighted the sedan empty now parked before an imposing massive steel gate the gate was not of steel bars hut of riveted plates it looked forbidding there was a square aperture in the gate for a watchman to peer through above the gate a sign read winthrops shipyards paine l winthrop president doc savage advanced swiftly and put an eye to the square opening in the gate the shipyard was beyond grotesque in the fog with its cranes material piles and moving booms there seemed to he no work under way just inside the gate a man was sprawled on his back one arm angled across his face in an attitude of grisly slumber the shoulder of his rough suit was sodden with crimson leakage from his head doc gave the door a shove it was unlocked swung back quietly and let him in he examined the man the fellow was old workstooped grayhaired and on his breast was a watchmans badge doc felt his wrist although he could see that the man still breathed some type of bludgeon perhaps a revolver barrel had beaten the watchman down he would be unconscious some time judging from the nature of the wound but was in no immediate danger doc advanced into the shipyard there was some breeze here the fog eddied swept past in nebulous streamers like marching ghosts moisture had been deposited on the packed earth and this slime bore tracks reasoning that the freshest prints were those of the sinister men in silver garb doc followed them the tracks progressed in a direct manner which indicated a definite objective they ended at the door of a massive brick building evidently housing the offices doc waited outside listening gray fog around about made his great frame seem larger more formidable the gloom of early evening was pressing down bringing the clammy murk of a waterlogged catacomb a trial of the door showed it locked but a moments work with a thin steel probe tripped the tumblers a professional locksmith would have been slightly stunned at the swiftness with which the lock was solved inside was denser murk mingled with it the faint heat from radiators which bubbled against the fog chill there was a desk telephone and hard wooden waiting benches a flyspecked calendar was crooked on the wall doc advanced passed through an open door found worn wooden steps which led upward but he did not mount immediately instead he dipped a hand into a pocket and brought out what might have been mistaken for a handful of black clover seed he strewed some of this on the floor of the outer office then he went up the stairs at the first landing he found a door open beyond was an office fitted up more luxuriously the desk drawers were open the papers within littered up as if they had been gone through hastily a curl of smoke arose from a metal smoking stand which stood beside the desk doc went over to it the smouldering objects were old cigar and cigarette stubs which had been ignited by hits of burning paper dropped into the stand the bronze man examined the charred paper fragments blueprints he decided the print had been torn into fractional sections each burned separately and the ash crushed even his consummate skill was unequal to telling what nature of diagram had been on the blueprints the burning had been done within the last few minutes however and the care with which it had been done indicated sinister motives doc dropped the ashes he stood very still listening prom below came a loud report it was like a shot three more followed there was a cry strangled inarticulate doc savage did not go back down the stairs but whipped instead to a window he managed to get it up without noise that could be heard downstairs from inside his clothing came an object he always carried a thin stout silk cord affixed to the end of which was a folding grapple of lightness and strength the grapple hooked to the inner edge of the window sill held his weight as he slid outside and down the silk line he went slowly supported by the incredible strength in his metallic hands a few feet to the left of the spot where he touched the ground there was a window it allowed a look into the reception room the glass pane was grimy that with the fog and darkness made vision difficult the outlines inside hazy but there was one point cleaner than the other sections of the glass through the clear section doc could distinguish his flakegold eyes peered closely a small flat automatic pistol a vest pocket caliber gun a thin hand encased in a suede glove held it doc brought out a handkerchief doubled it spread it over his knuckles but did not wrap it around so that it would interfere with his fingers he struck glass splintered the cloth protected his knuckles but did not interfere when his arm went through the window and his corded fingers gripped the gun hand coat fabric over the bronze mans arm bulged slightly as great muscles exerted tension inside a shriek piped out the gun fell from a hand made nerveless by the steel pinch of docs fingers doc knocked more glass out of the window found the lock twisted it then released his victim long enough to get the sash up and hound inside the victim was on all fours clawing for the dropped automatic doc nudged the weapon away with a toe the woman on the floor not until he had seized her gun arm had doc been sure it was a woman looked up angrily and gritted why didnt you just shoot me thats what you tried before she was a vision in suede not only were her gloves suede but her pumps and the pert saucy riding beret a wealth of brown hair her frock was almost the gray of the suede making with her gray bag an ensemble studied yet extremely striking the garments set off some intriguing curves and the picture was aided by a pair of exquisite eyes a nose bordering on the retrousse and rosebud lips which trembled a little with rage and fear doc gave the beauty an impersonal eye then he glanced at the floor on the boards of the floor lay the numerous particles which resembled black clover seed just as doc had left them except in four spots where there were scorched spots it looked as if firecrackers had gone off on the floor the entrancing young woman got to her feet in doing so she stepped on one of the clover seeds there was a loud report as it exploded she jumped and glared at doc what are those things she snapped and put a hand up to adjust her luxuriant brown hair just a precaution to warn if any one was following me doc told her the girl fingered in her hair thrusting in her fingers patting suddenly she took her hand down she pointed it at doc the hand held the twin to the small automatic which doc had caused her to drop your precaution she said is not going to do you much good the girls arm was out rigid the gun pointed at about the middle button of docs vest and because her arm was tense her gray sleeve was drawn off a whitegold wrist watch he could hear the animated clicking of the watch tiny as the sound was this may be a mistake doc told her it will he a mistake if you make any move that i dont order she informed him doc asked there has been a previous attempt to kill you and you think i had a part in it the girl seemed fascinated by the eerie quality of the bronze mans eyes i cant prove it was you she said why not the man who shot at me had some kind of a silvercolored suit on she answered he had a silver mask too when did this happen the attempt to shoot me yesterday yesterday evening about this time she moved her gun meaningly but it still pointed at the center of docs vest i went right out and bought me two guns and dont get the idea i cant use them i was born and raised in montana why doc asked her should a man in silver try to kill you her gun remained steady that is what i would like to know doc savage studied her as if trying to read her mind then slowly but firmly he walked forward ill shoot the girl shrilled but doc came on and she did not fire but retreated biting her lips in vexation until she was against the wall the bronze man reached out and removed the gun from her hand without difficulty you fool she flared you dont know how near i came to killing you your peashooter doc advised her would not have dented my bulletproof vest she had tucked her bag high under an arm so that it had not fallen throughout the encounter she did not resist when he took the bag there was a folder of business cards inside they read miss lorna zane private secretary to paine l winthrop lorna doc asked miss zane to you she snapped silently doc extended the bag after noting there was nothing else in it other than a metal powder box almost full the girl took the bag absently opened it then apparently got a big idea she flipped the powder case open and dashed the cosmetic flakes at docs eye but she had not counted on the blinding speed with which the bronze man could move he ducked and the powder shooting over his shoulder spread in a cloud over the room the girl tried to flee doc grasped her arm she screamed from fright since he could not have been hurting her from behind doc came a loud report as a black pellet on the floor exploded there was a second bang a third doc whirled turning the bronze man saw first the chair big and heavy it clubbed in a whining arc for his head doc threw head and shoulders back through the air turned sidewise the chair missed him snapped buttons off his vest such was its speed and broke itself into fragments on the floor blast me youre lightning in chains rapped the man who had swung the chair blast me lightning in chains the man gave the impression of something operated by electricity his words actually gobbled such was their high pressure speed his arms moved as if driven by a clockwork which had lost its governor he stabbed a hand at his coat pocket weighty hang of his coat on that side indicated a gun doc lunged he was fast but this other man had speed too he brought his left fist up in a terrific blow it landed flush on docs jaw the other waited expectantly his mouth fell open and his eyes flew wide when doc did not drop he looked scared but desperate incredible he exploded incredible yes it is he started another blow but he was not as fortunate this time docs left hand drifted out pushed and the fellow upset as he went down docs other hand grasped his coat pocket and wrenched half of the mans coat was torn off with it the pocket and the gun which it held ill be damned the man exclaimed with staccato rapidity ill be damned yes i will damned doc ignored him for the girl was running to get the automatic which she had first held when doc swept across the floor and got the weapon first she grimaced angrily and backed into a corner the man of staccato speech came up from the floor like a suddenly awakened cat he bounced backward warily as if apprehensive of encountering doc again his hands and lower lip trembled who are you he clipped who are you thats what i want to know doc savage the bronze man said that explains it gulped the other it sure does doc glanced at the girl who is this fellow he asked harry pace is the name answered the man for himself yes sir pace people call me rapid rapid pace get it efficiency thats pace you bet efficiency he the girl said dryly is paine l winthrops efficiency expert the young woman had undergone a marked change she wore a somewhat sheepish expression so you are doc savage she added i have heard so much about you that i began to think you were a legend yes sir youre almost a legend mr savage said rapid pace yes sir a legend why did you try to club me with that chair doc asked him a mistake pace clattered all a mistake you see i was protecting lorna efficiency on all occasions that is me docs flakegold eyes probed have you seen any silver deathsheads around the shipyard he asked good night rapid pace stuttered what arc you talking about the floor seemed to jump a little under their feet a loud thump accompanied this phenomenon several windows in the building evidently broke they could hear the glass jangling bless me gulped rapid pace what was that stay here doc rapped and whipped for the stairs rapid pace started after him stepped on one of the explosive particles on the floor gave a wild jump and trembled furiously dear me he choked my nerves arent going to stand this no sir stay with miss zane doc directed then the bronze man vanished up the stairs his going as silent and swift as the progress of a galeswept tendril of fog rapid pace eyed lorna zane and said hurriedly lorna im worried what is this all about i do not know said the girl grimly if anything would happen to you i think i id die pace said earnestly the young woman studied him i doubt it she said dryly now dont joke lorna pace pleaded you know im crazy about you yes sir crazy why dont you like me you get scared too easy said lorna you go off half cocked i cant help it pace groaned and you talk too much lorna continued you say everything twice and you could get along with half as much conversation im trying to stop that too pace assured her well well see how you improve lorna told him they strained their ears but did not hear doc savage for the bronze man was moving with an uncanny quiet through the upper floors of the building he swung down a corridor angled right and found the building was much larger than it had seemed there were numerous hallways in fact the place was a labyrinth doc came unexpectedly to a room which was very large there were rows of desks many judging from the lack of wastebaskets and absence of other paraphernalia not at present in use others were seeing service evidently the winthrop shipyards had once done more business than at present across the room was a safe huge and battered with flakes of the black paint scaled off by long usage but there was more wrong with the safe than scuffed paint the door of the strong box was off and reposed on the floor papers the former contents of the safe were scattered about a biliouslooking cloud of smoke eddied above the wreckage and there was the itching tang of burned nitro in the air the safe being blown open was undoubtedly what they had heard downstairs chapter mysterious blueprints doc savage did not expend time examining the safe but whipped to the left found a door open and went through the hallway beyond led him several yards and turned conveying him back the way he had come toward the stairs and the front door an excited staccato yell sounded rapid paces voice a gun made an ugly roar lorna zane shrilled something unin telligible doc changed his course found a window and got it up as silently as was consistent with slashing speed more than a dozen feet that drop below he made it easily tremendous leg muscles cushioning his landing an instant later he was at a corner it chanced to be the one nearest the gate lorna zane and rapid pace were running across the shipyard striving to reach the shelter of a pile of steel ship frames neither looked back but gave all attention to sprinting a gun whacked im hit pace grabbed his arm im hit but he did not glance back and both he and the girl dived behind the frames another shot slammed the lead made a belling noise on the steel frames get that damned girl yelled the voice of the silver deathshead member called uii feet pounded doc stepped from his concealment the group in the weird silver garments and masks which he had followed here were running for the frame pile guns ready over the thin cloth of woven alloy metal which protected his body doc savage wore a most unusual vest a garment of many pockets compartments rather padded so that they were unnoticeable from one of these he extracted a metal vial the padded interior of which held metallic objects about the size of cherries he flung one of these ahead of the charging silver killers it struck there was a blinding flash a terrific crack of a noise which left ears ringing two silver men were upset by the blast uii he was prudently not leading the charge yelled the girl must have grenades get her in the gloom it was impossible to tell from where the thrown object had come they renewed the charge there was a second flash and a rapping crash this one knocked fully half of the group down even ull was upset and a bundle he was carrying flipped from his arms the bundle was long round azuretinted at the edges tied with cord and sealed with wax a bundle of blueprints undoubtedly ull scrambled after the prints as if they meant his very life their merely getting out of his hands seemed to change his whole plan let the girl go he howled the big boss said to get these prints and thats our job we do not want to lose them after all the trouble we had getting them out of that safe back men well leave here before some one calls the police the silver men retreated firing freely at the pile of massive steel frames scrambling over the keel of a partially completed small vessel they made for the gate working around a tractor a mobile derrick and other machinery one produced a flashlight and employed it to aid their flight they reached the gate it was locked hell snarled uii and glared at the watchman who was still unconscious i thought we left this unlocked the fastening of the solid metal sheet was a bar affair and this was jammed very tightly but they got it back and shoved out into the waterfront street with frantic haste they piled into their blue sedan well go to gardners home next barked uli the car engine backfired came to life and the machine wailed its tires on the fogdamp pavement then rocketed away there were shadows close to the wall outside the gate very dark shadows and the men in the silver regalia had neglected to examine them thereby they had missed an important discovery the layer of damp murk seemed to swell then condense and materialize into a bronze figure of giant size this occurred at a point no more than fifteen feet from where the sedan had been parked doc taking advantage of the night and the fog had beaten the silver men to the gate gotten through jammed the lock by the handle outside and concealed himself uiis bark well go to gardners home next had reached his ears doc had taken a good deal of trouble to avoid showing himself for it was well that the silver men continue thinking they had killed him at the apartment of the unfortunate flier gilbert stiles finding his two men monk and ham rescuing them if they were still alive punishing their murderers if they were dead was docs immediate task eventually these silver men probably would lead him to his objective once again he could follow them by the radio directional device doc did not take up the chase immediately he ran back into the shipyard lorna zane came cautiously from behind the steel pile rapid pace once sure the coast was clear bounded out like an excited cricket he waved his arms and began to talk like a phonograph which had lost its governor indicating a mere scratch on his shoulder an outrage he yelled yes sir an outrage a mystery too a very black mystery a most confounding affair doc ignored him and asked the girl do you know what was in that large safe upstairs i should know she replied i am the only one who has the combination doc gestured come on as they ran into the brick office building lorna zane said angrily i do not understand this why should those men try to kill me what position do you hold here doc asked her i really manage the shipyard she explained although i am only secretary to paine l winthrop that might explain it said doc the young woman glanced sharply at the bronze man a strange light in her entrancing eyes what do you mean doc savage seemed not to have heard the question and they soon reached the large room where the safe had been blown open will you see what is missing the bronze man requested and indicated the rifled strong box lorna zane went through the strewn contents of the safe picking up packages dropping them inspecting letters the inventory did not take her long only one thing is missing she decided doc watched her closely what is it a sealed roll a blueprint which paine l winthrop gave me nearly four months ago to lock in this safe for him said the attractive young woman blueprint of what the girl hesitated there was something strange about that i got explicit orders not to look at it and it was sealed so no snooper could open it without that fact being apparent i have no idea what it was doc nodded the blueprint seems to have a sinister importance lorna zane bit her lip uncertainly then said there was another strange thing last spring mr winthrop gave all his regular employees a fivemonths vacation with pay that was queer because he usually did not give vacations with pay i came back four months ago when you came back did you notice anything doc asked there had been a great deal of work done in the shipyard the girl replied but when i got back whatever bad been built was gone and no workmen remained come on doc directed well talk as we ride i wonder if the vacations could have anything to do with this rapid pace mumbled you know i got one too yes it was swell they retired to the bronze mans roadster all three occupied the commodious front seat and the machine lunged away the buzzing radio directional device gave them a line on the blue sedan doc drove swiftly silently for a time so as to decrease the lead of the sedan the radio transmitter under the car of the silver men would only carry a few miles did winthrop have the combination of the safe which held the mysterious blueprint doc asked the girl shook her head no why is that that is what i was wondering said rapid pace yes i was wondering in the gloom it was much darker now the girls rather inviting lips compressed into an angry line i virtually manage the shipyard she snapped there are many details to which paine l winthrop does not give close attention the combination of that safe happens to be one of them the tires on the roadster were designed with a tread which prevented as much as possible the usual wail present at high speed the engine was still silent although turning at high speed sway and pitch of the car the blur of lighted buildings on their side told of their true momentum doc savage said suddenly paine l winthrop is dead did you know that the girl became very quiet in her comer of the seat she separated her lips as if to speak seemed to reconsider and closed them slender hands tangled and untangled on her lap rapid pace started up in the seat at the words groped for expression and burst out the old boys heart eh his heart sure i knew it would get him sooner or later it was not his heart doc corrected it was a threeinch highexplosive shell fired from a spot as yet not definitely determined for once rapid pace did not repeat himself this is very mystifying he muttered do either of you have any idea of what is behind it all doc asked not i said rapid pace nor i murmured the girl doc adjusted the directional apparatus knob the procession of buzzing was louder docs metallic features showed no trace of concern but he did not resume the questioning he slowed the roadster for the increasing loudness of the signals indicated he was coming up rapidly on the sender then he turned sharply to the right the roadster pitching over ruts muddy water flying from puddles he stopped they were on a side road brush walled them in the headlights glinted on blue doc slackened speed rolled up windows especially designed in the doors of the roadster and which were of bulletproof glass the car body engine hood radiator were all protected by armor plate the machine ahead was the blue sedan empty using a flashlight doc located tracks it seemed that the silver men had gone back along the road afoot following the trail closely doc progressed to the main thoroughfare and down that footprints were faint in the fog damp on the pavement to a drug store before which there was a taxi stand as a matter of precaution the silver men had abandoned their easily recognized sedan doc savage secured from the drug store clerk a description of the taxi driver who frequented that stand the driver was an elderly man distinctive because of a great drooping white mustache the clerk had not seen the men who had taken the taxi although he had heard the hack depart only a few minutes before thirty minutes later doc savage pulled the roadster to a stop before an elaborately modernistic building on the more elite section of park avenue instead of one doorman there were two and they were caparisoned in uniforms somewhat more distinctive than doormen elsewhere on this possibly the most expensive street in the world what now lorna zane asked curiously eying the imposing structure i am going to leave you here doc told her lorna nipped her lower lip with white teeth havent i anything to say about that your life is in danger doc told her you will be safe here what about me rapid pace clattered yes what about me you stay in the car doc directed the bronze man escorted lorna zane into the building they received much attention the doormen collaborating efficiently in ushering them inside there was a waiting room a bewildering resplendence of chromium enamel and colored rugs a stately exquisitely formed young woman ushered them to comfortable chairs she was a blonde a redhead equally as shapely brought them a tray of iced drinks a young lady with black tresses popped up with the most fashionable magazines whew said lorna what is this anyway doc did not answer but watched another young woman who was approaching the attendants who had waited upon doc and lorna were striking but they were completely overshadowed by the newcomer this entrancing venus had bronze hair of a hue remarkably like docs hello pat doc greeted the bronzehaired beauty this is lorna zane lorna this is pat savage my cousin pat shook hands with lorna then waved an airy hand this is the first time you have been here doc she said i want to show you the gymnasium upstairs its a knockout and i have over thirty beauty operators at work all highly skilled i already have all the fashion leaders on my list waiting to have their youthful figures restored how i am going to reduce some of those heavyweights is a mystery to me but they pay me in advance busy doc asked busy pat laughed say this business of running a combination beauty salon and gymnasium is no joke you bet im busy at this point a customer departed a fat man whose countenance was still flushed from a facial and whose sparse hair had undoubtedly been curled men on my clientele too pat smiled but i do not know whether they come to have their looks improved or to flirt with my snappy assistants want to help me pat doc asked help you pat said cheerfully do i want to fly the atlantic do i want to stand up and get shot at do i want to go in for parachute jumping ail of those are safer than helping you do you want to help doc repeated sure pat laughed who is trying to kill you now miss lorna zane here is the one in danger this time doc explained and briefly outlined what had occurred pat savage listened with profound interest pat liked excitement and had aided doc on other occasions she had even tried to join docs group of assistants had been turned down because doc considered it no life for the socalled gentler sex and had started this elaborate beauty establishment to keep herself occupied rapid pace was walking rapidly back and forth beside the roadster when doc joined him down in the street i am puzzled clipped the highpressure efficiency expert yes deeply puzzled what i want to know is this how are we going to find those silver devils through an order their leader ull gave doc said what was the order pace questioned swiftly something about going to an individual named gardner doc told him oh oh gulped pace gardner bedford burgess gardner did you say who is bedford burgess gardner doc countered gardner is owner of transatlantic lines the ocean line which was paine l winthrops chief rival until lately when there has been talk of the two companies merging said pace using what for him was an extraordinarily long sentence gardner is we will go to gardners home doc said briskly i happen to know where he lives said pace yes i know he has a lolapaloosa of a place a lolapaloosa the lolapaloosa was a cluster of white buildings which stood like big dice atop a green hill that shouldered up impressively from the hudsons tranquil blue ribbon some miles north of new york city the mansion itself was palatial modeled after the lines of mount vernon with tall white columns near by were smaller buildings in imitation of old slave huts the stables were large and back of them a private race track looped around a private flying field on which stood a hangar also ingeniously colonial the river edge at the foot of the hill boasted boat houses and a seaplane hangar also colonial there was no fog this far north it seemed to be present only along the sea and the sky was comparatively free of clouds so that moonlight spilled down giving doc savage and rapid pace sufficient illumination to look over the ground pace said a lolapaloosa didnt i tell you yes sir a quiet said doc who was getting tired of the efficiency experts repetitive manner of speaking they had left the roadster a short distance from the palatial estate and they were approaching on foot they were on a driveway which was barked on either side by black ominous brush a small red point of light appeared ahead they used more caution came close and perceived a taxi the tail light illuminated the license a new jersey plate probably the machine the silver men took when they abandoned their sedan in new jersey doc imparted doc rounded the cab saw it was empty and they advanced through the shrubbery until they came to a stretch of lawn which was closecropped and somewhat glassy with dew beyond was the house ample impressive almost unnaturally white makes me think of a bone pace shivered yes sir a white bone what do you know about bedford burgess gardner doc asked a mysterious person said pace a very mysterious person what do you mean he rarely gets out pace explained offhand i cannot recall any one who has seen him he does not keep offices downtown and all his business is transacted by telephone they say he is a strange person who does not like any one around him they even say his servants do not live here that he makes them leave every evening before dark wealthy doc queried within the last year his company has merged with other shipping concerns until he is the most powerful shipping magnate in america unless i am mistaken said pace ever see him doc asked no sir said pace didnt i just tell you that very few people have ever seen the old codger old an old wreck from what i hear said pace they say what they said never did come out however from the white house exploded a shout hollow because it was inside guttural with fright the cry repeated a door banged open spilling white light it had opened on a small balcony some fifteen feet up on the side of the mansion a figure reeled through the door it was a man who made a grotesque form against the glitter from within his age must have been near forty and his face even from that distance radiated terror he wore the uniform of a taxi driver the man was fleeing obviously he endeavored to get over the balcony railing then a gun banged hollowly inside the house bullet impact kicked the taxi driver around so that he fell across the balcony rail teetered a moment then was carried over by momentum there was a concrete sidewalk below and the driver struck that squarely on top of his head which would have killed him had the bullet not done so already chapter the indians head doc savage heard a fluttering sound beside him looked around and saw that rapid pace seemed to be in the grip of a violent chill his shaking was oscillating a bough of the bush against which they stood suddenly pace dived for the nearest cover disappearing like a frightened rabbit doc ran for the house angling to the right keeping low so that he could not be glimpsed by the gunman inside the balcony door the house seemed to grow in proportions as he came near it the structure was very large a side door which he approached was locked but docs thin metal probe gave him silent quick admission the darkness inside swallowed him a few feet inside he turned into a room where the carpet was thick soft he caught breathing sounds uneasy jerking after a few seconds feet shuffled on the carpet doc moved like a wraith his tendonwrapped bands lashed out and closed on arms the struggle was brief there was a soft thump evidently of a gun falling doc released his captive leaped back got the gun then found a light switch and clicked it on he studied the individual who was revealed in the brilliant flood it was a man a weird figure stooped almost double the man had a black beard slightly larger than a vandyke which made his lower face a dark bundle of fur the eyes were squinted to the thinnest of slits not even the color of the orbs were distinguishable the bent bearded figure scuttled back stooped over almost falling but managed to pick up a heavy cane which leaned against a chair then he glared at doc from his slitted eyes silence persisted for a few seconds then the thick beard bobbed as the other nodded doc savage he said in a coarse quavering voice ive seen you somewhere before or maybe it was your picture doc ejected cartridges from the gun it was an automatic none of the shells had been fired he threw the cartridges cut of an open window and placed the weapon on a stand near a telephone doc never employed a gun although he was a skilled marksman if need arose whats going on here he asked who are you the bearded man answered the last question first i am gardner what happened doc repeated the coarse voice quavered i shall tell that to the police i doc pointed out have a police commission this is westchester county bedford burgess gardner growled you may have a new york commission but it will do you no good here it is a state trooper commission doc advised gardner thought that over while the cane trembled a little under his nervous weight you go to hell he suggested finally and also clear out of here i do not like people around me at night there was noise outside footsteps and rapid paces voice called out nervously when doc answered him pace came in gardner pointed a shaking hand at pace and grated you get out too pace asked who killed the taxi driver doc eyed gardner who did i dont know gardner wailed i dont know anything about it thats going to make it tough for you said pace yes sir gardner lifted his cane and started for pace pace leaped back and doc was forced to move aside to get out of his way changing his course suddenly gardner moved for the door nerves overwrought at what he considered an intrusion of his home he left the room in haste doc disappointed at the results of the inquiry started for the hallway followed by pace there was no sign of gardner now until they heard sounds from above scuffing scraping sounds they ran up a flight of stairs doc had his flashlight out a moment later they dived through a door into the room that faced on the balcony on the floor lay the cane gardner had carried near it were wet crimson spots a chair was upset been a fight said pace a fight sure but was it the taxi driver or was gardner being seized is this gardners blood or the taxi drivers thats the question doc savage lunged forward swooped and picked up a shiny limp fragment from the floor it was a bit of silver cloth ragged as if torn from one of the weird garments of the mysterious silver men they got gardner pace muttered or did they doc savage glided to the nearest door opened it and went through pace slow in following reached the door and seemed frightened by the darkness beyond he squirmed uncertainly his habitual nervousness even more pronounced the upshot of his hesitancy was that pace instead of following doc went back upstairs and got the gun which doc had taken from gardner then pace eased from the room and through the darkened house the automatic ready in his hand a grim expression on his features some moments later in the murk beside one of the imitation slave houses which stood near the white mansion a sinister meeting occurred there was an elaborate garden about the slave cabins with tall flowering plants arrayed in neat rows these formed an ideal concealment for furtive comings and goings two silver men were just being joined by a third uii one of the two whispered suspiciously drawing a gun yes its me uii hissed the newcomer did you see who was breaking them doors down asked the other replacing his gun in its holster its doc savage grated ull but i thought i know uii snarled he must have avoided that grenade at the fliers apartment he is not dead the first man swore quietly briefly then what are we going to do if we hadnt shot that taxi driver when he tried to run uii considered a harridan figure in his allenveloping disguise of silver which shimmered slightly in the moonlight everything else has turned out all right he said finally the safest thing for us to do is leave here the rest of our party went on ahead did they not they did said the first uli gave the fellow a shove then get a move on we will join them the three furtive figures had taken scarcely a step when they were brought up by a voice it came from the slave hut window you fools said this new speaker you are overlooking a chance two of the silver men started violently and wrenched out weapons uii grabbing at their arms swore in an angry whisper this is the master he grated the other two obviously had never heard the voice before but at uiis words they seemed profoundly impressed you mean the big shot who is behind all this one stuttered uii ignored him and addressed the window behind which the unseen speaker lurked you say we are overlooking a chance what is it and what are you doing here an opportunity to get rid of doc savage said the voice from the window murk and never mind what i am doing here but it is too risky to rush him uii protested the man is a walking storehouse of scientific weapons twice as many men as i have could not overcome him the tone of the concealed mastermind took on an edge you do not underrate an enemy do you not if i can help it said uii and i have seen this fellow work to rush him would be too dangerous i am going to throw you a package said the voice inside the cabin catch it an instant later a small packet sailed out into the moonlight and uli cupped it successfully in a silvergloved palm the parcel seemed to be a bottle carefully wrapped for it gurgled as it hit uiis hand come close under the window the unseen chief directed i want to give you explicit directions uii crept near and their voices dropped so that even the two who waited near by in the garden the two who had been with uii could not hear what was said these two kept eyes avidly on the window for they had never seen this mysterious chief this sinister one of great ingenuity who was their real leader nor did they see him now the fellow did not show himself inside the big white house doc savage was pushing his search for some sign of gardner or the silver men doc did not use undue haste for that in the perilous career which he led was synonymous with risking sudden death he heard sounds after a time some one moving he waited the prowler seemed to be coming from outdoors the bronze man used his sensitive ears to their fullest noting particularly the number of nervous moves which the skulker made this identified the man pace he said quietly rapid pace emitted a loud gasp and struck a match he seemed relieved at sight of doc i have been looking for you he gulped yes sir looking for you i was outside where did you get the gun doc questioned pace glanced down at his weapon it is the one gardner had i got it i had no cartridges of course but just holding the gun kind of makes me feel more well brave hear anything of gardner doc asked pace denied this and they continued their hunt in company the efficiency expert seemed never to run out of conversation and he began whispering his personal opinion in the darkness until doc reminded him that the noise would make an excellent target i think gardner is behind all this pace breathed and fell silent they moved outdoors kept to the shadowbanked side of the house and moved to the right toward the spot where the body of the murdered taxi driver had fallen doc peered around a corner for an instant the bronze mans weird trilling note came into being hardly audible it trailed up and down the musical scale fantastic in its vague similitude to the cadence of an exotic tropical bird it had been brought forth by surprise over the prone form of the slain cab driver crouched a second silver figure this individual held a glass bottle he was sprinkling the contents on the clothing of the corpse doc stepped into view the silver man looked up bleated and threw the bottle doc whipped back to let it go past a few drops of liquid showering from the bottle as it gyrated spilled on the bronze mans coat doc promptly wrenched the coat off lunging for the silver figure as he did so the silver man ran but his pace was wild with haste his metallic garment slightly clumsy and he stumbled down on all fours he slapped twisting his head over his shoulder he saw that doc was almost upon him beside the silver man was a low basement window without thought of glass cuts he rolled into the window knocked the sash out with head and shoulders and vanished within doc savage flung his coat aside and rapped at pace keep away from that coat dont touch the body either pace barked but what contact poison doc shouted an acid and some sort of toxin in solution a trick to kill whoever touched the corpse the last words were lost in a crashing noise as doc kicked the basement sash out and dived inside he hit the concrete floor lightly let the rebound carry him to one side flame plunged through the basement murk a yardlong tongue powder bellow accompanied it the bullet made a hammering sound against the wall doc seeing darkness with his hands found a chair with one leg missing he shied it at the gun flame source but got only the noise of the chair striking the gunman had shifted position came a dull patpatpat noise and doc looking up through the window saw rapid paces head and shoulders recede in the moonlight the efficiency expert was living up to his name he was fleeing across the lawn the situation had gotten the best of his nerves doc advanced under cover of the sound he passed the spot where the powder fumes were thickest and made for the opposite side of the basement the quarry would be over there somewhere bending low doc drifted a hand over the concrete floor like most basements this one was covered with a film of gritty dust the stuff did not grind audibly under docs shoe soles because they were of rubber not ordinary rubber but the soft sponge variety but the grit would make sound under ordinary shoes even rubber heels of the prosaic type as doc had hoped the grit gave the silver man away doc heard the fellow drift slowly nearer through the gloom when the man was near the bronze giant leaped doc did not flail blows or try to hold the man he simply found the fellows neck and grasped the back of it with corded fingers doc savage was skilled in many lines but easily his greatest knowledge was in the field of surgery of human anatomy he knew the location of certain nerve centers on which pressure properly applied produced a temporary paralysis the silver man went limp under docs fingers doc called through the smashed window pace everything is all right it was not a desire for paces company that moved doc to call the efficiency expert with his aggravating habit of repeating half of what he said was as tiresome a companion as doc could recall encountering pace was shy on nerve as well but doc wanted to keep all threads of this weird mystery of the silver man as closely at hand as possible and pace might be one of the threads rapid pace appeared at the basement window after giving the poisoned corpse a wide berth another man might have been sheepish over the recent show of cowardice but not pace i was looking for another weapon said pace you know a club or something doc said nothing but used his flashlight to locate a switch which filled the basement with light then he went to the man in silver and stripped off the hooded mask a rather square stupid face was revealed the eyes were ugly the mouth twisted in a perpetual sneer a typical crook said rapid pace yes typical doc searched the fellow but found nothing to indicate the mans name the fellow unable to move or speak because of the weird paralysis could only glare doc turned him over adjusted the thick neck and exerted pressure with skilled finger tips the results were amazing the victim began to squirm in an endeavor to sit up lemme go he snarled fear rasped in his coarse voice and he stared at docs hands at the sinews that were like bundled cables there are two things i want to know doc told him quietly thell wit yer snarled the thug what happened to my two aides monk and ham where are they now doc spoke slowly and the ominous undertones of his great voice caused the listener on the floor to cringe involuntarily that is the first thing i want to know the second is what is behind all of this melodramatic business of the silver disguises the evilfaced man wet his lip nervously hesitated then snarled i dunno a ting shelp me hit him mr savage suggested rapid pace his type cannot stand physical pain yer been takin in de movies sneered the other can take all yer got hold him mr savage pace urged ill try busting him one on the nose hey what doc lashing out an arm upset pace simultaneously the basement quaked with gun sound a shot had been fired from the window not at pace but at doc himself the slug smashed against docs bulletproof vest despite his great physique air was driven from his lungs and he was half turned a long lunge carried him to the shelter of a cellar pillar rapid pace was safe where he had been propelled by docs shove there was movement at the window a pistol came gyratmg through the air and landed on the lap of the man doc had been questioning no words were spoken none were needed the fellow clutched the gun avidly and wheeled in docs direction the bronze man seemed for a moment caught between two fires if he left the shelter of the pillar he would be in range from the window and the marksman would be intelligent enough to shoot at his head this time the thug on the floor heaved up for a deliberate aim doc flattened closer to the pillar his right hand seemed to vanish so swiftly did it move it dipped into his coat and came out with the only weapon at hand the collapsible grappling hook with its silken cord the cord was wound tightly around the hook adding weight to it doc threw the device threw it with all the violence he could muster from tremendous thews the gunmans hand was not a difficult target any baseball pitcher of ability should have been able to hit it the thug howled his gun knocked from his band skittered toward rapid pace the man on the floor peered abruptly at his hands it was as if he were surprised by something he had discovered on the somewhat grimy paws then he began to scream his voice held terror pace reached for the gun which had been tossed to the thug dont doc rapped and pace jerked his hand back stared stupidly at doc then at the thug on the floor and his eyes flew wide with horror the thug was becoming mottled of face he made gagging sounds a hideous foam came to his lips and he twisted with a convulsive violence that gun stuff off corpse on handle he choked doc took a chance leaped and broke the one electric light bulb with a snap of his hand darkness descended there was no shooting from the window the person outside evidently having departed doc wheeled back and seized the stricken man then moved him to the shelter of the pillar your chance to get back at them doc said rapidly the grip of the gun that was tossed to you was smeared with some of the poison you were putting on the body it was a trick to kill you to shut you up just on the chance that you would fail to get me damn damn ull the groveling man choked what you want know where are my two assistants monk and ham doc rapped indians head mumbled the man where doc asked the stricken one was having difficulty with his words the strange poison seemed to work with uncanny speed the indians head both there he labored what is this indians head doc demanded but the man seemed not to hear uli not brains back of silver deathsheads he said and the words seemed to come from a bag which had leaked almost empty who is the chief doc snapped there was no answer the bronze man made a brief examination he was careful not to touch the hands with which the other had gripped the gun tossed to him from the window dead doc said chapter the big mystery heavy silence hung in the gloomy basement outside there was no sound hut the faint shuffle of night breeze in the shrubbery in the distance a dog moonbayed mournfully then far up the hudson a boat whistle blew a deep note doc savage glided to the window careful not to disturb the broken glass on the floor inside he heard nothing a quick glance showed him no one the bronze man did not go outside through the window for that would be inviting a shot instead he ascended stairs worked through hallways and let himself out through a rear door he began a search he found no one the gunman who had fired through the window had disappeared not a difficult task since there had been time for him to flee back in the house doc addressed rapid pace do you want to stay here and watch things until the police arrive rapid pace shuddered so violently that he almost fell down stay with these two dead men he gulped not me no sir doc however had decided the efficiency expert was a liability there will probably be much more violence before i find my two men monk and ham be pointed out pace groaned i shall take my chances with you yes with you you seemed to bear a charmed life just being around you braces my shhh admonished doc listen the breeze made leaves flutter outside the basement window the dog was still baying the moon in the far distance chunk the sound was dull as if soft dough had been dropped on a board chunk it came again the silver deaths heads havent ggone pace stuttered come doc rapped and swung up the stairs that led to the second floor they heard the sound again more of a hollow thumping this time it came from the front from a bedroom doc swung into the chamber across it and opened a closet door a man fell out he was bound and gagged and had been making the noises by thumping the door with his head doc untied him and extracted the gag the man was a powerful handsome fellow in his early thirties his hair was dark and thick a bit shiny with a pleasantly aromatic oil and the sideburns in front of his ears were cut not squarely across but slanting his complexion was as perfect as a womans his eyelashes were long but his strapping physique kept him from seeming unnaturally pretty rapid pace took one look at the stranger and groaned hugh mccoy of all people you have seen him before doc demanded i have seen entirely too much of him pace said gloomily he has been hanging around the shipyard a lot lately er lorna zane was the attraction yes she was the attraction hugh mccoy managed to get up on his feet although his muscles apparently were cramped he rubbed and kneaded himself briskly it became apparent that his suit was of most expensive tailoring what happened to you doc asked him mccoy studied the bronze man briefly then said some one leaped onto me from behind and overpowered me who was it doc asked it must have been bedford burgess gardner mccoy snapped doc indicated the door we will talk while moving two of my men have been seized by silver deathsheads and everything but their rescue is secondary but you havent got a clue to where your two men may be rapid pace protested that man in the basement did gasp something about an indians head but i do not see how that is going to help you doc ignored that said hurry and they clattered down the stairs and out into the night swung boldly across the lawn and reached docs roadster without anything happening the machine chased the white funnels of its own headlights through the night like a quiet black ghost hurtling after some lustrous siren you saw gardner attack you doc queried of hugh mccoy mccoy shook his head it was dark i saw no one but it must have been gardner because there was no one else in the house the blackwhiskered old devil any idea why you were attacked to get me out of the way mccoy said and shrugged i know of no other reason i wonder pace put in mccoy stared coldly at the efficiency expert pace returned the frosty look with interest it was apparent that no love existed between these two just what are you driving at mccoy asked harshly rapid pace snapped your story sounds fishy to me yes fishy mccoys features darkened in the back glow of the car headlights he made one hand into a hard square fist and drew it back wrathfully ill cave your face in then he lowered the fist no i wont either youre just a sorehead peeved because miss zane has gone out with me a few times arent you lets not bring miss zane into it pace suggested stiffly doc nursed the roadster over a bridge where their speed caused the machine to travel a score of feet with all wheels off the ground drop the personalities he suggested mccoy what were you doing at gardners house tonight i am a financial relations counsel by profession mccoy began i a general fourflusher would be more like it rapid pace sneered shut up or ill crown you mccoy snapped mr savage i am a financial relations counsel just what does that mean doc interposed i give corporations and business concerns financial advice explained mccoy sometimes i take charge of disputes between companies serving as intermediary to get things settled amicably for instance take the currently discussed merger between gardners shipping company and the steamship concern and shipyard owned by paine l winthrop gardner called me in as consultant i looked over the situation and advised the merger winthrop however opposed it i was at gardners house tonight discussing the matter did you doc queried know that paine l winthrop was murdered late this afternoon hell no hugh mccoy said feelingly who killed him the silver deathsheads undoubtedly doc answered mccoy shook his head slowly how was it done with a shell from a threeinch cannon doc replied listen mccoy exploded are you serious do you doc asked know anything about this mystery not a thing mccoy said vehemently doc savage seemed on the point of putting another question but instead he applied the brakes bringing the roadster to a sharp stop they were approaching one of the bridges which led over the harlem river into manhattan a squad of policemen with riot guns and teargas bombs was barring their way a burly sergeant advanced recognized doc savage stepped back hastily and motioned the car on but doc tarried to ask questions he wanted to know what happened why the blockading party at the bridge officer he queried its them blasted silver deathsheads said the cop we have all the bridges an ferries an the subways blocked well get em have the silver men done anything since the murder of paine l winthrop doc questioned done anything the policeman exploded theyve been running wild they robbed a string of movie theaters blew open a bank vault and looted three jewelry stores they worked like an army theyve got gas masks inside them silver hoods they wear and theyve got bulletproof vests machine guns and gas grenades theyre the worst thing this town has ever seen any trace of where they go to doc asked no nor where they come from either groaned the officer except maybe it must be somewhere in the east river waterfront district after their jobs they seem to flee in that direction doc savage drove on signs that the law enforcement agencies of the city were on edge was evident at point after point instead of one traffic cop on duty at a corner there were two or even three and an unusual number of radio cars were prowling but we have been chasing the silver men all evening rapid pace remarked it does not seem possible that they could have committed the robberies the policeman told about no sir the organization must be large doc told him we have been following only a small portion of the gang where are we going hugh mccoy asked abruptly instead of replying doc savage swung the roadster up before an allnight drug store which displayed a telephone sign entered and thumbed through the directories pace and mccoy following him in were interested observers in the directory doc found numerous concerns which used the name indian head he moved a metallic finger down the list we will try this one he said and stopped his finger at indian head club pace squinted then asked but why this particular one notice the address doc suggested it is in the brooklyn waterfront district across from the manhattan side of the east river where the crooks have been disappearing on wallow street to be exact after their crimes they ferried in some manner across to the brooklyn shore have you hugh mccoy asked abruptly any objection to my doing my bit to aid you i have a personal interest in this matter docs flakegold eyes were inscrutable personal interest he queried i am on gardners pay roll mccoy elaborated i do not like to have anything put over on me gardner has been acting uneasily of late which leads me to think something is queer if anything is wrong i would be involved in the minds of the public at least if i have been working for a crook i want to be known as one of those who helped put him behind bars you think gardner is a crook doc asked sharply gardner might be the leader of the silver deathsheads mccoy reminded wallow street was a narrow teeming alley full of odors and gloom the thoroughfare was less than half a dozen blocks long with the first two blocks the two up on the hill lined with tenements of the lowest type the other four blocks housed sail lofts warerooms and shops dealing in ship supplies wallow street ended at the water front where piers bulked gloomily and the polluted water of the east river sloshed and eddied at this hour the section down by the water was deserted while farther up in the tenement stretch wretched inhabitants draped themselves on fire escapes and rooftops to escape the fogsoaked warmth rapid pace and hugh mccoy were silent as doc guided the roadster into wallow street they were still showing a coldness toward each other neither having addressed a word to the other since entering the city doc pulled into a side street stopped the roadster and motioned mccoy and pace back when they moved to get out you two stay here he directed then the smelly darkness seemed to absorb the bronze giant there was no sound to indicate which way he had gone pace and mccoy watched the corners where street lights were brilliant expecting to see the bronze man but to their amazement he did not appear they should have watched the roof line along the street they might have seen doc savage poise for an instant against the foggorged sky after he had climbed a heavy metal drain pipe there was no sign of life on the rooftops but doc went forward as warily as if he were stalking an abnormally alert sentinel the roofs were level except for one stretch a floor lower than the rest an obstacle which doc bridged by use of his grapple and silk line advancing to the forward edge of the roof he employed a thin periscope device to scrutinize the street this apparatus functioned remarkably well in the darkness indian head club the sign was almost below the letters arrayed around a gaudy likeness of a redskin braves head the building was as devoid of lights as the black sombre warehouses on either side doc retreated buildings such as this usually had roof hatches doc searched and found one and pressed an ear to it he listened for a long time but heard nothing from within doc did not enter the hatch but moved to the rear of the building slid down his grapple cord with the hook affixed behind a chimney and reached a window the glass pane in this was large docs flashlight came out protruded a beam little thicker than a lead pencil and he examined the edge of the glass where it was puttied in he dug very carefully with his penknife what he eventually found was so well concealed that it almost evaded his intent scrutiny affixed in the putty was a hairfine wire of copper had he carelessly tried to remove the putty the wire would have been broken setting off an alarm somewhere the discovery was proof that his caution was not wasted the roof hatch of course would be fitted with another alarm with a penknife doc went to work carefully uncovering the fine wire locating its terminals he twisted them together forming a short circuit that would keep the alarm system electromagnets energized without this shortcircuiting he would not have been able to remove the glass without actuating the ingenious device he now removed the glass before entering doc clambered back up the roof he ran boldly to the hatch gave it a wrench and it came open doc whipped back to his grapple cord slid down to the window he bad operated upon freed the grapple with a jerk and rolled it up and pocketed it as he eased into the indian head club he advanced silently eased through a door and found proof that his precautions were wise four grim figures in silver crouched at the end of the hallway scarcely discernible in the vague light which came down through the open hatch doc took a chance on the floor squeaking and crept a bit closer be sure the silencers are on your guns said a coarse whisper why dont the guy who opened that hatch come on down grated another perhaps a minute of grim waiting ticked by two of you go back and watch savages two buddies breathed the coarser whisper two silver men detached from the group and eased along the hallway and down a flight of stairs they did not see doc savage for the bronze man was moving ahead of them doc was doing a strange thing as he glided along in one of his hands was a small can with a perforated top not unlike the containers in which talcum powder is often sold from time to time he sprinkled some of the contents on the floor behind him the powder was dark and did not show up in the darkness the two silver men reached a door shoved it open and thumbed on flashlights a glance within seemed to satisfy them theyll never get away said one come on lets take a look at the back door i dont like that business of the roof hatch opening somebody mightve done that to cover up while they got inside some other way nobody could get in without setting off an alarm the other snorted skeptically well take a look anyhow the two men retreated they were hardly around a corner when doc appeared at the door got it open and passed through his flashlight traced its white thread big apish monk and slender dapper ham were handcuffed wrist and ankle in addition wrist shackles were linked to ankle manacles both their lips and eyes were taped the strips almost concealing their features the manacle locks were simple they surrendered quickly to docs metal probe he got the gags off with quick jerks the least painful method monk making a snarling sound reached up and uncovered his eyes he saw doc gulped and dropped the fist with which he was preparing to drive a blow glory be he grinned i knew it was only a question of time until you got here the door snapped open a silverhooded head thrust in attracted no doubt by the noise monk had made the observer let out an earsplitting yell doc scooped up a heavy handcuff and snapped it at the door the head jerked back the manacles struck the wood so hard that splinters were torn off with a slam the door was yanked shut from the hallway came a sound reminiscent of buckshot being poured on a taut bed sheet a silenced machine gun its clamor was not as loud as the uproar made by the slugs tearing through the door monk was on his feet shoving doc propelled him to a corner ham was jerking at the tape over his eyes doc pitched him bodily after monk clear of the leaden storm in the hallway there was shouting and the pound of racing feet the silver men were gathering to the attack the room which held doc and his two men were fitted with easy chairs tables and smoking stands doc heaved a chair at a window and it went through with a great jangling of glass three silenced rapidfirers were stuttering in the hall but the weapons firing cartridges of pistol caliber could not penetrate the walls the door however mangled by metal toppled off its hinges a silvergloved hand thrust a machine gun inside monk threw a smoking stand it hit the hand the owner screamed and his gun skittered across the floor monk started for the weapon willing to chance being shot in order to get it wait doc rapped the bronze man stripped off the light alloy metal mail which he wore to protect his torso from bullets he spread this over a cheap overstuffed chair making a mobile shield using this monk scuttled across the floor the mail jumped and whipped under the impact of lead and flattened bullets fell from it to the floor but monk got the rapidfirer he loosened a brief burst of fire and outside a man squawked in agony theyre wearing bulletproof vests monk said grimly youve got to shoot at their legs or their heads i got that one in the legs monks single burst had a remarkable effect for the shooting outside suddenly ceased footsteps pounded grew fainter monk promptly charged outside holding docs bulletproof garment in front of his chest sounds like theyre heading for the back he roared doc and ham followed they could hear the running feet until silence fell unexpectedly on the floor was a spattering of crimson which had come from the leg of the man monk had shot doc followed the trail but not for far it ended indicating the injured one had stemmed the scarlet flow perhaps with a handkerchief its a cinch they didnt leave the place monk rumbled well find em watch the doors doc directed monk raced to the front entrance and almost at once there was a violent scuffle it subsided quickly doc ive got one monk called caught him just inside doc savage running to the spot found the homely chemist holding a very frightened young man speared on the muzzle of his gun the frightened individual was rapid pace we hheard ffighting rapid pace stuttered we decided to hhave a look where is mccoy doc demanded he took the back way said pace yyes the back way did you see any one running from the club no said pace no sir doc studied rapid pace for a moment it had taken quite a degree of nerve to enter the indian head club as pace had done the efficiency expert was a puzzle at times he exhibited plenty of nerve at other times none at all hugh mccoy appearing from the rear door put a halt to docs character appraisal no one asserted mccoy emphatically had fled down the alley which ran past the back door but they went somewhere said monk monk had returned to his habitual tinyvoiced manner of speaking in marked contrast to his gusty roaring when he was in action monk liked plenty of noise with his fights we will doc stated pull this place apart if necessary to find where those four silver men went monk ham did you overhear anything to indicate who is behind this affair there is a mastermind ham offered crisply he is a fellow who remains in the background he does not even mingle with his gang some of the gang do not even know him by sight we did not get his name or overhear anything to indicate his identity a bird named ull is first lieutenant to this chief monk put in this ull is no dunce himself he is a scientist from what i overheard he has invented a lot of things these silver deathssheads use their disguises for instance and bulletproof vests which are almost as efficient as our own too he mixed up a poison which kills you when you touch it docs gaze roving eyed a telephone wait he directed and went to the instrument lifting the receiver he found it alive he dialed a number then heard the ringer operate the distant phone twice before a receiver came up park avenue beautician said a cultured feminine voice miss savage doc requested a moment later another voice said miss patricia savage speaking is lorna zane safe doc asked she is unless she succumbs from some of my beauty treatments pat advised i told her anything she wanted was free while she was with me and did she take advantage of it she started with my special egyptian clay pack facial and is going right down the list doc do you know what i think better put a guard over her doc suggested sure pat agreed doc i think she is setting her cap for you she keeps wanting to know about you doc said dryly try to discourage her and hung up chapter the capture patricia savage smiled as she hung up because she knew that doc was as womanproof as any man could be feminine attention only embarrassed doc and pat womanlike enjoyed kidding him more the pity too because there was no doubt but that lorna zane was actually entranced by the bronze giant and lorna was not only a beauty but she had good sense and ability as well no one without ability could run a shipyard poor lorna sighed pat aloud shes bumping her head against a stone wall and you sister said a cold voice are going to bump into some lead if you dont behave pat started violently and whirled the windows of her private office were adorned with drapes which hung to the floor from behind one of these a man had stepped at least pat decided be was a man since the voice was too coarse to come from a feminine source the fellow was garbed in one of the weird silver regalias what pat demanded does this mean never mind that growled the silver man call that zane dame in here the speaker moved his right hand silvergloved to emphasize the presence of the pistol which he held pat studied the gun she was outwardly calm and looked very chic in an evening gown from one of the citys finest designers get a jump on advised the silver man all right pat said and picked up an interoffice telephone leaping swiftly the silver man wrenched the instrument from pats fingers and clapped it back on the hook what in blazes are you tryin to pull he grated that phone connects to the operator who is now dressing miss zanes hair pat explained i was going to call her if you dont believe me call her yourself the other hesitated thinking the matter over you got some men working in this joint aint you he grunted of course said pat very handsome men too the older society matrons like that yeah the silver man leered well ill take a chance on em thinking its one of your men callin he picked up the instrument which was one of the cradle type receiver and mouthpiece on one arm and began i want to talk to the operator dressing miss zanes hair that was as far as he got because a popping noise interrupted him he dropped the instrument and staggered back gasping and blinking he seemed to forget that he held a gun and pawed at the eyeholes in his mask pat lunged seized his gun with both hands wrenched and got it she sprang back triumphantly because she helped doc savage occasionally she was sometimes in danger and she had taken precautions this trick telephone was one of them it was not connected to anything but the mouthpiece when spoken into ejected a tiny spray of tear gas she had borrowed the device from doc savage who had fashioned countless such trick contrivances when you get around to it pat advised you can put up your hands the silver man snarled incoherently and kept on pawing at his masked features the noises he made in his agony and rage were bubbling and babylike they were loud enough to cover the sound if any as a second silver man appeared in the open door behind pat and advanced swiftly lifting a gun clubfashion the gun bludgeoned down heavily pat moaned and collapsed to her knees a wise dame said the newcomer but not wise enough while still stunned pat was jerked up and slammed into a chair the same gun which had clubbed her was shoved into her face dont think im finicky about usin it on a dame neither the man advised her we got too much at stake to take chances on the works bein gummed pat sat very still and said thickly the last thing i would think of doing is gumming anybodys works you take a lot of killin dont you the other jeered half admiringly then he snapped at his companion get over in the corner to that water cooler and wash your eyes the blinded man stumbled to the water cooler spilled water down the front of his clothing but finally managed to bathe his eyes by that time the effects of the tear gas had started subsiding and he was soon able to use his orbs with gusto he took over the task of guarding pat pull a funny one on me will you he gritted at the young woman i oughta hand you yours right here nix said the other this hank of hair goes with us the big shots orders you mean pat demanded that i am going to be honored with your companionship you get the idea why pat wanted to know the silver man squinted at her through the eyeholes in his mask this guy doc savage thinks a lot of you dont he i suspect said pat that doc sometimes wishes i had never been horn you would he surprised how much time he has to spend rescuing me from trouble the silver man laughed harshly k now hes gonna have another chance pat snapped i fail to follow you live bait sister the other sneered get it we use you to pull the bronze guy into a trap is that why you kept monk and ham alive pat asked teeth made a gritting noise behind the silver mask so you know that savage got em away from us eh pat had not known this doc with a reticence characteristic of himself had neglected to tell her over the telephone pat smiled cheerfully into the gun muzzle my feminine intuition or something tells me you fellows will be better off if you drop everything and hunt a nice hideout in let us say timbuktu she advised your intuition had better show you when its wise to pipe down the other grated and shoved his gun closer to her face can the chatter said the second silver man who was carefully examining the telephones on pats desk he picked up one held it gingerly got the operator and seemed satisfied there was no trick will you send miss zane to miss savages offices he requested then put the instrument down scowled at pat and added you had better hope that scheme works the scheme worked as perfectly as the two silver men could have wished lorna zane unsuspicious freshened and more entrancingly pretty than ever came swinging in she was an advertisement for the effectiveness of pats beauticians the two men stepping to her side as she came through the door put guns to her side and chorused do the wise thing sister lorna zane looked at the two men then at pat sorry said pat i did all i could i could scream lorna stated grimly but they would probably shoot us both youre damn right we would she was assured were walking you out advised the second of the two men in the metallic disguises take the back way lorna zane did not move she stared steadily at the two sinister figures in silver what do you want with me she demanded why did you try to kill me at the shipyard dont kid us sister sneered the man you know why i do not lorna insisted and that is the truth the vehemence in her tone seemed to penetrate the callous armor of the two men convincing them that she was telling the truth lets get this straight one growled didnt you know what that blueprint was about you mean the print that your gang stole from the safe out at the shipyard lorna demanded sure you know what it was didnt you no said lorna i did not the silver man whistled softly as if amazed didnt old winthrop tell you what it was all about emphatically not lorna a snapped damned if i dont believe you the man mumbled thoughtfully the second silver man emitted a gritting laugh say i see what happened remember when the big boss threatened winthrop over the telephone winthrop was scared he said this dame had the blueprint and knew the story and would go to the cops if anything happened to winthrop we had been keepin an eye on winthrop and knew who had the blueprint this dame here you think winthrop stalled to save his neck for a while his companion questioned it looks like it the other admitted then youll let me go lorna asked hopefully watch us do that the man growled get goin both of you skirts out the back way pat and lorna walked meekly ahead of the two gunmen there was nothing else for them to do instead of an alley at the hack of the modernistic skyscraper which housed pats beauty establishment there was a large tunnel of an affair closed at the street by large steel doors during the daylight hours this was used by the trucks which had merchandise to deliver to the building but at the present late hour the tunnel was occupied only by an innocentappearing truck the truck driver had his collar turned and his hat was yanked over his eyes this coupled with the darkness afforded him a complete disguise pat and lorna did not see his features as they were forced to get into the hack of the truck accompanied by their two captors the doors were closed one silver man pressed his metallic mask to a slit in the van and spoke to the driver all set sure said the driver and listen did i get a message that was relayed from the big boss chuckled the other savage doesnt know it the driver advised gleefully hes all set to get his within ten minutes though everything is fixed the big boss himself arranged it where is savage now asked the silver man in the indian head club hes frisking the joint the silver man swore violently hell if he ever finds dont worry snapped the driver he wont find anything but sudden death its all fixed i tell you savage wont suspect a thing until blooje hell be done for pat heard each word desperation seized her and she lunged at the nearest captor it was a move doomed to defeat because the fellow was alert he simply stepped back and sideswiped pats head with the barrel of his heavy automatic not hard enough to do violent damage but forcibly enough to send her reeling back the van rolled out of the tunnel and into the traffic as the two men in the rear used tape to gag pat and lorna youll hear all about the party at the indian head club chapter death blasts the indian head club was outwardly quiet but there was grim work underfoot inside doc and his party were searching this place is more than a hideout monk stated firmly theres some secret about it what makes you think that doc questioned the way them silver mugs acted monk explained they were mighty careful and i heard one of them remark that if you or the police found out what was here the fat would be in the fire ham who was hauling clothing out of a closet emitted a grunt of pleasure he had found his sword cane our captors brought this along when they seized us he said flourishing the weapon they were curious about the chemical on the tip i heard one of them remark that ull might make use of it yeah monk admitted this ull is a brainy cuss from what they said hugh mccoy flushed and seemingly enjoying the excitement put in did either of you gentlemen hear a mention of gardner while you were prisoners no said monk whos gardner a man who might conceivably be behind the silver deathsheads mccoy replied rapid pace snapped what makes you suspect gardner that is what i want to know what makes you suspect him have you any better suggestion mccoy asked coldly rapid pace merely glared at mccoy then wheeled away we are killing time he snapped the thing to do is find where those four silver men went to that will not be difficult doc assured him quietly monk you watch the rear door mccoy you take the front entrance the bronze man moved out into the street and ran toward the corner where his roadster stood the streets were quiet except that lateplaying children made a little noise up in the tenement section the fog seemed to be thicker from the nimble seat of the roadster doc got an object which might have been a press photographers camera but which was actually a lantern projecting light rays in the ultraviolet range of the spectrum the device was simple merely being an electric bulb battery operated which gave off light closely akin to that of an arc and a deep filter which cut out all the light but ultraviolet doc went back to the house and to the stairway where he had sprinkled the powder from the shaker during the time that the silver men were unwittingly leading him to monk and ham the silver men had walked through the powder without knowing it doc extinguished all lights turned on the ultraviolet lantern and pointed its dark lens at the floor scattered patches of glowing electric blue appeared wherever doc bad sprinkled the powder and where the silver men had walked through the powder their feet had therefore left prints doc followed the trail it grew a bit fainter for the powder would soon wear off the shoe soles of the quarry the tracks progressed down into the basement the basement floor was of concrete a large furnace stood in a corner and insulated steam pipes stretched about like the tentacles of an octopus there were barrels boxes and a bin holding coal the glowing tracks led to a barrel which stood against one wall stand back doc warned and moved the barrel at first it seemed there was solid concrete below but a closer scrutiny revealed a circular manhole its lines intended to be concealed by the mark the barrel bottom had made on the floor with a heel doc put weight on various parts of the lid it hinged up uncovering a cavity so black that it resembled a puddle of drawing ink the thin flashlight beam showed a room below with a ladder leading down walls and floor of the subterranean recess were lined with bricks there was a table chairs a rack holding numerous silver garments opened cases of submachine gun ammunition and other boxes holding rapidfirers and hand grenades but there was no sign of the silver men doc descended the ladder after searching to make sure there were no trick triggers or death traps on the rack of silver garments four metallic regalias lay askew as if hastily cast there doc lifted them curiously one was crimson stained still wet discarded by the man monk shot in the leg doc decided he stood hefting the silver cloaks curiously upstairs monk was shifting from one foot to the other as he watched the rear door monk believed there would be action below and he hated to miss it he peered into the alley listened then withdrew to the stairway that led down into the basement and strained his ears he did not hear anything from the basement instead he caught a faint sound from the direction of the front door where hugh mccoy was functioning as lookout monk hesitated mccoy he called softly there was no answer gripping his captured submachine gun monk eased toward the front mccoy should have been just inside but he was not there monk peered out into the street it was some seconds before he caught an indefinite blur moving away from the indian head club keeping in the shadow of the buildings with a silence remarkable for a man of such bulk monk floated down the steps glided a dozen yards took a deliberate aim with his weapon and invited whoever you are stand still the figure was silent so long that it seemed there was going to be no answer speak up monk growled you dope said mccoys voice theyll hear you who the four silver men grated mccoy just saw them sneaking up the street wait here monk grated doc will want to know about this the homely chemist whipped back into the indian head club went half way down the basement stairs and barked doc mccoy just seen the four birds pulling a sneak monk saw ham and pace race for the stairs saw doc appear from the round hole in the basement floor he waited for no more but pitched back outside to aid mccoy mccoy was not where monk had left him deciding the financial counselor had gone ahead so as not to lose sight of the quarry monk scuttled up the street he gained the corner and discerned no sign of mccoy monk looked around to see if doc and the others were following him and saw the most stupendous display of pyrotechnics he had ever witnessed the ground seemed to sink several inches under monks feet then jump straight up simultaneously there was a sound as if a firecracker had gone off in each ear bloodred light flooded his eyes blinding him against the lurid glow monk saw doc ham and pace outlined the trio were not running but seemed to be flying through the air carried by an invisible force from behind then the force of the explosion reached monk slapped him like an unseen colossus and he was knocked sprawling dazed unable to hear because the blast had temporarily deafened his ears monk managed to land on all fours peering upward he saw copings toppling off buildings window glass was falling like brittle snow walls began to come down down by the indian head club or rather where it had been a mound of flame and debris was climbing toward the sky monk began to crawl then something happened to the top of his head things turned very black in front of his eyes and all noise of the uproar left him monks next connection with the material world was a briskly calloused voice saying no ordinary brick could do anything to that head of monks hell be all right in a minute monk unable to think coherently wheres habeas there you are said ham thinking of that pet pig ahead of everybody else we left the pig at your laboratory yeah monk got his wits together i sure wasnt worrying about you shyster say what happened the last i remember vesuvius seemed to turn loose that was no more than a minute ago ham snapped take a look at the indian head club monk realizing he was facing away from the club turned himself around with his hands still in a seated position a great glare caused him to close his eyes tightly where the indian head club had been there was a tower of flame that moaned and squirmed fully two hundred feet in the air waves of heat shoved against his face say what could burn like that monk gulped chemicals doc savage said quietly there must have been a mine under the place charged with an inflammable chemical in addition to explosive them four silver devils must have lit the fuse and were beating it when mccoy saw them monk reared up shakily say where did mccoy go no sign of him doc advised rapid pace standing in the background dabbing at various minor cuts snapped i do not trust that mccoy no sir he is a very smooth man if he hadnt discovered those silver lads skipping out it would have been just too bad for us monk growled down the street a weaving figure appeared it was a man he was staggering keeping both hands pressed to his head his clothing was torn and dust fell from him when he stumbled when he was close they saw that it was hugh mccoy where did the four silver men go doc asked sharply mccoy looked at them painfully still holding his head how would i know he snapped part of a wall fell on me ive been unconscious the flames from the indian head club ruin seemed to be climbing higher gory tongues of fire detached themselves and shot upward hundreds of feet the howling bedlam of the blaze made conversation difficult to escape the searing heat doc and his men retreated from all around them came the wall of fire sirens but none of the apparatus was yet in sight doc savage eying the flames decided it will be a good many hours before we can get into that ruin to do any investigating come on we have something to do besides watching the fireworks monk peering at doc started slightly he had just discovered that doc carried tucked obscurely under one arm one of the strange metallic garments worn by the silver deathsheads whered you get that thing doc the homely chemist demanded from the room under the indian head club basement doc replied think its a clue monk questioned eagerly no doc told him but there are pockets inside the garment and the contents of one of those pockets is i think going to prove very valuable they were still retreating from the flames a crowd sprang up rapidly about them curious persons drawn by the terrific blast and the amazing fire howling fire trucks bored through the throng followed by hose wagons rescue squads and emergency police in the uproar doc savage and his party attracted little attention they reached a drug store windows of which had been broken by the detonation it was unoccupied the proprietor evidently having dashed off excitedly to the fire lights were burning inside the first spot doc and his party had encountered where there was illumination lets have a look at what was in the pocket of that silver suit monk requested doc nodded and they went in the drug store broken glass strewed the floor for many bottles had been shaken off counters the bronze man employed the marble top of the soda fountain as a table from the inner recesses of the silver suit he extracted a long blue roll sealed with wax rapid pace took one look at them and exploded the blueprint that was taken from the shipyard safe youve seen it before hugh mccoy asked sharply pace scowled at his rival for the hand of lorna zane no he retorted but miss zane described it doc unrolled the print it was it developed the only one blazes muttered monk eying the lines traced whitely on the blue background a sketch of new york harbor now that aint quite what i expected the map it was actually no more than that of the harbor was not especially complete but it showed certain prominent details outstanding landmarks and the depth of water was carefully gauged at numerous points compared with a regulation marine harbor chart it would have been crude yet it apparently had been traced from such a chart doc dropped a finger on the blue expanse these four small stars seem to be the only especiallyoutstanding marks the stars with doc indicated were situated in approximately the center of the east river the first off the wall street section of manhattan the next possibly a quarter of a mile south and the others spaced at like intervals farther down maybe theyre buoys ham suggested no buoys at those points doc assured him and notice the position of the first the northermost one ham looked again then started by jove it is almost directly opposite that indian head club exactly doc agreed you think that is significant i do will you explain doc ham requested later doc told him the bronze man went to a telephone booth took the receiver down found the circuit intact and dialed a number he spoke quietly for some moments his metallic features did not alter expression however there was audible for a brief moment that unearthly trilling sound which was the bronze mans peculiar characteristic the sound which he made unconsciously when some unusual danger threatened or which marked some stark discovery or which preceded some unusual course of action finally he replaced the receiver and left the booth the silver deathsheads he said slowly have seized pat and lorna zane i just talked to pats establishment chapter ii the river bed mystery it was getting along toward dawn and father knickerbocker as new yorkers like to dub their city as a whole was for the most part asleep it had been a hectic night no less than twenty major robberies had been committed by the weird silver deathsheads during the early part of the night new york bad had her crime waves in the past there had been nights which saw more robberies and nights when more loot bad been annexed by thieves but never had a crime wave possessed quite the spectacular qualities of this one never before had the thieves all affected the same fantastic costumes that was the startling thing the tabloid newspapers ate it up the radio broadcast it and the police began to expect gray hairs when they next looked in mirrors the mayor was up all night walking the floor the governor called twice to know whether the militia would help and editorial writers sharpened their pencils to take digs at the city administration almost a million dollars in loot had been taken the largest haul being the armored truck earlier the previous afternoon robbery reports piled onto the city desks of newspapers so fast that the editors could not tell which was which the murder of paine l winthrop good for a frontpage streamer on the first edition was relegated to the back pages before the final edition went to bed most amazing aspect of the whole thing however was the fact that new yorks usually efficient policemen had not captured a single silver man what was more they had no idea where any one of the silver men could be found the sinister fellows in metallic disguises bobbed up committed a robbery shot down any one who resisted and fled maybe the police chased them a few blocks then without exception the silver men disappeared usually they disappeared in the vicinity of the water front surrounding manhattan island the police had noted this fact it was still foggy and although dawn was more than an hour distant there was still intense darkness ocean vessels were dropping anchor outside the narrows waiting for the soup to lift such tugs as prowled the harbor nosed along with tooting horns and every spare man on lookout duty there was one boat on the river which was not making undue noise however it was a thin lance of a speed craft with motors which did not make sound proportionate to their great power for they were scientifically muffled with just a few alterations that boat could well be a contender for the harmsworth trophy she was fast doc savage and monk were alone in the speedboat monk handling the controls doc in the cockpit donning a pair of heavy lead diving shoes from time to time monk lifted a boxlike device to his eyes and peered at first one shore of the river and then the other monk was getting bearings on the shore doc had placed projectors emitting strong infrared light rays invisible to the unaided eye but which bad the power of penetrating fog and smoke to a remarkable degree the boxlike apparatus rendered the infrared beacons visible merely an adaptation this contrivance of the signaling apparatus well known to naval technicians and of principles with which alert photographers were familiar the place is about a hundred feet upstream monk decided doc paused in buckling on the lead shoes and reached into a locker he brought out a flashlight already tied to a float and switched it on this he tossed overboard together with a long line to which was affixed an anchor weight the light bobbed astern moored in place by the line and weight monk took another bearing then said were right over the place where the first star was marked on that blueprint doc savage stood up as the boat slackened speed he lifted an apparatus which might have been mistaken for an oversized fish bowl and put it over his head it was a diving hood of a transparent composition infinitely stronger than glass and had the advantage of permitting vision on all sides the helmet was a product of docs inventive genius its composition vaguely akin to the common cellophane inside the helmet was a receiver and microphone these being connected to a tiny radio transmitter that was attached to a stout tool jacket which doc now donned the radio transmitter aerial was in one sleeve of the jacket the receiving aerial in the other the receiving aerial was a loop and by pointing the arm in various directions the position of another diver using one of the transmitters could be ascertained doc switched on the radio which was waterproof and twirled the wavelength knob he got major broadcasting stations amateurs very shortwave stuff then a sudden earsplitting moan he waited tensely the moan came again the sound was the radio compass station operated by the government doc searched on down until he found a clear band then gave monk the wavelength figure monk who had lifted another radio transmitterreceiver combination from a box tuned to the same wave doc stepped overside the heavy lead shoes pulled him down with a gurgling rapidity cruise above this spot doc directed monk better shut off your motor douse all lights and use the oars you can hold your position with the oars alone sure said monk keep me posted on what you find the twoway radio functioned perfectly a fact that did not displease doc because this was the first time he had been able to test it and the transparent helmet under actual diving conditions inset in the helmet side low down where it did not interfere with vision was a watchshaped depth gauge calibrated in feet it was marked with radiant paint doc watched the hand crawl around the pressure did not greatly hamper his powerful body the water at this point being not excessively deep patent lungs of conventional type kept breathable air in the helmet when he was near the bottom doc switched on a powerful waterproof searchlight he hit bottom and mud clouded up around him by pointing the arm containing the receiver loop upward he located monks transmitter it was a bit upstream doc walked in that direction sweeping the river bottom with his band searchlight he almost missed it the thing was drifted over with mud and only the clank of the lead diving shoes against the metal cover disclosed its presence doc picked it up washed it off and studied it he held in his arms a metal box something over a foot square it had thickly soldered seams to render it waterproof lower a line doc directed monk a moment later a weighted line came snaking down doc grasped the end and was hauled upward so you got it monk chuckled when they were both in the speedboat yes doc told him and i believe we have our hands on the whole secret the bronze man employed a screwdriver to thrust into one of the soldered seams prying he gradually tore the metal box open inside was a soft black composition of the type used to fill automobile spark coils doc carefully dug into this he uncovered scattered wires then a coil and finally the rounded glass top of a vacuum tube upstream the light he had left atloat made a pale blur in the darkness doc worked low in the boat cockpit his own light painstakingly sheltered down in the bay two tugboats were hooting at each other their own boat was drifting what do you make of it monk asked anxiously well doc began it seems monk had stood erect to look over docs shoulder he flopped flat in the cockpit as a piercing whistle sounded overhead there was a flash it seemed to come from some distance down the river another much brighter flash followed it that one from up the river then came two earsplitting roars which blended intermingling until they became one whooping tumult a great geyser of water lifted where doc had left the floating light bilious water pushed away from the spot in a wall that boiled down upon the speedboat the craft was caught broadside it lifted and turned completely over doc and monk clutching life lines remained with the boat and the craft because of its design came upright again everything loose including the mysterious box on which doc had been working was gone from the cockpit a full six inches of water sloshed in the bottom of the boat doc lunged for the instrument panel thumbed a button and the big motors in their waterproof compartment moaned into life a stroke of a lever set pumps to work emptying the shallow cockpit no ordinary boat this but one with such peculiar qualities of efficiency that the naval experts were considering its design for creating a fleet of light coastal defense speedsters that was a shell monk gulped boy ive heard too many of them things whistle to be mis taken doc said grimly fired from downstream too the sound from the gun reached us just before the shell detonated it was aimed at that decoy light we left floating doc had the speedboat controls now the craft lifted its snout out of the water and knifed downstream clambering forward monk wrenched at a hatch and a mechanical tripod lifted a gun into view the weapon fired shells no more than an inch in diameter hut they were armorpiercing and highexplosive slugs which could sink a destroyer if carefully placed monk hunkered behind the piece waiting the homely chemist had no idea what manner of craft they might encounter but any antagonist armed with a cannon was formidable he wondered how it happened that they had not heard the motors of the enemy monk found cause for fresh wonder when they passed over the spot from which the gun flash of the foe had come and found nothing doc curved the fast boat in a narrow circle still there was nothing he described a wider circuit with the same negative results twice more be went around then be cut the motors and both he and monk listened the only sound was the noise of a loud motor upstream and a hit later a siren wail from the same source this identified an approaching police boat monk squinted in docs direction moistened his lips then growled well only one thing can explain it yes doc agreed that shell was fired from a submarine fantastic as the idea seems rapid pace and hugh mccoy leaped to their feet when doc savage and monk entered the reception room of docs skyscraper headquarters any word of lorna miss zane mccoy asked anxiously yes pace echoed any word no doc said is ham hack pace nodded at the library door in there he told us to stay out said he did not want to be bothered doc and monk waved mccoy and pace back when the pair would have followed them into the laboratory ham gave them a wellbred frown when he saw their dripping garments i knew i would miss out on some excitement he said peevishly doc questioned did you have any luck with your end i followed the orders you gave before you and monk started out in the speedboat ham replied a fine job i had too digging up old sanitation maps of the city at that hour of the night what did you learn doc demanded ham picked up a rolled map which reposed on the writing desk you can see it on here he said but i can tell you just as well up until fifteen years ago a large drainage pipe ran under the waterfront section of brooklyn and emptied into the fast river it was abandoned fifteen years ago not taken up mind you because that was too expensive it was merely abandoned doc said it ran in the neighborhood of the indian head club right under the indian head club to he exact ham stated daggone monk gulped this is beginning to shape up the silver deathsheads had opened a passage into that old pipe thats why they blew up the indian head club to keep us from finding the pipe and the secret passage but what did they use the abandoned drain pipe for ham pondered aloud to get to their submarine monk grunted ham had secured a new sword cane from a supply of the unique weapons which he kept in his apartment at a fashionable club he picked the weapon up twirled it slowly eying monk the while that brick which cracked you when the indian head club blew up must have done some damage after all he said dryly you sound even crazier than usual submarine bosh monk scowled listen shyster there was a submarine in the river tonight or at least some craft that went under the water whats more whoever was running it took a potshot at us with what sounded like a threeinch cannon ham absently unsheathed the blade of his sword cane a few inches then clicked it back together amazement sat his features you are serious about this submarine business he asked earnestly it may sound wild said monk but it is the truth doc savage put in you will recall that it was a threeinch shell which killed paine l winthrop yesterday afternoon later two men who were in a position to see the submarine were killed i mean the fisherman and the aviator of course murdered to keep the existence of the submarine a secret monk mumbled i say ham queried sharply do you mean that these silver deathsheads came into new york harbor under water and reached the indian head club through that abandoned drainage pipe that is not at all impossible doc assured him and now ham did you learn anything about a scientist named uii ham drilling his sword cane with his eyes said this fellow must he don uii alias ellis nodham alias professor odonald alias a flock of other names he served a term in sing sing for manufacturing pineapples for gangsters in the united states patent office he has over a dozen electrical inventions registered some of them extremely clever he was technician for a concern manufacturing poison gas during the war which means he was a skillful chemist he once designed a patent twoman submarine and he is an expert on diving apparatus having patented one of his creations i talked to a dozen men who had known him in the past and every one said uii was as crooked a snake as ever lived whew monk exploded the fellow seems to be a jackofalltrades think what a clever rascal the mastermind behind ull must be ham said monk looked grim and stated that reminds me how in blazes did the silver deathsheads know we were going to be on the river probably had men shadowing us ham retorted now what i want to know is what did you find in the river a tin box monk told him a tin box soldered waterproof and filled with black insulating compound wires and vacuum tubes ham demanded what was it instead of answering monk turned around and faced the door of the reception room in there the telephone buzzer was whining doc leaped to the door rapid pace was reaching for the phone ill take it doc said and scooped up the instrument a voice remindful of a squealing rat said i wanta talk to a guy named doc savage you have him now doc replied what is it a dame throwed a note out of a window whined the rodent voice the note said some mugs had kidnaped her and for me to call you for help and youd pay me plenty to show you where she was bein held was there a name signed to the note doc questioned sharply yeah it was pat the squeaking took on a more uneasy quality listen mister step on it im kinda worried i dunno but what some guys are followin me i sorta thought they was a time or two where are you doc rapped in an allnight drug store at the corner of stein and decker streets ill wait here the ratty voice broke off sharply in an excited gasp there followed a tense dozen seconds of silence when the squeaking tone resumed it was stark with terror oh hell mister im on the spot it choked them fellers that was followin me just came in theyre them silver deathsheads theyre runnin for this phone booth the rodent voice began to scream glass crashed and wood broke as if the phone booth doors had been smashed in ugly thumps coming over the wire sounded like blows a voice that was unmistakably uils said it is fortunate that we saw this fellow loitering about the spot where we were holding the two women i believe he was up to something whats we do wit im asked another voice take him to the place where the two women arc said ull then the distant telephone receiver was placed on its hook chapter the trick ull glared at the receiver after he hung it up in his allenveloping silver garment uii made an ominous figure and the heavy submarine gun in his left hand detracted no whit from his fierce aspect behind uii two silvercloaked men were pointing guns at a drug store clerk who was so frightened that he was on the point of fainting two more silver men gripped a scrawny pinchfaced fellow who was also badly scared lemme loose whined the prisoner in a ratsqueal voice i aint done nothin lay off the jaw music he was ordered harshly uil directed loudly everybody out one of the pair guarding the clerk held up a hand said wait a minute boss i got a headache lets see if i can find something thats good for it hurry up then ull snapped the silver man who claimed he had a headache began a rapid scrutiny of the drug store display shelves he showed scant consideration for the stock sweeping bottles off the shelves he seemed to take an unholy joy in doing as much damage as he could he came to an array of vaseline in jars and tubes these he upset then he trampled over the litter and his weight forced the pale petroleum jelly from the tubes and jars and smeared the whole mess over his shoe soles the man left greasy tracks as he tore down more chemicals and found his aspirin then all the silver men moved for the door dragging the fellow who had been in the telephone booth about to walk onto the street uil paused and snarled maybe we had better shut this clerk up permanently the soda jerker paled swayed his lips moved without sound and he fainted on his feet toppling forward he fell on the fountain syrup pumps pushing them down and squirting strings of chocolate pineapple and strawberry uii and his silvermasked companions cast alert gazes about them as they moved down the gloomy street there was still fog over the city thick stuff which deposited a slimy coat over every exposed object this was a remote street and at this early hour almost deserted the man who had stepped in the petroleum left greasy tracks for a time but they grew fainter and soon were no longer discernible to the naked eye the man looked back at his tracks scowled then tried scuffing along to leave more pronounced prints no said ull that might make him suspicious how dyou mean the man growled he can see from the way you scraped your feet that you deliberately tried to leave tracks uii told him hell said the man the guy aint that sharp doc savage is a mental genius said uii the trouble so far is that we have underrated the fellow they turned into an alley where it was almost as dark as night do you think doc savage will fall into it asked one of the weirdly garbed figures yes said ull it was perfect the vaseline tracks especially they now released the man with the ratty voice one of the silver garments was produced and the rodent one donned it hurriedly the suit was fitted with zipper fasteners which facilitated getting into it how about a bonus for me he chuckled you did excellently ull told him with heartiness the men were moving swiftly as if aware that each moment upon the street was dangerous the city was inflamed against them because of the depredations committed the previous day and night mere sight of them in this section would be enough to create a turmoil hurry uii snapped you figure savage will come asked the ratty man if your acting over that telephone was sufficiently convincing he will said ull did he sound as if be were being taken in he sure did declared the rodent one then he must he on his way now uii sounded vastly pleased he wilt search the drug store and of course he will find the vaseline which was so thoughtfully walked through what if savage aint wise enough to know what we want him i mean what we hope hell do about the vaseline forget it snorted uii he uses ultra violet light a lot they clustered about a grimy doorway and ull rapped a peculiar signal with his finger tips playing a short distinctive bit from a song popular at the moment the fingertip aria could be recognized easily as such the door opened two men inside the building sighted grimly over machine guns safeties were off the weapons and the eyes back of the mask holes were coldly grim both were garbed in the metallic disguises uii stared at the gunmen saying nothing all right snarled one of the men you aint foolin nobody by wearin them silver rigs get em off moving very slowly so as not to invite a bullet ull tugged one sleeve back and looked at an expensive heavily protected wrist watch seventeen minutes and eleven seconds after said ull one of the machine gunners eyed his own watch laughed and said k how did i do very well said ull remember we all wear watches timed to the exact second all set together but not at the correct time at the present moment we are all two minutes and fifteen seconds fast sure said the other it beats a password ull and his party advanced down a gloomy corridor in complete darkness reaching a room where other silver men waited one of these men illuminated a flashlight briefly what do we do now this man asked we have set the trap for doc savage uli explained this building has been carefully prepared there are many traps to kill him when he tries to enter what about us we remain here to take a hand if the traps fail said ull there must be no slip this time a grotesque silver figure came in hurriedly excitement in his walk the big boss wants to talk to you he said to uii he sounds mad as hell ull emitted a startled ejaculation is the chief here no explained the other he is on the telephone and he wants to talk to you as ull went into another room to the telephone there was a trace of nervousness in his manner he strode much more hurriedly than was his wont and his hands made jerky gestures reaching the phone he picked up the dangling receiver put an ear to the instrument got his mouth close to the transmitter and said ull speaking a coarse angry whisper said damn you ull you have just about bungled everything ull recognized that harsh sibilance the rage it carried evidently impressed him as well for before he spoke his neck stiffened slightly as if he were swallowing some trouble but chief he murmured there has been no major misfortune i consider that we have come off very luckily hell the other swore expressively ull stammered in haste of course we have had backsets such as losing the blueprint and being forced to blow up the indian head club and a few other minor details but in fighting a man the caliber of doc savage we could not expect perfect sailing why you the other tried to find a word bad enough but ul eager to plead his own case before this whispering mastermind of whom he stood in such awe interrupted our situation is still very satisfactory he pointed out doc savage does not suspect your identity he has learned who i am but that does not matter because i am already wanted by the police we have doc savages cousin and the girl lorna zane the two women are perfect bait with which to draw doc savage into a trap listen doc savage is now heading straight for a trap from which he cannot possibly escape interpolated uii we will get him out of the way then there will be no one to bar our path we will repeat what we did last night why chief we got nearly a million all told from those robberies you damned blathering idiot grated the distant master i did not order those robberies except the first one the armored truck holdup you pulled the others on your own initiative ull you went crazy the city is in an uproar they cant touch us u said earnestly not with the system weve got of making a getaway and i thought you had brains the other snarled the governor will throw troops into the city they will call on the navy they will use naval submarine finders then how long do you think we will last ull mumbled aw maybe we can clean up first damn you said the coarse whisper why do you think i have been financing you for the loot you could get from a few robberies not much why the stuff you took last night wont repay a fraction of what i have invested in this thing the money was in large bills and the banks have the numbers the jewelry can be identified hell by the time you dispose of last nights take you will not have cleared two hundred thousand ull seemed dazed boss do you mean there is something bigger behind this yes snarled the other ulls confusion began to turn to anger you were using my brains and inventive ability eh using it for your own benefit listen i do not like shut up gritted the whispering one i intended for you to pull a robbery now and then like that armored truck job to pay expenses but the big money was not to come from that trivial stuff ull snapped if you call what we got last night trivial trivial alongside what i plan interjected the master but well go into this later your job now is to get doc savage ull stood perfectly still for some seconds glaring at the telephone he had thought he was fully in the confidence of this mysterious chieftain who kept in the background he had just discovered that such was not the ease it made him mad doc savage will be taken care of ull growled then theres got to be a new deal on splits i didnt know about this socalled big stuff you planned to pull what is it ill tell you after you get through with savage the other delayed and the telephone conversation ended with that chapter the phantoms doc savage was giving orders as he drove through the early morning fog that hung like a stuffing of wet cotton in the new york streets the bronze man was alone the machine which be drove was not his roadster but a vehicle with an appearance totally foreign to his character the car was a slightly shabby laundry truck with a noisy motor and a manner of jolting over cobbles in a manner which seemed most uncomfortable the cab windows being extraordinarily grimy made it difficult for the driver to be observed the vehicle was deceptive the noise was not actually in the motor which was huge and powerful but was created by a mechanical device the cab and body were of armor steel the windows thick and proof against anything less than a tankrifle slug and the machine could travel nearly a hundred miles an hour in giving commands doc savage was utilizing a twoway radio apparatus just now monks voice small and disgusted was coming from the speaker listen doc monk demanded what was the idea of leaving us behind i want you to do some work doc told him but first i want you to ask hugh mccoy and rapid pace if either of them left headquarters while you and i were out on the river bringing up that small metal box there ensued a brief pause while monk relayed the question there was sharp interest in the homely chemists childlike voice when he spoke rapid pace was out for a while right after we left he declared he says he went to get some cigarettes have you seen him smoking doc queried no monk replied i asked him about that and he said he had been too excited to smoke listen doc im wondering wondering what somebody mustve tipped them damn silver men in their submarine that we were going to be on the river monk paused for dramatic effect do you reckon pace could have slipped out and given them the tip doc said from now on watch pace very closely will i monk growled is ham there doc asked ham speaking said hams voice over the radio despite the outward noise of the laundry truck the clattering clanking and popping of the motor and the squeak of the spring it was comparatively quiet inside the armored van the radio operated through a loudspeaker hence conversation could be carried on without great difficulty ham doc directed you will make a quick check on bedford burgess gardner learn what you can of his character his associates his business career and that sort of thing certainly said hams melodious orators voice check up particularly on how it happens that gardners shipping company has become one of the largest in the business doc said pointedly concentrate on learning the facts back of the mergers which made it one of the biggest companies so you suspect gardner said ham doc did not comment on the swordcanecarrying lawyers words get any available details together with all suspicious circumstances in connection with the mergers he directed righto said ham doc clicked off the microphone button he was driving on decker street and stein street was directly ahead the bronze man could see the drug store from which the rodentvoiced man had called there was a small crowd in front of the store composed mostly of policemen doc savage received courteous cooperation from the police being told without delay that the soda clerk had upon regaining consciousness telephoned news of the raid of the silver men the clerk knees still rubbery stopping to swallow frequently said the silver gang had entered seized the individual who was telephoning then one man had torn up a lot of stock while hunting some aspirin by way of corroborating himself the clerk indicated the smashed vaseline on the floor we followed those greasy tracks the police officer put in at this point but they played out very shortly some moments later doc savage departed when the police would have accompanied him he requested them to refrain from doing so the cops looked disappointed they had hoped to see this remarkable bronze man work doc followed the greasy footprints until they were no longer visible to the unaided eye this was a bit farther than the officers had been able to trace them the bronze man was carrying a leather case and this he now opened the portable ultraviolet light lantern came to view together with another device which resembled welders goggles except that they were more bulky doc switched on the lantern and donned the goggles the goggles simply made it easier to observe the fluorescing effect by daylight of substances in which the ultraviolet light caused the phenomena vaseline being a substance which glows when exposed to ultraviolet light doc had little difficulty picking up the footprints which had become invisible to the naked eye microscopic quantities of vaseline showed up vaguely under the socalled black light the trail led to the gloomy side street doc canny did not enter instead he circled to the opposite end of the block used his black light and finding no tracks knew that the quarry had entered a building somewhere in the block the bronze man considered a boat was passing on the river and it was near enough that the watery wash from its bows was audible this evidence that the river was very near seemed to give doc an idea he moved down the street careful to keep clear of the street in which the vaseline trail ended and the thick fog swallowed him some minutes later a creature with an appearance both grotesque and pitiable appeared in the street and the grimy thoroughfare was filled with the whine of a hand organ the organ player was a beggar a hideous cripple his legs were drawn up and apparently useless for the fellow dragged himself along by his hands judging from the enormous colored glasses under the brim of a shapeless hat the fellow was also blind the hand organ jangled with a quality as macabre as the personality of the grisly beggar from time to time the mendicant lifted a face that was purple lumpy and utterly repulsive the beggar moved slowly cranking his organ carefully feeling his way along the sidewalk he stopped frequently to let the organ wail and to clink some pennies in a tin cup eventually he reached the house into which ull and his silver men had gone a few feet beyond it he stopped put his organ down drew from his ragged clothing a paperwrapped sandwich and began to eat the slowness with which he ate indicated he would be some time at his dining but it was not long before things began to happen a door opened get thell outa here bum grated a harsh voice the beggar seized his organ and began to play his loudest the street resounded with the discordant notes the man in the door cursed then he ran down the steps across the walk and gave the beggar a resounding kick in the side beat it i told yer he snarled but the results were not as expected the mendicant gave a convulsive jerk and fell over he lay motionless apparently in a dead faint the man who had done the kicking swore fiercely and seemed baffled as to what do he could not let the beggar lie that would draw attention he picked the fellow up and hauled him inside after he had the limp beggar through the door the man dropped him went back and scrutinized the street the miserable avenue was deserted whew sighed the man i couldnt leave that bum layin around for doc savage to see it might make the big bronze guy suspicious he picked up a silver garment which had been behind the door and drew it on then he turned intending to inspect the senseless beggar he got barely half around his eyes flew wide his jaw fell for the erstwhile beggar had undergone a complete metamorphosis the mendicant had turned into a giant of a figure legs uncoiling from their grotesque positions back straightening head lifting the silver man lashed out frantically with a fist his knuckles skidded on purplish makeup and the theatrical grease rubbed aside disclosed bronze skin beneath doc sav the silver man did not get past the first syllable a metallic fist under his jaw closed his mouth clickingly and he slumped knocked out doc savage let the fellow sag to the floor breaking the fall enough to eliminate undue noise he had not struck hard the victim would be out only a few minutes this was so that the man could be questioned if necessary doc listened then he whipped for the nearest shadows the scuffle had been heard the clatter of approaching footsteps told him that a door down the hallway came open with a smash silver figures appeared they held flashlights which sprayed blinding luminance the lights picked up docs form the bronze giant was a startling figure in the beggar makeup the coat he wore it went with one of several disguises which he carried in the delivery truck was padded to feign deformities and these padded portions protruded strangely now that he was erect curiosity gripped the silver men held them long enough for doc to move he already bad the implement he intended to use had it in one hand he lobbed it at the floor in front of the nearest silver man there was a roar the floor splintered the silver man was knocked backwards went end over end then managed to gain his feet the other silver men backed away wildly forgetting their guns in their baste then as doc lifted his arm with another explosive grenade they pitched for the nearest door got through and hurled their weight against the panel in an endeavor to close it doc tried to prevent the door from closing the silver men strained and pushed squeezing profanity through clenched teeth except the floor which was inadequate there was no grip for docs feet he was forced back the door closed and the lock clicked an instant later machinegun slugs began clouting splinteredged holes in the panel doc retreated swabbing some of the makeup off his face with a sleeve the stuff might get in his eyes in a handtohand fight he brought out a tiny highexplosive grenade and lobbed it at the door lightning seemed to strike inside the grimy building plaster fell off the walls floor boards jumped up with a screeching of pulled nails the door turned into a cloud of fragments the machine gun was silenced by the exploding grenade after debris had ceased to fall men began cursing then they ran away from the dragging sounds it seemed they were hauling one of their number who was injured doc savage did not advance in pursuit he held respect for these foes they were cunning just how cunning was evident when there came a second terrific concussion which caused the old building to rock sent window glass sheeting out and loosened more plaster they had left one of their own grenades behind the time fuse set for a long interval had doc followed them he might very well have been killed from the entrance to the building there came noise of a movement that would be the silver man who had so unwisely kicked the pseudo beggar the reviving fellow floundered about a bit then he ran outside his feet made a rapid patter which receded down the street doc savage did not attempt to follow him the bronze man waited and it must have been full two minutes later when he heard several shots which came from the direction the fleeing silver man had taken doc did not try to ascertain what had happened the bronze man used a second highexplosive grenade to open a hole in the hallway wall then whipped through the aperture while debris was still falling he was now in a bare litterstrewn room plaster dust seethed in choking clouds doc produced a cuplike contrivance which fitted over his nostrils a rubber tube ran from this to a compact arrangement of metal flasks it was a gas mask also a protection against smoke and dust there were airtight goggles for his eyes the silver men were working toward the rear doc could hear their profanity then he saw distinct traces of a cloud other than plaster dust and knew his foes had turned loose some type of gas hoping they would think the gas had overcome him doc did not use more grenades he worked toward the rear near the center of the building he encountered a room which had windows opening on a ventilating shaft through these light came on the floor a large rat groveled its antics madly agonized as the bronze man observed the rodent became still the gas was poison glass had been shattered out of the ventilating shaft windows looking out of one of these doc saw a fireescape ladder leading upward he swung out but before he mounted he pulled another of the explosive grenades from a pocket this grenade like all of its kind was fitted with a time fuse but this differed from the conventional type in that its explosion was capable of being delayed by the turning of a tiny knob so as to withhold detonation for as long as several seconds doc adjusted the turning knob and left it on the floor the fire escape was ancient and groaned and shed rust under the bronze mans weight but it furnished him the means of reaching the roof crouched on the roof edge in the fog he could hear the caterwaul of police sirens headed for the spot as doc had expected there was another fire escape at the rear he ran down that lightly and stood in an alley that was black filthy when he was very near the rear door he could hear voices the silver men were grouped just inside arguing we gotta clear out of here one was insisting listen to the bull wagons bowl the placell be runnin over with law in a minute quiet commanded ulls voice savage may hear us at that instant the grenade which doc had left behind exploded deep inside the building hes still blastin around in there a man said voicing what doc had hoped they would think another growled wonder if hes wise that the two women aint here the police sirens were getting very close we shall have to leave ull snapped the rear door opened the door being heavy opened but slowly ulls words had given doc an instant of warning too and he was already in motion forty feet away up the alley stood an ash can doc was behind it before ull and his silver men stepped out into the alley the silver hoods were more bulky due no doubt to gas masks which ull and his fellows had donned the group ran in the direction of the nearby river after one searching glance around they did not look back but gave all attention to getting away before the police arrived when they were out of the alley doc followed them he kept under cover using his greatest skill for he wanted to follow these silver men to the spot where pat and lorna zane were being held the quarry made noise in their haste and that simplified docs trailing them warehouses shoved out of the fog became dank towering piles there was the odor of polluted bay water the sound of waves and the noise of a disconsolate gull doc quickened his pace he caught sight of the silver men still in their weird disguises they rounded a warehouse and ran out on a wharf where they were lost to view behind a tool house on the pier lay old machinery piling timbers doc worked through this on hands and knees most of the time a dozen feet from the tool house he lay still and listened there was no sound the bronze man leaped up and lunged for the tool structure a smoke bomb in one hand a grenade in the other as soon as he was around the structure all of his grim haste left him and his great muscles uncoiled from their tenseness so that he seemed suddenly slack and weary his motions as he pocketed the grenades were slow the gull that had been making the noise spun low overhead then zoomed away frightened by a fantastic note an eerie indefinable sound that might have been a spawn of the fog the sound was trilling melodious yet devoid of tune an eerie cadence which lasted only a moment then came to an end as fantastic as its beginning docs lips did not move as he made the sound such a quality of ventriloquism did it possess that a close bystander could not have told from whence it came without previous knowledge the tool house was an open shed there was no one in it no one on the wharf nor on the water which lunged greasy and menacing at the bronze mans feet doc looked under the wharf the silver men were not there he listened for a long time no boat could have taken them away in the fog so silently that he could not have heard their departure the silver men had vanished in a fashion as strange as their costumes there was a crowd of police about the ramshackle grimy and now half destroyed building where the trap had been set for doc they asked questions of the giant bronze man who wore the grotesque padded garb of a deformed beggar a trap doc said simply and got the hand organ which he had carried when playing the part of the mendicant the hand organ held carefully concealed in its innards the ultraviolet lantern the big colored glasses doc had worn while playing beggar had been the spectacles which helped in detecting by daylight the fluorescing of the black light thus he had traced the vague smears of vaseline to the building doc started for his truck but deviated to join a crowd at a nearby corner there police were keeping the crowd back from a body sprawled on the sidewalk an officer was removing an allenveloping silver garment from it the dead man was burly evil of face and his body had not spilled much scarlet because he had been shot perfectly between the eyes there was a gun near the corpse i came around a corner and bumped into him and he ups and ats me with his iron explained one of the cops but he was a little slow doc said nothing and did not change expression although the death of the burly man closed a source of possible information for the fellow was the one who bad come out and kicked doc when he was doing his beggar act i will take the silver suit doc said the police passed it over without objection they knew this bronze man with his scientific skill his daring which sometimes seemed madness could probably accomplish more against the menace of the silver deathsheads than the entire metropolitan police there was an expensive wrist watch on the dead man doc glanced at it then at his own wrist watch the other was exactly two minutes and fifteen seconds fast doc savage started away only to pause and do what for him was a rare thing he reconsidered then he came back and took the expensive wrist watch from the arm of the dead man he donned the watch and wore it in place of his own chapter the green trail doc savage had exchanged his armored delivery truck for a dark somber sedan which in its way was as impregnable as the truck and as deceptive the change had been made at the skyscraper headquarters ham and rapid pace occupied the commodious front seat with doc monk and hugh mccoy were wedged in the back with a large number of metal equipment cases there had been no time out for explanations come on doc had directed then rattled out a string of numbers the numbers corresponded with the numerals inscribed on the equipment boxes which doc kept ready packed in the skyscraper aerie but now the bronze man was finishing a brief synopsis of what had happened at the end of the vaseline trail it was of course a trap he said now ham what did you learn about bedford burgess gardner or did you have time to learn anything ham rolled his sword cane between manicured fingers he had changed his clothing and looked dapper neat not at all as if he had been in a mad whirl of death destruction and mystery throughout the night i learned enough be said and grimness crackled in his orators voice what do you mean by that one year ago bedford burgess gardner beaded a secondrate shipping company ham stated exactly one year ago negotiations were under way discussing the merger of gardners hack concern with a larger sounder company one man opposed the union the president of the board of the other company that night the president was killed by a burglar whom he caught ransacking his house the merger went through this sounds bad rapid pace gulped rapidly yes sir it does sound bad three months later a second merger was under consideration this one between gardners company and still another two men in the other outfit opposed the union a private yacht blew up and killed them both the merger went through for cryin out loud hugh mccoy exploded bigvoiced in the rear seat that was the merger between gardners concern and the oriental passengerfreight transport exactly said ham there was another merger a few weeks ago and that one also had suspicious circumstances somebody else killed monk demanded in his characteristic tiny voice no said ham it was the sinking of the liner avallancia hey monk barked we read about that in the paper yesterday the newspaper story said the avallancia belonged to bedford burgess gardners company it did not at the time it was sunk ham corrected it belonged to the other company a small concern and its loss put them in such a bad financial predicament that they had to merge with gardners corporation gardner gave out that he had already merged that was so wall street would not think the smaller company was financially embarrassed and try to beat down the price of its stock doc savage asked sharply did financial manipulations in stock feature these mergers all of them ham rapped and right here we haul the cat out of the bag listen said monk use plain english will you bedford burgess gardner has made over a billion dollars during the last year ham said slowly and distinctly does that sound like plain english it sounds like a blasted lot of money monk muttered the conversation had not taken long but the big sedan was traveling fast they were now on the water front gliding along before frowning phalanxes of pier warehouses stock ballooning doc asked without turning his head exactly said ham recapitalization with each merger and flotations of immense stock issues which were disseminated to the public again said monk will you use plain english here is a simple example ham snapped make it very simple monk told him sourly and dont make any cracks about me being ignorant you own a boat worth a thousand dollars and i own a boat worth a thousand dollars ham explained we both carry passengers and freight we are bitter business rivals we do anything we can to cut each others throat i can see how that could be monk growled as a result neither of us makes much money ham continued i offer to merge you refuse and i ruin the engine in your boat so youve got to merge which is another name for selling out to me very clear monk snorted now i have two companies worth a thousand a piece said ham i issue stock two thousand shares of no par value and offer it to the public if the public has any sense they wont pay over a dollar a share for the stock because that is all my merged companies are worth hurry it up monk commanded impatiently all right said ham i bid three dollars a share for the stock on the market doing the bidding through a broker so that no one knows my name or even through a dummy purchaser i jump the price to four dollars the public gets excited and begins to buy demand holds the price up or possibly makes it go higher the result when all two thousand shares of stock are sold is that i have cleaned up an extra thousand or two hmmm monk murmured his homely features thoughtful then i find another company make it merge with me recapitalize issue new stock to the holders of shares in the first merger concern and do it all over again ham leaned back in the seat that is what gardner did fundamentally of course the actual high finance was a bit more complicated than that but he has cleaned up almost a billion within the last year rapid pace whipped around glared at hugh mccoy and clipped you work for gardner what do you know about this mccoy returned the glare his too perfectly handsome face turning scarlet i have only been working for gardner on the paine l winthrop concern merger he yelled i did not know anything was wrong and i dare you to show differently you mean you were so dumb you did not know you were working for the worlds biggest crook rapid pace snapped gardner is a devil a cunning devil mccoy shouted and dont you insinuate pipe down you birds or ill bob you both monk advised his small voice turning into a rumble doc pulled to a stop before an enormous building of brick and steel the structure in front of which they had halted for all of its size differed little from other warehouses which stood on piers along the water front a sign on the front read hidalgo trading company the building was doc savages waterfront boathouse and seaplane hangar perhaps dock workers wondered why the place seemed deserted much of the time but it was doubtful if any knew its true nature doc touched a button on the dash this operated an ultraviolet light projector on the front of the sedan and the beam in turn actuated a photoelectric cell which caused the great door in the front of the warehouse hangar to slide open doc drove into the enormous building and the door closed automatically behind them rapid pace and hugh mccoy stared in gaping astonishment at the array of fast planes they ranged from a tiny gyro to a great trimotored speed ship which could carry two dozen passengers in excess of three hundred miles an hour hurry doc commanded the bronze man passed the planes opened a door into another section of the building and switched on lights if pace and mccoy had been surprised by the planes they were figuratively floored by what they saw now a submarine mccoy gasped and his manicured band strayed up to his eyes as if to see if they were functioning correctly helldiver was the name on the conning tower of the underseas craft the helldiver was probably as unique a sub as man had ever constructed the conning tower as such existed hardly at all and from bow to stern ran great steel sledlike runners stoutly braced the helldiver had first been constructed for a trip under the north polar ice doc and his little group of aides had seen two great adventures aboard the heildiver the first under the polar ice and the second through an underground river into a fantastic phantom city in the arabian desert after the arabian trip the submersible had lain idle but carefully greased the fuel tanks full the craft was ready for quick service get the stuff aboard doc directed mccoy moistened his almost womanish lips are we are we going under the water doc studied him you do not like the idea mccoy straightened his remarkably square shoulders i i have never been down but i shall go i owe it to my reputation to help capture this devil gardner doc turned to rapid pace and you pace shuddered i do not like the idea i think i shall stay here he shuddered again yes sir i shall stay behind no iron fish for mine then pace caught monks eye monks eyes were small and normally pleasant but now they were small and not pleasant for monk was thinking that rapid pace had gone out for cigarettes about the time he and doc were in the east river diving for the mysterious metal box monk was a blunt fellow not given to suavity and what he was thinking showed on his incredibly homely features rapid pace began to tremble on second thought i shall be glad to go he gulped yes on second thought the helldivers engines had been reconditioned since her arabian jaunt diesels had new pistons the electric motors new bearings the electric motors were running now and they made little noise doc savage and his four companions stood in the control room the submarine was equipped so that one man could operate her if necessary all controls centered in one spot the depth indicator read only twenty feet and the periscope was up above the surface but doc now turned a wheel and the steel cigar with the strange runners sank slowly a touch of a button and the periscope swished down into its well rapid pace moistened his lips clenched his fists and cried uneasily but were in new york harbor a ship may run into us monk homely features placid said weve taken the helldiver where icebergs were thicker than fleas and never did hit anything what saved you pace demanded yes sir what saved you the instruments monk shrugged there are sonic devices all over the hull they tell us how deep the water is and if anything larger than a rowboat comes near well know it monk indicated a bank of dials these bore hands which were continually jumping slightly four of them were marked north south east and west a fifth dial was labeled bottom distance the dial marked south abruptly began jumping that means there is a boat to the south said monk doc swung the steering controls slightly after a bit the jumping shifted to the west dial then the north dial which meant they had left the surface vessel astern remarkable hugh mccoy murmured you aint seen nothing monk snorted doc has used this sub for testing out ideas its got more gadgets aboard than the average man sees in a lifetime rapid pace shifting about nervously as was his habit asked in a shrill voice but what are we out here in a submarine for monk scowled were hunting silver men of course who ever heard of a submarine hunting a submarine pace said rapidly they use sub chasers surface vessels for that listen noisy suppose you pipe down monk requested yes mccoy told pace you talk too much rapid pace glared at the handsome wellknit figure of mccoy his lips curled hatefully you of course are large enough to whip me he gritted otherwise i would hand you a poke on the jaw ill tie one hand behind me if it will encourage you any mccoy jeered monk said cut it out or ill bump your heads without taking his flakegold eyes off the controls doc savage announced within not longer than two minutes we shall know whether we have the slightest chance of finding the silver men the electric motors had decreased their slight hum and gear boxes made almost no noise so that they could hear the bay water curling past the outer skin of the helldiver where are we monk asked doc savage dropped a sinewwrapped bronze finger on the illuminated chart table and said here the gorillalike chemist hunched over the map board blinked his small eyes and observed that they were navigating by the crude map which doc had secured from the secret room in the indian head club their position as indicated by docs finger was near one of the four small stars but not the star where the bronze man had dived and found the mysterious metal box so were gonna try to get another one of them boxes monk grunted no doc corrected monk squinted his small eyes huh i saw enough of the first box before losing it over the side of the launch when the submarine fired on us doc explained those boxes are very clever radio buoys they are nothing more than tiny transmitters radio transmitters monk grunted very compact doc elaborated they are fitted with a form of the socalled aircell battery which delivers a small quantity of current over a long period of time the transmitters in the boxes are of extremely small power using a negligible amount of current ham tapped the chart with his sword cane you say those stars mark the location of radio buoys what do you mean radio buoys i will illustrate doc answered the bronze man clicked switches then turned a knob which controlled the helldivers radio compass the latter did not differ greatly from the type in use on most naval and commercial vessels except that it could function on extremely short wavelengths manipulating the wavelength knob doc fished through the ether for the signal from the silver deathsheads radio buoy the others waited impatiently the bronze man had decreased their speed even more until the momentum was now barely enough to cause the planing effect of diving rudders to hold them off the bottom a faint popping came from the speaker it loudened as doc maneuvered the loop a sound closely akin to static there he announced they did not use the regular dotanddash signals but an arrangement of breaking contacts which creates a sound resembling static deuced clever ham murmured any one picking up that noise on their radio would think it was static and give it no more attention doc moved levers the helldiver picked up speed and headed for the radio buoy the sound got louder then began to weaken as they passed over it and left it astern soon doc picked up the sound of the next buoy rapid pace said abruptly i get it yes i get it these buoys are to guide the silver deathshead submarine into the harbor they must have a rendezvous somewhere outside the harbor there were thick glass windows in the submarine conning tower and through these the men could see the vile green water of the bay curling past the green trail ham said grimly i hope it leads us to something chapter hell under water although the helldiver could be navigated by one man it was considerable of a singlehanded task it kept doc extremely busy moving levers nipping switches the tanks trimmed themselves through the medium of a robot apparatus which helped inset in the front wall of the control room was a large panel of frosted glass there were similar panels in the side and rear walls as well monk who was familiar with the helldivers intricate mechanism adjusted dials which resulted in a remarkable thing happening to the frosted glass panels they assumed a greenish hue the glaucous tint seemed alive moving rapid pace ogled the panels but not until a bit of underwater driftage swirled past one did he realize he was seeing the watery depths outside the submarine marvelous be exploded yes sir marvelous there are strong infrared searchlights recessed in the hull monk told him infrared light penetrates water a little better than ordinary visible rays photoelectric eyes pick up the images and they are brought to these screens through common television apparatus pace looked a little dizzy why this underseas boat is incredible it must have cost a fortune it did monk told him calmly this iron fish was a whiz when it was first built and it has been improved on ever since i told you that when doc invents something for a submarine he tries it out on the helldiver ham eying his sword cane put in and that reminds me of something where did these silver deathsheads get their sub monk grunted ive been wondering about that too that may not be so mysterious doc offered eh monk stared at the bronze giant do you recall my telling you that lorna zane said paine l winthrop gave her fivemonths vacation with pay last spring doc queried sure said monk rapid pace exploded i was given a vacation at the same time so were all of the regular employees of the winthrop shipyards it was very mysterious when we got back to work we found that the shipyard had been in operation during our absence we never did find out what had been built that said doc explains it so the submarine was built in winthrops yard ham clipped grimly winthrop was in on this he got cold feet or fell out with his partners or something and they killed him with a shell fired from the submarine in the east river fantastic rapid pace murmured utterly fantastic yes sir the helldiver had now passed the last of the radio buoys shown on the map which doc had gotten from the indian head club what now monk wondered aloud we will keep on and hope the map did not show all of the radio guides doc said sure enough the directional apparatus picked up more of the bursts which bad the sound of static the buoys it seemed continued out toward the open sea following the trail always beneath the surface they veered to the right out of ship lanes they were now heading down the jersey coast but a number of miles offshore pretty slick monk said having a string of radio buoys to guide them right into new york harbor boy oh boy what a perfect getaway idea it required the expenditure of a lot of money ham pointed out monk started to say something and his mouth flew so very wide open that it seemed he was trying to yawn his right arm jutted out like a bar pointing ill be a whales brother he choked look in the sternview screen had appeared an object which resembled a steel egg viewed from the front it might have been a fish coming headon for they had seen other fish on the screens but this was of a steely color and certain rudders and protuberances marked it for what it was submarine ham ejaculated the other subseas craft was traveling more swiftly than the helldiver and therefore was gaining doc savage advanced the throttles the helldiver picked up speed but so did the other ship it continued to gain this bus was not made for racing monk grumbled the iceprotector rails cut down the speed rapid pace cried anxiously how about torpedo tubes none aboard doc advised what about depth bombs then doc savage shook a metallic head the helldiver is not equipped for fighting it is primarily a scientific experimental vessel the bronze man changed their course a trifle monk was scowling at the screen one consolation that other iron fish hasnt got torpedo tubes either the pursuing sub swung slightly sidewise to follow the helldiver and they could observe the length of the craft it was considerably smaller than the helldiver more slender scientifically streamlined seems like ive seen that bus somewhere before monk grunted or maybe it was a picture it was a picture doc told him monk blinked little eyes i cant remember where i saw it do you not long ago united states newspapers carried a photograph of a small twoman submarine which the japanese were testing doc advised it was a craft closely resembling that one probably the design of the japanese submarine was copied in making this one the smaller underseas boat was now only a few yards behind they could see in the front of the conning tower a round glass porthole rapid pace barked i wonder what they plan to do doc not altering expression said nothing pleasant you can rest assured pace moistened his lips then glanced down at his bands he held them out in front of him they were steady this seemed to surprise him hurrah he shouted hugh mccoy glared at him and snarled i dont see anything to be happy about mccoys exquisitely handsome face was greasy with perspiration rapid pace grinned widely gentlemen i believe my association with you has ridded me of something which has hampered me all my life i am speaking of my cowardice i usually scare get so frightened that i am positively a wreck but now i feel like a daredevil positively a daredevil mccoy groaned what are we going to do why dont we rise to the surface we cant outrun them see that streamlined hatch on the other sub doc queried yyes mccoy stuttered that undoubtedly covers the threeinch gun doc assured him they cannot fire it under water but wait let us see if this helps the bronze man reached over and jerked a brass lever the rearview screen suddenly became black but the viewing device had not failed the blackness was from without an inky cloud was pouring from receptacles in the skin of the submarine blazes monk gulped this is a new one on me doc savage put the wheel hard over then cut the motors to halfthrottle remember when we went under the polar ice in the helldiver he asked do i grunted monk ill never forget we put tanks in the submarine skin to hold a chemical mixture you invented incidentally which would melt ice when released doc recalled that was to free us if we got trapped under the ice pack monk nodded sure the chemical solution i just released from those tanks is my own invention doc told him it turns salt water black the secret is now in the hands of the united states government it may come in handy should there be another war doc now manipulated the sonic locators these showed that the small submarine of the silver men was astern wandering in its course baffled by the sepia water doc cut the motors of the helldiver entirely the craft lost headway sank and came to a rest on the bottom of the atlantic which at this point was hard sand according to the charts mccoy mopped perspiration from his toohandsome features and groaned i dont see where this is going to help us pace grinned at him were alive anyway glaring mccoy snapped you dont need to be so damned cheerful rapid pace in his new personality of a man who was not afraid was a different individual from the nervous rapidtalking efficiency expert he even spoke more slowly firmly and did not repeat himself as much from now on you use a civil tongue when you speak to me he told hugh mccoy grimly otherwise i am going to do my best to knock hell out of you monk growled for just about the last time im telling you guys to cut that out there came a loud metallic clank the rubberribbed floor tilted throwing all but doc savage off balance the bronze mans grip on the controls kept him erect mccoy wailed fearfully and seemed on the point of bursting into tears what was that he screamed rapid pace picked himself up sneered at mccoy then squinted at the window panels these were black due to the murky solution in the water without but the ocean current had swept some of the sepia cloud away and he could make out objects a few feet from the helldiver hull look pace barked that other submarine has fastened itself to our hull in some manner doc savage started the helldiver motors the sub began to move but it was an erratic motion the resistance of the other vessel clinging to their hull and the other craft did not dislodge was sufficient to prevent them steering a straight course manipulating valves doc caused the helldivers ballast tanks to blow they lifted a few feet then their rise stopped and they watched the depth gauge sink back until they jarred on the sandy ocean floor again the helldiver an extremely heavy craft did not have enough surplus buoyancy to lift the other submarine with its ballast tanks fully filled hell yelled monk this beats anything i ever heard of whats holdin that iron fish to us that is the mystery doc said grimly and what puzzles me even more how did it find us in the black water there was quiet in the helldiver now except for the clicking of a gyro compass and the microscopic ticking of chronometers they strained their ears hugh mccoy had changed color not getting pale but blue as if he were being slowly smothered glub the sound was wet glub glub it repeated twice again bubbles from an escape hatch on the other sub doc rapped they are sending divers outside the bronze giant lashed a glance at the depth indicators they read slightly below seventy feet the depth was not excessive for diving work doc ran to a locker which held diving equipment flexible mailarmored suits and some of the transparent hoods which vaguely resembled goldfish bowls the locker held more than hall a dozen outfits doc hauled them out put them on he rapped monk and ham sprang to obey they knew how the suits operated having used them before rapid pace joined them hugh mccoy stood back his exquisitely profiled face even more purple monk picked up one of the suits and ran toward mccoy intending to force the handsome man to put it on mccoy suddenly clawed at a pocket he bad a gun half out when monk lunging wrenched the weapon from his fingers what in blazes were you gonna do with that monk yelled i ddont know mccoy stuttered ffight those devils i guess i dont want to go outside i hate the water ive never been in a diving suit why were sseventy feet down monk jammed mccoys gun in his own pocket yes and well be down here permanently unless we do something about it mccoy trembling allowed himself to be helped into the diving suit and received instructions on its operation rapid pace chest puffed with his newfound courage said im not scared i feel like a daredevil positively damned if i understand it chapter underwater defeat the helldiver was not silent now the men were breathing noisily from the exertion of getting into the suits the suits themselves made clinkings against the metal parts of the submarine but there was other sound a hideous sound it was a series of resounding blows against the steel hull of the submarine these came from forward and from immediately overhead theyve found our hatches and are trying to get them open to let the water in monk growled then the homely chemist pulled the transparent helmet over his head switched on the tiny twoway radio and added lets get goin we gotta put a stop to that doc savage led the way aft he opened an oval hatch which gave into a steel cubicle hardly more than six feet square in the top of this was another hatch doc closed the bulkhead through which they had come he turned a lever machinery whined the hatch overhead lifted and water came in by strings at first then with a smashing rush that jostled them about the bronze man let compressed air from the back tanks into his suit to compensate his buoyancy to approximately that of the surrounding sea then he leaped floated upward grasped the hatch edge and clambered out the others followed him mccoy first then pace then monk and ham each man drew a sharp longbladed knife these were holstered to the diving suit belts under water knives were the most effective weapons it was lighter than they had expected outside for one thing the current had swept away the black cloud and the silver men were carrying powerful portable torches doc headed for the group about the main conning tower hatch they were vague at first like figures seen in a fog then they took on distinctness there were four of them they wore selfcontained diving suits paraphernalia which did not require air hoses oxygen being supplied by tanks worn on a back harness their helmets were not transparent but of metal with round grilled windows the diving equipment was of the sort which could be purchased at any supply house the silver men there was not the slightest doubt but that they were silver deathsheads were working with wrenches and bars and a cutting torch made a lurid spot of light and spewed bubbles through the water doc ran toward them leaning far forward probably the thump of his lead shoes on the sub hull warned the group about the conning tower hatch they straightened the one with the torch sidled ahead waving the grisly flame before him it was a hideous weapon that torch it burned under water by grace of pure oxygen supplied from a portable tank and it could slice through hard steel with no more difficulty than a finger is drawn through mud monk lunged along at docs elbow the pleasantly ugly chemist retained some of his apish aspect in a diving suit well flank the man with the torch doc said into the radio the bronze man went to the right monk took the left the diver with the torch made a few erratic passes then began to retreat he had respect for the knives doc and monk carried the body of his suit was of rubber and canvas composition by no means proof against sharp steel suddenly the silver men broke and fled resistance of the water made their movements grotesquely slow as they took flying leaps off the hull of the helldiver then churned for their own craft which was attached slightly forward doc and monk following had a chance to observe how the other submarine managed to cling so tightly to the helldiver attached to the hull of the smaller uboat was a succession of circular objects which might have been washtubs it was these which were in contact with docs submarine electromagnets monk yelled through the intercommunicating radio but what in blazes are electromagnets doing on their tub the answer to that did not come until later after unpleasant things had happened the submarine of the silver men while small in proportion to the helldiver was larger than it had first seemed when viewed through the lookout screen from within the helldiver it was no twoman craft at least a dozen silver men in diving suits were outside they grouped to meet doc and his party some of them held divers knives but others were doing something else working at the escape hatch by which they had left their own submersible they drew out black rods some six feet or more in length to the ends of which were attached what resembled black rubber hose the men held these rods like lances and advanced the black line trailed out behind them and led into their own submarine one of them stumbled he put the end of his rod down against the sandy bottom to maintain his balance where the rod touched there was abrupt sizzling blue flame like an electric arc the rods carry highvoltage current doc warned his companions pressure closes a contact if they touch us with those things were finished the silver men came on their features were grotesque inside the helmet windows for they still wore the gruesome masks which had caused the tabloid newspapers to give them their designation of silver deathsheads the insulated highvoltage rods probed hungrily doc halted wheeled saw that his four companions were behind him and waved them back to fight them would be fatal he warned stay away from those rods circle around them keep them worried i am going back into the helldiver the bronze man spun and sloped back for the escape hatch his best speed was not as fast as a normal man could walk on land injecting extra buoyancy into his suit he lifted himself up to the conning tower compensated the buoyancy then dropped back and let himself down into the hatch compressed air forced the sea water out a moment later he was in the helldiver control room a twist of a lever discharged a fresh quantity of the chemical which due to its reaction with the saline content of the sea water created a black smudge next the bronze man dug a cutting torch out of a locker he did not ignite it then he passed through the escape hatch and emerged outside again every one safe he asked monk and ham replied almost at once over the intercommunicating radio mccoy was a bit slower how about you pace doc asked im not a bit scared said rapid pace i cannot understand it simply stay clear of them doc directed give me a chance to work on their electromagnets with this cutting torch the bronze man did not ignite the torch immediately since its glow might betray his presence despite the black smear which now filled the sea it was like working through ink as he crept along the hard sandy bottom the silver men he reasoned would be worried by the black cloud and stick close to their own craft getting between the two tightlyclinging submersibles doc fended off with one hand then puffed his suit with the air valve and sailed upward he found one of the electromagnets which were like washtubs the cutting torch was fitted with an underwater igniter with a mild explosion it began to flame doc savage promptly clamped his transparent helmet to the steel side of the submarine this would cause the clank of lead shoes should any divers approach to come to his attention before danger was too close instead of holding the cutting torch in his hand the bronze man placed it on the sub hull in such a position that the flame was held against the electromagnet covering without aid from his own hand this was a matter of precaution the torch might shortcircuit through the coil and bring a deathdealing jolt of current shortly a flash of blue flame showed through the sepia void that would be the burnedout coil wires arcing doc jerked the insulated lanyard attached to the torch and drew it to him he worked down the hull in the intensely dark gently resisting void that was the sea and found the next electromagnet he repeated the process there even to keeping his helmet pressed to the subhull and it was well that he did not neglect that last he might have missed the clanking of rapid footsteps lead shoes were coming along the subdeck from the jangling noises other divers were striving to clamber up the hull doc waited the torch made a roaring that almost drowned out the footsteps but it did not drown them quite as much as before the divers were getting close doc hauled the torch in cut the flame and eased away a few feet down the hull he stepped out and let himself sink to the sand before he got his balance the ocean current carried him against the helldivers hull he crept along it feeling his way monk ham doc called into the microphone get in the helldiver with pace and mccoy doc reached the escape hatch and a moment later with a dull clanking and a bubbling of released air his four companions also reached the hatch in order not to get lost they had linked themselves together with a line a hank of stout cord was a part of each diving suit belt equipment doc closed the escape chamber hatch blew the water then stepped into the helldiver he ran for the control room without removing the diving suit motors wailed out at his touch of the starting switch wailed and labored suddenly there was a great crashing of circuit breakers cutting current off from the motors the breakers functioned automatically to protect the motors from an overload doc tried again unclutched from the propeller drive shafts the motors turned over readily but the shafts themselves refused to turn the overload caused the breakers to bang open what is it monk asked anxiously they seem to have wrapped chain around our propeller shafts doc told him the bronze man now blew the helldivers ballast tanks to their fullest in an endeavor to get the submarine to pull free from the electromagnets which still held it to the other underwater craft since some of the magnets had been rendered useless doc hoped the others would be insufficient to hold he was positive they could have gotten away had the helldivers motors been able to turn over the propellers the submarines did not separate however but continued to repose on the sea bottom magnetically glued together and now there was more noise at the hatches as the silver men endeavored to force themselves inside the helldiver doc went back to the escape chamber accompanied by the other four they were grim saying little enclosed in the chamber they shut the inner door then doc touched the control which started opening the outer panel the door had opened but a few inches when he lunged for the controls and reversed them a black rod had protruded through the opening its end was armored with the shiny copper of an electrode one of them blasted electric lances monk growled keep away from it doc commanded grimly the lance had been caught in the closing door the steel panel pinched shut and a moment later cut through the lance insulation with a resultant explosion of blue flame the helldiver was equipped with two escape hatches so that divers could come and go they had been intended for scientific exploration work under water the second hatch was located forward and was smaller well try the other hatch doc decided they were in water well above their knees when the inner door was open this flooded into the helldiver with them but the automatic pumps would take care of it but they did not reach the other escape hatch or pass through it to engage in combat they were abreast of the conning tower when there was a moaning roar and water sheeted out of the control room it came from the control room door as if that aperture were the mouth of a great faucet which had been turned on suddenly doc savage for all of his great strength was tumbled about and smashed into bulkheads the torrent jostled him down a passage banged him into a steel support and the transparent helmet he was wearing would have broken had it not been of very strong construction monk and the others lacking docs physical hardihood were handled with greater roughness mccoy yelled in pain as he smashed over a motor there was terror in his voice also pace swore calmly monk and ham resisted the water with grim silence had they all not worn diving suits death would have come within the ensuing few minutes as it was they were jostled about helpless to resist the tremendous force of the water until the helldivers main compartment had filled only the central section filled at the moment however for there were safety devices on the bulkhead doors mechanical contrivances which closed and made the bulkheads watertight when water entered there were no air locks between the bulkheads so that it was impossible to move from one compartment to the other now that the central one was full silver men in diving suits began dropping down the conning tower hatch the sea water due to the strong current had cleared up again the black cloud having been swept away the first silver man to enter held one of the long dark lances and close at his elbow came another man bearing a strong underwater searchlight they advanced more sinister divers entered behind them they floated down in an ominous procession vague forms in the water like spectral bodies from some stygian domain there was only the one electric lance the others held divers knives doc and his men retreated there was nothing else to do the lance was deadly it was the thing which had defeated them the one weapon with which they were helpless to cope having as they did no time to rig an insulated shield or other defense there was not even an insulated pole in the helldiver which could be employed to fend off the electric lance doc watched the lancer the bronze mans remarkable features plainly distinguishable inside his transparent helmet showed no emotion docs attention all of it was on the lance the clanking of lead shoes made a metallic mumble on the floor plates that was why he did not hear the bulkhead door behind him open it was a carefully made wellgreased door doc had no way of knowing that the other compartments had been opened and flooded but they had the work had been done with wrenches and cutting torches and silver men had come from behind to flank docs party a second diver appeared in the bulkhead opening then came a third a fourth and a fifth they had no lance but they all held knives they lunged in to attack doc was not taken entirely unawares he heard the flanking divers wheeled noted the absence of a lance and lunged in fiercely to the attack the silver divers did not retreat they must have felt they had safety in numbers it was a weirdly fantastic battle which was fought in the watergorged entrails of the submarine the fellow with the electrified lance made a few jabs then the electric cord leading to the power plant in his own underwater craft became entangled and he had to abandon the unique weapon doc savage and his men surrounded completely now formed a tight ring a circlet that bristled with the razorsharp steel thorns of their knives but they did not hold it for iong silver divers lunged in on the side defended by pace and mccoy they broke through one man sagged back bubbles pouring from a hole which pace had knifed in his suit the fighting ring disintegrated four men seized doc savage one lost interest in the fray and stumbled off for his own submarine his suit streaming bubbles a man leeched upon docs arm doc endeavored to shake him off in the open air it would have been a simple task but under water it was a herculean job the bronze mans second arm was trapped a man tangled with his legs doc was forced over sidewise there was no purchase for footing because his weight above the displaced water was negligible the diving suit hampered him he felt some one at his back he endeavored to spin despite the men trying to hold him but it was too late there was a roar of escaping air his oxygen apparatus had been wrenched away as air pressure left the bronze mans helmet water began to pour in it sloshed cold upon his neck his shoulders spilled down in his suit which had been pressed tightly to his great frame when the air escaped water came up around his neck his lips had he been erect air pressure in the top of his helmet might have kept the water out for a few moments but he was tilted over on the steel floor the brine covered his nostrils his eyes a few bubbles left his nostrils then the mad desperation of impending death seemed to seize the metallic giant his great arms corded convulsed and the two silver livers who held him were carried together head first they dropped off his arms stunned doc stamped the other man free of his legs the fellow who had torn off the oxygen tank retreated still holding the tank in one hand a knife in the other doc made a move as if to follow him but a great weakness seemed to have seized him he swayed was moved about by the water currents within the swamped helldiver he sagged the current carried him backward and he disappeared into the gloom of the compartment from which the silver divers had come to stage the flank attack chapter the subseas ride ull himself had wrenched the oxygen apparatus from doc savages suit he was elated he yelled once in unholy delight as doc vanished into the black tomb of the compartment then he lunged toward two men who held rapid pace and jammed his helmet to one of theirs keep them alive he yelled because their diving suits were not equipped with the ingenious radio intercommunicating sets it was necessary to put helmets together when they wanted to talk in that manner vibration through the metal carried their voices hells fire the man shouted back why well pump them uli bellowed we must know whether they told the police what they had learned about us uli moved rapidly to his other men and repeated the order as a result monk and ham were hauled to the conning tower hatch not greatly damaged except in spirit monks diving suit was leaking on one leg but that would not be serious as long as he kept upright a knife had made a gash in it rapid pace and mccoy were also unharmed they were dragged along behind to the homely monk the trip back to the submarine of the silver deathsheads seemed to take an age he struggled at first then desisted at the very real threat of a knife point against his chest the air lock by which they were taken into the other subseas boat was of the conventional type possibly a bit larger than usual but monk was not interested in structural details forlorn grief contorted the chemists pleasantly ugly features he had seen what had happened to doc savage the bronze giant he was convinced was now dead the thought appalled monk it weakened him took his spirit made him listless not caring greatly what happened henceforward the fact that pat savage and lorna zane were still prisoners of the silver deathsheads perhaps alive was temporarily forgotten monks existence was tied up with doc savage and had been for years but doc was dead now scientist a being of superhuman physical powers master of incredible feats the bronze man had perished in a tomb of steel sixty feet beneath the atlantic monk thought of that and it put him in a mood where he could not see the need for carrying on monk and ham under the guard of alert submachine guns were placed together in a tiny compartment in the silver mens submarine their diving suits were removed they had to sit down shoulder to shoulder between two lockers there was barely room for them nor was there headroom for even the shortest of their captors in the submarine the uboat was incredibly cramped and she had a big cargo of humanity aboard if these men who wore the silver disguises could be classed as such rapid pace and mccoy were placed somewhere else monk and ham did not see them after they entered the underseas craft the homely chemist and the dapper lawyer did see a large metal canister being passed through the air hatch a clockwork device was attached to this and they recognized it for what it was a mine of the type used by the coast guard to destroy derelicts they could guess to what use the explosive was to be put the silver deathsheads loaded aboard the submarine and took off their diving paraphernalia they were a jubilant lot some removed their silver masks the faces they revealed had one thing in common there was viciousness about the eyes a switch was thrown cutting current off from the electromagnets the submarine lifted a little but did not clear the surface and traveled away by the sound of the motors monk and ham knew the craft was making full speed they knew why the mine the mine went off after a few minutes and the shock of it rolled the submarine and made her steel plates groan ull came and leered down at monk and ham and said that blew your submarine and the corpse of doc savage to where they belong ull removed his mask now probably because it hampered his breathing the fact that he did remove it promised an unpleasant future he would not show his face to men whom he expected to live to identify him later in a court of law it was a surprise this face of ulls it mirrored no evil not even the eyes it was a round cherubic thing the countenance of a matured cupid the eyes were soft and brown and the fat round chin had a cleft that was almost a dimple uii stared peacefully at monk and ham you see he said dryly we were prepared for trouble under the water whatcha mean monk asked thickly the electric lances u chuckled we have carried them aboard for a long time you see there was always a chance that we might be trapped under water and divers sent down to investigate the lances were the most effective weapons i could devise monk said nothing but tried not to think of doc savage and what had happened to him his groping mind hit on another thing which was puzzling him so he asked about it the electromagnets he asked how come this this thing was equipped with them we use them uii chuckled how monk questioned hoarsely uii chuckled if there was placidity and innocence on his cherubic face it did not extend to his voice for that was ugly in its very quietness there was satanic evil also in his calm demeanor the electromagnets enabled us to contact you in that black water uii offered we were lucky we came close to you and had sense enough to have the magnets switched on before we knew it we were fastened to you the magnets pulled us close they are very powerful you didnt put them on for that purpose monk muttered they wouldnt operate over a distance of more than a few feet what are they intended for uil smirked before long i think that will cease to puzzle you yeah monk growled then still trying to keep his thoughts off doc savages fate the homely chemist ejected another question pat is she all right she is alive uli told him i would not say she is all right in fact her position is very bad so is that of the other young lady lorna zane to be quite clear they are to be killed along with you unless you tell us whether or not the police know of our method of getting into new york harbor by the underwater route that last was an afterthought plainly and monk did not honor it with an answer they would be tortured of course whether or not they talked would not make much difference to them they would be killed anyway monk tried to clear up another mysterious point is bedford burgess gardner behind all this he asked ull hesitated put the end of a pink tongue between his teeth as he considered then burst into an explosion of hollow laughter is gardner the big brain he smiled you want to know that yes monk grunted yes said uli the submarine was traveling along at half throttle and not making great speed that was fortunate otherwise doc savage might have been torn off true he was lashed to a mooring ring on the deck he could never have held on any other way even with his fabulous muscles maybe he could have managed for a time but the chances were against it especially earlier during the time when the underseas craft had charged full speed from the vicinity of the helldiver endeavoring to get clear before the mine exploded docs escape from death had been executed without great difficulty or impossible legerdemain the water where the subsea fight had occurred was not so deep that its mere pressure produced extreme discomfort the bronze man had managed to get to a locker in the compartment into which he had disappeared after uil had torn off the oxygen apparatus this was not hard for doc knew the helldivers every rivet and he could hold his breath due to long practice a time an ordinary man would consider beyond human ability a pair of diving lungs had come out of the locker these were merely the tubes and mouthpiece purifier and oxygen tanks minus the helmet and suit of an ordinary diving rig donning the diving lungs had entailed no greater problem than the swallowing of a quantity of salt water doc wore them now the bronze man had to keep his head down and his features protected with enwrapping arms otherwise the diving lungs would have been torn out by the rush of the water that was why it was well that he had lashed himself to the mooring ring getting atop the submarine had not been difficult either since the silver men thought him dead not that the bronze man was having an easy time of it t he water tore at him with terrific force the lashing line was gradually sawing into his great ligaments and eventually he was certain to weaken and be battered into insensibility or else to lose the diving lungs which would be more disastrous he was unable to keep his eyes open against the tearing water except for an occasional brief squint the lighter hue of the water about him told him that the sub was not running far beneath the surface no doubt it was following the radio guide buoys the fact that they were not as deep indicated conceivably that they might be nearing shore soon the shoreward course hypothesis became a certainty for there was a grinding sound and doc chancing a glance saw the periscope rising he could barely make it out through the sunlit waters the fog must have cleared up judging by the illumination in the water the submotors became more silent the water lost some of its tearing force after a bit there was a soft jar and mud billowed up around the sub it had touched bottom probably its keel was reenforced against just such contacts as this t he sub was built almost as strongly as the practically indestructible helldiver the uboat lifted out of the mud and continued with bare headway it nosed forward everything indicated that the craft was nearing the secret base of the silver deathsheads doc could keep his eyes open he saw the underwater searchlight on the bow of the submarine spout brilliance although it was hardly necessary with the brightness of the sun a moment later the bronze man began a mad wrenching at the lashings which held him to the mooring ring a mass it resembled a gigantic log with the bark on due to a profuse growth of barnacles was looming overhead he was in immediate danger of being crushed chapter the base doc savage unlashed himself from the ring then stroked down and seized the fin of a diving rudder a watery rush from the propellers nearly tore him loose the sub was jockeying to get under the huge hulk above the slow tedious task the silver men made of it was nevertheless an expert job undoubtedly they were guided by highly scientific soundwave projectors and receivers or possibly beam radio apparatus which told them when they were directly under the mass overhead ballast was slowly blown and the underseas boat lifted there was a jar as it touched the barnaclecovered hulk in some spots the barnacles had been sheared away by past contacts and steel plates were disclosed the sub did not move after the contact it was being held in place by the electromagnets the thing above was the bottom of a ship it could be nothing else no doubt there were other electromagnets inside the ship to keep the uboat from changing position machinery ground a great turmoil of bubbles poured up from the direction of the air lock by which divers came and went from the uboat doc savage hastily released the diving fin to which he clung then stroked down and under the submarine from there he managed to get under the hull of the ship where he would be comparatively safe from discovery the bronze man worked forward swimming a little using the more clustered patches of barnacles for finger tip purchase the hull began to narrow as he approached the bow it was not a large ship it seemed he did not follow the bow up out of the water but shoved himself free and swam to the right keeping far beneath the surface he prowled out there for a time but found nothing then he tried the left side there he located the anchor cable a procession of thick iron links doc drew in all the air his lungs would comfortably contain then removed the diving lungs and tied them to the anchor linkage by the straps which held the purifying mechanism to his back it was a precaution if he got aboard the ship was shot at and went overboard not to come up the silver deathsheads would think him dead again perhaps he could reach the lungs swimming under water to don them the anchor chain ran down on the side opposite the point where the submarine had fastened itself which was fortunate but doc broke the surface very cautiously keeping under the anchor links they being large enough to partially conceal his head he stared upward the ship was a tramp a rusty old hulk of a few thousand tons one of the type which helped make up the rum row of prohibition days the row still existed for that matter well outside the jurisdiction of the coast guard and handled other things beside rum perfumes watch movements and other things on which there was a high duty no doubt a few aliens were smuggled too the tramp needed paint her brasswork was almost beyond being helped by polish and her one funnel leaned slightly askew doc saw the funnel when he reached the anchor hawse hole and lifted himself by the strength of his great arms the vessel had two crows nests that suspicious in itself and in each a lookout was on duty doc watched the lookouts closely they would sweep the horizon with binoculars then give attention to their comrades who were coming up from the submarine through the air lock it was while they were eying the sub that doc whipped over the rail flashed to the nearest open hatch and dropped down it no one saw him because there was a commotion aft along the rail the commotion was of monks making the homely chemist still thought doc savage dead he had been benumbed by the fact but now he was shedding the agonizing lethargy monk topped the rail dripping and sputtering he had been forced to swim up from the air lock without benefit of a diving suit and he was mad he lashed out at the first convenient jaw bone crunched under his fist the man who had been hit caved as he went backward some one tried to smash monk over his bulletlike head with a revolver monk grabbed the short arm he almost got it but silver men rushing in clubbed him back he was seized and handcuffed when ham appeared he and monk were led below they did not see hugh mccoy or rapid pace nor had they seen the pair since the misfortune aboard the helldiver i wonder if theyre alive monk growled get below gentlemen suggested cherubfaced uii monk and ham were convoyed below decks by a grim ring of gun snouts they were halted before a metal door monks wrists were decorated with an additional pair of manacles and ham was handcuffed the door was opened and they were shoved inside monk took one look at the two occupants of the rusty steel chamber and let out a loud grunt of relief pat he ejaculated so you are safe after all do you call this safe pat demanded caustically wheres doc patricia savage wrists ornamented with steel linkage was far from being the immaculate personality who headed a successful swanky park avenue beauty establishment she still wore her evening gown but it was grimy and she had torn it off above the ankles for greater freedom of movement lorna zane was with her and she also showed traces of a rough evening and night her brown hair was disheveled her ensemble of gray had lost its effectiveness the gray beret and gray bag being missing and a heel was gone from one gray pump wheres doc pat repeated monk turned around as if to look at ham but actually to hide the expression on his homely features i dunno he mumbled pat voice suddenly shrill demanded monk has something happened to doc ull laughing loudly from the door said i will tell the broadminded world that something happened to him he drowned then we blew his body to little pieces pat became very pale and swiveled so that no one could see her face lorna zane bit her lower lip so furiously that it seemed certain her small white teeth would go through a silver man appeared behind uii and said listen the big boy wants to see you and hes as mad as hell ull scowled his childishly round face suddenly ugly he leveled an arm at the prisoners ill be back he promised and you had better make up your minds to tell whether or not you spilled the dope on us to the police before you started out in that submarine then ull stamped out and made his way up a companionway then along a filthy passage the old boat had once carried passengers and ull turned into what had been the lounge in the center of the lounge stood a large table it was long and wide but it was none too large for the use to which it was being put the table held the proceeds of the silver deathsheads robberies of the night before there were stacks of currency canvas bags of hard money piles of necklaces bracelets and fully a bushel of rings almost a million dollars worth of it if sold at retail by the original owners at the head of the table stood an ominous figure he waved an arm and snarled in a coarse whispering voice i suppose you had this display arranged to impress me the expression on ulls cherubic features showed that he had done just that there is a great deal of money here he muttered the ominous one at the end of the table wore one of the silver cloaks t he whispering tone he used was obviously assumed to disguise his voice you still think that the loot taken last night justifies the turmoil into which the robberies threw the new york police he asked sarcastically they wont catch us said ull ill order the anchor hoisted and we shall cruise out to sea for a few days no one will suspect us the papers of this ship are in order and there is a cargo of innocent wool and hides in the hold by way of proving we are enroute from south america to canada you are avoiding rapped the whispering one avoiding what uii asked with pretended innocence the fact that you ordered those robberies on your own initiative snapped the other you were to loot that first armored truck you were to kill paine l winthrop and that was all except for the work incidental to fighting doc savage ull began we took nearly a million dollars and you endangered a scheme which has netted me a billion within the last year the silver mastermind hissed ulls cleft chin sagged what he choked a how much a billion snarled the man at the head of the table ull seemed dazed i do not understand this do you recall that at various times during the past year i have ordered certain men killed queried the other grimly the killings were well done by yourself and aides i must admit in no case were they traceable to an organized plot ull wet his lips i thought they were just enemies of yours like you said enemies business enemies the other said hoarsely they were men who stood in the way of business mergers which i was engineering it was necessary to get them out of the way but what about the billion uli gulped that was made by recapitalizing the merged companies and selling the stock he was informed the financial details are too complicated to consider here ull eyed the loot on the table and it did not seem to impress him as much as it had earlier was paine l winthrop in the way of one of your mergers he asked no rasped the other winthrop was working with me as you know he built our submarine in his shipyard a few months ago when all of his regular employees were laid off and we used our own men for the construction work i was going to merge his company and give inina a handsome cut of the profits but he got cold feet he had been told the submarine was for a foreign government when he found out its true use his nerve failed i had to put him out of the way to keep him from going to the police oh ull said vaguely the master in silver teetered on his heels he even wore the silver gloves but it was apparent that his hands were shaking slightly with rage the sinister ones anger began to get on ulls nerves as did the mask he was uneasy here be realized was a schemer of much greater magnitude than be had thought you do not have to wear that disguise aboard ull mumbled most of your men do not know me the other whispered hoarsely it is as well that they remain in ignorance but let us not get away from the subject you disobeyed my orders last night that uil told him quietly is not entirely my fault how do you figure that way had i known of this billion business do you think i would have been fool enough to endanger it ull demanded the other seemed to think this over in the future my orders must be followed implicitly he said they will be ull replied earnestly the being in silver waved an arm at the treasureladen table divide this stuff among the men i do not want a share and you will get no share yourself that is by way of punishment for overstepping your authority last night ull looked as if he had been stuck with a pin but said nothing what about the prisoners he asked question them commanded the other then execute them ull departed close the door behind you he was directed and do not disturb me ull closed the door of the treasure table room and walked away after ull had gone the man in silver walked over to the table gazed upon the jewels with an experienced eye and picked out the more valuable he selected packets of bills in less than a minute he had annexed nearly a fourth of the loot the fellow now left the room chuckling harshly the passage into which he went was dark but he strode blithely along it until he suddenly fell on his face he never heard the blow which had struck him for it had been delivered silently with great force nor did he see the giant man of bronze who bent over him and searched him a bulky packet not the loot from the table was fastened inside the silver mans garment doc savage took that then doc removed the silver garment it was very dark in the corridor and doc did not make a light hence it was impossible for him to view the features of his victim the chieftain of the silver deathsheads nor did doc risk striking a match he drew the silver cloak on over his own head found that it was snug but could be worn then searched his victim again and found matches he pocketed the matches back to the treasure room doc walked under a light he opened the packet which had been inside the silver mans garment the package held a large wellmade black theatrical beard doc replaced the set of dark whiskers in his pocket the bronze man left the treasure room stooping bending his knees and hanging his head in order to make himself appear smaller he sighted a guard down the passage and made for the fellow but before he reached the watchman another silver figure appeared and attempted to pass the lookout challenged snarling get that rig off i wanta see your face instead of complying with the command the silver man held up an arm and exposed a wrist watch the guard compared its reading with the expensive timepiece on his own wrist sure he said go ahead doc paused and for a brief moment his fantastic trilling sound was audible but not loud enough to penetrate to the guard doc had just discovered the significance of the expensive wrist watches which all of the gang wore they were used in place of passwords the bronze man still wore the wrist watch which be had taken from the man who had kicked the beggar in new york city the man who had discovered his mistake and later fled only to be shot to death by a policeman its underwater bath had evidently not hurt the watch advancing doc was challenged he showed the watch as the other had done it got him past a few yards beyond the guard he turned and in a voice greatly different from his own a harsh cruel tone asked where are the prisoners being held right ahead of you he was told you cant miss it doc went on he saw the room in which the prisoners were being questioned but instead of pausing went on as if he were uninterested he had seen that monk ham and the two girls were safe for the time being they would be safe until they talked providing they did not hold out until uii was exasperated working deep into the old tramp steamer doc carefully avoided the engine rooms the craft was an oil burner he found the fuel tanks got a cap unscrewed and learned they were almost full he left the cap off scooped up oil in his hands and spilled it along the tanks and down the sides thence to the nearest bulkhead door he carried the trail beyond that for some distance at the end of the oil trail he sank to a knee and felt through the pockets of the silver frock until he found the matches with a quick scrape he struck one then dropped it the bronze man was running furiously when the match hit the fuel oil there was a sizzling the stuff did not burn like gasoline but it flamed nevertheless and the fire ran along until it reached the bulkhead passed through and went on that was all doc saw he was still running he mounted a companionway there was a loud roar and a rush of superheated air as the fuel tank took fire there had been enough gas inside it to explode and split the container chapter destruction ull was yelling threats at monk and ham when the explosion came the cherubfaced man rocked on his feet brought up against a bulkhead and looked very surprised what the he began then a mad shout apprised him of what was wrong fire fire was the yell ull wheeled and plunged out of the steel cell rapping over his shoulder watch these prisoners he disappeared down the passage other men some in silver frocks and some in shirt sleeves followed they streamed past the door but one did not pass he whipped into the cell the guard stared wonderingly at him im taking your place snapped the newcomer give me your gun and go help fight that fire the guard hesitated then passed over his weapon and plunged outside he had little hankering to be left below on sentry duty where he might be trapped if the ship sank the replacement wrenched down his hood doc monk squawked and looked as if he were going to faint doc savage snapped come on weve got to get out of here fast the bronze man replaced his hood concealing his features and waved his gun prominently as he herded monk ham and the two girls down the passage other silver men passing him thought if they took time to think at all that he was merely one of their number moving the prisoners doc stopped one of them where is the other captive he demanded the silver man pointed third door he said doc ran to the designated panel wrenched at the heavy hasp which secured it got it open and rapid pace came stumbling out he lunged fiercely at doc and tried to strike with his fists stop it doc rapped bless me pace gulped i thought you were dead yes sir i thought you were dead doc herded his party on still pretending to be escorting them to another prison cell they came to the room which held the treasure table monk stared at the assembled wealth then made a growling sound and plunged to the left sacks lay there stout rubberized canvas bags in which the loot had no doubt been brought aboard he seized upon some of the bags and with sweeps of his great arms began stuffing the sacks gimme a hand he snapped at ham i dont want to see these guys get away with this stuff ham leaped to aid to expedite matters doc also lent a hand rapid pace dashed forward opened a door yelled over his shoulder im gonna see if the coast is clear then disappeared he had entered the passage in which doc had overpowered the master of the silver deathsheads a moment later were grunts blows painful exclamations pace yelled ouch theres somebody on the floor here say hes tying a handkerchief over his face watch it doc shouted he is the man behind all of this pace shouted ouch again after which there were more blows heels kicked steel plates grunts came from between clenched teeth the thumping and tearing of clothing indicated a terrific fight doc leaped forward and plunged into the passage it was very dark the fight had worked farther down the corridor the master of the silver deathsheads seemed to be in flight with pace close on his heels i licked im pace howled but hes getting away an instant later doc bumped into pace the efficiency expert stood in the brilliant sunlight outside an open hatch near by indicated where the quarry had gone paces face was blank he tried to speak twice before he could manufacture words tthat was the mastermind be stuttered it was doc told him did you see his face i ssure ddid pace gulped and am i ssurprised doc gave rapid pace a shove they headed for the nearest lifeboat the two girls immediately behind monk and ham heavily burdened bringing up the rear the lifeboat was an unusual craft for a tramp steamer of this sort it was more of a fast seagoing launch evidently it was a provision against the necessity of a getaway some time when the submarine was not at hand doc wrenched the tarpaulin off then he and monk threw their weight against the levers which swung the davits out ham heaved sacks of loot into the craft they loaded aboard a silver man in the crows nest yelled and shot at them t he bullet dug splinters out of the boat the second lookout had quitted his post to assist in fighting the fire no doubt doc directed a single shot from his gun at the crows nest the man there screamed and dropped his weapon then tried to get both hands down in the crows nest bucket to squeeze the pain out of the leg which docs bullet had drilled it was one of the few times the bronze man had used a gun but the shot was accurate he might have been practicing with the weapon all of his life they ran the rope through the falls a bit more swiftly than was sane but with alert eyes and husky muscles doc and monk managed to keep the craft level ham had the engine going as they hit the water it was perfect teamwork the shots on deck had spread an alarm men leaped to the rail get down doc rapped the boat sides were thick enough to break the force of a revolver bullet and flattened below the water level it was unlikely that they would be hit at all the boat heaved its nose up dug its stern down in a mass of propellerstirred foam and scudded away from the tramp lead smacked the hall chewed a thwart and clanged off the engine one slug opened a pair of holes in the gas tank and monk crawling back calmly planted a hairy finger over each aperture a few minutes put them out of bullet range smoke was climbing from hatches and portholes of the tramp it was very black oil smoke and it indicated the silver men had not been successful in extinguishing the oil fire that the flames were spreading rapidly was evident when men began diving overside they fought each other to get over the rail trying to get in their sub monk grunted lifting his bead from his job of stoppering the gas tank theyll have a job ham said grimly the sub wont hold a fifth of them some of the silver men undoubtedly reached the submarine perhaps they entered through the air lock but it did them no good the tanker suddenly blew up possibly it was the fuel tanks in later discussion doc tended toward the theory that explosives were stored aboard and these had let loose there was a great geyser of debris smoke and flame the ship came apart in the middle separating the two ends turning half around while men spilled off the decks their bodies hardly distinguishable amid the flying wreckage a boiling inferno of oil poured out of the rent craft and spread flaming on the sea engulfing those men who were in the water burning them to death or forcing them down until their lungs took in water convulsively at that the swimmers were no more unlucky than those in the submarine the blast undoubtedly crushed the submersible so that those within perished doc said slowly it is too bad that they tried to fight the fire so long and then wasted time in seeking to get into the submarine they could have gotten off in the lifeboats we did not take them all ham offered probably afraid they would get picked up in the boats and turned over to the police poor guy monk put in who ham demanded hugh mccoy said monk we did not rescue him thats tough rapid pace had been sitting as if in a stupor now he started and eyed monk its not tough he snapped no sir its not monk scowled listen that aint no way to talk about a dead guy even if you were all the time going to lick him i did lick him pace exclaimed triumphantly i finally did i dont understand how i had it in me when monk grunted when did this happen just before we got off the boat said pace the significance of the words dawned on monk listen he exploded say that again will you hugh mccoy was the brains behind all of this pace said grimly it was him that i fought in the corridor monk swiveled on doc is that right mccoy was the chief of the silver deathsheads doc said slowly that was finally evident when the silver men attacked our submarine when they could have used a depth bomb and destroyed us their chief was aboard they did not want to kill him monk waved hairy arms the gastank leak forgotten but what about gardnerbedford burgess gardner the same person doc said what monk all but choked on the exclamation remember the black beard which gardner wore doc questioned you did not see him but face and myself did and i told you about it sure monk admitted doc produced the packet which he had taken from the unconscious chief of the silver men he tossed it over monk opened it the packet held the black theatrical beard monk slowly put his thumbs back over the holes in the gas tank there was not much more they could do the sea about the spot where the tramp had gone down was a flaming mass of oil in it no creature could live but they cruised as near as possible hoping to pick up any survivors lorna zane gave way and sobbed a little and seemed quite willing for pace the efficiency expert who had improved his nerve so remarkably to comfort her pace was radiant pat looked wan a little exhausted by the whole grisly episode but doc and his party were satisfied that the menace of the silver men was ended and were unconcerned over the future they cruised with the launch until there was no possible chance of survivors being found then they turned toward the jersey coast there was sufficient fuel to make it and the sea was not too rough for the launch in the stern rapid pace had an arm around lorna zanes shoulders you know ive stopped getting scared be told her i cant understand it no sir the end
