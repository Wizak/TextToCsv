 chapter one she dreamed of death the dirty red light from the neon sign pulsed against the grimy window like an angry heart its flash turned the pools of blood glistening on the floor from dark to bright dark to bright slicing the filthy little room into sharp relief then damning it to shadows she huddled in the corner a bony girl with a tangle of brown hair and huge eyes the color of the whiskey he drank when he had the money for it pain and shock had turned those eyes glassy and blind and her skin the waxy gray of corpses she stared hypnotized by the blinking light the way it blipped over the walls over the floor over him him sprawled on the scarred floor swimming in his own blood small feral sounds rumbled in her throat and in her hand the knife was gored to the hilt he was dead she knew he was dead she could smell the ripe hot stink of it pouring out of him to foul the air she was a child only a child but the animal inside her recognized the scent both feared it and rejoiced over it her arm was screaming where hed snapped the bone the place between her legs burned and wept from this last rape not all the blood splattered over her was his but he was dead it was over she was safe then he turned his head slowly like a puppet on a string and pain washed away in terror his eyes fixed on hers as she babbled scrambled back deeper into the corner where shed crawled to escape him and the dead mouth grinned youll never be rid of me little girl im part of you always inside you forever now daddys going to have to punish you again he pushed to his hands and knees blood fell in fat noisy drops from his face from his back slid obscenely from the rips in his arms when he gained his feet and began to shamble through the flow of blood toward her she screamed and screaming woke eve covered her face with her hands held one tight over her mouth to hold back the mindless shrieks that tore at her throat like shards of hot glass her breath heaved so painfully in her chest she winced with every exhale the fear followed her breathed cold down her spine but she beat it back she wasnt a helpless child any longer she was a grown woman a cop who knew how to protect and defend even when the victim was herself she wasnt alone in some horrible little hotel room but in her own house roarkes house roarke and concentrating on him on just his name she began to calm again shed chosen the sleep chair in her home office because he was off planet shed never been able to rest in their bed unless he was with her the dreams came rarely if at all when he slept beside her and all too often chased her in sleep when he didnt she hated that area of weakness of dependence almost as much as shed come to love the man turning in the chair she comforted herself by gathering up the fat gray cat who curled beside her watching her out of narrowed bicolored eyes galahad was accustomed to her nightmares but he didnt care to be wakened by them at four in the morning sorry she muttered as she rubbed her face against his fur its so damn stupid hes dead and hes not coming back the dead dont come back she sighed and stared into the dark i ought to know she lived with death worked with it waded through it day after day night after night in the final weeks of guns were banned and medical science had learned how to prolong life to well beyond the century mark and man had yet to stop killing man it was her job to stand for the dead rather than risk another trip into nightmares she ordered the lights on and climbed out of the chair her legs were steady enough and her pulse had leveled to nearly normal the sick headache that tagged onto the coattails of her nightmares would fade she reminded herself hoping for an early breakfast galahad leaped off behind her then ribboned through her legs as she moved into the kitchen area me first pal she programmed the autochef for coffee then set a bowl of kibble on the floor the cat attacked it as if it were his last meal and left her to brood out the window her view was the long sweep of lawn rather than the street and the sky was empty of traffic she might have been alone in the city privacy and quiet were gifts a man of roarkes wealth could easily buy but she knew beyond the beautiful grounds over the high stone wall life pumped and death followed it greedily that was her world she thought now as she sipped the potent coffee and worked the stiffness of a stillhealing wound out of her shoulder petty murders grand schemes dirty deals and screaming despair she knew more of those than of the colorful swirl of money and power that surrounded her husband at times like this when she was alone when her spirits were low she wondered how they had ever come together the straightarrow cop who believed unwaveringly in the lines of the law and the slick irishman whod tangled with and over those lines all of his life murder had brought them together two lost souls whod taken different escape routes to survive and despite logic and sense had found each other christ i miss him its ridiculous annoyed with herself she turned intending to shower and dress the blinking light on her telelink signaled a muted incoming without a doubt who was transmitting she leaped at it and unblocked the silent code roarkes face popped on screen such a face she thought watching as he lifted one dark eyebrow poetically handsome with black hair falling long and thick to frame it the clever perfectly sculpted mouth the strong bones the shocking intensity of brilliant blue eyes after nearly a year just the sight of that face could send her blood humming darling eve his voice was like cream over strong irish whiskey why arent you sleeping because im awake she knew what hed see as he studied her there was so little she could hide from him hed see the shadows of a bad night hounding her eyes the paleness of her skin uncomfortable she shrugged and pushed a hand through her short disordered hair im going into cop central early ive got paperwork to catch up on he saw more than she realized when he looked at her he saw strength courage pain and a beauty in those sharp bones that full mouth those steady brandycolored eyes she was delightfully oblivious to because he also saw weariness he changed his plans ill be home tonight i thought you needed a couple of more days up there ill be home tonight he repeated and smiled at her i miss you lieutenant yeah however foolish she considered the warm thrill she grinned at him i guess ill have to make some time for you when you get here do that is that why you were calling to let me know youd be back early actually hed intended to leave a message that hed be delayed another day or two and to try to convince her to join him for the weekend on the olympus resort but he only smiled at her just wanted to inform my wife of my travel plans go back to sleep eve yeah maybe but they both knew she wouldnt ill see you tonight uh roarke yes she still had to take a bracing breath before she said it i miss you too she cut the transmission even as he smiled at her steadier she took her coffee with her as she went out to prepare for the day o o she didnt exactly sneak out of the house but she was quiet about it maybe it was barely five in the morning but she didnt doubt summerset was around somewhere she preferred whenever possible to avoid roarkes sergeantmajor or whatever term youd use for a man who knew everything did everything and poked his bony nose into what eve considered her private business entirely too often since her last case had shoved the two of them closer together than either was comfortable with she suspected hed been avoiding her as carefully as she had him for the past couple of weeks reminded of it she rubbed a hand absently just under her shoulder it still troubled her a bit in the morning or after a long day taking a full blast from her own weapon was an experience she didnt want to repeat in this or any other lifetime somehow worse was the way summerset had poured meds down her throat afterward when shed been too weak to knock him on his ass she closed the door behind her took one deep breath of the frigid december air then cursed viciously shed left her vehicle at the base of the steps mostly because it drove summerset crazy and hed moved it because it pissed her off grumbling because she hadnt bothered to bring along the remote for the garage door or her vehicle she trooped around the house boots crunching on frosted grass the tips of her ears began to sting with cold her nose to run with it she bared her teeth and punched in the code with gloveless fingers then stepped into the pristine and blissfully warm garage there were two gleaming levels of cars bikes skyscooters even a twopassenger minicopter her cityissue vehicle in peagreen looked like a mutt among sleek glossy hounds but it was new she reminded herself as she slid behind the wheel and everything worked it started like a dream the engine purred at her command the heat began to whir softly through the vents the cockpit glowed with lights indicating the initial check run then the bland voice of the recording assured her all systems were in operational order shed have suffered the tortures of the damned before she would admit she missed the capriciousness and outright crankiness of her old unit at a smooth pace she glided out of the garage and down the curved drive toward the iron gates they parted smoothly soundlessly for her the streets in this exclusive neighborhood were quiet clean trees on the verge of the great park were coated in a thin sheen of glittery frost like a skinsuit of diamond dust deep inside its shadows chemiheads and spine crackers might be finishing up the nights work but here there were only polished stone buildings wide avenues and the quiet dark before dawn she was blocks away before the first billboard loomed up spitting garish light and motion into the night santa redcheeked and with a manic grin that made her think of an oversized elf on zeus rode through the sky behind his fleet of reindeer and blasted out ho ho hos while warning the populace of just how many shopping days they had left before christmas yeah yeah i hear you you fat son of a bitch she scowled over as she braked for a light shed never had to worry about the holiday before it had just been a matter of finding something ridiculous for mavis maybe something edible for feeney thered been no one else in her life to wrap gifts for and what the hell did she buy for a man who not only had everything but owned most of the plants and factories that made it for a woman whod prefer a blow with a blunt instrument to shopping for an afternoon it was a serious dilemma christmas she decided as santa began to tout the variety of stores and selections in the big apple sky mall was a pain in the ass still her mood lifted as she hit the predictably snared traffic on broadway twentyfour hours a day seven days a week there was a party going on the people glides were jammed with pedestrians most of whom were drunk stoned or both glidecart operators shivered in the cold while their grills smoked if a vender had a spot on this street he held it in a tight ready fist she cracked her window a sliver caught the scent of roasting chestnuts soy dogs smoke and humanity someone was singing out in a strident monotone about the end of the world a cabbie blasted his horn well over noise pollution laws as pedestrians flowed into the street on his light overhead the early airbuses farted cheerfully and the first advertising blimps began to hawk the citys wares she watched a fistfight break out between two women street lcs eve mused licensed companions had to guard their turf here as fiercely as the vendors of food and drink she considered getting out and breaking it up but the little blonde decked the big redhead then darted off into the crowd like a rabbit good thinking eve thought approvingly as the redhead was already on her feet shaking her head clear and shouting inventive obscenities this eve thought with affection was her new york with some regret she bumped over to the relative quiet of seventh then headed downtown she needed to get back into action she thought the weeks of disability had made her feel edgy and useless weak shed ditched the recommended last week off had insisted on taking the required physical and she knew had passed it by the skin of her teeth but shed passed and was back on the job now if she could just convince her commander to get her off desk duty shed be a happy woman when her radio sounded she tuned in with half an ear she wasnt even on call for another three hours any units in the vicinity a reported at seventh avenue apartment b no confirmation available see the man in apartment a any units in the vicinity eve clicked on before dispatch could repeat the signal dispatch this is dallas lieutenant eve im two minutes from the seventh avenue location am responding received dallas lieutenant eve please report status upon arrival affirmative dallas out she glided to the curb flicked a glance up at the steelgray building a few lights glimmered through windows but she saw only darkness on the eighteenth floor a meant thered been an anonymous call reporting a domestic dispute eve stepped out of her vehicle and slid an absent hand over her side where her weapon sat snug she didnt mind starting out the day with trouble but there wasnt a cop alive or dead who didnt dread a domestic there seemed to be nothing a husband wife or same sex spouse enjoyed more than turning on the poor bastard who tried to keep them from killing each other over the rent money the fact that shed volunteered to take it was a reflection of her dissatisfaction with her current assignments eve jogged up the short flight of stairs and looked up the man in a she flashed her badge when he spoke through the security peep shoved it into his beady little eyes when he opened the door a stingy crack you got trouble here i dunno cops called me im the manager i dont know anything i can see that he smelled of stale sheets and inexplicably of cheese you want to let me into b you got a master dont you yeah fine she sized him up quickly short skinny smelly and scared how about filling me in on the occupants before i go in only one woman single woman divorced or something keeps to herself dont they all eve muttered you got a name on her hawley marianna about thirty thirtyfive nice looker been here about six years no trouble look i didnt hear anything i didnt see anything i dont know anything its fivefuckingthirty in the morning shes done any damage to the unit i want to know about it otherwise its none of my nevermind fine eve said as the door clicked shut in her face go back to your hole you little weasel she rolled her shoulders once then walked across the corridor to the elevator as she stepped inside she pulled out her communicator dallas lieutenant eve im at the seventh avenue location building manager is a wash ill report back after interviewing hawley marianna resident of b do you require backup not at this time dallas out she slipped the communicator back into her pocket as she stepped out into the hallway on eighteen a quick glimpse up showed her security cameras in place the hall was church quiet from the buildings location and style she pegged most of the residents as white collar middle income most wouldnt stir from their beds until after seven theyd grab their morning coffee dash out to the airbus or subway stop more fortunate ones would just plug into the office from their home station some would have children to see off to school others would kiss their spouses goodbye and wait for their lovers ordinary lives in an ordinary place it flipped through her mind to wonder if roarke owned the damn building but she pushed the idea aside and stepped up to b the security light was blinking green deactivated instinctively she stepped to the side of the door as she pushed the buzzer she couldnt hear its muffled echo and decided the unit was soundproofed whatever went on inside stayed inside vaguely annoyed she took out her master code and bypassed the locks before entering she called out nothing worse she mused than scaring some sleeping civilian into coming at you with a homemade stunner or a kitchen knife ms hawley police we have a report of trouble in your unit lights she ordered and the overheads in the living area flashed on it was pretty enough in a quiet way soft colors simple lines the view screen was programmed to an old video two impossibly attractive people were rolling around naked on a bed scattered with rose petals they moaned theatrically there was a candy dish on the table in front of the long mistygreen sofa it was filled to brimming with sugardashed gumdrops silver and red candle pillars were grouped beside it burned artistically down to varying heights the entire room smelled of cranberry and pine she saw where the pine scent originated a small perfectly formed tree lay on its side in front of a window its festive lights and sweetfaced angel ornaments were smashed its boughs snapped at least a dozen festively wrapped boxes were crushed under it she reached for her weapon drew it and circled the room there was no other obvious sign of violence not there the couple on the view screen reached simultaneous climax with throaty animal moans eve sidestepped past it listened listened heard music quiet cheerful monotonous she didnt know the tune but recognized it as one of the insidious christmas ditties that played everywhere for weeks during the season she swept her weapon over a short corridor two doors both open in one she could see a sink a toilet the edge of a tub all in gleaming white keeping her back to the wall she slid toward the second door where the music played on and on she smelled it fresh death both metallic and fruity easing the door all the way open she found it she moved into the room swinging right then left eyes sharp ears alert but she knew she was alone with what had been marianna hawley still she checked the closet behind the drapes then left the room to search the rest of the apartment before she relaxed her guard only then did she approach the bed a had been right she thought the woman had been a looker not stunning not an eyepopper but a pretty woman with soft brown hair and deep green eyes death hadnt robbed her of that not yet her eyes were wide and startled as the deads often were against the dull pallor of her cheeks careful and subtle color had been applied her lashes were darkened her lips painted a festive cherry red an ornament had been pinned to her hair just above the right ear a small glittery tree with a plump gilded bird on one of its silver branches she was naked but for that and the sparkling silver garland that had been artistically wrapped around her body eve wondered as she studied the raw bruising around the neck if that was what had been used to strangle her there was more bruising on the wrists on the ankles indicating the victim had been bound and had likely had time to struggle on the entertainment unit beside the bed the singer suggested she have herself a merry little christmas sighing eve pulled out her communicator dispatch this is dallas lieutenant eve i have a homicide o o heck of a way to start the day officer peabody stifled a yawn and studied the victim with dark cops eyes despite the atrociously early hour peabodys uniform was crisp and pressed her dark brown bowlcut hair ruthlessly tamed the only thing that indicated shed been rudely roused out of bed was the sleep crease lining her left cheek heck of a way to end one eve muttered prelim on scene indicates death occurred at twentyfour hundred hours almost to the minute she shifted aside to let the team from the medical examiners office verify her findings indications are cause of death was strangulation the lack of defensive wounds further indicate the victim didnt struggle until after she was bound gently eve lifted the dead womans left ankle and examined the raw skin vaginal and anal bruising indicate she was sexually molested before she was killed the units soundproofed she could have screamed her lungs out i didnt see any signs of forced entry no signs of struggle in the living area except for the christmas tree that looked deliberate to me eve nodded slanted peabody a look good eye see the man in a peabody and get the security discs for this floor lets see who came calling right away set a couple of uniforms on the doortodoor eve added as she walked over to the telelink by the side of the bed somebody turn that damn music off you dont sound like youre in the holiday spirit peabody hit the off button on the sound system with a clear sealed finger sir christmas is a pain in the ass you finished here she demanded of the mes team lets turn her over before shes bagged the blood had found its lowest level settling in the buttocks and turning them a sickly red bowel and bladder had emptied the waste of death through the seal coat on her hands eve felt the waxydoll texture of the skin this looks fresh she murmured peabody get this on video before you go down eve studied the bright tattoo on the right shoulder blade as peabody moved in to document it my true love peabody pursed her lips over the bright red letters that flowed in oldfashioned script over the white flesh looks like a temporary to me eve bent lower until her nose all but brushed the curve of shoulder sniffed recently applied well check where she gets body work done partridge in a pear tree eve straightened lifted a brow at her aide what in her hair the pin in her hair on the first day of christmas because eve continued to look blank peabody shook her head its an old christmas song lieutenant the twelve days of christmas the guy gives his true love something on every day starting with a partridge in a pear tree on the first day what the hell is anybody supposed to do with a bird in a tree stupid gift but a sick suspicion churned in her gut lets hope this was his only true love get me those tapes bag her she ordered then turned once more to the bedside link while the body was being removed she ordered all incoming and outgoing transmissions for the previous twentyfour hours the first came in at just past eighteen hundred hours a cheerful conversation between the victim and her mother as eve listened studied the mothers laughing face she thought of how that same face would look when she called and told the woman her daughter was dead the only other transmission was an outgoing goodlooking guy eve mused as she studied the image on screen midthirties quick smile soulful brown eyes jerry the victim called him or jer lots of sexual byplay teasing a lover then maybe her true love eve removed the disc sealed it and slipped it into her bag she located mariannas daybook portalink and address book in the desk under the window a quick scroll through the entries netted her one jeremy vandoren alone now eve turned back to the bed stained sheets were tangled at the foot the clothes that had been carefully cut off the victim and tossed to the floor were bagged for evidence the apartment was silent she let him in eve mused opened the door to him did she come in here with him voluntarily or did he subdue her first the tox report would tell her if there were any illegals in the bloodstream once he had her in the bedroom he tied her hands and feet likely hooking the restraints around the short stump of post at each of the four corners spreading her out like a banquet then hed cut off her clothes carefully no hurry it hadnt been rage or fury or even a desperate kind of need calculated planned ordered then hed raped her sodomized her because he could he had the power shed struggled cried out probably begged hed enjoyed that fed on that rapists did she thought and took several deep steadying breaths because her mind wanted to veer toward her father when he was done hed strangled her watching watching while her eyes bulged then hed brushed her hair painted her face draped her in festive silver garland had he brought the hairpin with him or had it belonged to her had she amused herself with the tattoo or had he decorated her body himself she moved into the neighboring bathroom white tile sparkled like ice and there was a faint underscent of disinfectant he cleaned up here when he was finished eve decided washing himself even grooming then wiping down and spraying the room to remove any evidence well shed put the sweepers on it in any case one lousy pubic hair could hang him shed had a mother who loved her eve thought one whod laughed with her making holiday plans talking about sugar cookies sir lieutenant eve glanced over her shoulder saw peabody in the center of the hallway what i have the security discs two uniforms are initiating doortodoors okay eve rubbed her hands over her face lets seal the place up take everything to central i have to inform the next of kin she shouldered her bag picked up her field kit youre right peabody its a heck of a way to start the day chapter two did you run the link number on the boyfriend yes sir jeremy vandoren lives on second avenue hes an account exec for foster bride and rumsey on wall street peabody glanced at her notebook as she relayed the rest divorced currently single thirtysix and a very attractive specimen of the male species sir hmm eve slipped the security disc into her desk unit lets see if the very attractive specimen paid a call on his girlfriend last night can i get you some coffee lieutenant what can i get you some coffee eves eyes narrowed as she scanned the video if you want coffee peabody just say so behind eves back peabody rolled her eyes i want coffee then get some and get some for me while youre at it victim arriving home at sixteen fortyfive pause disc eve ordered and took a good look at marianna hawley trim pretty young her shining brown hair covered with a bright red beret that matched the long swirl of her coat and the slick shine of her boots shed been shopping peabody commented as she set the mug of coffee at eves elbow yeah bloomingdales continue scan eve said and watched as marianna shifted her bags dug out her key card her mouth was moving eve noted talking to herself no she realized marianna was singing then the woman shook back her hair shifted her bags once again stepped inside the apartment and shut the door the red lock light blinked on as the disc continued eve saw other tenants coming and going alone in couples ordinary lives moving forward she stayed in for dinner eve stated looking now with her minds eye through the door inside the apartment she could see marianna moving around the rooms wearing the simple navy slacks and white sweater that would later be cut from her body turn the viewing screen on for company hang up the bright red coat in the front closet put the hat on the shelf the boots on the floor tuck away the shopping bags she was a tidy woman who liked pretty things preparing for a quiet evening at home fixed herself some soup at about seven according to her autochef eve drummed short unpainted nails on the desk as she continued the scan her mother called then she called the boyfriend while she clicked off the time frame in her mind she saw the elevator doors open her brows winged up disappearing under the fringe of bangs on her forehead well ho ho ho what have we here santa claus grinning peabody leaned over eves shoulder bearing gifts the man in the red suit and snowy white beard carried a large box wrapped in silver paper and trimmed with an elaborate bow of gold and green hold it pause enlarge sector ten through fifty thirty percent the screen shifted the section eve designated separating then popping out nestled in the center of the fancy bow was a silver tree with a plump gilded bird son of a bitch son of a bitch thats the thing that was in her hair but thats santa claus get a grip on yourself peabody continue scan hes going to her door eve muttered watching as the cheerful figure carried his glossy burden to mariannas apartment he pressed her buzzer with a gloved finger waited a beat then threw back his head and laughed almost instantly marianna opened the door her face glowing her eyes sparkling with delight she scooped back her hair with one hand then opened the door wider in invitation santa tossed one quick glance over his shoulder looked directly at the camera smiled winked freeze video the bastard cocky bastard print hard copy of image on screen she ordered while studying the round ruddycheeked face and sparkling blue eyes he knew wed view the discs see him hes enjoying it he dressed up as santa peabody continued to gape at the screen thats disgusting thats just wrong what if hed dressed up as satan it would have been more appropriate yes no peabody moved her shoulders shuffled her feet its just well its really sick its also really smart eyes flat eve waited while the image printed out whos going to shut the door in santas face continue scan the door closed behind them and the hallway remained empty the timer running along the bottom of the screen marked at twentyone thirtythree so he took his time eve mused nearly two and a half hours the rope hed used to tie her and anything else he might have needed would have been in that big shiny box at eleven a couple got off the elevator laughing a little drunk arm in arm as they passed mariannas door oblivious to what was going on inside fear and pain murder the door opened at half past midnight the man in the red suit stepped out still carrying his silver box a smile wide almost fierce on his redcheeked face once more he looked directly at the camera and now there was madness glowing in his eyes he was dancing as he got on the elevator copy disc to file hawley case number h how many days of christmas did you say there were peabody in the song twelve peabody soothed her dry throat with coffee twelve days wed better find out if hawley was his true love or if he has eleven more she rose lets talk to the boyfriend o o jeremy vandoren worked inside a small box in a hive of small boxes his stingy cubicle held a workstation just big enough to accommodate his computer and phone system and a threewheeled chair pinned to the flimsy walls were printouts of stock reports a theater schedule a christmas card showcasing a wellendowed woman wearing strategically placed snowflakes and a photo of marianna hawley he barely glanced up when eve stepped inside he held up a hand to hold her off and continued to work the keyboard of his computer manually while talking rapidly into a headset comstats at five and an eighth kenmarts down three and threequarters no roarke industries just took a leap up six points our analysts look for it to go up another two by end of day eve raised a brow and tucked her hands in the pockets of her trousers she was standing here waiting to talk murder and roarke was making millions it was just weird done vandoren hit another key and had a tangle of mysterious figures and symbols swimming onto the screen she let him fiddle another thirty seconds then pulled her badge out of her pocket and held it in front of his face he blinked twice then turned and focused on her ive got that youre set absolutely thanks with a puzzled smile slightly nervous around the edges vandoren swiveled the mike of his headset to the side um lieutenant what can i do for you jeremy vandoren yeah his deep brown eyes slid past her brushed over peabody then slid back am i in trouble have you done something illegal mr vandoren not that i can remember he tried a smile again bringing a small dimple to life at the corner of his mouth not unless that candy bar i stole when i was eights come back to haunt me do you know marianna hawley marianna sure dont tell me maris nicked a candy bar then abruptly like a light winking off the smile disappeared what is it has something happened is she all right he was out of his chair his eyes scanning over the top of the cubicle as if he expected to see her mr vandoren im sorry eve had never found a good way to relay the news so she settled on relaying it quickly ms hawley is dead no shes not no he said again turning those dark eyes back to eve shes not thats ridiculous i just talked to her last night were meeting for dinner at seven shes fine youve made a mistake theres no mistake im sorry she repeated as he only continued to stare at her marianna hawley was murdered last night in her apartment marianna murdered he continued to shake his head slowly as if the two words were foreign thats definitely wrong thats just wrong he whirled around fumbled to his desk link ill call her right now shes at work mr vandoren eve put a firm hand on his shoulder and nudged him into his chair there was no place for her to sit so she eased a hip on the desk so their faces could be more on level shes been identified through fingerprints and dna if you can manage it id like you to come with me and do a visual confirmation a visual he sprang up again his elbow rapping eves shoulder and causing the still healing wound to sing yeah ill come with you damn right i will because its not her its not marianna o o the morgue was never a cheerful place the fact that someone in either an optimistic or macabre frame of mind had hung red and green balls from the ceiling and draped ugly gold tinsel around the doorways only succeeded in added a kind of smirking grin over death eve stood at the viewing window as she had stood too many times before and she felt as she had felt too many times before the hard jerk of shock punch through the man beside her as he saw marianna hawley lying on the other side of the glass the sheet that covered her to the chin would have been hastily draped to hide from friends family and loved ones the pitiful nakedness of the dead the slices in the flesh left by the y incision the temporary stamp on the instep that gave that body a name and number no in a helpless gesture vandoren pressed both hands to the barrier no no no this cant be right marianna gently now eve laid a hand on his arm he was shaking badly and the hands on the glass had balled into fists and were pounding in short light beats just nod if you can identify her as marianna hawley he nodded then he began to weep peabody find us an empty office get him some water even as eve spoke she found herself engulfed by him his arms coming around her his face pressed into her shoulder his body bowed down to her by the weight of his grief she let him hang on signaling the tech behind the glass to raise the privacy shield come on jerry come with me now she kept a supporting arm around him thinking shed rather face a stunner on full than a grieving survivor there was no help for those left behind no magic no cure but she murmured to him as she led him down the tiled hall to the doorway where peabody stood we can use this one peabody said quietly ill get the water lets sit down after helping him to a chair eve pulled the handkerchief out of the pocket of his suit coat and pressed it into his hand im sorry for your loss she said as she always did and felt the inadequacy of it as she always did marianna who would hurt marianna why its my job to find out i will find out something in the way she said it had him looking over at her his eyes were red and desolate with an obvious effort he drew in a deep breath i she was so special he groped in his pocket and pulled out a small velvet box i was going to give this to her tonight id planned to wait until christmas eve marianna loved christmas but i couldnt i just couldnt wait his hands trembled as he opened the box to show eve the bright flash of diamond on the engagement ring i was going to ask her to marry me tonight she would have said yes we loved each other was it carefully he closed the box again slipped it back in his pocket was it a robbery we dont think so how long have you known her six months almost seven he stared at peabody as she came in and held out a cup of water thank you he took it but didnt drink the happiest six months of my life how did you meet through personally yours its a dating service you use a dating service this from peabody with more than a little surprise he hunched his shoulders sighed it was an impulse i spend most of my time on work and wasnt getting out much i was divorced a couple years ago and i guess it made me nervous with women anyway none of the women i met nothing clicked i saw an ad on screen one night and i thought what the hell couldnt hurt he did drink now one small sip that had his throat working visibly as he swallowed marianna was the third of the first five matches i went out with the first two drinks just drinks there was nothing there but when i met marianna everything was there he closed his eyes struggled for composure shes so wonderful so much energy enthusiasm she loved her job her apartment she got a kick out of her theater group she does community theater sometimes eve noted the way he switched back and forth past and present tense his mind was trying to accustom itself to what was but it wasnt quite ready yet you started dating she prompted yes wed agreed to meet for drinks just drinks to scope each other out we ended up going to dinner then going for coffee talking for hours neither one of us saw anyone else after that night it was just it for both of us she felt the same way yeah we took it slow a few dinners the theater we both love the theater we started spending saturday afternoons together a matinee a museum or just a walk we went back to her hometown so i could meet her family the fourth of july i took her to meet mine my mother made dinner his eyes unfocused as he stared at something only he could see she wasnt seeing anyone else during this period no wed made a commitment do you know if anyone was bothering her an old boyfriend a former lover her exhusband no im sure she would have told me we talked all the time we told each other everything his eyes cleared the brown hardening like crystal why do you ask that was she marianna did he oh god on his knee his hand balled into a fist he raped her first didnt he the fucking bastard raped her i should have been with her he heaved the cup across the room sending water splashing as he lurched to his feet i should have been with her it would never have happened if id been with her where were you jerry what where were you last night between ninethirty and midnight you think i he stopped himself holding up a hand closing his eyes three times he inhaled exhaled then he opened his eyes again and they remained clear its all right you need to make sure it wasnt me so you can find him its all right its for her thats right and studying him eve felt a new well of pity its for her i was home my apartment i did some work made some calls did a little christmas shopping via computer i reconfirmed the dinner reservations for tonight because i was nervous i wanted he cleared his throat i wanted it to be perfect then i called my mother he lifted his hands rubbed them hard over his face i had to tell somebody she was thrilled excited she was crazy about marianna i think that was about tenthirty you can check my link records my computer anything you need to do okay jerry have you her family do they know yes i spoke with her parents i need to call them theyll want her to come home his eyes filled again and he continued to look at eve as tears streamed down his cheeks ill take her back home ill see that shes released as soon as possible is there someone we can call for you no i need to go tell my parents i need to go he turned toward the door and spoke without looking back you find who did this you find who hurt her i will jerry one last thing he rubbed his face dry and turned back what is it did marianna have a tattoo he laughed a short harsh sound that seemed to scrape out of his throat marianna no she was oldfashioned wouldnt even go for temporaries youre sure of that we were lovers lieutenant we were in love i knew her body i knew her mind and her heart okay thank you she waited until hed gone out until the door clicked quietly closed behind him impressions peabody guys hearts ripped right out of his chest agreed but people often kill the ones they love even with link records his alibis going to be shaky he doesnt look a thing like santa claus eve smiled a little i guarantee the person who killed her wont either otherwise he wouldnt have been so happy to pose for the camera padding change the eye color makeup beard and wig any damn body can look like santa but for now she had to go with the gut its not him lets check out where she worked find her friends and enemies o o friends eve thought later marianna appeared to have in volume enemies she seemed to have none the picture that was being painted was one of a happy outgoing woman who liked her work was close to her family but enjoyed the pace and excitement of the city she had a tightly knit group of female friends a weakness for shopping a deep love of theater and according to all sources had been in an exclusive and happy relationship with jeremy vandoren she was dancing on air everyone who knew her loved her she had an open trusting heart as she drove home eve let the statements made by friends and associates play back in her mind no one found fault with marianna not once had she heard one of those sly often selfcongratulatory remarks the living made of the dead but there was someone who thought differently someone who had killed her with calculation with care and if the look in those eyes was any indication with a kind of glee my true love yes someone had loved her enough to kill her eve knew that kind of love existed bred festered shed been the recipient of that hot and twisted emotion and survived it she reminded herself and engaged her link got the tox report on hawley yet dickie the longsuffering and homely face of the chief lab tech filled the screen you know how things get clogged up here during the holidays people whacking people right and left technicians putzing around with christmas and hanukkah shit instead of doing their jobs yeah my hearts bleeding for you i want the tox report i want a vacation but muttering he shifted and began to call something up on his computer she was tranqd overthecounter stuff pretty mild given her weight the dosage wouldnt have done much more than make her stupid for ten fifteen minutes long enough eve murmured indications are a pressure injection upper right arm likely felt like shed just downed a half dozen zombies results dizziness disorientation possibly temporary loss of consciousness and muscular weakness okay any semen nope not one little soldier he condomized or her bc killed them we still need to check on that body was sprayed with disinfectant traces of it in her vagina too which would have killed off some of the warriors we got nothing off her oh one more the cosmetics used on her dont match what she had in her place were not finished with them yet but prelim indicates theyre all natural ingredients meaning high dollar odds are he brought them with him get me brand names as soon as you can its a good lead nice job dickie yeah yeah happy fucking holidays same to you dickhead she muttered after she logged off and rolling some of the tension out of her shoulders she headed through the iron gates toward home she could see the lights in the windows beaming through the winter dark tall windows arched windows in towers and turrets and the long sweep of the main floor home she thought it had become hers because of the man who owned it the man who loved her the man whod put his ring on her finger as jeremy had wanted to do with marianna she turned her wedding band with her thumb as she parked her car in front of the main entrance shed been everything jerry had said even a year before she wouldnt have understood that now she did she sat where she was a moment dragged both hands through her already disordered cap of hair the mans grief had wormed its way into her that was a mistake it wouldnt help and could possibly hinder the investigation she needed to put it aside to block out of her mind the devastation of emotion shed felt from him when hed all but collapsed in her arms love didnt always win she reminded herself but justice could if she was good enough she got out of her car left it where it was and started up the steps to the front door the minute she was inside she peeled out of her leather jacket and dropped it carelessly over the elegant newel post banking the curve of stairs summerset slipped out of the shadows and stood tall bony eyes dark and disapproving in a pale face lieutenant leave my vehicle exactly where it is she told him and swung toward the stairs he sniffed an audible sucking of air through his nose you have several messages they can wait she kept climbing and began to fantasize about a hot shower a glass of wine and a tenminute nap he called after her but shed already stopped listening bite me she said absently then opened the door to the bedroom everything inside her that had wilted bloomed roarke stood in front of the closet stripped to the waist his beautiful back muscles rippling subtly as he reached in for a fresh shirt he turned his head and the full power of that face struck her the poets mouth curved the rich blue eyes smiled as he shook back his glorious mane of thick black hair hello lieutenant i didnt think youd be back for a couple of hours anyway he laid the shirt aside she hadnt been sleeping well he thought he could see the fatigue the shadows i made good time yeah you did then she was going to him moving fast almost too fast to see the quick light of surprise the deepening of pleasure in his eyes his arms were open for her when she got there she drew in his scent deeply ran her hands up his back firmly then turned her face into his hair and sighed once you did miss me he murmured just hold on for a minute okay as long as you like her body fit with his somehow it simply fit like one piece of a puzzle interlinking with another she thought of the way jeremy vandoren had showed her the ring the glinting promise of it i love you it was a shock to feel the raw tears in her throat an effort to swallow them back im sorry i dont tell you often enough hed heard the tears his hand slid up to cradle the back of her neck to rub gently at the tension he felt knotted there what is it eve not now steadier she drew back framed his face with her hands im so glad youre here im so glad youre home her lips curved as she leaned in and slanted them over his warmth welcome and the underlying shimmer of passion that never seemed fully sated and with it sheltered in it she could for a little while push everything outside but this were you changing clothes she asked against his mouth i was ummm a little more of that he murmured and nipped at her bottom lip until she shivered well i think its a waste of time to prove it she slipped her hands between their bodies and unbuttoned his trousers youre absolutely right he pressed the release on her shoulder holster and shoved it aside i love disarming you lieutenant in a quick move that had his brow arching she twisted and had him pressed against the closet door i dont need a weapon to take you pal prove it he was already hard when her hand curled around him the blue of his eyes deepened with dark dangerous lights flickering in them you havent been wearing your gloves again she smiled sliding her chilly fingers up and down the length of him is that a complaint no indeed his breath was clogging of all the women hed known she was the only one who could leave him breathless with so little effort he skimmed his hands up to cup her breasts rubbed his thumbs gently over the nipples before unfastening the buttons of her shirt he wanted her under him come to bed whats wrong with here she lowered her head bit his shoulder whats wrong with now not a thing this time he moved fast hooking a foot behind hers to throw her off balance then tumbling with her to the floor but ive a mind to take you instead of the other way around his mouth clamped on her breast sucking hard words strangled in her throat images exploded in her brain and her hips arched to him he knew her better he often thought than she knew herself she needed heat the potent flood of it to drown out whatever was troubling her mind heat he could give her and he would pleasure them both with wave after wave she was thin the weight shed lost during her recovery couldnt be spared on her slim frame and had yet to be put back in place but he knew she didnt want gentle strokes now so he drove her ruthlessly relentlessly until her breath was ragged and her heart slammed against his seeking mouth and hands she writhed under him her hands in his hair fisted tight her breasts bared for him with the long tearshaped diamond hed once given her resting in the shallow valley between he licked his way down her torso over ribs along the firm flat belly scraping teeth against the narrow line of hip as she began to buck he tugged her trousers lower exposing the soft curls between her thighs when he swept his tongue over her into her the orgasm struck like a lightning bolt blood pumped under her skin brought a dew of sweat to the surface she was half in half out of the closet surrounded by the scent of him trapped in it and glorying she felt his fingers dig into her hips lifting her spreading her taking her her own helpless moan echoed as he urged her up again and flying there was nothing left inside her but the driving need to mate she reached for him panting his name as her hands slid off his shoulders around his back as her legs lifted to hook around his waist he glided into her one smooth stroke of homecoming his body shuddered once as she tightened around him trapped him as she was trapped his mouth crushed down on hers feeding there as her hips began to pump fast and hard with their eyes on each other now thrust retreat and thrust breathing each others air closer still closer with the good solid slap of flesh against flesh she watched his eyes go opaque an instant before he rammed himself home her body erupted shattered beneath his when he lowered his head pressed his face to her throat she once more turned hers into his hair once more breathed in his scent its good to be home he murmured o o she had her shower her glass of wine then what she considered the ultimate in decadence dinner in bed with her husband tell me about it he waited until shed relaxed until shed eaten now he poured her another glass of wine and watched the shadows come back into her eyes i dont want to bring my work home why not he smiled refilled his own glass i do its different eve he skimmed a finger over the slight dent in her chin we are both of us very much defined by what we do for a living you dont you cant leave your work outside the door any more than i can its inside you she leaned back against the pillows looked up through the sky window at the dark winter sky and told him it was cruel she said at length but thats not it really ive seen things that were more cruel she was innocent there was something about her space her walk about her face i dont know but she had an innocence i know thats not really it either innocence is often destroyed i know what its like not to be innocent i dont remember being innocent but i know what its like to be destroyed she cursed under her breath and set the wine aside eve he took her hand waiting until she turned her gaze to his a rapemurder might not be the best way for you to get back into active duty i might have passed on it it shamed her to admit it enough that she looked away again if id known im not sure i would have taken the call you can still pass it to someone else in your division no one would blame you for it id blame me ive seen her now i know her now eve closed her eyes but only for a moment shes mine now i cant turn my back on that eve pushed at her hair ordered herself to focus she looked so surprised and happy when she opened the door like a kid might oh boy a present you know yes the way the bastard looked at the camera before he went in the big smile the cagey little wink and after doing his victory dance into the elevator her eyes fired up as she spoke of it as she shoved herself straighter in the bed not just cops eyes now roarke thought but the avenging angel there was no passion just sheer delight she closed her eyes again bringing that image back clearly and when she opened them again the fire was banked smoldering deep it made me sick annoyed with herself she picked up the wine again sipped once i had to tell the parents i had to watch their faces when i did and vandoren watching him go to pieces seeing him try to understand that his world had just fallen apart she was a nice woman a nice simple woman who was happy in her life about to get engaged and she opens the door to someone whos symbolically a figure of innocence now shes dead because he knew her he took her hand unballing the fist shed made it doesnt make you less of a cop because it touches you too many of them touch you and the edges get blurred you get closer to the limit to the time you know youre not going to be able to face another of the dead did it ever occur to you to take a break when her brows drew together he only smiled no of course not youll face the next eve because thats what you do thats who you are i might be facing one sooner than id like she linked fingers with the hand that held hers was she the one roarke his true love or are there eleven more chapter three eve circled the parking deck at the sky mall a second time and ground her teeth why arent these people at work why dont they have lives for some peabody said solemnly shopping is life yeah yeah eve passed a section where cars were stacked like poker chips six high in their slots screw this she whipped the wheel threaded through the stacks skinning by bumpers close enough to have peabody closing one eye you know you can buy anything you want right on screen in the privacy of your own home i dont get this screen shopping doesnt give you the same buzz peabody braced a hand on the dash as eve jerked to a stop in the fire lane right outside of bloomingdales you cant use the senses or your elbows to jab people out of the way theres no sport in screen shopping with a snort eve engaged her on duty sign and stepped out of the car immediately her ears were assaulted with a blast of music christmas carols pumped full blast into the air she decided that people ran inside ready to buy anything just to escape the noise though the temperature in the computercontrolled environment hovered at a pleasant seventytwo a light synthetic snow swirled in the enormous dome the windows of the department store were filled with costumed droids santas and elves labored away in a workshop reindeer flew or danced on rooftops young goldenhaired children with angelic faces unwrapped bright packages behind another window a teenage boy decked out in the latest fashion trend of black unisuit and neon checked overshirt did circles and flips on his new flyer airskate this years hotticket item a push of the button beside the glass would engage the recording of his excited voice hawking the skates options and virtues as well as its price and location in the store id like to try one of those suckers peabody said under her breath as she followed eve to the door arent you a little old for toys its not a toy its an adventure peabody said reciting the tag line for the airskate lets get this over with i hate these places the doors slid smoothly open and greeted them with a soothing promise welcome to bloomingdales youre our most important customer inside the music continued to play but at a lower volume but the voice level rose dozens of people speaking at once making a cacophony of sound that rose up and up to echo off the ceiling where angels soared in graceful circles it was a palace of consumption with merchandise displayed temptingly on twelve glossy floors droids and staff swept through the crowds modeling fashions accessories the hair and bodystyles that could be purchased in the salons the electronic map just inside the door stood ready to guide customers to their hearts desire licensed child pet and elderly care facilities were located handily on the main level for those who didnt care to shop with junior fido or grandpa underfoot minicarts to carry customers their purchases or both were available for a small rental fee hourly or daily rates available a droid with hair in snaking flamecolored ropes approached with a small crystal bottle keep that thing away from me eve ordered id like some obligingly peabody tilted back her head so the droid could spritz some perfume on her throat its called do me the droid purred wear it and prepare to be ravished hmm peabody angled her head toward eve what do you think eve took one sniff shook her head its not you could be me peabody muttered trudging after her lets try to keep our focus here eve took peabodys arm as her aide paused at a cosmetic counter where a woman was being painted with sparkling gold from the neck up lets hit the mens department see if we can find out who waited on hawley day before yesterday she used credit so theyd have her address i could finish up my christmas shopping in about twenty minutes finish it eve turned back as they stepped on the people guide going up sure ive only got a couple of little things left peabody pursed her lips then bit the inside of her cheek to hold back the grin havent started yet have you ive been thinking about it what are you getting roarke ive been thinking about it eve said again and jammed her hands in her pockets theyve got great clothes here peabody nodded toward the display droids as they turned left on the glide toward mens casual wear hes got a closet the size of maine full of clothes already have you ever bought him any eve felt her shoulders hunch defensively and straightened her spine im not his mother peabody paused by a droid modeling a dull silver silk shirt and black leather trousers hed look good in this she fingered the sleeve of course roarke would look good in anything she wiggled her brows at eve guys really love having a woman buy them clothes i dont know how to buy clothes for somebody else i barely know how to buy them for myself when she caught herself trying to imagine roarkes face and body in place of the droids she hissed out a breath and were not here to shop scowling she strode straight to the first checkout counter then slapped her badge on it under the nose of the clerk he cleared his throat and tossed his long black hair over his shoulder is there something i can do for you officer lieutenant you had a customer a couple of days ago marianna hawley i want to know who waited on her im sure i can check on that for you his eyes a trendy gold shifted right then left lieutenant would you mind putting your identification away and perhaps uh buttoning your jacket over your weapon i believe our customers would be more at ease saying nothing eve jammed her shield back in her pocket then hitched her jacket over her side arm hawley he said obviously relieved would you know if her transactions were made with cash credit or store accounts credits she bought two mens shirts one silk one cotton a cashmere sweater and jacket yes he stopped running the scan on his register i remember i waited on her myself an attractive brunette of about thirty she was selecting gifts for her partner ah he closed his eyes shirts in fifteen and a half thirtyoneinch sleeves sweater and jacket fortytwo chest good memory eve commented its my job he said opening his eyes to smile remembering customers their tastes and needs ms hawley had excellent taste and the foresight to bring along a wallet hologram of her young man so that we could program a color chart for him did she deal with anyone but you not in this department i gave her my full time and attention you have her address on record yes of course as i recall i offered to have her purchases sent but she said she wanted to take them with her she laughed and said that it added to the fun she enjoyed her shopping experience very much his eyes clouded does she have a complaint no eve looked him in the eye and knew in her gut she was wasting her time she isnt complaining did you notice anyone hanging around while she was shopping talking to her watching her no we were quite busy though oh i hope she wasnt accosted in the parking area weve had a number of incidents in the last few weeks i dont know whats wrong with people its christmas umhm you sell santa suits santa suits he blinked yes that would be in seasonals and novelties sixth floor thanks peabody check it out eve ordered as she turned away get names and locations for anyone buying or renting a suit in the last month im going down to jewelry see if anyone can make the hairpin meet me there yes sir knowing her aide eve laid a warning hand on her arm in fifteen minutes any longer and i bust you down to mall guard peabody moved her shoulders as eve strode off shes so strict o o having to elbow her way to a spot at the counter on the third floor didnt improve eves mood beneath the glass was an ocean of sparkling body accessories from earrings to nipple rings gold silver colored stones elaborate shapes varying textures all vied for attention under the glass roarke was always buying her things to drape around her neck pin to her ears she didnt get it absently she fingered the diamond under her shirt but he seemed to enjoy seeing her wear the things he chose for her because she was running out of patience and being roundly ignored by the staff manning the counter she simply leaned over and snagged a clerk by the collar madam outraged the clerk scorched her with a hot blue scowl lieutenant she corrected pulling out her shield with her free hand got a minute for me now of course he eased back straightened his needlethin silver tie what can i do for you do you sell anything like this she opened her bag and took out the sealed pin i dont believe thats one of ours he stooped until his gaze was level with the pin very nice work festive he leaned back we wont be able to take this as a return unless you have a receipt i dont recognize it as being of our stock im not looking to return it got any ideas where it might have come from id suggest a specialty shop the craftsmanship appears to be quite fine there are six jewelers in the mall perhaps one of them will recognize it great she dropped it back in her bag and blew out a breath is there something else i can do for you eve shifted her feet and scanned the display under her nose a set of three chained ropes with clashing colored stones the size of her thumb caught her eye it was ridiculously flashy edging toward tacky and just screamed mavis that she said and pointed ah youd like to see the heathen neck ornament very unique very i dont want to see it ill take it just wrap it up and make it fast i see training kept him from goggling and how would you like to pay for that peabody marched up just as eve was accepting the festive red and silver bag you shopped she said accusingly no i bought theres a difference the pin didnt come from here the guy seemed to know his stuff and was pretty definite i dont want to waste any more time here doesnt look like you wasted it peabody muttered well run the pin through the computer ill see if feeneys got time to do a trace what did you buy just something for mavis she caught peabodys pout as they walked through the doors dont worry peabody ill get you something really she brightened immediately ive already got your present its wrapped and everything showoff cheered now peabody hopped into the car want to guess what it is no ill give you a hint pull yourself together start running the names you got on the santa suits see if you get a hit on anyone with a sheet yes sir where are we heading personally yours she sent peabody a sidelong glance and youre not doing any shopping there either spoilsport sir peabody added dutifully and began to run the names on her hand unit o o in the heart of midtown towering over fifth avenue in polished black marble was a palace of pleasure the exterior was a sleek spear ringed on the upper floors with gilded balconies and silvered glides sheer glass tubes slid up and down at the four corners of the compass inside there were salons for body sculpting mood enhancement sexual orientation without leaving the premises a client could be buffed polished molded remodeled or sexually satisfied in the manner of their choice several gyms were outfitted with the newest equipment for those who preferred a little doityourself for those who chose a more passive road to fitness and beauty licensed consultants were available to wield laser and toning tubes to rid a client of those pesky extra pounds and inches one floor was dedicated to the holistic approach which included everything from chakra balancing to coffee enemas as she scanned those particular offerings eve wasnt certain whether to laugh or shudder mud baths algae scrapes injections of the placenta of sheep raised on alfa six tranquility sessions vr trips vision adjustments facelifts tucks and morphs all could be done on the premises with a number of package deals offered once your body and mind were perfected you were invited to explore the possibility of finding the right mate for the new you with the trained staff of personally yours the firm encompassed three floors of the building with its staff uniformed in simple black suits with small red hearts embroidered on the breasts with the path of beauty on the doorstep attractive faces and bodies were every bit as much a part of the dress code the lobby area was done in grecian temple with small musical ponds glinting with the flash of goldfish and white marble columns decked with trailing vines separating areas the seating arrangements were low to the tiled floor cushy and plentiful a checkin desk was discreetly tucked between fanning palms i need information on one of your clients eve held up her badge and watched the receptionists eyes flicker with nerves were not allowed to give out client information the woman bit her lip and brushed her fingers over the tiny heart that was tattooed under her eye like a pretty red tear all our services are strictly confidential we guarantee to protect our clients privacy one of your clients isnt worried about privacy anymore this is police business i can have a warrant transmitted in about five minutes or you can give me what i need and avoid having the department go over every file if youd just wait a moment the receptionist indicated the closest seating area ill get the manager for you fine eve turned away as the receptionist slipped on a headset it smells great in here peabody commented the whole building smells great she took in a deep sniff of air they must pump something through the air vents nice and soothing she settled her rump on one of the golden cushions near a tinkling fountain i want to live here youre annoyingly chipper these days peabody the holidays do that to me wow look at that she swiveled her head her eyes lighting appreciatively as a man with a stream of streaked blond hair swaggered in now why would a guy who looked like that need a dating service why does anybody its creepy i dont know could save time trouble wear and tear peabody leaned forward to look around eve and keep the man in view maybe i should try it out i could get lucky hes not your type peabodys face clouded exactly as it had when eve had rejected the perfume how come i like looking at his type sure but try to have a conversation with him eve dipped her hands in her pockets and rocked back on her heels guys in love with himself and figures every woman who gets a load of him has to go moonyeyed just like youre doing hed bore you to death in ten minutes because all hed talk about is himself how he looks what he does what he likes youd just be his latest accessory peabody considered watching as the goldtipped adonis posed at the checkin counter okay so we wont bother to talk well just have sex hed be a lousy lay wouldnt give a damn if you got off or not im getting off just looking at him but she sighed when he took out a small silverbacked mirror and examined his face with obvious delight its times like this i hate it when youre right look at this eve said under her breath these two are so polished i need my sunshades ken and barbie on the town at eves blank look peabody sighed again man you didnt have a barbie doll what kind of kid were you i was never a kid eve said simply and turned back to greet the magnificent couple gliding her way the woman was slimhipped and fullbreasted as the current fashion demanded her silvery blond hair fell in a straight streaming waterfall over her shoulders to flick across the big beautiful breasts as she walked her face was smooth and white as alabaster with deepset eyes of rich emeraldgreen surrounded by long lashes dyed to match those jewellike irises her mouth was full and red curved in a polite smile of greeting her companion was every bit as dazzling her twin in coloring with his moonlight hair swept back into a long braid twined with thin gold ribbon his shoulders were wide his legs long unlike the rest of the staff they werent dressed in black but wore slim white skinsuits the woman had draped a transparent red scarf cleverly over her hips she spoke first in a voice as soft and silky as the scarf im piper and this is my associate rudy what can we do for you i need data on one of your clients once again eve took out her badge im investigating a homicide a homicide the woman put a hand to her heart how dreadful one of our clients rudy well certainly cooperate in any way we can he spoke quietly in a creamy baritone we should discuss this upstairs in private he gestured toward the clear tube of an elevator guarded by enormous white azaleas in full bloom youre sure the victim was one of our clients her lover met her through your service eve stepped directly to the middle of the tube and ignored the view as they whisked up heights had never appealed to her i see piper sighed we have an excellent success rate in matching couples i hope it wasnt a lovers quarrel that ended in tragedy we havent determined that i cant believe that could be it we screen very carefully rudy gestured toward the opening of the tube as the elevator stopped how were connected to comtrack as he spoke he escorted them down a quiet corridor in hospital white with soft dreamy watercolors in gold frames and banquets of fresh flowers in clear vases every applicant is put into the system we look at marital history credit ratings criminal records of course our applicants must also take the standard personality test any violent tendencies are rejected sexual preferences and desires are recorded analyzed and matched he opened the door to a large office done in blinding whites and screaming reds the window wall was filtered against both the glare of the sun and the noise of sky traffic whats your percentage of deviants pipers perfect mouth thinned we dont consider personal sexual preferences deviant unless the partner or partners involved object eve merely lifted her brows why dont we use my definition instead bondage s and m you get any in here who like to doll up their partner after sex rudy cleared his throat and moved behind a wide white console certainly some applicants look for what we might call adventurous sexual experiences as i said those preferences would be matched with like applicants who did you match up with marianna hawley marianna hawley he glanced at piper im better with faces than names she turned to the wall screen as rudy fed the name into the computer seconds later marianna smiled out at them her eyes bright and alive oh yes i remember her she was charming yes i very much enjoyed working with her she was looking for a companion someone fun who she could enjoy art no no it was theater i believe she tapped one perfectly shaped nail against her bottom lip she was a romantic rather sweetly oldfashioned it seemed to come to her all at once and pipers hand dropped limply to her side shes been murdered oh rudy sit down dear he came gracefully around the console to take her hand pat it to lead her to a long sofa with deep air cushions piper becomes very personally involved with our clients he told eve thats why shes so marvelous at her work she cares so do i rudy though her voice was flat his eyes flicked over her face and whatever he saw had him nodding yes im sure you do you suspect that someone in our system someone she might have met through our service killed her im investigating i need names give her whatever she needs rudy piper patted her fingers under her eyes to dry tears id like to but we have a responsibility to our clients we guarantee privacy marianna hawley was entitled to privacy eve said shortly someone raped her sodomized her and strangled her id say they pretty much violated her privacy i doubt any of your clients would enjoy sharing in that experience rudy took a deep breath his face was paler now if that was possible so that his eyes seemed to burn against a field of glossy white i trust youll be discreet you can trust ill be good eve said in return and waited for him to call up the list of matches chapter four sarabeth greenbalm wasnt having a good day first off she hated working the afternoon shift at the sweet spot the clientele from noon to five consisted primarily of junior execs looking for a long lunch and cheap thrills with the emphasis on cheap the climbingthecorporateladder crowd didnt have a lot of money to toss to a stripper they just liked to gawk and hoot five hours of hard work had netted her just under a hundred in cash and credit chips and a half a dozen drunken propositions none of which included marriage marriage was sarabeths holy grail she wasnt going to find a rich husband in the afternoon set of a strip club even a highclass club like the sweet spot there was potential in the night hours when the vps and ceos sauntered in bringing important clients for an hour or two of titillation she could make a thousand easily and when you added in some lap dancing double that but the best was collecting business cards sooner or later one of those corporate suits with their big white smiles and perfectly manicured and grabby hands was going to put a ring on her finger for the privilege of groping her it was all part of the career plan shed carefully mapped out when shed moved from allentown pennsylvania to new york city five years before stripping in allentown had been a deadend situation netting her just enough per week to keep her from becoming another sidewalk sleeper still moving to new york had been risky there was more competition for the same recreation dollar younger competition the first year shed worked two shifts three if she could still stand shed worked as a roamer sliding from club to club and shelling out the hardline forty percent of take to the managers it had been a gruesome year but shed earned her nest egg the second year shed focused on nailing a regular spot at an upscale club it had taken nearly all of those twelve months but shed carved her niche at the sweet spot during her third year shed fought her way up the food chain to shift headliner cagily investing her profits and she admitted she had wasted nearly six months considering the cohabitation offer of the clubs head smasher she might have done it too if he hadnt gone and gotten himself sliced into six separate pieces in a bar fight at a dive where hed been moonlighting because sarabeth had insisted he needed a bigger bank account if he wanted her to sleep with him on a permanent basis shed decided to consider it a lucky escape now well into year four she was fortythree years old and running out of time she didnt mind naked dancing hell she was a damn good dancer and her body she studied it as she turned in front of her bedroom mirror was her meal ticket nature had been generous gifting her with high full breasts that hadnt required augmentation so far a long torso long legs a firm ass yes she had all the necessary weapons shed had to put money into her face and considered it a good investment shed been born with thin lips a short chin and a heavy forehead but a few trips to a beauty enhancement center had fixed that now her mouth was full and ripe her chin sassily pointed and her brow high and clear sarabeth greenbalm looked in her opinion damn good the problem was she was down to her last five hundred the rent was due and some overeager bozo in the lunch crowd had ripped her best gstring before she could slither out of it she had a headache her feet hurt and she was still single she should never have plunked down the three thousand for personally yours in retrospect what had seemed like a clever investment now appeared to be good money down the sewer losers used dating services she thought as she tugged on a short purple robe and losers attracted losers after meeting the first two men on her match list shed gone straight down to fifth avenue and asked for her money back the blond ice queen hadnt been so friendly then sarabeth thought now no refunds no way no how with a philosophical shrug sarabeth walked from the bedroom into the kitchen a short walk in an apartment barely bigger than the communal dressing room at the sweet spot the money was gone a writeoff and a lesson had been learned she had to depend on herself and herself only the knock on her door interrupted her hopeful scan of the limited offerings of her autochef absently she tugged her robe closed then beat a fist on the wall the couple next door fought like cats and fucked like minks most every night her pounding wouldnt change the noise level by a decibel but it made her feel better she turned one suspicious brown eye to the security peep then grinned like a girl hurriedly she disengaged the locks and swung the door wide hey there santa his eyes twinkled merrily merry christmas sarabeth he shook the big silver box he carried then winked at her have you been good o o captain ryan feeney sat on the end of eves desk and munched on candied almonds he had the livedin vaguely morose face of a basset hound and a wiry thatch of russet hair sprinkled with thin steely threads of silver there was a rustcolored splotch on his rumpled shirt a memory of the bean soup hed had for lunch and a small nick on his chin where hed cut himself shaving that morning he looked harmless eve would have gone through any door with him and had hed trained her and taught her now as captain of the electronic detective division he was an invaluable resource to her wish i could tell you the bauble was a one of a kind he popped another nut into his mouth still theres only a dozen stores in the city that sell it and how many do we have to trace fortynine of them were sold in the last seven weeks he scratched his chin worrying at the tiny scab the pin runs about five hundred fortyeight were credit deals only one cash transaction that would be him more than likely feeney pulled out his memo book the cash deal was at sals gold and silver on fortyninth ill check it out thanks nothing to it got anything else mcnabs willing and able mcnab he liked working with you the boys good and

it over all the data i have on the ex is here ill be running the names of the matches from personally yours ill pass those to him after ive taken a look dont understand places like that feeney shook

pocket oh were looking forward to the christmas party she was already focused on her computer and barely glanced over what party your party oh she searched her mind found it blank as far as parties went yeah great dont know a thing about it do you i must and because it was feeney she smiled its just in another compartment look if you see peabody out in the bullpen tell her shes off duty will do party she thought with a sigh every time she turned around roarke was giving a party or dragging her off to one the next thing she knew mavis would pounce on her about getting her hair done having face and body work trying a new outfit designed by her lover leonardo if she had to go to a damn party why couldnt she just go as she was because she was roarkes wife she reminded herself and as such she was expected to attend social functions looking slightly better than a cop with murder on the brain but that was whenever it was and this was now computer list matches through personally yours for hawley marianna working match one of five dorian marcell single white male age thirtytwo while the computer listed his statistics eve studied the image on screen a pleasant face a shy look around the eyes dorian liked art theater and old videos claimed to be a romantic at heart looking for a mate for his soul his hobbies were photography and snowboarding nothing special about dorian she thought but they would see what hed been up to on the night marianna had been murdered match two of five charles monroe single white male whoa whoa hold it stop with a half laugh eve peered at the face on screen well charles fancy meeting you here it was a fine face smiling back at her and she remembered it shed met charles monroe nearly a year before while investigating another murder the case that had brought her and roarke together charles was a licensed companion slick and charming and what she wondered was a wellheeled lc doing in dating service trolling charlie looks like you and i are going to have to have another talk computer go to third match match three of five jeremy vandoren divorced lieutenant computer pause yeah she glanced over as peabody hovered at the door captain feeney said youre finished with me for the day right im just running some names before i go he uh mentioned that you were going to use mcnab for some of the ework thats right eve angled her head then kicked back in her chair as peabody struggled to keep her face controlled you got a problem with that no that is dallas you dont really need him hes such a pain in the ass eve smiled cheerfully hes not a pain in mine i guess youll just have to work on making your ass a little tougher peabody but buck up hell do most of what i give him over in edd he wont be around here much hell find a way peabody muttered hes such a showoff he does good work and anyway she broke off as her communicator beeped shit i should have gotten out of here on time she pulled it out dallas lieutenant commander whitneys wide stern face filled the small screen sir we have a homicide that appears to be connected to the hawley case there are uniforms on the scene now i want you as primary report to b west one hundred and twelve apartment d contact me at my home office after youve confirmed the status yes sir im on my way she spared peabody a glance as she rose and grabbed her jacket youre back on duty o o the uniform standing guard at sarabeths door had eyes that told eve shed seen the likes of what was inside before and expected to see it again officer carmichael eve began scanning the nameplate what have we got white female early forties dead at scene apartments in the name of sarabeth greenbalm no sign of forced entry or struggle theres no video security in this building other than on the main door my partner and i were on our cruise when dispatch sent the call at sixteen thirtyfive a anonymous report at this address we responded arriving at sixteen fortytwo the entrance door and the door of the reported unit were unsecured we entered and found the deceased we then secured the scene and alerted dispatch of a suspicious death at this location wheres your partner carmichael locating the building manager sir fine keep this hallway clear stand until relieved sir carmichael slid her eyes over peabody as they passed among the uniforms peabody was regarded as dallass pet with varying degrees of envy resentment and awe feeling a combination of all three from carmichael peabody twitched her shoulders as she followed eve through the door recorder on peabody yes sir lieutenant dallas and aide on scene at b west one hundred twelve street apartment of sarabeth greenbalm as she spoke eve took a can of sealit from her field kit and sprayed her hands and boots before handing it off to peabody victim yet to be identified is white female she approached the body the bedroom area was no more than an alcove off the main room the bed a narrow bunk style that could be folded up to afford more room it had plain white sheets and a brown blanket worn at the edges hed used red garland this time wrapping it around her boa style from neck to ankle so that she resembled a festive mummy her hair a shade of violet eve imagined mavis would admire had been neatly brushed and styled into an upswept cone her lips slack in death had been painted a rich purple her cheeks a tender pink pale gold glitter shadow had been carefully applied to her eyelids all the way to the brow line pinned to the garland just at the center of her throat was a circle of glossy green within it two birds one gold one silver nested beak to beak turtledoves right eve studied the brooch i looked up the song the second day his true love gives him two turtledoves gently eve pressed a hand to the painted cheek shes fresh id bet it hasnt been more than an hour since he finished her stepping back she took out her communicator to contact whitney and request a crime scene team o o it was nearly midnight when she got home her shoulder was throbbing a little but she could ignore that what annoyed her was the fatigue it came too quickly and too intensely these days she knew what the departments orifice poker would say about it not enough recovery time shed been entitled to another ten days injury leave her return to full duty had been too soon because it tended to sour her mood to think of it she blocked it out shed forgotten to eat and the minute she stepped inside the warmth of the house the first pangs of hunger hit just need a candy bar she told herself and scrubbed her hands over her face before turning to the scanner near the door where is roarke roarke is in his home office figures she decided as she started up the stairs the man didnt seem to need sleep like a normal human she imagined hed look as fresh as he had when shed left him that morning hed left his door open so it only took one quick glance inside to confirm her suspicions he sat at the wide glossy console scanning screens giving orders into his link while his laser fax hummed behind him and he looked sexy as sin she thought if she could get her hands on that candy bar she might just have the energy to jump him dont you ever quit she demanded as she stepped into the room he glanced over smiled then turned back to his link all right john see that those alterations are made well go over this in more detail tomorrow he broke transmission you didnt have to stop she began i just wanted to let you know i was home i was entertaining myself while i waited for you he angled his head as he studied her face forgot to eat didnt you im hoping for a candy bar got any he rose and moved across the polished floor to the autochef moments later he took out a thick green bowl steaming with soup thats not a candy bar you can feed the child after you take care of the woman he set the soup on a table then poured himself a brandy she walked over sniffed the soup nearly drooled smells pretty good she decided and sat down to devour did you eat she asked with her mouth full and nearly groaned with joy as he set a plate of hot bread on the table you have to stop taking care of me its one of my little pleasures he sat beside her sipping brandy watching the hot food put color back in her cheeks and yes ive eaten but i wouldnt say no to a bit of that bread umm obligingly she broke a hunk in half and passed it to him it was sort of homey she decided the two of them sharing soup and bread after a long day just like well normal people so roarke industries rose what eight points yesterday his brow winged up eight and threequarters have you developed an interest in the stock market lieutenant maybe im just keeping an eye on you your stock goes down i might have to dump you ill bring that point up at the next shareholders meeting do you want some wine maybe ill get it sit eat i havent finished taking care of you yet he rose and selected a bottle already open and chilling in the cold box cabinet while he poured she scraped the last of the soup from the bowl barely resisting licking it clean she felt warm settled home roarke are we having a party i imagine when i dont know when a line formed between her eyebrows as she looked up at him if i knew when why would i ask feeney said something about our christmas party december twentythird yes were having a party why darling eve he bent down and kissed the top of her head before he sat again because its the holidays how come you didnt tell me i believe i did i dont remember do you have your date book handy grumbling she tugged it out of her pocket and plugged in the date there clear as crystal was the information followed by her initials to indicate shed logged it in herself oh the trees are being delivered tomorrow trees yes well have a formal one in the parlor several in the ballroom upstairs but i thought wed have a smaller more personal one in our bedroom well decorate that one ourselves her brows shot high you want to decorate a tree i do i dont know the first thing about it ive never decorated a christmas tree before neither have i or not in years itll be our first the warmth that moved through her now had nothing to do with a hot meal or vintage wine her lips curved well probably make a mess of it he took the hand she held out to him no doubt feeling better a lot yeah do you want to tell me about tonight her fingers tightened on his yeah i do she released his hand and rose because she would think more clearly on the move he got another one she began same mo outside security cameras tagged him the santa suit the big silver box with the fussy bow he left her a pin two birds in a circle turtledoves right or close enough i dont know what a damn turtledove looks like no sign of forced entry no sign of struggle i imagine the tox report will show she was tranqd shed been restrained probably gagged as the unit wasnt soundproofed there were some fibers on her tongue and in her mouth but he didnt leave whatever he gagged her with behind sexually assaulted yes same as the first there was a fresh temp tattoo on her right breast my true love and hed wrapped her up in red garland painted her face brushed her hair the bathroom was the cleanest place in the apartment im guessing he scrubbed it down himself after he was done cleaning himself up shed only been dead an hour by the time i got there the anonymous call came in from a pay slot a half a block from her house he could see the frustration working back into her rising he took her glass and his own who was she a stripper lap dancer worked at the sweet spot an upscale club on the west side yes i know where it is when she turned eyes narrowed he handed her the wine and yes it happens to be one of my properties i really hate when that happens when he only grinned at her she blew out a breath anyway she had the afternoon shift got off just before five from what we can tell she went straight home she ran a scan on her autochef at six just about the time the outside camera picked up this bastard going into the building eve stared into her wine id say she missed dinner too hes working quickly and having a jolly old time with it looks to me like he wants to make his quota by new years i need to run her link her finances her personal records ive got to check out the pin im getting nowhere with the santa suit or the garland how the hell do i connect a sweet administrative assistant to a lap dancer i know that tone with that he turned and moved to his console lets see what we can do i didnt say anything about you running scans he flicked a glance in her direction it was implied what was her name it was not implied sarabeth one word no h greenbalm she walked over to stand with him behind the console i was simply running through my thoughts out loud the address is b west one hundred and twelve got it what do you want first i can run her link in the morning go with either personal or financial financial would take you longer lets start with that no showing off eve warned then laughed when he snaked a hand around her waist and pulled her against his side of course im going to show off subject sarabeth greenbalm he began then nuzzled at eves throat residing west one hundred and twelve his hand slid up to cup her breast all financial records latest transactions first working now he murmured and turned eve until their bodies meshed i should just have enough time to his mouth swooped down drawing deeply from hers and sending the top of her head spinning somewhere near the lofty ceiling data complete well he nipped her bottom lip maybe not quite enough time your data lieutenant she cleared her throat exhaled youre good exhaled again i mean youre really good i know and because she was just a bit off balance yet he sat pulling her until she tumbled into his lap hey im working here me too swiveling her to face front he began to nibble at the back of her neck ill work on this you work on that i cant while youre she hunched her shoulders stifled a chuckle and tried to concentrate on the data on screen rents her biggest expense followed by clothes shes got most of them marked costume for taxes stop it she slapped at the clever fingers that had already unbuttoned her blouse to the navel you dont need your shirt to read data he said reasonably and began sliding it off her shoulders look pal im still wearing my clutch piece so she sprang to her feet making him mutter an oath shit shit there it is son of a bitch theres the link resigned he tucked away thoughts of seducing her and turned his attention to the screen where there three thousand to personally yours by electronic transaction six weeks ago her eyes were hot now not with passion but power as she swung around to face him she and hawley used the same dating service thats not a coincidence thats a connection i need her matches she murmured then catching roarkes inquiring look she shook her head no well do it the right way by the book ill go in tomorrow and get them it wouldnt take me long to access its not legal she struggled to keep her face stern when that grin of his beamed at her and its not your job but i appreciate it how much she stepped back stood between his legs and looked down at him enough to let you finish taking care of me she sat straddling him after i take care of you that is how about he fisted a hand in her hair and brought her mouth within a breath of his we take care of each other thats a deal chapter five settled in her home office with weak winter sunlight dribbling through the window wall at her back eve organized her data she intended to feed a report to her commander by midmorning and had several blanks she wanted to fill in first computer engage detail data on dating service enterprise known as personally yours located on fifth avenue in new york working personally yours established in fifth avenue location owned and operated by rudy and piper hoffman stop confirm business in question is owned by rudy and piper hoffman affirmative rudy and piper hoffman fraternal twins age twentyeight residence fifth avenue continue scan on personally yours no search and report full data on owners searching while her computer juggled its chips she rose to get a cup of coffee fraternal twins she thought as the autochef filled her request brother and sister shed tagged them as lovers and now thinking back remembering the way theyd touched moved together the looks exchanged she wondered if both she and the computer were right it was a thought that didnt sit well in her gut a movement in the adjoining doorway caught the corner of her eye an instant before roarke stepped into full view good morning youre up and about early i want to get my prelim report to whitney first thing she took her coffee from the autochef shook back her hair you want a cup of this yes i do he took hers smiling when she frowned at him ill be in meetings most of the day what else is new she muttered and programmed the unit for a second cup of coffee but you can reach me if you need she grunted then glanced over as her computer signaled data search was complete good okay ive got she yelped in surprise as he grabbed the front of her shirt and tugged hey what hold data she called out and shoved at her husband i like the way you smell in the morning he leaned in and sniffed at her hair as he spoke its just soap i know get ahold of yourself but damn it he had her blood up and pumping fast ive got work she muttered even as her arms came around him so do i i miss you eve he set his cup aside so he could hold her just hold her i guess weve both been busy the last couple of weeks it felt so good to lean against him and just be i cant back off this case now i dont expect you to for the pleasure of it he rubbed his cheek against hers i wouldnt want you to but it was the last case what it had done to her that weighed on his mind and his heart im content to steal a moment here and there he eased back brushed his lips over hers ive always had a good hand at stealing whatever youre not supposed to remind me and smiling she framed his face with her hands from the doorway peabody watched them it was too late to step back too soon to step forward though they were only standing his hands on eves shoulders hers on his cheeks peabody found it a wrenchingly intimate moment that had her face heating and her heart sighing with envy at a loss she did the only thing she could think of and worked up the fake faintly embarrassed cough of the intruder roarke ran his hands down eves arms and smiled toward the doorway good morning peabody coffee um yeah thanks uh its pretty cold out really roarke said as eve moved back toward her desk yeah its not supposed to get up to freezing we might get some snow flurries this afternoon what are you the national weather service eve demanded then took a good look at her aide peabodys face was flushed her eyes soft her hands busily plucking at her brass buttons whats wrong with you nothing thanks she said when roarke brought her a cup of coffee youre welcome ill leave you to work when he walked through the adjoining doorway and closed it off peabody sighed i dont know how you can remember your name when he looks at you the way he does if i forget it he reminds me though she heard the wry humor in eves voice peabody stepped closer whats it like what glancing up eve caught the intensity in her aides eyes and shrugged uncomfortably peabody weve got work here isnt that what its about peabody interrupted isnt what youve got what those two women were looking for eve opened her mouth then shut it again she glanced toward the connecting doors saw that roarke had closed them but hadnt engaged locks on either side its more than you think it can be she heard herself say it changes everything and fixes everything that matters maybe youre never going to be the same and maybe part of you is always afraid of what will happen if but hes always going to be there all you have to do is reach out and hes going to be there surprised at herself she slipped her hands into her pockets can you find that by pumping data into a computer system and letting it run personality and lifestyle matches i dont know but weve got two dead women who thought it was worth a try pull up a chair peabody and well see what weve got yes sir well run a full search of jeremy vandoren instincts aside we need to confirm or eliminate once we have full data on all five matches on the hawley list well pay another visit to personally yours detective mcnab reporting for duty eve looked over and saw ian mcnab swagger into the room he had a big satisfied grin on his pretty face a kneelength vest in eyesearing fuchsia over his christmasgreen jumpsuit and a striped ribbon of both colors binding back his long sweep of glinting gold hair feeling peabody stiffen like a flagpole beside her eve nearly sighed hows it going mcnab its going good lieutenant hey there peabody he winked cockily then set a hip on the desk captain feeney said you could use me on this santa case im here to serve got anything to eat see whats in the autochef mag working for you dallas has rocking benefits he wiggled his brows suggestively at peabody then walked over to forage breakfast if you were going to use that pinhead peabody muttered under her breath why cant he work out of edd because i wanted to irritate you peabody its my main goal in life since youre here mcnab eve continued you can take over these searches peabody and i need to go out in the field just line them up he said taking a huge bite of a blueberry danish ill knock them back when youve finished stuffing your face eve said mildly run the names in the hawley file all data took care of the ex last night he said with his mouth full cant find any break in his alibi so far okay she appreciated the fast return but decided not to mention it and have peabody pouting all day ill be sending you another list from the field run those names then do a crosscheck between the lists take a good look at the hoffman twins rudy and piper i want anything that pops and run this she turned back to her computer called up the evidence file and shot out a hologram of the second brooch i want to know who made this piece how many were manufactured where they were sold how many were sold and to whom crosscheck that with the first pin found on hawleys body you getting this mcnab sir he swallowed hastily then tapped a finger to his temple every bit you get me a name that matches both lists and the bauble and ill see to it youve got fresh danishes every morning for the rest of your life thats a hell of an incentive he wiggled his fingers let me at it lets ride peabody eve rose grabbed her bag dont bother roarke mcnab she warned and headed out looking good shebody mcnab called just as peabody hit the doorway she snarled hissed stomped out and left him feeling gratified edds full of detectives with class you know peabody complained as they trooped downstairs how come were stuck with the one asshole in the division just lucky i guess eve snagged her jacket off the newel post and swung it on as they walked outside christ its fucking freezing out here you really ought to have a warmer coat lieutenant im used to this one but she slid into the car quickly heat for gods sake she ordered seventyfive degrees i love this unit peabody snuggled into the seat everything works yeah but it lacks character still eve glanced down with pleasure as her link signaled an incoming catch this she told peabody screen incoming she ordered as she drove through the gates dallas dallas damn it the attractive and irritated face of ace screen reporter nadine furst came on screen i just missed you at home summerset said youre on route somewhere answer the damn link will you i dont think so hell those cityissue units you cops drive never work peabody and eve exchanged cheerful grins while nadine continued to mutter i guess she got wind of the case sure she did eve confirmed now she wants to hit me up for information for her midmorning report and shell hound me for a oneonone for the noon edition dallas i need more data on these women who were killed are the cases linked come on dallas be a pal i need to bump up my midmorning told you eve said complacently as she twisted through traffic get in touch will you we can set up a oneonone im on deadline here my heart bleeds eve yawned as nadine signed off i like her peabody commented so do i shes fair shes accurate and shes good at what she does but that doesnt mean im going to take time out to give her ratings a goose if i avoid her for a couple of days shell be digging on her own lets see what she can feed us for a change youre sneaky lieutenant i like that about you but about mcnab live with it peabody eve suggested and whipped up and into a secondlevel parking slot on the curb on fifth inside she went directly to a tube stepped in hooked her thumbs in her pockets and tolerated the ride up to the office level of personally yours manning the greeting desk was a young god with shoulders the size of mountains skin the color of rich swiss chocolate and eyes like antique gold coins stop vibrating eve muttered and peabody only grunted in response tell rudy and piper lieutenant dallas and aide are here lieutenant his smile was dreamy and slow im sorry but rudy and piper are in client consultations tell them im here eve repeated and that theyre minus another client of course he gestured to the waiting area to the left please make yourselves comfortable feel free to order up some refreshment while you wait dont keep me waiting long he didnt within five minutes and before peabody could weaken enough to order up something called a raspberry cream froth both rudy and piper stepped into the lobby area they were in white again ankle dusters this time with piper jazzing hers up with a blue silk sash each wore a single gold hoop in the right ear one the mate of the other it made eves skin crawl lieutenant rudy spoke keeping a hand on pipers shoulder were a bit rushed this morning our schedules very full it just got fuller you want to do this here or in private the faintest hint of irritation flickered in rudys exotic eyes but he gestured gracefully toward the hallway leading to their offices sarabeth greenbalm eve began the minute the door shut at her back she was found murdered yesterday she was one of yours oh god oh my god instantly piper collapsed in a wide white chair and covered her face with her hands hush now rudy ran a hand over pipers hair caressed the back of her neck youre certain she was a client yes i want her matches which one of you worked with her i would have piper dropped her hands in her lap the deep green eyes glinted with threatening tears her pale gold mouth trembled i work with the female applicants rudy with the male unless otherwise requested in general we find that people are more comfortable discussing romantic and sexual needs with a member of the same sex okay eve kept her eyes on pipers face and tried not to notice the way her hand crept up until it was swallowed by her brothers i remember her sarabeth i remember her because she was dissatisfied with the first two matches she wanted a full refund did she get one we have a firm policy against refunds once the client has begun to explore the matches rudy gave his sisters hand a reassuring squeeze then walked to his console i see neither of you mentioned that you owned the company you didnt ask rudy said simply as he called up the data eve had requested who besides the two of you would have access to client data we have thirtysix consultants rudy began after the initial screening which piper and i deal with personally applicants are assigned to the consultant who most suits their needs our consultants are screened trained and licensed lieutenant i want their names full data his eyes shuttered seemed to frost i cant agree to that that kind of invasion into the privacy of our staff is insulting eve angled her head peabody request a warrant search and seizure of all records personnel and client lists for personally yours log in reports on the hawley and greenbalm cases and request warrant be issued directly to me through my communicator and put a rush on it right away lieutenant rudy rubbing her hands together piper rose is this necessary i think it is he held out a hand taking hers when she crossed to him if our records are to be part of a police investigation i want it all to be documented i apologize for what might seem like a lack of cooperation and compassion lieutenant dallas but i have a great many people to protect so do i when the communicator beeped piper jolted excuse me eve turned her back to them and slipped it out of her pocket dallas we tagged the makeup used on hawley dickie scowled out of the screen brand names natural perfection highdollar shit like i figured nice work dickie yeah it cost me overtime and i got christmas shopping to do prelim indicates the stuff on greenbalm was the same brand you gotta buy this crap through salons or an enhancement center cant get it in regular stores even highend ones or off screen good thatll make it easier to trace who manufactures his scowl transformed into a wide wicked grin renaissance beauty and health a division of kenbar which is an arm of roarke industries dont you know what your old mans up to dallas hell was all eve said and she cut the transmission before she turned around any of the salons in this building sell natural perfection products yes piper leaned against rudy in a way that made eves stomach roll over that line is showcased in all things beautiful on the tenth level are you connected with the salon its a separate business but we maintain relationships with all the salons and shops in the building rudy moved to the console opened a compartment and selected a glossy foldout brochure and attached disc packages including salon work and gift certificates are available with consults here he said as he offered eve the material all things beautiful he continued is the most exclusive salon in the building they also offer packages which include a consult with us in their diamond day plan handy its good business was rudys response warrant approved lieutenant peabody tucked her own communicator away again processing transmission now o o feed all that data to mcnab eve ordered peabody when they were in the tube again all of it eve didnt spare much sympathy despite peabodys wide shocked eyes all start with the matches on greenbalm then give him personnel go from there into client list go back one year i have a feeling our man is living pretty much in the present thats going to take twenty or thirty minutes then find yourself a quiet spot and get started i get off here meet me in the salon when youve finished uploading data yes sir and buck up peabody poutings not attractive im not pouting peabody said with some dignity im gritting as in my teeth she sniffed audibly as the tube whooshed shut again the salon level smelled of forests and meadows the sound system piped in soft tinkling music of lyres and flutes underfoot was a carpet the color and consistency of crushed rose petals the walls were dull silver and drenched with the slowly streaming flow of water that fed into a narrow canal that circled the entire floor palmsized swans in pastel hues glided over its surface there were six salons in all each with glassfronted archways arbored with exotic vines eve recognized the reproduction of the immortal blossom that had been trained to spiral up a thin gilded curve that haloed the entrance of all things beautiful figures she thought that particular bloom had caused her quite a bit of trouble once upon a time the doors parted fluidly as she approached inside the lobby area was wide and sumptuous with deep cushioned scoop chairs in pale greens each was fitted with its own miniscreen and communication system statuary and sculpture ran to bronze nudes small serving droids scooted here and there carrying refreshments reading material vr goggles and whatever else clients ordered for their amusement while they were beautified two of the chairs were occupied by women who chatted absently and sipped something that looked like seafoam while they waited for their treatments both wore plush shellpink robes with the salons name discreetly etched on the lapel may i help you madam the woman behind a ushaped console gave eves battered jeans scarred boots and untidy hair a slow measuring study out of glittering silver eyes the eyes matched the sshaped streaks snaking through her wedge of triangular magenta hair i assume youre looking for our complete woman package eve smiled pleasantly is that a dig the woman blinked with a flurry of silver lashes i beg your pardon never mind sister i want to talk about your natural perfection line yes of course its the very best cosmetic and enhancement line money can buy ill be happy to arrange for a consultant to speak with you would you care to make an appointment yeah eve slapped her badge on the console now would be good i dont understand i can see that get me whoever runs this place excuse me a moment the woman shifted on her high stool and spoke softly into her link simon could you come up front please with her thumbs in her front pockets eve rocked back on her heels and studied the elegant bottles and tubes in the revolving display behind the console whats all that personalized scents we feed your personality and physical traits into a program and create a scent that is uniquely you the container is your choice each is one of a kind and once selected will never be made again interesting they make thoughtful gifts she arched a razorthin brow but are quite exclusive and expensive really irritated by the sarcasm eve sent her a tawny slitted stare i want one naturally the purchase must be prepaid before programming seriously riled eve imagined grabbing a handful of that stiff streaked hair and rapping the perfect sneering face firmly against the console she took one step forward as hurried footsteps sounded on the floor behind her yvette what seems to be the problem im swamped back there shes the problem yvette said with a thin smile and eve turned and got a full blast of the magnificent simon the eyes caught her first they were a pale almost translucent blue framed by thick dark lashes and thin ebony brows that each peaked to a rulersharp point in the middle his hair was a brilliant ruby red swept high off his forehead and temples and styled to tumble in a snowfall of springy curls to the middle of his back his skin had the dull gold sheen indicating mixedrace heritage or complexion dyes his mouth was painted a deep bronze and riding along his prominent left cheekbone was a white unicorn with gold horn and hooves he swept back the electricblue cape draped over his shoulders beneath he wore a skinsuit of chartreuse and silver stripes with a deeply scooped neckline a tangle of gold chains gleamed against his impressive chest he angled his head sending the long gold dangles in his ears dancing as he set one hand on one slim hip and studied eve and what can i do for you dear heart i want wait wait he threw up both hands palms out revealing a chain of hearts and flowers tattooed there i know that face with a dramatic toss of his head he circled eve and gave her a whiff of his scent plums she thought the guy smelled like plums faces he continued while eves eyes narrowed are after all my art my business my stock and trade ive seen yours oh yes indeed i have abruptly he grabbed eves face between his hands and leaned forward until they were nearly nose to nose look pal roarkes wife he squealed it then planted a loud juicy kiss on her mouth leaping back before she could follow through with the urge to punch him thats who you are darling he crooned turning with his hands crossed over his heart to the receptionist roarkes wife is in our humble salon roarkes wife yvette went bright red then lost all color oh she muttered and looked ill sit you must sit and tell me everything you desire he scooped an arm around eves shoulders and began to nudge her toward a chair yvette be a lamb and cancel all my consultations dear lady i am yours where shall we begin you can begin by stepping back ace she shrugged off his arm and with some regret pulled out her badge instead of her weapon im here on police business oh my oh my goodness simon patted his hands to his cheeks how could i have forgotten roarkes wife is one of new yorks finest forgive me dear heart the name is dallas lieutenant dallas of course then he smiled sweetly forgive me lieutenant my enthusiasm i tend to emote seeing you here i lost my head if you will you see youre on our top ten wish list along with madam president and slinky lemar the video queen he added when eves eyes remained narrowed its excellent company right i need your client list for the natural perfection line our client list he laid a hand on his heart again and sat he touched the video screen and had the menu popping on a sparkling lemon please lieutenant allow me to offer you some refreshment im fine but because he looked chastised and didnt appear to be planning on grabbing her again she sat across from him i need the list simon is it permissible to ask why im investigating a homicide a murder he whispered it leaned closer i know its dreadful but i find that terribly exciting im an avid fan of mystery and detective videos he offered that sweet smile again and despite herself eve softened this is a little different than a video simon i know i know its horrid of me ghoulish but i cant imagine how a line of cosmetics and enhancements figure into a his eyes went wide and bright poison was it poison someone added poison to the lip dyes the victim prepared herself for a glorious night on the town perhaps she used radical red or no no bombshell bronze then get a grip on yourself simon his lashes fluttered his color went bright then he chuckled warmly i should be spanked without glancing over he scooped a tall slim glass of pale yellow liquid from the serving droid that zipped to his chair of course well cooperate lieutenant in any way we can i should warn you that our client list is quite extensive if you could give me specific products we could whittle it down considerably give me the whole shot for now then ill see what i can do at your command he rose bowed then waltzed behind the console yvette give dear lieutenant dallas some samples while i perform this little task for her theres a lamb i dont need any samples eve smiled thinly at yvette but i want the scent we were talking about absolutely the receptionist nearly knelt at eves feet would this be for yourself no its a gift and a very thoughtful one yvette took a personal palm computer out of her pocket male or female female could you give me three of her strongest personality traits as in bold or shy or romantic intelligent eve said thinking of dr mira compassionate thorough very good now something of the physical medium height slender brown hair blue eyes light complexion thats very nice yvette said for a police report she thought in disgust what color brown is her hair how does she wear it eve hissed between her teeth this christmas shopping was tough stuff doing her best she focused and described the citys top profiler and shrink by the time peabody walked in she was choosing the bottle and waiting for simon to generate hard copy and disc you shopped again no i bought again should we have this delivered to your home or office lieutenant home would you like it gift wrapped hell yeah yeah wrap it up simon how about that data just coming lieutenant dear he looked up beamed at her im so happy we could help you in that matter he slipped the papers and disc into a gold foil shopping bag i added some samples i think youll find them perfect naturally he chuckled at his own joke as he passed the bag to eve and i hope youll keep me informed please come back any time any time at all id love to work on you chapter six an ocean of humanity swamped fifth avenue people swarmed on the sidewalks the people glides clogged the intersections and crowded at display windows all in a flurry to get into stores and buy some already burdened like pack mules with shopping bags elbowed and shoved their way through the waves of pedestrians to fight the hopeless fight for a cab overhead advertising blimps encouraged the masses toward a shopping frenzy with competing announcements of sales and products no consumer could live without theyre all insane eve decided as she watched a ministampede toward a maxibus heading downtown every one of them you bought something twenty minutes ago in a civilized and dignified manner peabody shrugged i like crowds at christmastime then im about to make you very happy were getting out here its as close as were going to get in a vehicle eve nosed her car through the stream of people and inched it toward the curb at fifth and fiftyfirst the jewelers just a few blocks down well make better time on foot peabody shoehorned her way out and caught up with eves long strides on the corner the wind rushed down the street like a river through a canyon and turned the tip of her nose pink before theyd managed a block i hate this shit eve muttered half these people dont even live here they come in from all over hell and back to clog the streets every damn december and drop a nice ton of money in our economy cause delays petty crime traffic accidents you try to get uptown at six oclock some night its ugly scowling she walked through the roasting meatscented steam of a corner glidecart a shout had her flicking her glance to the left in time to see a scuffle she lifted a brow in mild interest as a street thief on airskates toppled a pair of women snatched what bags he could reach snagged both purses and skimmed away through the crowd sir yeah ive got him eve noted his grin of triumph as he weaved through the crowds of people gaining speed as they leaped out of his path he ducked swiveled dodged then veered around toward eves right their eyes met for one brief second his bright with excitement hers flat and level she pivoted and took him out with one shortarmed backfisted punch had there been less of a crowd she thought he would have sailed nicely for ten feet or so instead he barreled back into a group of people upended with his skates still humming and facing the sky blood gushed out of his nose his eyes rolled back white see if you can get a beat cop in here to take care of this jerk eve flexed her fingers rolled her shoulder then absently put one booted foot on the thiefs midriff as he began to moan and squirm you know what peabody i feel a lot better now o o later eve thought busting the thief had been the high point of her day she didnt learn squat from the jeweler neither he nor his sourfaced clerk remembered anything about the customer whod paid cash for the partridge pin it was christmas the jeweler had complained even while his clerk rang up sales with the speed and precision of an accounting droid how was he supposed to remember one transaction eve suggested he think harder and contact her when his memory cleared then ended up buying a copper ear chain for maviss lover leonardo much to peabodys disgust you catch some transpo go back to the house and work with mcnab why dont you just punch me in the face with a bare fist handle it peabody im going into central ill need to give whitney an update and i want to see mira start her working on a profile maybe youll pick up a few more christmas presents on the way eve stopped by her car was that sarcasm i dont think so it was too direct for sarcasm find me a match on those lists peabody or we start interviewing lonely hearts eve left peabody elbowing her way toward sixth to catch a maxibus uptown she engaged her link as she headed in the opposite direction and set up the two meetings she scanned the incoming listened to nadines harried voice and decided to give the reporter a break stop whining nadine dallas christ where have you been keeping the city safe for you and yours look theres just enough time to plug something into my noon report give me a line here i just busted a mugger on fifth dont be droll im up against the wall whats the connection between the two murders which two murders we got a lot of bodies this time of year christmas brings out that wacky holiday spirit nadine snarled audibly hawley and greenbalm come on dallas two women strangled ive got that much youre primary on both i hear there was sexual molestation will you confirm the department will not confirm or deny at this time rape and sodomy no comment damn it why the hardball i dont have any breathing room right now im trying to stop a killer nadine and i just cant be too worried about the ratings for channel i thought we were friends i guess we are and because of that when ive got something to give youll get it nadines eyes brightened first exclusive dont keep tying up my link a oneonone dallas let me set it up i can be at cop central by one no ill let you know when and where but i dont have time for you today and time eve thought was the biggest factor no one she knew researched as fast or as deep as nadine furst youre not seeing anybody in particular these days are you nadine seeing anyone as in dating or sleeping with no not in particular ever try one of those dating services please nadines eyelashes fluttered as she lifted her hand to examine her manicure i think i can find my own men just a thought i hear theyre popular eve paused and watched nadines eyes narrow and glitter you might want to give it a try yeah i might do that thanks gotta run im on in five one thing do i have to buy you a christmas present nadines brows went up her lips curved in a wide smile absolutely damn i was afraid of that frowning eve broke transmission and steered into the garage at cop central on the way to whitneys office she snagged an energy bar and a tube of extrazing coke from a vending machine she wolfed down the bar chugged the soft drink and as a result stepped into whitneys office feeling slightly ill status lieutenant i have mcnab from edd working with my aide at my home office commander we have the lists from personally yours for each victim were hoping to get a match were still working on the jewelry he left with the victims and have the brand and projected source for the enhancements he used he nodded whitney was a powerfully built man with a smooth dark complexion and tired eyes through the window at his back eve could see the city the constant flow of air traffic around the spears of buildings people moving around offices behind other windows she knew if you stepped up to that window you could look down and see the street below all the people rushing to or away all the lives that needed protecting as always she thought she preferred her cramped office and limited view do you know how many tourists and outofstate consumers come into the city in the weeks before christmas no sir the mayor gave me the estimated number this morning when he called to inform me the city couldnt afford a serial killer scaring away holiday dollars his smile was thin and humorless he didnt seem at that point to be overly concerned with residents of the city being raped and strangled but with the distressing side effects such events could cause if the media plays the santa killer angle the media isnt aware of that angle at this time how long before it leaks whitney leaned back kept his eyes level and on eves maybe a couple of days channel has already been tipped that theyre sexual homicides but their data is patchy at this point lets see if we can keep it that way how long before he hits again tonight tomorrow at the latest no way to stop it she thought and saw by whitneys face he understood the dating service is the only connection youve got yes sir at this time theres no indication that the victims knew each other they lived in different parts of the city moved in widely different circles they werent of a type physically she paused waiting but whitney said nothing im going to consult with mira eve continued but in my opinion hes already established a pattern and a goal he wants twelve on or before the end of the year thats less than two weeks so he has to move quickly so do you yes sir the source of his victims has to be personally yours weve tagged the cosmetics used on the victims sources of purchase for them in the city are fairly limited we have the pins he left at both sites then she exhaled he knew we could trace the cosmetics he left the pins deliberately he feels secure that his tracks are covered if we dont find a match within the next twentyfour hours our best defense might be the media and tell them what if you spot a fat man in a red suit call a cop he pushed back from his desk find a match lieutenant i dont want twelve bodies under my tree this christmas eve pulled out her communicator as she left whitneys office mcnab make me happy im doing my best lieutenant he gestured with what appeared to be a slice of pineapple pizza ive pretty well eliminated the exhusband of the first victim he was at an arena ball match with three friends on the night of the murder peabodys going to check on the three pals but it looks solid no transpo to new york was issued under his name he hasnt been to the east coast in over two years one down eve said as she hopped a glide give me more none of the names on hawleys list match any on greenbalms but im checking finger and voiceprints to make sure nobody tried to pull a fast one there good thinking and two on hawleys list look clear so far need to follow up but theyre alibied im just going into greenbalms now run the names on the cosmetics first she dragged a hand through her hair as she stepped off the glide and squeezed into an elevator i should be back within two hours she got off the elevator crossed a small lobby area and entered miras offices there was no one at the reception desk and miras door stood open poking her head in eve saw mira reviewing a case file on video and nibbling on a thin sandwich it wasnt often she caught mira unaware eve mused mira was a woman who saw almost everything too much eve often thought when it came to herself she wasnt sure what had caused the bond to form between them she respected miras abilities though they sometimes made her uncomfortable mira was a small cleanly built woman with soft sable hair waving elegantly around a cool attractive face she habitually wore slim suits in quiet colors eve supposed that mira represented all she eve thought a lady should be selfcontained quietly elegant well spoken dealing with mental defectives violent tendencies and habitual perverts never seemed to ruffle miras composure or her compassion her profiles of madmen and murderers were invaluable to the new york police and security department eve hesitated at the door just long enough for mira to sense her the psychiatrist turned her head and her blue eyes warmed when they met eves i didnt mean to interrupt your assistant isnt at her station shes at lunch come in close the door i was expecting you eve glanced at the sandwich im cutting into your break cops and doctors we take our breaks where we find them would you like something to eat no thanks the energy bar wasnt sitting well in her stomach which made her wonder just how long it had been since the vending machine had been serviced despite eves refusal mira rose and ordered tea from the autochef it was a ritual eve had learned to live with shed sip the faintly floraltasting brew but she didnt have to like it ive reviewed the data you were able to transmit and the copies of your case reports ill have a complete and written profile for you tomorrow what can you give me today probably little you havent gleaned for yourself mira settled back in one of the blue scoop chairs similar to those in simons salon eves face she noted was a bit too pale a bit too thin mira hadnt seen her since eves return to duty and her doctors eye diagnosed that the return had been rushed but she kept that opinion to herself the person youre looking for is likely a male between the ages of thirty and fiftyfive she began hes controlled calculating and organized he enjoys the spotlight and feels he deserves to be the focus of attention he may have had some aspirations toward acting or a connection to the field he showed off for the camera played to it exactly mira nodded pleased he employed costumes and props and not just in my opinion as tools and disguises but for the flair of it and the irony i wonder if he sees his cruelty as irony she took a breath shifted her legs and sipped at her tea if shed believed eve would actually drink the cup shed given her mira would have added some vitamins to it its possible its a stage a show he enjoys that aspect very much the preparation the details hes a coward but a careful one theyre all cowards eve stated and had mira tilting her head yes you would see it that way because to you the taking of a life is only justifiable in defense of another for you murder is the ultimate cowardice but in this case i would say he recognizes his own fears he drugs his victims quickly not to save them pain but to prevent them from fighting and perhaps overcoming him physically he needs to set the stage he puts them in bed restrains them before cutting off their clothes he doesnt strip them in a rage and he makes certain theyre bound before he goes to the next step now theyre helpless now theyre his then he rapes them yes when theyre bound naked and helpless if they were free they would reject him he knows this hes been rejected but now he can do as he wishes he needs them awake and aware for this so that they can see him so they know he has the power so they struggle but cant escape the words the images had eves already uneasy stomach pitching memories danced too close to the surface rapes always about power yes because she understood mira wanted to reach out and take eves hand and because she understood she didnt he strangles them because its personal an extension of the sexual act hands to the throat its intimate mira smiled a little how much of this had you already concluded doesnt matter youre confirming my take on him all right then the garland is trimming props again show irony theyre gifts from himself to himself the christmas theme may have some personal meaning to him or it may simply be the symbolism what about the destruction of marianna hawleys tree and ornaments when mira only cocked a brow eve shrugged breaking the symbol of the holiday in the tree the eradication of purity in the angel ornaments it would suit him the pins and tattoos hes a romantic a romantic yes hes very much the romantic he brands them as his love he leaves them a token and he takes the time and the trouble to make them beautiful before he leaves them anything less than that would make them an unworthy gift did he know them yes i would say he did whether they knew him is another matter but he knew them hed observed them hed chosen them and for the length of time he had them they were his true love he doesnt mutilate she added leaning forward he decorates enhances artistically perhaps even lovingly but when he is finished he is done he sprays the body with disinfectant erasing himself he washes scrubs erasing them from him and when he leaves he is jubilant hes won and its time to prepare for the next hawley and greenbalm were nothing alike physically nor in their lifestyles their habits or their work but they had one thing in common mira put in they were both at one time lonely enough needy enough interested enough to pay for help in finding a companion their true love eve set her untouched tea aside thanks i hope youre well aware that eve was braced to rise and leave mira stalled fully recovered from your injuries im fine no mira thought not quite fine you only took what two or three weeks off to recover from serious injuries im better off working yes i know you think so mira smiled again are you ready for the holidays eve didnt squirm in her chair but she wanted to ive picked up a couple of presents it must be difficult finding something for roarke youre telling me im sure youll find something perfect no one knows him better than you sometimes i do sometimes i dont and because it was in the back of her mind she spoke without thinking hes getting into all this christmas stuff parties and trees i just figured wed hand each other something and be done with it neither of you have the memories of childhood everyones entitled to of anticipation and wonder of christmas mornings with pretty boxes stacked under the tree id say roarke intends to start making those memories for the two of you knowing him she added with a laugh they wont be ordinary i think hes ordered a small forest of trees give yourself a chance at that anticipation and wonder as a gift for both of you with roarke you dont have a choice she did stand now i appreciate the time dr mira one last thing eve mira got to her feet as well hes not dangerous at this point to anyone other than the person hes focused on he wont kill indiscriminately or without purpose and planning but i cant say when that might change or what might trigger a shift in pattern ive got some thoughts on that ill be in touch o o peabody and mcnab were bickering when she walked into her home office they sat side by side at her workstation snarling at each other like a couple of bulldogs over the same bone ordinarily it might have amused eve but at the moment it was only one more irritation break it up she snapped and had both of them shooting to attention with grim resentful faces report when they both began to talk at once she seethed for approximately five seconds then bared her teeth that shut both of them up peabody risking one smug sidelong glance at her nemesis peabody began we have three matches with the cosmetics two from hawleys list and one from greenbalms one from each bought the works from skin care to lash dye the second from hawleys purchased eye and brow pencils and two lip dyes we got a hit on what was used on greenbalms mouth thats cupids coral all three purchased that shade problem mcnab lifted a finger like an instructor halting an overzealous student both cupid coral lip dye and musk brown lash enhancer are routinely given as samples in fact he gestured to the counter where the samples eve had been given were lined up you have both here we cant track every stupid sample peabody said with a dangerous edge to her voice we have three names and a place to start the fog over london eye smudger used on hawley is one of the pricier products and it isnt given out as a sample you only get it as a separate or when you buy the whole shot in the deluxe package we follow the smudger well be closer to the mark and maybe the son of a bitch lifted the smudger when he was buying the rest of the stuff peabody turned on mcnab you want to track every shoplifter in the city now its the only product we cant trace so far so its the one we have to find they were nose to nose when eve stepped forward and gave them both a shove the next one who speaks im taking down youre both right we interview the matches and we look for the eye gunk peabody get the names go down to my vehicle and wait for me peabody didnt have to speak not when a ramrodstiff spine and hot eyes could say volumes the minute she stalked out mcnab shoved his hands in his pockets but when he opened his mouth he caught the warning glint eve shot him and closed it again you run personally yours again client and personnel find who on there bought that smudger and see how many more of the products used on the victims you can match she lifted her eyebrows say yes sir lieutenant dallas he heaved a sigh yes sir lieutenant dallas good while youre at it mcnab see if you can wiggle into piper and rudys credit account lets find out what brand of enhancements they use she waited brows still high one thing mcnab wasnt was slow yes sir lieutenant dallas and stop pouting she ordered as she strode out females mcnab muttered under his breath then caught a movement out of the corner of his eye he spotted roarke standing in the open doorway between the offices grinning at him marvelous creatures arent they roarke stepped in not from where im standing ah but youll be a hero wont you if you can match your product with the right name he strolled over scanned the lists and documents that they both knew were official business and none of his i find i have an hour or two free want some help well i mcnab glanced toward the door dont worry about the lieutenant roarke pleased himself and sat at the computer i can handle her o o donnie ray michael wore a ratty brown bathrobe and a silver nose ring with an emerald cabochon his eyes were a bleary hazel his hair the color of butter and his breath ferocious he studied eves badge expelling air in a yawn that nearly knocked her flat then scratched his armpit what donnie ray got a minute yeah i got plenty of minutes but what ill tell you after we come in and you gargle with a gallon or two of mouthwash oh he went slightly pink and stepped back i was asleep wasnt expecting visitors or cops but he waved them inside then disappeared down a short hallway the place was as tidy as your average pigsty with clothes empty and halfempty takeout containers overflowing ashtrays and a litter of computer discs strewn over the floor in the corner beside a threadbare sofa was a music stand and a brightly polished saxophone eve caught a drift in the air of very old onions and the shadow of an illegal usually consumed by smoking if we decide a search is in order eve told peabody weve got probable cause what suspicion of toxic waste theres that eve toed what might have been underwear aside hes been pumping zoner probably as a bedtime soother you can just smell it peabody sniffed i just smell sweat and onions its there donnie ray walked back in his eyes slightly clearer his face red and damp from a quick splash sorry about the mess droids year off whats this about do you know marianna hawley marianna his brow wrinkled in thought i dunno should i you matched with her through personally yours oh the dating gig he kicked clothes out of the way then dropped into a chair yeah i gave that a shot a few months back i was in a drought he smiled a little then shrugged marianna was she a big redhead no that was tanya we hit it off pretty well but she moved to albuquerque for christs sake i mean what rocks there marianna donnie ray slim brunette green eyes yeah yeah now i get her sweet we didnt click too much like well a sister she came to the club where i was blowing and heard me we had a couple of drinks so you ever watch the screen read the paper not when ive got a steady gig im booked with a group downtown at the empire been doing the tentofour slot for the last three weeks seven nights on no five you blow seven nights you lose the edge how about tuesday night im off tuesday mondays and tuesdays are clear his eyes were focused now and just beginning to go wary whats the deal marianna hawley was murdered tuesday night you got an alibi for tuesday from nine to midnight oh shit shit murdered jesus h he sprang up stumbling over debris as he paced man that bites she was a sweetheart did you want her to be your sweetheart your true love he stopped pacing eve found it interesting that he didnt look frightened or angry he looked sorry look i had a couple of drinks with her one night a little talk tried to convince her to take a harmless roll but she wasnt into it i liked her you couldnt help but like her he pushed his fingers against his eyes then ran them back into his hair again that was hell six months ago maybe more i havent seen her since what happened to her tuesday night donnie ray tuesday he rubbed his hands over his face i dont know hell who remembers i probably did a few clubs some hanging lemme think a minute he closed his eyes blew out a couple of breaths tuesday i went down to crazy charlies and heard this new band did you go with anybody a few of us started out together i dont know who ended up at crazys i was pretty wasted by then tell me donnie ray what did you buy the full product line of natural perfection for you dont look like the type to paint up what he looked baffled then dropped into the chair again what the hell is natural perfection you ought to know you spent over two thousand on the line cosmetics donnie ray enhancements cosmetics he shoved his hands through his hair until it stood up in buttery spikes oh shit yeah the jazzy stuff my mothers birthday i bought her the works you spent two large on your mothers birthday with doubt obvious in her eyes eve glanced around the cramped messy room my mothers the best the old man ditched us when i was a kid she worked like three dogs to keep a roof over my head and to pay for music lessons he nodded toward the sax i make good money blowing fucking good now im helping to pay for the roof over her head in connecticut a decent house in a decent neighborhood this he gestured to encompass the room it dont matter a damn to me im hardly here except to flake out how about i call your mother right now and ask her what her boy donnie ray gave her for her last birthday sure without hesitation he jerked a thumb toward the link on a table by the wall her numbers programmed just do me a favor okay dont tell her youre a cop she worries say youre doing a survey or something peabody ditch the uniform jacket and call donnie rays mom eve moved out of transmission range and sat on the arm of a chair rudy at personally yours do your profile no well i talked to him first i got the feeling everybody does like an audition then some joker did the consult what do you like to do for entertainment what do you dream about whats your favorite color you take a physical too to make sure youre clean they didnt turn up traces of zoner he had the grace to look abashed no i was clean i bet your mother would want you to stay that way ms michael received a complete line of natural perfection cosmetics and enhancers from her son on her birthday peabody shrugged back into her uniform jacket then gave donnie ray a smile she was really happy with the gift shes pretty isnt she yes she is shes the best thats what she said about you peabody told him i got her diamond earrings for christmas well theyre really just chips but shed get a large charge he was eyeing peabody with interest now having seen her without the stiff jacket you ever get down to the empire not yet you ought to drop in we really blow maybe i will but she caught eves owlish look and cleared her throat thank you for your cooperation mr michael do your mother a favor eve said as they headed for the door shovel out this garbage heap and lay off the zoner yeah sure and donnie ray gave peabody a suggestive wink before he closed the door its unseemly to flirt with suspects officer peabody hes not really a suspect peabody glanced over her shoulder and he was really cute hes a suspect until we confirm his alibi and hes a pig but a really cute pig sir weve got two more interviews to conduct peabody try to control your hormones i do dallas i do she sighed as she climbed back into the car but its so nice when they control me chapter seven spending most of the day doing interviews without making a crack in a case didnt put eve in the best of moods finding mcnab packed and gone when she returned to her home office darkened her mood a bit more she considered it fortunate for his future wellbeing that hed left her a memo and a nibble lieutenant logged off at sixteen fortyfive list of names and products under case file subhead e for evidence twoa couple of pops might interest you i got hits on both piper and rudy on the smudger another on piper for the lip dye by the way the two of them are rolling in credits not that theyd give roarke a run but they arent hurting interesting too all their assets are held jointly down to the last penny report also in file all their assets held jointly eve mused her impression had been that rudy manned the business end of things it had always been rudy whod made the decisions gone to the console when shed been there it followed that he handled the money too he had the control eve decided he had the power and the opportunity the access one other hit on smudger mcnabs voice continued two on lip dye with charles monroe popping on both missed him first pass because he put another name on the credit slip for the mailing list of new products and specials profile on monroe included eve frowned as the memo ended her instincts might have been steering her toward rudy but it looked as though she was going to pay charles monroe a visit glancing over she saw the light over the door that adjoined roarkes office was on if he was busy it was as good a time as any to check on a more personal matter she moved quietly using the stairs rather than the elevator keeping an eye out for summerset as she lengthened her strides toward the library the walls of the twolevel room were lined with books it always baffled her that a man who could buy a small planet at the snap of a finger preferred the weight and bulk of a book rather than the convenience of reading on screen one of his quirks she supposed though she could appreciate the rich smell of leather from the bindings the glossy look of the spines as they marched along the dark mahogany shelves there were two generous seating areas more leather in the woodtrimmed deep burgundy sofas and chairs jewels of colors on glass lamp shades the sheen of brass the shine of old wood in cabinets deeply carved by craftsmen from another century drapes were open to the night around a wide window seat dressed with thick pillows in tones that picked up the multihues of the lamps enormous and ancient rugs with intricate patterns over a redwine background stretched over the wide and polished chestnut planks of the floor she knew a fullrange multitask computer system was hidden behind the antique cabinet but everything in view in the room spoke of age and wealth and a taste for both she didnt come here often but she knew roarke did she might find him sitting in one of the leather chairs in the evening his long legs stretched out a brandy by his elbow and a book in his hands reading relaxed him hed told her and she knew it was a skill hed taught himself as a boy in the slums of dublin when hed found a tattered copy of yeats in an alley she crossed to the cabinet and opened the doors rich with inlays of lapis and malachite engage she ordered and cast a cautious glance over her shoulder search library all sections for yeats yeats elizabeth yeats william butler her brows came together her hand scooped through her hair how the hell do i know its some irish poet yeats william butler confirmed searching stacks the wanderings of oisin section d shelf five the countess of cathleen section d wait she pinched the bridge of her nose shift search tell me what books by this guy arent in the library adjusting searching he probably had every damn thing anyway stupid idea she decided and jammed her hands in her pockets lieutenant and nearly jumped out of her boots she whirled around and stared at summerset what damn it i hate when you do that he merely continued to eye her blandly he knew she hated when he came up on her unawares it was one of the reasons he so enjoyed doing it may i help you find a book though i didnt realize you read anything but reports and the occasional disc on aberrant behavior look pal ive got a perfect right to be in here which didnt explain why being found in the library made her feel like a sneak and i dont need your help all works by subject author yeats william butler are included in library do you require locations and titles no damn it i knew it yeats lieutenant curious summerset moved into the room closely followed by galahad who padded over to eve scissored between her legs then deserted her to leap onto the window seat and stare out at the night as if he owned it so what he only raised his eyebrows was there a play you were interested in a collection a particular poem what are you the library police these books are quite valuable he said coolly many are first editions and quite rare youll find all of yeatss work in the disc library as well that method im sure would suit you better i dont want to read the damn thing i just wanted to see if there was something he didnt have which is stupid because he has every damn thing so what the hell am i supposed to do about what christmas you moron incensed she turned back to the computer disengage summerset pursed his lips and followed the train of thought you wished to purchase a volume of yeats for roarke as a christmas gift that was the idea which turns out to suck lieutenant he said as she started to storm out what it annoyed him when she did or said something that touched him but it couldnt be helped and he owed her for risking nearly losing her life to save his that simple fact summerset knew made them both uncomfortable perhaps he could even the scales by a small weight he does not own as yet a first edition copy of the celtic twilight the mutinous glare faded though some suspicion remained what is it its a prose collection by this yeats guy yes a part of her a small nasty part wanted to shrug and walk away but she jammed her hands in her pockets and stuck the search said he had everything he owns the book but not in a first edition yeats is particularly important to roarke i imagine you know that i have a connection to a rare book dealer in dublin i could contact him and see if it can be acquired bought eve said firmly not stolen she smiled thinly when summersets spine snapped stiff i know something about your connections we keep it legal i never intended otherwise but it wont come cheap it was his turn to smile just as thinly and there will no doubt be a charge for securing the acquisition in time for christmas as youve waited until the eleventh hour she didnt wince but she wanted to if your connection can find it i want it then because she couldnt figure a way around it she shrugged thanks he nodded stiffly and waited until shed left the room before he grinned this eve thought was what being in love did to you it made you have to cooperate with the biggest annoyance in your life and she thought sourly as she took the elevator to the bedroom if the skinny son of a bitch actually pulled it off she was going to owe him it was mortifying then the elevator doors opened and there was roarke with a half smile on his lost angel face his eyes impossibly blue with pleasure what was a little mortification i didnt know you were home yet yeah i was doing stuff she cocked her head she knew that look why are you looking so smug he took her hand drew her into the room what do you think he asked and gestured centered in the deeply recessed window on the far side of the raised platform that held their bed was a tree its boughs fanned out into the room and rose up and up until the tip all but speared the ceiling she blinked at it its big obviously you havent seen the one in the living area its twice this tall cautious she moved closer it had to be ten feet if it toppled she mused while they were sleeping it would drop like a stone on the bed and pin them like ants i hope its secure she sniffed smells like a forest in here i guess were going to hang stuff on it thats the plan he slipped his arms around her waist drew her back against him ill deal with the lights later you will its a mans job he told her and nipped at her neck who says women throughout the ages who were sensible enough not to want to deal with it are you off duty lieutenant i thought id get some food then run a few probability scans his mouth was cruising up to her earlobe she thought he could do the most interesting things to an earlobe and i want to see if mira sent through her profile her eyes were already half shut as she angled her head to give him fuller access to the side of her neck when his hands slid up to cup her breasts her mind went wonderfully foggy then ive got a report to write and file his thumbs flicked over her nipples and sent a spear of heat lancing straight to her gut but i probably have an hour to spare she muttered and turning she fisted her hands in his hair and pulled his mouth to hers a sound of pleasure hummed in his throat and his hands glided down her back come with me where he bit her bottom lip wherever i take you circling her he guided her back into the elevator holoroom he ordered then backed her into the corner and cut off her question with one long mindnumbing kiss something wrong with the bedroom she asked when she could breathe again i have something else in mind keeping his eyes on hers he drew her out engage program the large empty room with its stark black mirrored walls shimmered shifted she smelled smoke first fragrant faintly fruity then the tang of some spicy scented flower the lights dimmed and wavered images formed a crackling fire in a big stone hearth a window wide as a lake with a view of steelblue mountains and deep feathery snow that gleamed icily in the moonlight urns of hammered copper filled to bursting with flowers in whites and rusty hues candles hundreds of candles white as the snow burning with flickering flames out of polished brass holders under her feet the mirrored floor became wood dark nearly black with a dull sheen dominating the room was an enormous bed with head and footboards fashioned of complicated curves and loops of thin sparkling brass spread over it was a cover of dull gold that looked thick enough to drown in and dozens of pillows in shades of precious gems scattered over all were white rose petals wow she looked toward the window again the view those towering peaks the miles of white did something odd to her throat what are those a simulation of the swiss alps one of his greatest delights was watching her reaction to something new the initial wariness that was the cop the slow bloom of pleasure that came from the woman ive never managed to take you there in reality a holographic chalet is the next best thing turning he picked up a robe that was draped over a chair why dont you put this on she reached for it frowned what is it a robe she shot him a bland look i know that i meant whats it made of is this mink sable he stepped forward why dont i help you youre in a mood arent you she murmured as he began unbuttoning her shirt his hands skimmed over her bare shoulders as he brushed the shirt aside it seems i am in a mood to seduce my wife slowly need was already kindling spreading i dont need seduction roarke he laid his lips on her shoulder i do sit he nudged her down so he could tug off her boots then bracing his hands on the arms of the chair he leaned over and took her mouth again just mouth to mouth warm and soft a skillfully tender sliding of lips and tongue a cleverly gentle scrape of teeth her muscles quivered then went lax feeling her surrender was his own seduction drawing her to her feet he unhooked her trousers the wanting of you never stops his fingers skimmed over her hips the trousers pooled at her feet the loving of you never peaks theres always more undone she leaned against him her face buried in his hair nothings the same for me since you he held her a moment for the simple pleasure of it then reaching down he lifted the robe and draped the soft pelt over her shoulders for either of us he picked her up and carried her to the bed and her arms reached out for him she knew what it would be like overwhelming unsettling glorious shed come to crave each separate sensation he could bring her to crave the feel of him against her the way she did air or water without thinking of it and unable to survive without it there was nothing she couldnt give or take when their bodies came together sunk deep in the feather bed she met his mouth eagerly reveling in the slow burn of her blood sighing she tugged at his shirt helping him shrug it aside so flesh could meet flesh the long and lovely slide of it a slow roll a low moan the silk of the petals the satin of the spread the ripple of muscle under her hands all tangled together in an exotic mix of textures the quick bounding leap of the heart a delicious shiver a soft sigh the flicker of candlelight the spill of the moon the shifting shimmer from the fire melded into one sumptuous glow she tasted and was tasted she touched and was touched aroused and was aroused and trembled her way up the long curve of a peak as smooth as polished silver he felt her rise up shudder then slide lazily down again their limbs tangled as they rolled over the bed to touch again to adjust the fit of bodies he could see the lights flicker over her face her hair in her eyes the rich brandy of them eyes he could watch go glassy as he nudged her inch by inch toward that peak again her hands strong capable and beautifully familiar moved over him a grip a caress quiet sounds of pleasure hummed in her throat sighed into his mouth whispered over his skin his breath began to quicken and need became a thunder in the blood warmth turned to heat and heat to a dangerous flash then she was rising over him her body slim and silvered in the shift of light and shadow her moan was long a throaty sound of greed as she lowered to him enclosed him took him in when his fingers dug into her hips she arched back into a gleaming curve rocking rocking with her eyes golden brown slits her breath rushing between parted lips she tightened around him when the orgasm slashed through her then curled into him when he reared up when his mouth fixed hungrily on her breast lost now captured he pushed her back so both her mind and body went spinning and he drove into her one wild animal thrust after another with a sudden pounding greed that ripped her past control her fingers wrapped around the thin curving tubes of the headboard gripping hard as if to anchor herself a scream of mindless pleasure strangling in her throat as he pushed her knees back to go deeper when her body erupted beneath him his mouth swooped down to hers and he let himself go she was covered with rose petals and nothing else those slim disciplined muscles were as lax as the melted candlewax pooled fragrantly beneath the white tapers as her breathing slowed to normal roarke nibbled at her shoulder then he rose to get the robe and draped it over her her response was a grunt both amused and pleased that that was the best she could do he moved to the far corner of the room and ordered the jet tub to fill at one hundred and one degrees he popped the cork on a bottle of champagne set it back in its bucket of ice then snatched his limp wife off the bed i wasnt asleep she said it quickly and with the slurred tone that told him thats just what shed been youll blame me in the morning if i let you sleep and you dont do your probability scan with this he dumped her in the hot frothing water she yelped once then moaned in sheer sensual delight oh god i want to live here right here in this tub for about a week arrange for some time off and well go to the alps for real and you can soak in a tub until you turn into one big pink wrinkle it was exactly what he wanted to take her away to see that she was completely healed and recovered and he imagined he had as much chance of doing so as he had of convincing her to kiss summerset on the mouth the image of that even made him grin joke she asked lazily oh it would be a delightful one he handed her a flute and taking his own climbed in to join her i have to get to work i know he let out a long breath ten minutes the combination of hot water and icy champagne was just too good to refuse you know before you my breaks used to consist of a cup of bad coffee and a a cup of bad coffee she decided i know and they still do entirely too often this he said and sank a little deeper is a much superior way to recharge hard to argue she lifted her leg examined her toes for no particular reason i dont think hes going to give me much time roarke hes working on a deadline how much do you have not enough not nearly enough youll get more ive never known a better cop and ive known more than my share she frowned into her wine its not out of rage not yet its not for profit its not that i can find for revenge hed be easier to track if i had a motive love true love she cursed softly my true love but you cant have twelve true loves youre being rational youre thinking a man cant love more than one women with equal degrees of fervor but he can sure if his heart is in his dick with a laugh roarke opened one eye darling eve its often impossible to separate the two for some he added mistrusting the quick glint in her eye physical attraction most usually proceeds the finer emotions what you may not be considering is that he might very well believe each of them the love of his life and if they didnt agree the only way he can convince them is to take their lives i have considered it but it isnt enough to give me a full picture he loves what he cant have and what he cant have he destroys she jerked her shoulder i hate all the goddamn symbolism it muddles things up you have to give him points for theatrical flare yeah and im counting on that to be what trips him up when it does im tossing jolly old st nick in a cage times up she announced and rose out of the water shed just flicked a towel from a heated bar when she heard the muffled beep on her communicator shit dripping she dashed across the room to snatch up her trousers and pull it from the pocket block video she muttered dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve das at houston apartment e report to scene immediately as primary dispatch she dragged a hand through her damp hair acknowledged contact peabody officer delia as adjutant affirmative dispatch out das roarke picked up the robe to drape it over her again dead at scene she heaved the towel aside and bending tugged on the trousers damn it goddamn it thats donnie rays apartment i just interviewed him today o o donnie ray had loved his mother that was the first thing eve thought of as she looked at him he was on the bed draped in green garland that sparkled with gold flecks his buttery hair had been carefully styled to flow against the pillow his eyes were shut so that lashes lengthened and dyed a deep antique gold lay against his cheeks his lips matched the tone perfectly around his right wrist just over the raw and broken skin was a thick bracelet with three pretty birds etched into hammered gold three calling birds peabody said from behind her shit dallas he changed sexes but hes keeping to pattern eves voice was flat as she shifted aside so that the body would be in full view for the record theres bound to be a tattoo on him and probable signs of sexual abuse ligature marks hands and feet as with previous victims we need any security discs from the hallway and the outer building he was a nice guy peabody murmured now hes a dead guy lets do the job peabody stiffened the slightest of movements that had her shoulders going straight as a ruler yes sir they found the tattoo on his left buttock if that and the clear signs of sodomy affected her eve didnt let it show she did the preliminary had the scene secured ordered the initial doortodoors and had the body bagged for transport well check his link she told peabody get his date book any data you can find on personally yours i want the sweepers in here tonight she moved down the short hall to the bathroom pushed the door open walls floor and fixtures sparkled like the sun we can assume our man cleaned this donnie ray wasnt too concerned about cleanliness being next to godliness he didnt deserve to die this way nobody deserves to die this way eve stepped back turned you liked him so did i now put it away because it doesnt do a damn thing for him now hes gone and we have to use what we find here to help us get to number four before we lose another i know that but i cant help feeling jesus dallas we were in here joking with him a few hours ago i cant help feeling she repeated in a furious whisper im not like you you think he gives a damn what you feel now he wants justice not grief not even pity she marched into the living area kicking away scattered cups and shoes to vent a little of her frustration do you think he cares that im pissed off she whirled back eyes blazing being pissed off doesnt do anything for him and it clouds my judgment what am i missing what the hell am i missing he leaves it all here in front of my face the son of a bitch peabody said nothing for a moment it wasnt she thought the first time shed mistaken eves cool professionalism for a lack of heart after all the months theyd worked together she realized she should know better she drew a deep breath maybe hes giving us too much and its scattering our focus eves eyes narrowed and the fists shed jammed in her pockets relaxed thats good thats very good too many angles too much data we need to pick a channel and zoom in start the search here peabody she ordered as she pulled out her communicator its going to be a long night o o she stumbled home at four am riding on the highoctane lowquality faux caffeine of cop central coffee her eyes felt sticky her stomach raw but she thought her mind was still sharp enough to do the job still she jerked and had a hand on her weapon when roarke came into her home office a few paces behind her what the hell are you doing up she demanded i might ask the same lieutenant im working he lifted a brow and took her chin in his hand to study her face overworking he corrected i ran out of real coffee in my autochef had to drink that sewage they brew at central a couple of hits of the good stuff and ill be fine a couple of hours unconscious youll be better though it was tempting she didnt shove his hand away ive got a meeting at oh eight hundred i have to prep eve he shot her a warning glance when she hissed at him then calmly laid his hands on her shoulders im not going to interfere with your work but i will remind you that you wont do your job well if youre asleep on your feet i can take a booster you and he smiled when he said it making her lips twitch i may have to hit the departmentalapproved drugs before its over hes not giving me any time roarke let me help i cant use you every time it gets tough why his hands began to knead the tension out of her shoulders because im not on the departmentalapproved list that would be one the shoulder massage was relaxing her a bit too much she felt her mind drift and wasnt able to snap it back to clarity again ill take two hours downtime two hours to prep should be enough but ill crash in here good idea it was simple enough to guide her to the sleep chair her bones were like rubber he slipped down with her ordered the chair to full recline you should go to bed she murmured but turned her body into his i prefer sleeping with my wife when the opportunity arises two hours i think i have an angle two hours he agreed and shut his eyes when he felt her go limp chapter eight theres something i should tell you roarke waited until eve scooped up the last of an eggwhite omelette and smiled at her as he topped off her coffee about the natural perfection beauty products she only stared at him as she swallowed you own the company its a line of a company thats part of an organization thats a branch of roarke industries he smiled again as he sipped his coffee so in a word yes i already knew it she jerked a shoulder gaining some satisfaction at seeing his eyebrows lift at her careless reaction i actually thought i might get through a case without you being connected you really have to get over that darling and since i do own it he continued as she bared her teeth at him i should be able to help you track the products used on the victims were stumbling along there on our own she pushed away from the little table and paced to her desk logically the products were purchased at the location where the victims were chosen going on that assumption i can whittle down the choices to a short list those enhancements are obscenely expensive you get what you pay for roarke said easily lip dye at two hundred credits a tube for christs sake she shot him a narroweyed glance you ought to be ashamed of yourself i dont set the price now he grinned at her i just manage the profit a couple of hours of sleep and a hot meal had recharged her he noted she wasnt pale now or quite so heavyeyed he rose walking to her to skim his thumbs over the faint shadows under her eyes would you like to sit in on a board meeting and lobby for a price adjustment ha ha when he brushed his lips over hers she struggled to keep her own from curving go away i need to focus in a minute he kissed her again nudging a sigh out of her why dont you tell me about it itll help you to think out loud she sighed again leaned for a moment then drew back theres an ugliness to this because hes using something that symbolizes hope and innocence this kid last night damn it he was harmless the others were women what does it tell you that hes bisexual that his idea of true love crosses genders the male victim was raped just as the women were bound like them marked like them and painted up like them after hed finished she moved away idly picking up her coffee to drink hes getting them from personally yours obviously scanning their videos and personal data he might have dated the women but not donnie ray donnie was straight hetero the shift makes me think he hasnt met any of the victims facetoface at least not in a romantic sense its all fantasy he chooses people who live alone hes a coward doesnt want any real confrontation he tranqs them right off gets them restrained its the only way he can be sure hell have the power the control her thoughts veered back and settled once again on rudy setting the coffee down again she dragged a hand through her hair hes smart and obsessive hes even predictable on several levels thats how ill nail him you said you had an angle yeah a couple of them i have to run them by the brass ive got to dodge nadine for a while i cant give her the santa suit well have people whipping up on every store and street corner santa in the city theres an image roarke murmured serial santa strangles singles details at noon nadine would love that lead shes not getting it not until i dont have a choice im toying with leading the personally yours connection itll keep her off my back and get the word out to anyone whos used the service and rudy and piper will scream harassment her smile spread slow and wicked it would be worth it couple of protocol droids i need to shake them up you dont like them they give me the creeps i know theyre fucking each other sick you dont approve theyre brother and sister twins oh i see however worldly he was roarke found himself mirroring his wifes reaction thats very unattractive yeah the thought of it ruined her appetite and had her pushing the plate of flaky croissants aside hes running the show and her right now hes top of my list he has access to every client file and if i can confirm the incest we add a bent toward deviant sexual behavior i need someone inside she drew a deep breath as she heard bootsteps marching down the hallway and there she is now both eve and roarke turned as peabody stepped into the doorway she looked from one to the other rolled her shoulders as if shrugging off something vaguely uncomfortable something wrong no come in eve jerked a thumb toward a chair lets get started coffee roarke offered hed already figured out what eve had in mind for her aide yeah thanks mcnab isnt here yet no ill brief you first eve shot roarke a look waited ill just get out of your way he passed peabody a cup turned and kiss his wife despite or perhaps because of the fact that she scowled at him then walked into his adjoining office and shut the door does he always look like that in the morning peabody wanted to know he always looks like that period peabody sighed deeply are you sure hes human not always eve angled a hip on the corner of her desk and studied peabody carefully so want to meet some guys huh want to broaden your social circle meet some men who share similar interests certain eve was joking peabody grinned isnt that why i became a cop cops make lousy life partners what you need peabody is a service like personally yours sipping coffee peabody shook her head nope i did a dating service a few years back right after i moved into the city too regimented i like picking up strange men in bars when eve only continued to stare at her peabody slowly lowered her cup oh she said as realization struck oh id have to clear it with whitney i cant put a uniform undercover without the commanders okay and before you agree i want you to know just what youd be getting into undercover despite the fact that she had been a cop long enough to know better the phrase conjured up images of excitement and glamour get the stars out of your eyes peabody christ eve straightened scooped both hands through her hair im talking about putting your ass on the line here using you as bait and youre grinning like ive just given you a present you think im good enough for it you trust me to handle it thats a pretty good present i think youre good enough eve said dropping her arms i think you can handle it because you know how to follow orders exactly and thats what id expect following orders to the letter no grandstanding if i get it cleared and if i can get the fucking budget to stretch enough for the consultant fee for that place youll go in what about rudy and piper theyre not off the suspect list and theyve seen me they saw a uniform people like that dont pay attention to whos wearing it well get mavis and trina to deck you out cool get a grip peabody well work out a cover an identity ive gone over the victims videos and personal data well cull out the similarities and work them into your profile the idea is to tailor make you thats bullshit mcnab stood in the doorway his face was flushed with a fury that had his eyes glittering his mouth tight and his hands fisted at his side thats fucking bullshit detective eve said mildly your opinion is noted youre going to stick her like a worm on a line and drop her into the pool goddamn it dallas shes not trained for undercover mind your own business peabody snapped as she lunged to her feet i know how to handle myself you dont know squat about undercover mcnab strode forward turning on his heel so that they were nose to nose youre a goddamn aide a button pusher next up from a droid eve saw the intent flash in peabodys eyes and managed to shove between them before her aides fist plowed into mcnabs nose thats enough your opinion is noted mcnab now shut up the son of a bitch isnt going to stand there and call me a droid and get away with it suck it in peabody eve warned and sit down both of you sit the hell down and try to remember whos in charge before i put the pair of you on report the last thing i need on this case is a couple of hotheads if you cant maintain youre off we dont need detective data bank peabody muttered we need what i say we need and we need inside information and bait bait she added shifting her eyes from face to face of both sexes you up for it mcnab wait a minute wait peabody was out of her chair again as rattled as eve had ever seen her you want him to go under too with me yeah im up for it mcnab smiled thinly at peabody as he agreed it would be the perfect way to keep an eye on her and keep her out of trouble o o this is going to be mag mavis freestone danced around eves home office in thighhigh boots the material was clear and snug molding her legs and showing them off while she balanced on their threeinch glittery red heels the heels matched the slither dress that barely met the top of the boots her hair was the exact same glittery christmas red and fell in medusalike coils to her shoulders she had a tiny heart tattoo under the peak of her left eyebrow youre on the departmental payroll eve knew the reminder that this was official business was wasted but she felt obliged to get it in as mavis beamed at peabody out of newly toned grassgreen eyes pays shit this was from trina the beauty consultant circled peabody as a sculptor might with a flawed piece of marble with interest caution and faint derision trina was wearing eyebrow rings today a fact that made eve wince when she looked at the tiny gold hoops pinned to the outer line her hair a deep plum purple was slicked up in a foothigh cone her choice of outfit was a somewhat conservative black jumpsuit with the holiday touch of naked santas dancing over each breast and this eve thought as she pressed her fingers to her eyes this was the pair shed convinced whitney to budget into the case account i want to keep it simple she told them i just dont want her to look like a cop what do you think trina mavis leaned over peabodys shoulder pulling at her own curls so they lay over peabodys cheeks this colord rock on her festive right holiday time and wait till you see the wardrobe i got leonardo to lend us she bounced back grinning theres this peekaboo skinsuit thats really you peabody skinsuit peabody paled thinking of bulges lieutenant simple eve said again ready to desert her aide what do you use on your skin trina demanded taking a firm hold of peabodys chin sandpaper um you got pores like moon craters here girlfriend you need a full facial treatment im starting with a peeler oh god panicked peabody tried to jerk her chin free listen are those tits yours or enhanced mine instantly peabody crossed her arms over her chest and grabbed her own breasts before trina could theyre mine im really happy with them theyre good tits okay strip lets have a look at them and the rest of you strip peabody swiveled her head until her terrified eyes latched onto eves dallas lieutenant sir you said you could handle undercover peabody after one sympathetic shudder eve turned and started out youve got two hours with her i need three trina called out i dont rush my art you got two firmly eve shut the door on peabodys shocked squeak it seemed best all around eve thought if she stayed as far away from what was happening to her aide as possible she decided to pay a visit to an old friend charles monroe was a licensed companion as slick and attractive a prostitute as eve had encountered on or off the force hed once helped her with a case and then offered her his services for free shed taken the help and politely refused the offer now she pressed the buzzer outside his elegant apartment in a highpriced midtown building a building roarke owned she thought with a roll of her eyes when the security beam blinked green she lifted a brow aiming a look at the peephole and holding up her badge in case charles had forgotten her when he opened the door he proved she neednt have worried about his memory lieutenant sugar he caught her off guard with a strong hug and a quick slightly too intimate kiss hands off pal i never got to kiss the bride he winked at her a sleepyeyed handsome man with an elegant face so how do you like being married to the richest man in the universe he keeps me in coffee charles cocked his head studied her youre in love with him all the way well good for you i see the two of you on screen now and then at some glitzy do i wondered how it was with you now i see and i have to assume youre not here to take me up on that offer i made some months back i need to talk to you okay come on in he stepped back gesturing he wore a black unisuit that showed off a very welldisciplined body want a drink i doubt my blend of coffee compares to what roarke can supply how about a tube of pepsi yeah fine she remembered his kitchen neat spartan clean lined a great deal like its tenant she took a seat while he took two tubes out of the cold box and poured each into a tall clear glass he rolled the tubes slipped them into the recycle slot then sat down across from her id drink to old times dallas but they sucked yeah well ive got some new times for you charles they suck too why is a successful lc using a dating service before you answer she continued lifting her glass ill inform you that using such services for professional solicitations is illegal he blushed she wouldnt have believed it possible but his strong handsome face colored painfully and his gaze dropped to his glass jesus do you know everything if i knew everything id know the answer why dont you give it to me its private he muttered i wouldnt be here if it was why have you gone to personally yours for consults because i want a woman in my life he snapped his head came up and now his eyes were dark and angry a real woman not one who buys me all right i want a goddamn relationship whats wrong with that in my line of work they dont happen you do what youre paid to do and you do it well i like my job but i want a personal life theres nothing illegal about wanting a personal life no she said slowly theres not so i lied about what i do on the form he moved his shoulders restlessly i didnt want to match up with the kind of woman whod get some purient thrill out of dating an lc you going to arrest me for lying on a fucking dating video no and she was sorry sincerely to have embarrassed him you matched up with a woman marianna hawley do you remember her marianna he struggled to regain his composure drank deeply of the iced drink i remember her video pretty woman sweet i contacted her but shed already met someone now he smiled shrugged again just my luck she was exactly the type i was looking for you never met her no i went out with the other four from my first match list hit it off with one of them we saw each other off and on for a few weeks he blew out a breath i decided if it was going to go anywhere i had to tell her what i really did and that he finished toasting eve with his glass was the end of that im sorry hey there are more where she came from but his cocky smile didnt reach his eyes too bad roarke took you out of the running charles marianna is dead what havent you caught the news lately no i havent been watching any screen dead then his eyes sharpened focused in on eve murdered you wouldnt be here if shed died quietly in her sleep she was murdered am i a suspect yeah you are she said because she liked him enough to be straight with him im going to want to do a formal interview just to keep it all official but tell me now can you clear yourself for last tuesday night for wednesday and for last night he stared at her for a long time just stared with eyes dull with horror how do you do what you do he demanded day in and day out she met those eyes levelly i could ask you the same thing charles so lets not get into career choices can you alibi he broke the stare pushed away from the table ill get my book she let him go knowing she could trust her gut on this one he wasnt a man who had murder inside him he came back carrying a small elegant date book opening it he plugged in the dates shed asked for tuesday i had an overnight regular client it can be verified last night i had a theater late supper and seduction here the client left at twothirty am got thirty minutes overtime out of it and a handsome tip wednesday i was home alone he slid the book across the table to her take the names check it out she said nothing merely copied the names and addresses into her own book sarabeth greenbalm donnie ray michael she said at length either ring for you no she looked at him then steadily ive never seen you use enhancements why did you purchase lip dye and eye smudger from the natural perfection line at all things beautiful lip dye he looked blank for a moment then shook his head oh i picked them up for the woman i was seeing she asked me to get her a couple of things since i was going into the salon for the styling that came with my package obviously confused he smiled a little and why lieutenant sugar should you care if i buy lip dye just another detail charles you did me a favor once so im doing you one three people who used the services of personally yours are dead killed in the same manner and by the same hand three god in less than a week im not going to give you many details and what i do give cant be passed on to anyone its my opinion that hes using the data from personally yours to select his victims hes killed three women in less than a week no eve leveled her gaze the last victim was a man youre going to want to watch your step charles when he understood the edge of resentment faded you think i could be a target i think anyone in the personally yours data bank could be a target at this point im concentrating on the victims match list im telling you not to let anyone in your apartment you dont know anyone she drew another breath he dresses up like santa claus and carries a large giftwrapped box what he set down the glass hed just lifted is this a joke three people are dead its not very funny he gets them to let him inside he drugs them restrains them and he kills them jesus he rubbed his hands over his face this is bizarre if this guy comes to your door keep it secured and call me stall him if you can let him go if you cant dont under any circumstances open your door hes smart and hes deadly i wont be opening the door the woman i was seeing from the service i need to tell her ive got your match list ill tell her i need to keep this out of the media as long as i can id rather the press didnt get ahold of the story of the lonelyhearts lc thanks very much he grimaced can you get to her right away to darla mcmullen she lives alone and shes naive if santa came knocking shed open the door and offer him milk and cookies she sounds like a nice woman yeah now his eyes were bleak she is ill go see her eve rose maybe you ought to call her again no good he rose and worked up a smile but you be sure to let me know if you decide to ditch roarke lieutenant sugar my offers openended o o the heart eve thought as she drove was a strange and often overworked muscle it was hard to connect the sophisticated smoothtalking lc with the quiet intellectual woman shed just left but unless her instincts were way off darla mcmullen and charles monroe were halfway in love they just didnt know what to do about it on that score they had her full sympathy half the time she didnt know what to do about the impossible feelings she had for her own husband she made three more stops on the way back to her home office doing interviews with people on the match lists giving them the basic and specific warning and instructions she had written up and had approved by the commander if donnie ray had been warned she thought he might still be alive who was next in line someone shed spoken with or someone shed missed driven by that she accelerated and blew through the gates toward home she wanted peabody and mcnab to sign up with personally yours and get their profiles in before the end of the business day she saw feeneys vehicle parked in front of the house the sight made her hope her campaign to add him to the investigative team had been successful with feeney and mcnab doing the ework shed be freed up for the streets she headed straight up to her home office wincing when she heard the blast of music if it could be called music searing the air of the hallways mavis had one of her video clips on screen she sang along with herself screaming out lyrics that seemed to have something to do with ripping out her soul for love feeney sat behind eves desk looking bemused and slightly desperate roarke stood behind a chair looking completely comfortable and politely attentive knowing her chances of being heard over the din were nil eve waited until the last notes clashed out and mavis flushed with effort and pleasure giggled and took her bows i wanted you to see the rough cut right away she said to roarke it looks like a winner really obviously delighted mavis rushed him threw her arms around his neck and squeezed i just cant believe its really happening me cutting a disc for the top recording company on the planet youre going to make me lots of money he kissed her forehead i want it to work i really want it to work when she spotted eve mavis grinned hey did you catch any of the cut the tail end it was great and because it was mavis she meant it feeney are you on officially assigned he leaned back in her chair mcnabs doing his prelim consult at personally yours we profiled him as a computer droid for one of roarkes companies his datas been inputted and his new id is in place roarkes company seemed logical feeney grinned at her you got weight you use it appreciate your help boyo anytime roarke told him then smiled at his wife we cut a few corners as youre in a bit of a hurry peabodys profiled as a security guard at one of my buildings feeney thought it would be simplest to keep the profiles somewhat in line with truth oh yeah lets keep it simple but blowing out a breath she nodded good enough you own half the damn city anyway and nobodys going to question it or find any holes in your personnel files if you had your hand in it exactly wheres peabody trinas just finishing her i need her now shes got to get over here and put in her app get the consult going she looked okay for gods sake how long does it take to primp her up and put some street clothes on her trina had some mag ideas mavis assured her with such enthusiasm eves blood chilled wait till you see oh yeah trina wants you to plug in a session before your party she wants to glam you some for it since its the holidays eve merely grunted she had no intention of being glammed now or ever sure right where the hell her voice trailed off as she heard them coming she turned toward the doorway and blinked gaped i have to say trina announced im good peabody snorted flushed then smiled hesitantly okay so do you think ill pass the audition her bowlcut hair had been sheened and fluffed into a dark halo her face glowed with deep color smudged around her eyes to accent their shape and size and her lips were dyed a soft coral pink her body which appeared so sturdy in a uniform took on lusher more feminine curves in a sweeping ankle duster of deep pine green a tangle of chains in jewel hues were draped around her neck peeking out between the layers was a small wistful tattoo of a goldwinged fairy peabody had selected the tattoo herself after trina had caught her up in the spirit of things she hadnt flinched when the quick capable hands had cupped her left breast to apply the temp by that time shed begun to enjoy the sensation of being remade but now as eve stared at her peabody began to shift her feet they were clad in toothpick heels that matched the wings of her mystical tattoo it doesnt work you sure as hell dont look like a cop eve decided you look beautiful amused by his wifes reaction roarke stepped forward and took both of peabodys hands absolutely delicious so saying he kissed her fingers and had peabodys susceptible heart stuttering yeah really wow get over it peabody feeney youve got twenty minutes to brief her on her profile peabody wheres your stunner your communicator here still flushed she slipped a hand into a hidden pocket in the hip of the dress handy huh its not going to replace uniforms eve said then pointed to a chair you need to commit the data feeneys going to give you to memory record it you can replay it on the drive over we cant afford any slipups i want you in by end of day and on match lists by tomorrow yes sir but peabody fingered the material of the dress lovingly as she walked over to sit with feeney youre next trina said running a quick assessing hand through eves hair i dont have time for a treatment eve backed up besides you just did me a few weeks ago you dont get regular treatments you ruin my work she makes time before the party or im not responsible for how she looks trina warned roarke shell make time and to placate her he took her arm steering her out as he praised her brilliance with peabody chapter nine finding nadine furst lazily filing her nails at eves desk wasnt the welcome eve was looking for when she arrived at cop central get your butt out of my chair nadine merely smiled sweetly tucked her nail file away in her enormous calfcolored bag and uncrossed her smooth legs hello dallas so good to see you doing a lot of work out of your home office these days i cant blame you as she rose nadine skimmed her sharp cats eyes over the cramped dingy dusty room this place is a dump saying nothing eve marched directly to her computer checked the last logon time then did the same with her link i didnt touch anything nadine added just enough insult to her voice for eve to be sure the reporter had considered it im busy nadine i dont have time for the media go chase an mt van or harass one of the droids in booking you might want to make time still smiling nadine moved to the only other chair in the office and daintily crossed her legs again unless you want me to go on air with what ive got eve jerked a shoulder and found that her muscles had tensed as she sat stretched out her own denimcovered legs and crossed her battered boots at the ankles what you got nadine singles seeking romance find violent death personally yours dating service or death list ace homicide lieutenant eve dallas investigating nadine watched eves face as she spoke she gave eve full points her eyes didnt flicker but nadine was gut sure she had her full attention you want me to go on with a no comment from the investigating officer on that lead the investigation is proceeding a task force has been formed the nypsd is pursuing all leads nadine leaned forward slipping a hand into her bag to turn on her recorder then you confirm that the murders are connected im not confirming anything with your recorder on irritation flickered over nadines pretty triangular face give me a break here you turn that recorder off put it here on my desk in plain view or ill give you a break ill confiscate it and anything else you have in that suitcase youre hauling around recording devises arent permitted in official areas of cop central without authorization christ youre strict annoyed nadine took out her mini plunked it on the desk then set her bag aside off the record off the record because nadine had said the words eve nodded nadine could be irritating tenacious and a general pain in the ass but she had integrity there was no need to search the bag for another recorder the homicides under my investigation were committed by the same person personally yours appears to be the source of the victims you can go on air with that the dating service all traces of annoyance faded as nadine smiled eves subtle hint had nudged her into research on every dating service in the city she would be able to plug in the correct data and flesh out her report with the flick of a couple of buttons thats right what can you give me on it most of my notes are on my office unit but nadine pulled out her ppc and called up data you have all the standard already owners length of time in business requirements they do some pricey ads on our station shelled out a cool two mil last year on screen ads our credit checks showed they can afford it thats less than ten percent of their gross romance is profitable damn right i did an informal poll at the station about fifteen percent of the talent and crew have used services informing the public takes a toll on the personal life she added lightly anybody you like use personally yours probably nadine cocked her head i like a lot of people being the friendly sociable sort should i be worried about them all three victims used the dating service two knew each other casually through it as yet weve found no other connection among them so your guys trolling for lonely hearts and that was a hell of a lead nadine decided already running copy in her head we suspect that personally yours is his source eve wanted that one element hammered in she didnt intend to give nadine much more the task force formed today is pursuing all avenues of investigation leads are being checked out im not giving you specifics on this nadine suspects nadine said doggedly interviews are under way motive eve considered a moment theyre sexual homicides ah well that would fit you got a bisexual killer one of the victims was male two were female i cant confirm or deny the killers sexual preferences she thought of donnie ray and guilt scraped along her stomach the victims have admitted the killer into their homes there was no sign of forced entry in any case they opened the door to him they knew him they thought they did you can advise your viewing audience to think twice before opening their door to anyone they dont know on a personal level i cant give you any more without compromising the investigation hes killed three times in less than a week hes in a hurry he has a program eve said thats not for on air he has a schedule a pattern and thats how well get him give me a quick oneonone remote dallas i can have a camera in here in ten minutes no not yet she added before nadine could bitch about it youve got more than ive given anyone take it and be grateful ill give you a oneonone if and when i can id be more inclined if after you corner piper and rudy you tell me what you get nadine arched a brow quid pro quo fine im heading over there now once i she broke off her mouth dropping open as peabody rushed in the door dallas you wouldnt believe hi nadine is that you peabody though peabody struggled to maintain a casual air her lips twitched up in a smile yeah i just had a little work done a little you look fabulous is that one of leonardos designs its just absolutely mag she was up circling peabody yeah its one of his it really works on me doesnt it peabody you rock laughing nadine stepped back then her smile began to sharpen her eyes narrowed you let your aide play dressup in the middle of a murder investigation nadine began turning to eve i dont think so id say what we have here is a very slick undercover scam trying the wonders of computer dating peabody close the door peabody at eves flat command peabody inched in and shut the door at her back nadine if you leak this ill cut you off ill see to it that there isnt a cop here at central who gives you the day of the week much less a story lead then ill get nasty nadines foxsly smile faded her eyes went dark and dull you think id fuck with your investigation you think id go on with data that could put peabody in a jam go to hell dallas she scooped up her bag and swung toward the door but eve was quicker i put her ass on the line furious with herself eve yanked the purse out of nadines hands and tossed it i made the call and if anything goes wrong its on me dallas shut up she snapped at peabody if it hurts your feelings to know just how far id go to protect her cover and this case thats too damn bad okay nadine took a deep breath and reeled in her own temper it was a rare thing for her to detect even a shadow of fear in eves eyes okay she repeated but you should remember peabodys a friend of mine and so are you she bent down to pick up her bag shouldered it nice hair peabody she said before she opened the door and walked out fuck was all eve could think to say turning she stepped to the stingy window and stared out at miserable air traffic i can handle this dallas eve stared hard at an airbus that blatted fiercely at an advertising blimp in its airspace i wouldnt have put you on if i didnt think you could handle it but the fact remains im the one who put you on and youve got no undercover experience youre giving me a chance to get some i want to make detective i wont get the grade without undercover work on my record you know that yeah eve stuck her hands in her back pockets i know that uh i know my ass is a little bigger than it ought to be even though im working out but i know how to cover it with a half laugh eve turned back your ass is fine peabody why dont you sit on it and give me your report it went great grinning now peabody dropped into a chair i mean frigid they didnt have a clue i was a cop that id been in there just a couple days ago i got the royal treatment she fluttered her newly darkened and lengthened lashes eve cocked her head if youve got that out of your system officer id like your report sir peabody straightened in the chair sobered as ordered i reported to the subject location requested a consult after a brief interview i was escorted to a lounge where piper continued the interview personally the data i offered was logged on her personal palm computer i was offered refreshment a quick flicker of amusement lighted in her eyes i accepted believing this to be in character dallas they have hot chocolate i mean the genuine stuff and sugar cookies christmas style i ate three reindeer before i got ahold of myself keep that up and youll need a tarp to cover your ass yeah but peabody sighed in memory i indicated that i wanted to proceed immediately gave her a line about not wanting to be alone during the holidays she was very sympathetic personable i can see why people who go in there trust her to fix them up she wanted to pass me off to a consultant but i balked said how i was so comfortable with her and that this process was somewhat embarrassing for me i offered to pay more if necessary to have her stick with me good thinking she was sweet about it patted my hand she walked me through the video herself even coached me a little rudy came into it toward the end because she had a meeting to go to he didnt make me either he flirted with me in what way in an automatic way it was just part of the job if you ask me approving smiles compliments hand holding he is way not my type she added but i played along he offered me more hot chocolate but i managed to resist i also got a tour of the place was shown a club area they have where matches can meet if they feel awkward about making the connection outside very tasteful leaning toward elegant theyve got a small coffee shop too for the same purposes thats casual there were several couples linking up in there she wrinkled her nose i saw mcnab getting the runthrough too then were in and on schedule what about your match list i can go in tomorrow morning they prefer you come in person rather than arranging for a transmission on a first go they screened me in about an hour roarkes new data held up and from what i could see they really dig if i was going into this for real id feel safe okay you get the match list go through the routine but you set up meets outside she considered a moment well use one of roarkes places mediumsized club or bar well put a couple cops on the inside ill need to stay out if rudy or piper are in on this theyd make me well get a surveillance vehicle i want you to set up at least two try for three of the meets tomorrow night we cant sit on this she glanced at her wrist unit tapped her fingers lets find an empty conference room i need to pull in mcnab and feeney for an update i want this to go smooth if mcnab starts on me im flattening him wait till the case is closed eve advised then flatten him o o she could see the lights from the end of the long drive the minute she was through the gates at first eve wondered if the house was on fire they were so bright and brilliant as she sped closer she saw the outline of a tree in the wide window of the front parlor it was alive with white light shimmering and glowing sparking like little flames off the branches ladened with shiny globes of red or green dazzled she parked her car and jogged up the steps heading straight for the parlor she stopped under the archway and stared the tree had to be twenty feet high at least four feet across miles of silver garland were artfully draped to set off the hundreds of colored balls atop nearly brushing the ceiling was a crystal star each point pulsing with light beneath was a blanket of white that stood in for snow she couldnt begin to count the elegantly wrapped gifts stacked there jesus roarke pretty isnt it he came in silently behind her made her jolt before she turned to shake her head at him where the hell did you get it oregon it has a treated root ball well donate it to a park after the new year he slipped an arm around her waist them i should say them you have more of these theres one a bit bigger than this in the ballroom bigger she managed another in summersets quarters and the one in our bedroom i thought wed trim that one tonight itll take days to trim one of these it only took the crew i hired four hours to do this one and he laughed ours is more manageable he turned his head to brush his lips over her forehead i need to share this with you i dont know how to do any of this well figure it out she looked back at the tree and couldnt for the life of her determine why it made her nervous ive got work she began and would have stepped away but he shifted laid his hands on her shoulders and waited for her eyes to meet his i dont intend to interfere with your work eve but were entitled to a life our life i want an evening with my wife her brows came together you know i hate it when you say my wife in that tone why do you think i do it he laughed when she tried to shrug his hands away ive got you lieutenant and im keeping you knowing how quickly she could counter a move he scooped her off her feet get used to it he advised youre going to piss me off good then well have sex first its such an adventure to make love with you when youre annoyed with me i dont want to have sex she might have she thought irritably if he wasnt so damn smug about it ah a challenge and an adventure it just gets better put me down you jackass or ill have to hurt you and now threats im definitely getting excited she refused to laugh and when he stepped into the bedroom she was braced and ready for a bout later she would think roarke knew her thought process entirely too well he dropped her on the bed then dived onto her before she could shift into offensive mode with one hand he handcuffed her wrists and drew her hands over her head she shot him one hot narroweyed look i wont go down easy pal god i hope not she scissored her legs clamped them around his waist and managed to buck until they rolled galahad whod been enjoying a nap on the pillow gave one ferocious hiss and leaped off now youve done it eve grunted as he rolled on top of her again you annoyed the cat let him find his own woman roarke muttered then crushed his mouth to eves he felt the pulses in her wrists give two quick hard bumps felt the headtotoe shudder her body gave beneath his but she didnt yield wasnt ready to he thought there were times he knew eve liked a hot fast war by god he was in the mood for one himself he bit her bottom lip triumphing on the moan she couldnt quite swallow with his free hand he released her weapon harness tugged it down her shoulder then because he could because heat was already pouring off her in waves he hooked a hand in the opening of her shirt and ripped it down the center now her body strained toward his demanding daring even as she twisted under him in an attempt to evade or take control christ i want you its never enough his mouth clamped onto her breast no never enough was her last clear thought she cried out her strong body bowing up as those fierce pulls and tugs on her breast vibrated through her like wild music set to a furious beat heat seemed to roar from her center out freed her hands dragged at his shirt ripping at the silk until she found flesh with her fingers with her mouth with her teeth rolling again they yanked at clothes tormented skin with greedy nips and bruising strokes when she reached for him closed her fist around him he was iron hard and smooth as satin now now now she arched her hips and came violently the instant he drove into her he held there buried deep panting as he blinked his vision clear to look at her the fire that blazed in the hearth across the room shot flashes of light and shadow over her face glinted into her hair flickered in her eyes which had gone dark and blind with what they brought to each other its me who has you he drew back thrust again always he shifted lifted her hips with his hands go up again he demanded and began to destroy her with long hard strokes she fisted her hands in the bedclothes as if to anchor herself in the firelight she could see him over her dark hair gleaming eyes too blue to be real muscles sleek skin pale gold and dewed with sweat need rose like a flood and pleasure swamped her her vision blurred turning him into a shadow gilded at the edges she heard herself choke out his name as her body shattered and again he lowered himself taking her mouth with his linking his fingers with hers pounding his body into hers again he managed as his blood rioted with me and it was eve he said just eve when he emptied himself into her o o she lost track of time as she lay under him firelight dancing on the ceiling she wondered vaguely if it could be normal to need someone this much to love to the point of pain then he turned his head his hair brushing her cheek his lips brushing her throat and she wondered why she should care i hope youre satisfied her mutter wasnt as snippy as shed hoped it would be and she caught herself stroking a hand down his back mmmm i seem to be he nuzzled her throat again before lifting his head and looking down at her it seems to be mutual i let you win oh i know the twinkle in his eyes had her snorting get off me youre heavy okay he obliged then scooped her up again lets take a shower then we can do the tree just what is this obsession you have with trees i havent decorated one in years not since dublin when i lived with summerset i want to see if i can still do it he stepped into the shower with her and she clamped a hand over his mouth knowing his baffling preference for cold showers water on at one hundred degrees too hot he mumbled against her hand live with it and she sighed long and deep when the hot water began to pulse out from all directions oh yeah this is good fifteen minutes later she stepped out of the drying tube with her muscles warmed and limber her mind clear and alert roarke toweled off another of his habits she couldnt understand why waste time rubbing yourself with cotton when a quick spin in the drying tube took care of it she was reaching for her robe when she noticed it wasnt the one shed left hanging there that morning whats this she took down the long flow of scarlet cashmere youll like it youve bought me a million robes i dont see but her voice trailed off as she slipped it on oh she hated it when she lost herself in something as shallow as textures but this was soft as a cloud warm as a hug its pretty nice he grinned belting a black robe in the same material suits you come on you can fill me in on the case while i tackle the lights peabody and mcnab are in theyll have their match lists by tomorrow she wandered back into the bedroom and spotted the silver bucket with champagne a silver tray with canapes was waiting what the hell she decided and stuffed something glorious into her mouth as she poured two flutes your covers for them passed screening of course from a large box roarke took a long string of tiny lights dont get cocky weve got a long way to go nadine was in my office when i got to central eve added and set roarkes champagne on the table by the bed she got a load of peabody so i had to fill her in more than i wanted off the record nadine is one of those rare reporters you can trust roarke studied the tree the lights and decided to dive straight in she wont leak sensitive data yeah i know we got into that a bit frowning eve circled the tree while roarke worked she had no idea if he knew what he was doing if piper and rudy hadnt seen me id have done the inside work myself roarke lifted an eyebrow as he secured the first string and took out another i might have some mild objection to my wife dating strange men she went back to the tray took another pretty canape at random i wouldnt have slept with any of them unless the job called for it she grinned at him and i would have thought of you the whole time it wouldnt have taken very long since id have cut off his balls and handed them to you he kept stringing lights as she choked on her wine jesus roarke im only kidding mmmhmm me too darling hand me another string of these not at all sure of him eve pulled out another string of lights how many of these are you going to use as many as it takes yeah she blew out a breath what i meant before was ive done undercover before peabodys green peabodys had good training you should trust her and yourself mcnabs still kicking about it hes smitten with her he really what hes smitten with her roarke stepped back pursed his lips tree lights on he ordered then nodded satisfied as the tiny diamond points blinked on yes thatll do it what do you mean smitten like hes got a case on her mcnab no way hes not sure he likes her but hes attracted wanting to see his work from another angle roarke walked over picked up his wine and sipped as he studied ornaments next he irritates the hell out of her i believe you felt the same way about me initially he toasted his wife in the glow of tree and fire lights and look where we ended up eve stared at him for a full ten seconds then sat heavily on the side of the bed oh christ this is perfect this is just perfect i cant have the two of them working together like this if theres a thing there annoyance i can deal with sexual shit no way sometimes you have to let your children go darling he opened another box chose an antique porcelain angel you put the first one on itll be our little tradition eve stared at it if anything happens to her you wont let anything happen to her no she let out a breath and rose no i wont im going to need your help he reached out stroked a fingertip over the shallow dent in her chin you have it she turned picked her branch and hung the angel i love you i guess thats turning out to be our little tradition too its my favorite o o late very late when the tree lights were off and the fire burned low she lay awake was he out there now would her link beep announcing another body another soul lost because she was too many steps behind whom did he love now chapter ten the snow started to spit out of the sky at dawn no pretty postcard snow but thin mean needles that hissed nastily as they hit pavement by the time eve settled in her office at cop central there was a slick layer of ugly gray over the city streets sidewalks and glides that would certainly keep the mts and traffic cops busy outside her window two weather copters from rival channels dueled in a war to pass the bad news to viewers and report on the latest fender bender or pedestrian spill all they had to do eve thought badtemperedly was open their own fucking doors and see for themselves it was going to be a lousy day keeping her back to the arrowslit view of her window she fed data into her computer with little hope that shed get a decent probability match computer probability program using known data analyze and compute list in order of probability which names most likely to be targeted by true love killer working yeah you do that she muttered while her machine whined and clunked she took copies of photos confiscated from personally yours and rising fixed them to a board over her desk marianna hawley sarabeth greenbalm donnie ray michael faces smiling hopefully putting their best side forward the lonely looking for love the desk clerk the stripper and the sax blower different lifestyles different goals different needs what else did they have in common what was she missing that linked them all to a killer what did he see when he looked at them that attracted and enraged ordinary people living ordinary lives probability percentages even for all subjects eve glanced over at her machine and snarled the hell with that there has to be something insufficient data for further analysis current pattern is random how the hell am i supposed to protect two thousand people for christs sake she closed her eyes reeled in her temper computer eliminate all subjects who live with a companion or family member recalibrate remaining working task complete okay rubbing her fingers over her eyes she nodded all three victims had been white she thought eliminate all subjects not caucasian recalibrate remaining working task complete number remaining six hundred twentyfour subjects remaining shit she turned back to study the photos eliminate all subjects over the age of fortyfive and under the age of twentyone working task complete okay all right she began to pace as she thought it through grabbing her hardcopy file she pushed through paperwork firsttimers she muttered they were all firsttimers eliminate all subjects with repeated consults from personally yours recalibrate remaining working this time the machine bogged and rattled eve gave it an impatient smack with the heel of her hand piece of shit she muttered and set her teeth as the machine whined again task complete dont you start stuttering on me number remaining two hundred six names remaining better much better print amended list while her machine chewed and spit out data eve turned to her link and contacted edd feeney ive got just over two hundred names i need them checked out can you run them see how many have left the city how many got themselves matched or married died in their sleep are on vacation at planet disney shoot them over thanks she glanced up as she heard a stream of whistles and catcalls from the detectives bull pen its a priority she told him and logged off just as a flushed and flustered peabody walked in jesus youd think those morons hadnt seen me out of uniform before henderson offered to leave his wife and kids for a weekend with me in barbados but from the gleam in her eye peabody didnt appear to be too displeased by the reaction eve frowned her aides face was painted and polished her hair fluffed her legs were showcased in a short snug skirt and stilettoheeled boots both the color of ripe raspberries how the hell do you walk in that getup eve wanted to know i practiced eve inhaled deeply then blew out air sit down lets go over the plan okay but it takes me a couple of minutes to get down in this skirt cautious peabody braced a hand on the edge of the desk and began to lower her butt you going to do squats or sit the hell down just a second she sucked in air winced a little little tight in the waist she managed as she eased down you should have thought of your internal organs before you poured yourself into that thing youve got an hour before youre due at personally yours i want you to what the hell are you doing in that mcnab stopped at the doorway his eyes bugged out as they skimmed along peabodys legs my job she said with a sniff youre just asking to get hit on dallas make her wear something else im not a fashion consultant mcnab and if i were eve took the time to study his baggy red and white striped trousers and butteryellow turtleneck i might have something to say about your wardrobe choices at peabodys snicker eve narrowed her eyes now children you may be aware that were working multiple homicides at this time if you cant be friends im afraid ill have to limit your playground time this afternoon peabody immediately squared her shoulders and though she slid a sneering look toward mcnab she was wise enough to say nothing peabody i want you to convince piper to stick with you through the consult mcnab you take rudy once you have the match lists youll browse through the retail areas make yourselves obvious do we have a budget for purchases mcnab wanted to know and at eves bland stare he shrugged and dipped his hands into the wide pockets of his trousers itd make more of an impression if we bought some things chatted up the clerks youve got two hundred credits apiece departmental funds anything over its your worry mcnab we know donnie ray used the salon to buy enhancements for his mother make sure you spend time there he could use a month peabody said under her breath then folded her lips innocently when eve scowled at her peabody hawley used credits in the salon and in desirable woman lingerie place on the floor above check it out yes sir youll both need to contact as many names on your match lists as possible set up meets i want this to start tonight arrangements are being made to use the nova club on fiftythird the earlier in the evening the better to start try for the first meet at four then book the rest an hour apart get in as many as you can we dont know if he hit last night we may have gotten lucky but he wont wait she glanced over at the photos again well have cops inside feeney and i will be out on the street in constant contact youll both be wired neither of you are to leave with anyone if you have to take a pee you signal and one of the inside cops goes with you it isnt his pattern to hit in a public place peabody pointed out i dont take chances with my people you follow the steps no deviations or youre out get feeney and me the match lists as soon as you have them any member of the staff at personally yours or in any of the outlets shows undo interest in you you report questions eve lifted her eyebrows as both of them shook their heads then get started she didnt grin when peabody levered herself with some difficulty out of the chair but she wanted to mcnab rolled his eyes and showed his teeth as she marched by him and out of the office shes green he said to eve shes good eve countered maybe but im keeping my eye on her i can see that eve muttered as he strode out she turned back to the photos they haunted her those three faces what had been done to them crawled inside her and refused to let go too close she reminded herself too focused on what and not enough on why she closed her eyes a moment rubbed them as if to erase the images of her own memories why these three she asked herself again and moved closer to study the cheerfully smiling face of marianna hawley office professional she mused trying out the same system that shed used to select miras scent reliable oldfashioned romantic pretty in a safe comfortable sort of way close family ties interested in theater a tidy woman who enjoyed pretty things around her hooking her thumbs in her pocket she turned her gaze to sarabeth greenbalm the stripper a loner who was careful with money and collected business cards reliable too in her chosen career lived sparely horded her takehome pay and calculated her tips no apparent hobbies friends or family connections and donnie ray she mused the boy whod loved his mother and had blown sax lived like a pig and had a smile like an angel puffed a little zoner but never missed a gig and suddenly she had it staring at the three faces of victims who never met the theater oh yes computer bring up personally yours data on hawley marianna greenbalm sarabeth michael donnie ray tile on screen highlight professions and hobbies interests working on screen requested subjects hawley marianna administrative assistant fosterbrinke hobbies and interests theater member west side community players other

current subjects due to mutual connection or interest in theater and entertainment working with current data probability index is ninetythree point two percent good damn good and huffing out a breath she answered her communicators beep dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve see the couple at west eighteen unit possible assault attempt probability incident linked to current homicide investigations ninetyeight point eight percent eve was already up and snagging her jacket on my way dallas out o o it was just weird the woman was tiny as delicate as the fairies that danced on the tiny white glass tree centered in the wide window of the old rehabbed loft jacko gets too up about things i know what i know that flake was wrong cissy jacko scowled as he tightened his arm around the womans shoulder hed have made four of her eve thought he had to be sixthree and twofifty an arena ball players build a face tough as mountain rock scars dug in at the lantern jaw and over the right eyebrow she was pale as a moonbeam he dark as midnight his big hand swallowed hers the loft had been sectioned off into three main areas eve got a peek at the bedroom suite through the opening in wavy glass walls the color of peaches the bed was enormous and unmade in the living area the long ushaped sofa could have fit twenty people comfortably jacko took up space for three what she could see indicated easy money feminine taste and masculine comfort just tell me what happened we told the policeman last night cissy smiled but her eyes were shadowed with obvious annoyance jacko insisted on calling them it was just a silly prank hell it was look he leaned forward his tight scalp curls bobbing a bit this guy comes to the door dressed like santa claus carrying this big box all wrapped and ribboned does the hoho merry christmas deal anticipation curled in eves gut but she spoke coolly who opened the door i did cissy fluttered her hands my daddy lives in wisconsin he usually sends me something fun for

to let him in im in the kitchen i hear her laughing and i hear this guys voice jackos much too jealous for his own good it hurts our relationship bullshit cissy you cant tell a guys making you until hes got his hand up your skirt jesus obviously disgusted jacko hissed out a breath hes moving in on her when i walk out moving in eve repeated while cissy pouted yeah i could see it hes moving in got this big smile this gleam in his eyes twinkle cissy muttered santas eyes are supposed to twinkle for lords sake jacko they sure as hell stopped twinkling when he saw me he went statue just stood there gaping at me scared the hoho right out of him i tell you then he takes off like a fucking rabbit you yelled at him not until after he started to run jacko threw up his enormous hands in frustration yeah damn right i yelled then and i took off after him wouldve had his ass too if cissy hadnt gotten in the way but by the time i shook her off and got out to the street he was gone did the uniform who took the initial call take the security discs yeah he said it was routine thats right what did he sound like sound like cissy blinked his voice tell me what his voice was like um it was jolly jesus cissy do you practice being stupid it was put on jacko said to eve while cissy obviously insulted sprang up and flounced eve could think of no other word for it into the kitchen you know that fake cheer deep rumbling he said something like have you been good little girl ive got something for you only for you then i stepped out and he looked like hed swallowed a live trout you didnt recognize him eve asked cissy there was nothing about him under the costume under the makeup that looked familiar nothing about his voice the way he moved no she walked back in rigidly ignoring jacko and sipping from a glass filled with fizzy water but it was only a couple of minutes im going to have you review the discs take a look at them when we enlarge and enhance if theres anything familiar i want to know isnt this a lot of trouble for something so silly i dont think so how long have the two of you lived together on and off for a couple years a lot of off lately jacko mumbled if you werent so possessive if you didnt punch every man who looks at me sideways cissy began cissy eve held up a hand hoping to forestall the domestic dispute what do you do for a living me im an actor teach acting when i cant land a part theres one eve mused shes terrific with obvious and shameless pride jacko grinned at cissy shes rehearsing for a play offbroadway right now way off cissy said but she moved back to jacko with a smile and sat beside him again its going to be a huge hit he kissed one of her pretty hands cissy beat out twenty other women at the auditions this ones her big break ill be sure to watch for it cissy have you used the services of personally yours um her gaze skidded away no cissy eve put all cop in her voice in her eyes and leaned forward do you know the penalty for lying during an interview well for goodness sake i dont know what business it is of yours whats personally yours jacko wanted to know a computer dating service oh for christs sake cissy for christs sake furious jacko shoved off the couch rattling knickknacks as he stomped around the living room what the hell is wrong with you we broke up all at once the little fairy managed to outshout the giant i was mad at you i thought it would be fun i thought it would teach you a lesson you dummy ive got a perfect right to see who i want when i want when we arent cohabitating think again honey he swung back black eyes glinting see see cissy jabbed a finger at him as she appealed to eve all the flirty softness in her eyes had turned to flint this is what i put up with calm down both of you sit eve ordered when did you have your consult cissy about six weeks ago she mumbled i went out with a couple of guys what guys jacko demanded a couple of guys she repeated ignoring him then jacko came back around he brought me flowers pansies i caved but im rethinking that decision that decision might have saved your life said eve what do you mean instinctively cissy cringed into jacko his arm came back around her the incident last night matches the pattern of a series of homicides in the other cases the victims lived alone eve glanced at jacko lucky for you you dont oh god but jacko dont worry baby dont worry im here he all but folded her into his lap as he stared at eve i knew that guy was off whats going on ill tell you what i can then i need both of you to come down to cop central review the disc make another report and tell me everything you can remember cissy about your experience at personally yours o o the witnesses are giving the investigation their full cooperation eve stood in commander whitneys office too wired to sit she barely resisted pacing as she gave him her report the womans shaken cant give us much to go on the mans holding it together nothing about the perpetrator is familiar to either ive interviewed both of the matches cissy peterman dated both are alibied for at least one of the murders i think theyre clear on this lips pursed whitney nodded and began to scan the hard copy of eves report jacko gonzales the jacko gonzales number twentysix with the brawlers he plays professional arena ball yes sir well hell whitneys faced creased in one of his rare smiles ill say he plays hes a killer out there scored three goals his last game and took out two defensive blocks he cleared his throat as eve only watched him my grandsons a big fan yes sir too bad gonzalez didnt get his hands on this guy he wouldnt be walking i promise you i got that impression commander ms petermans a fortunate woman yes sir the next one might not be this threw him off schedule hes bound to hit again tonight i ran this by dr mira her opinion is hell be angry emotionally distraught to me that means he might be sloppy as well mcnab and peabody have three meets each set up for tonight everythings in place there i have their lists and reports she hesitated then decided to speak her mind commander what were doing tonight is a necessary step but hes going to be out there while were on this surveillance hes going to move unless youve got a crystal ball dallas youve got to take the steps ive got a probability list of victims down to just over two hundred i think ive found another connection the theater that can carve that number down im hoping with the new data feeney can get us a short list of probables the potential victims need to be protected how whitney spread his hands you know as well as i do the department cant spare that many officers but if he fines it down if he quarters it i cant spare them one of those people is going to die tonight she stepped forward they need to be warned if we go to the media put out an alert whoever hes targeted might not open the damn door if we go to the media whitney said coolly we start a panic how many streetcorner santas ringing their bells for charity get assaulted as a result or killed you cant play trade the victim here dallas and he added before she could speak if we go to the media we risk scaring him off he goes under we might never find him three people are dead and they deserve better he was right but knowing it didnt ease her gut if feeney fines down the list to a workable number we can contact each name ill put together a team to make the calls itll leak lieutenant and well be back to panic we cant just leave them open this way the next one he kills is on us on me she thought but knew better than to say it if we do nothing to alert the victim its on us he knows weve got his pattern he knows weve got the number of targets and he knows we cant do anything but juggle names and wait for him to hit again he loves it he performed for the security camera at petermans stood in the damn foyer and posed if gonzales had been out making goals last night shed be dead thats four in a week and its too damn many he heard her out his face calm and set its a hell of a lot easier where youre standing lieutenant maybe you dont think so but its a hell of a lot easier on that side of the desk i cant give you what you want i cant let you stand in front of every victim and take the hit the way you stood in front of roarkes man a few weeks ago this has nothing to do with that battling frustrated fury she set her teeth that incident is closed commander and my current investigation is against the wall information is already leaking to the media another one dies its going to blow up in our faces whitneys eyes flattened how much have you given furst no more than i had to and most of that off the record shell hold back but shes not the only reporter with a good nose and not many of them have her integrity ill take that matter up with the chief thats the best i can do you get me feeneys amended list and ill ask for individual contacts i cant authorize the budget for that kind of operation dallas its out of my control he leaned back studying her come up with something tonight on this surveillance end this thing o o eve found feeney scanning the monitor in her office good you saved me a trip to edd heard you had jacko gonzales in he glanced wistfully over her shoulder guess hes gone huh ill get you his autographed hologram for gods sake yeah appreciate it i need you to run these names and data she pulled out a copy of a disc my machines stuttering again and it takes me too damn long i need victim probability whittled down as far as itll go she dragged open a drawer pawing through and ignoring the vague headache behind her eyes just the top fifty okay i can push whitney into contacting fifty god help the others where the goddamn hell is my candy bar i didnt take it feeney jostled his bag of nuts mcnab was in here hes a known candy thief son of a bitch desperate for fuel she snagged feeneys bag and downed a handful of nuts i had the security disc from petermans enhanced and enlarged but i figure you can do better i want the frame of him when hes most himself when hes turned to run you can see the panic she jabbed at the autochef hoping for coffee to wash down the nuts ive got photos of the match lists the personnel at personally yours you got the equipment to scan them see how many might pop as far as facial shapes eye shape that kind of thing even with enhancements somethings got to come through most of his mouths hidden by the beard we can do mostlikely shapes on that if we have a good enough image yeah build isnt going to work but height should see how close you can come to height from the images he didnt appear to be wearing lifts so i think we can get close the gloves screw up the shape of his hands she gulped coffee eyes narrowing ears she said abruptly would he have bothered to change the shape of his ears how much of them show she leaped to her machine called up the program the file the images shit nothing nothing nothing here scanning through she came up with a side view thats good thats pretty damn good can you work with it feeney nibbled considered yeah maybe the hat covers the top of the ear but maybe nice call dallas it wouldve slipped by me well work feature by feature see what jumps its not going to be quick something this complex is going to take days maybe a week i need the bastards face she closed her eyes concentrated well go back work the jewelry angle again the disinfectant the cosmetics the tattoos were hand drawn maybe we can shake out something there dallas twothirds of the salons and clubs in the city have freehand tattoo artists and maybe one of them knows that design she blew out a breath weve got two hours before the meets at nova lets do what we can chapter eleven the one thing that really irritated peabody was that mcnab was on her match list it didnt matter that it was most likely due to the fact that her profile and his had been altered to fit those of the victims it just griped her she didnt like working with him with his ridiculous clothes cocky grins and knowitall attitude but figured she was stuck as long as eve found him an asset there was no one on the force peabody admired as much as eve dallas but she figured even the smartest of smart cops could make one mistake eves in peabodys opinion was mcnab she could see him across the snazzy little bar he and the sixfoot blonde hed matched with were directly in her line of vision a deliberate move on mcnabs part peabody imagined just to annoy her while they worked if he hadnt been there she might have been able to enjoy the quietly elegant atmosphere the bar had pretty silvertopped tables pale blue privacy booths and clever art prints of new york street scenes decorating the warm yellow walls classy she thought glancing over at the long shiny bar with sparkling mirrors and tuxedodecked servers but youd expect classy from something that belonged to roarke the padded chair where she sat was designed for comfort the drinks were glorious the table was equipped with hundreds of musical and video selections and individual headsets if a customer wanted entertainment while he or she waited for a friend or enjoyed a quiet solitary drink peabody was sorely tempted to try out the headset as her first match was a blistering bore the guys name was oscar and he was a teacher who specialized in physics on athome screens so far hed mostly been interested in sucking down rippers and badmouthing his recent exwife she was peabody was told a nonsupporting selfcentered bitch who was frigid in bed after fifteen minutes peabody was fully on the bitchs side still she played the game smiling and chatting while she crossed oscar off her mental lists of suspects the guy had a serious problem with alcohol and their man was too clearheaded to spend his time with the awesome hangovers a few rippers produced across the room mcnab erupted with delighted laughter that ran along peabodys nerve endings like a dull razor while oscar guzzled the last of his third ripper she glanced over and caught the quick eyebrow wiggle mcnab sent her it made her want to do something cool and mature like sticking out her tongue with great relief she parted ways with oscar making vague plans to hook up again when they sell iced rippers in hell she muttered and winced as she heard eves voice in her earpiece maintain peabody sir peabody hissed the word covering it by lifting her own virgin blitzer she sighed noting by her wrist unit that she had ten minutes before the next meet goddamn it peabody jolted when eves voice exploded in her ear sir she said again choking what the hell is he doing here damn it baffled one hand sliding down to where her weapon was snug inside her left boot peabody scanned the room and caught herself grinning widely as roarke strolled in now thats a match made in heaven peabody murmured why cant i get one of those dont talk to him eve ordered in a snap you dont know him okay ill just stare and drool like every other woman in the place she chuckled out loud at eves snarling string of curses and the couple at the next table glanced over peabody cleared her throat lifted her drink again and settled back to admire her lieutenants husband he walked by the bar and the bartenders came to attention like soldiers on parade for the general he stopped by a table to speak briefly with a couple leaned down to brush his lips over the womans cheek then moved to the end of the bar to lay a friendly hand on a mans shoulder peabody wondered if he moved just that beautifully in bed then flushed it was a damn good thing she decided that the wire wasnt transmitting her thoughts to the surveillance van o o outside eve scowled at the screen that projected the view from the microcamera in peabodys collar button she watched roarke work the room very casual very easy and vowed to pound him into dust at the first opportunity hes got no business walking into an operation she said to feeney its his place feeney hunched his shoulders an automatic defense against a marital tiff right he came by to check the liquor levels at the bar fuck she dragged both hands through her hair then made low feral sounds in her throat as she watched roarke wander over to peabodys table enjoying your drink miss um yeah i shit roarke was the best peabody could manage he only smiled leaned down tell your lieutenant to stop swearing at me i wont get in her way peabodys eye twitched as eves voice exploded in her ear uh she suggests you get your fancy ass out of here shell um kick it for you later looking forward to it still smiling he lifted peabodys fingers kissed them you look fabulous he told her then strolled away while the equipment in the van reported a sharp spike in her blood pressure and pulse rate down peabody eve warned i cant control an involuntary physical reaction to outside stimuli peabody blew out a breath sure does have a fancy ass respectfully sir match two approaching pull it together peabody im ready she glanced toward the door her company smile ready one of the perks for the operation as far as she was concerned had just walked in she remembered him from her first visit to personally yours the trim bronzed god whod caught her attention then given his own to his pocket mirror he was going to be a pleasure to look at for the next hour he posed at the door head up profile turned to the room as he scanned tables his eyes a tawny gold that matched his hair flickered then settled on peabody his mouth turned up as he gave a quick practiced head toss to allow his hair to flow he crossed directly to her table you must be delilah yes great voice she thought with an inward sigh better in person that on his video profile and youre brent across the room it was mcnabs turn to scowl the man preening for peabody was all plastic he decided with a thick layer of spray gloss probably just her type asshole had his face tailormade mcnab decided body too he doubted there was an inch on the man that hadnt been paid for and just look just look at the way shes fawning all over him mcnab thought in disgust tinged with a vicious dose of jealousy the woman was practically lapping up every word the guy dropped through his collagenenhanced lips women were so pitifully predictable his gaze slid over as roarke stopped by the table shes looking particularly appealing tonight isnt she most guys find it appealing when a woman has half her tits out of her shirt roarke grinned enjoying himself mcnabs eyes were on fire and his fingers were beating a rapid and angry tattoo against the tabletop but obviously youre above such things wish i were above them mcnab muttered as roarke moved on those are some superior tits keep your eyes off peabodys tits eve ordered your second match is at the door yeah mcnab glanced over at a tiny redhead in a spangled skinsuit im on it inside the van eve frowned at the screen give me the run on the guy with peabody will you feeney something about it seems off to me brent holloway commercial model works for cliburnwillis marketing thirtyeight twice divorced no kids model her eyes narrowed on screen thats sort of like entertainment right shit you havent watched much commercial screen lately nothing entertaining about those ads you ask me hes originally from morristown new jersey new york resident since current address central park west income in middle eighties shows nothing on yellow sheets no arrests got a mountain of traffic violations we saw him peabody and me at personally yours on our first trip there how many consults has he had this is his fourth match group this year okay why does a guy who looks like that has credits a strong career and a highdollar address become a dating service addict four match groups in a year five matches per group thats twenty women and nothing sticks whats wrong with him feeney feeney pursed his lips and studied the screen from my view he looks like a conceited asshole yeah but a lot of women arent going to care about that hes got looks and bucks something shouldve stuck she drummed her fingers on the narrow console no complaints to the service pop out nope his sheet theres clean too somethings off she said again an instant before she watched her aide rear back and plow a fist directly in brent holloways perfect nose jesus christ jesus did you see that busted it feeney said placidly as he studied the quick gush of blood nice shortarmed jab what the hell was she thinking what the hells going on peabody have you lost your mind son of a bitch stuck his hand up me under the table flushed and furious peabody was on her feet hands fisted bastards talking about the new play at the universe and he grabs my crotch pervert you pervert get up mcnab stay the hell where you are eve shouted as mcnab surged to his feet with murder in his eyes stay the hell where you are or youre off thats an order a goddamn order maintain peabody for christs sake put that guy down even as eve was pulling the hair out of her head peabody hauled holloway to his feet and hit him again shed have gone for three even though his gold eyes were rolling back white if roarke hadnt stepped through the excited crowd and pulled the rubberlegged holloway back was this man bothering you miss coolly roarke hauled holloway out of reach kept his eyes level on peabodys glinting ones im terribly sorry ill take care of it please let me get you another drink with one hand on holloway he lifted peabodys glass with his free one sniffed blitzer virgin he ordered and all three bartenders rushed to comply as he dragged the now struggling holloway to the door get your fucking hands off me that bitch broke my nose my face is my living for christs sake stupid cunt im suing her crazy ass off im reporting the minute they were outside roarke slammed him against the side of the building holloways head hit the wall with a sound reminiscent of pool balls cracking on the break the gold eyes rolled back white a second time let me give you a clue this is my place roarke accented the information by rapping holloways head against the bricks again while in the van eve could only watch and swear nobody paws a woman in my place and walks away on his own legs so unless you want to try crawling with your limp dick in your hand youll start moving now and thank jesus only your nose is broken the bitch asked for it oh now then that was the wrong thing to say entirely his irish comes out when hes pissed listen to the music of it feeney said sentimentally as eve only continued to make violent sounds in her throat on what might have been a sigh roarke hammered a fist into holloways stomach kneed him handily in the balls and let him drop he flicked one glance toward the van with what certainly was a quick and wicked grin then strolled back inside nice tidy job feeney decided lets call a cruiser to pick up that stupid bastard and get him to a health center eve rubbed her eyes this is going to look wonderful on the report mcnab peabody maintain positions do not repeat do not break cover christ when this little party is over report to my home office so we can try to salvage something o o at just past nine eve paced her home office no one spoke they knew better but roarke gave peabodys shoulder a reassuring squeeze we hit six meets between you so thats something the last two one for each of you is scheduled tomorrow noon peabody youll report this incident with match two to piper in the morning play it up i want to see how they handle it his sheet with them is clear up to now we have recordings on all meets but i want both of you to work up individual reports when weve finished the debriefing tonight youll both go home and stay there keeping your communicators open at all times both feeney and i will be monitoring yes sir lieutenant bracing herself peabody got to her feet she swallowed hard but kept her chin lifted i apologize for my outburst during the operation i realize my behavior could compromise the investigation the hell with that mcnab exploded out of his chair you shouldve broken his fucking legs the son of a bitch deserved mcnab eve said mildly the hell with it dallas the bastard got what he deserved we should detective mcnab eve snapped off the words and moved forward until they were toe to toe i dont believe your opinion in this matter was requested youre now off duty go home and cool off ill see you in my office at central at oh nine hundred she waited while he fought the war between training and instinct in the end he turned on his heel and stormed out without another word roarke feeney would you give me a moment with my aide glad to feeney said under his breath more than happy to desert the field got any irish roarke its been a long day i think we can find you a glass he sent eve one quiet look before guiding feeney out of the room sit down peabody sir peabody shook her head i let you down i promised you i would handle myself and the responsibilities you gave me then i broke at the first turn i realize you have every right and reason to take me off the investigation at least the undercover op but id like to respectfully request another chance eve said nothing let peabody wind down her aide was still sheetpale but her hands were steady her shoulders straight i dont believe i mentioned any plans to remove you from the undercover op officer but i did tell you to sit down sit down peabody she said more gently then turned away to dig up a bottle of wine i understand that when youre under you have to keep to your cover to handle any curves without breaking i didnt see you break your cover just that assholes nose i didnt think i just reacted i understand during that kind of op you have to think at all times peabody even an lc has the right to protest if some jerk grabs her crotch in a public place here have a drink he stuck his fingers in me her hand did shake now as eve pressed the glass into it we were just sitting there talking and all of a sudden i feel him jam his fingers in me i know i was flirting and i let him get a good look at my boobs so maybe i deserved stop it eves control wavered enough for her to put her hands on peabodys shoulders and shove her into a chair you didnt deserve it and it pisses me off to hear you think it the son of a bitch didnt have any right to touch you that way nobody has a right to push themselves on you that way to hold you down to tie your hands to hammer himself into you when youre begging him to stop and it hurts it hurts it hurts the sickness rose up all but gagging her until she turned laid her hands on her desk and ordered herself to breathe not now she murmured for christs sake dallas its nothing but she had to stay as she was hands braced for another moment im sorry you were put in that kind of position i knew something was off about him peabody lifted her glass with both hands she could still feel the sudden sharp shock of holloways fingers digging into her he passed their screening and now we know their screening isnt as good as they claim she drew a deep breath and steadier turned back i want you to hit piper with this in the morning in person go in demand to see her a little hysteria wouldnt hurt you can threaten to sue or go to the press i want her to get it full in the face lets see what shakes can you do it yeah appalled that tears were perilously close peabody sniffed yeah the way im feeling itll be easy keep your communicator open we cant use anything you get on the inside but i want you in constant contact you can delay your report on tonight until tomorrow afternoon im going to have feeney take you home okay yeah eve waited a beat peabody sir damn good punch next time though follow it through with a groin shot you want to completely disable not just annoy peabody let out a long sigh then managed a half smile yes sir o o because she wanted the position of command eve sat behind her desk and waited for roarke she knew hed walk feeney and peabody out probably add a few comfort strokes for peabody which would set the poor woman up for sweaty erotic dreams if eve knew her aide better she thought than ugly nightmares about groping hands and helplessness and that she realized was part of her problem with this case sexual homicides bondage the gleeful cruelty in the name of love too close to home too close to the past shed spent most of her life running from now it was hitting her in the face each time she looked at a victim she saw herself and she hated it get past it she ordered herself and find him she looked over as roarke walked in kept her eyes on him as he crossed the room he poured two glasses of the wine shed gotten out for peabody set one on her desk then took the other with him and sat in the chair facing her he sipped took out one of his increasingly rare cigarettes lighted it well he said and left it at that what the hell did you think you were doing he drew in smoke blew it out in a thin fragrant stream at which point dont get cute with me roarke but i do it so well easy lieutenant he lifted his glass in salute as she growled low in her throat i didnt infringe on your operation the point is you had no business being near the scene pardon me but i own the scene there was arrogance in his tone now and a dare i often drop in on my properties keeps the employees on their toes roarke eve this case is choking you do you think i cant see it his composure cracked just enough to have him rising to pace feeney was right she thought fleetingly the irish came out when he was pissed it disturbs your sleep what little you allow yourself it haunts your eyes i know what you go through he turned back temper alive in those wonderfully blue eyes christ i admire you but you cant expect me to stand back and pretend i dont see dont understand and not do whatever it is i can do to ease whats inside you it isnt about me it cant be about me its about three dead people they haunt you too he crossed to the desk and sat on the edge close to her thats why youre the best cop ive ever run up against theyre not names and numbers to you theyre people and you have the gift or curse of being able to imagine too well what they saw and felt and prayed for in those last minutes of life i wont back away he leaned forward a quick move that caught her unguarded and gripped her chin damn it i wont back away from what you are or what you do youll take me eve every bit as fully as i take you she sat very still absorbing his words searching his eyes she could never resist the things she found in his eyes last winter she began slowly you pushed yourself into my life i didnt ask for you i didnt want you his brow cocked an irritated challenge thank god you didnt give a damn what i asked for or what i thought i wanted she murmured and watched the dare slide into a smile i didnt ask for you either aghra my love she knew what it meant in the tongue of his birth and couldnt stop her heart from opening to it to him since then ive rarely had a case that hasnt tangled you into it i didnt want it to be that way ive used you when it was expedient that bothers me it pleases me i know it she sighed and lifting a hand curled her fingers briefly around his wrist his pulse beat there strong and steady you get too close to pieces of me i dont like to look at then i dont have any choice but to look at them you look at them with or without me eve but maybe with me they wont hurt you so much i look back he said and surprised her enough to have her eyes flicking up to his holding there and its easier those moments are easier to stand since you you cant ask me cant expect me not to stand with you when your moments close in she stood now taking her wine and moving away from him he was right she thought what she too often saw as dependence should have been accepted as unity and she could tell him i know what they felt i know what went through them the fear the pain the humiliation each one of them when they were helpless and naked and he was raping them i know what their bodies felt what their minds felt i dont want to remember what its like to be torn into that way ripped invaded but i do then you touch me she turned back realizing shed never really given him this then you touch me roarke and i dont i dont feel that i dont remember that its that simple its just you i love you he murmured outrageously so youre here when you should be off planet seeing to your business she shook her head before he could speak could slide some smooth excuse by her when she knew better you were there tonight knowing id be pissed off because you thought there might be a chance id need you youre here right now ready to argue with me just to take my mind off whats ripping at it i know you damn it im a cop im good at knowing people he only smiled busted so what so thanks but ive been on the job eleven years now and i can handle myself on the other hand she studied her wine then took a long swallow it sure gave me a nice feeling to watch you beat the puss out of that creep who jumped peabody i had to sit there in the fucking van couldnt risk getting out to smear him onto the pavement myself and blow cover so it felt pretty good to watch you do it for me oh it was absolutely my pleasure is she all right she will be he shook her thats the human part shell take a hot shower a tranq if shes smart and sleep it off the cop part will maintain shes a good cop shes a better one because of you no dont put that on me shes what she is uncomfortable with that topic she shot him a cool stare i bet you hugged her stroked her hair and gave her a kiss good night that gorgeous eyebrow lifted again and if i did her little hearts still pittypatting over it which is just fine shes got a thing for you really he grinned widely how interesting dont play with my aide i need her focused how about you unfocus for just a little while and i see if i can make your heart pittypat she ran her tongue around her teeth i dont know ive got a lot on my mind itd be a lot of work i enjoy my work with his eyes on hers he stubbed out his cigarette set down his glass and im damned good at it o o she was facedown on the bed naked and still vibrating when the call came in she grunted blocked video and answered thirty seconds later she was rolling over and looking for her clothes the call had been for her response to an anonymous tip on a domestic dispute the address was all too familiar thats holloways place its not a hes dead it followed pattern ill go with you roarke was already out of bed and reaching for his trousers she started to protest then shrugged okay i have to tag peabody for this and she might not handle it well im counting on you to give her the strokes because im going to have to be hard on her to keep her in line i dont envy your job lieutenant roarke said as he dressed in the dark right now neither do i she dug out her communicator and called peabody chapter twelve brent holloway had lived well and died badly the furnishing of his town house spoke of a man who was ruled by both trends and comfort a lakesized sofa dominated the living area and was pooled with triangular black pillows that appeared wet to the touch a view screen was recessed in the ceiling above in a cabinet shaped like a wellendowed female from neck to knee was an expansive collection of porn discs some legal some bootlegged a silver serving bar stretched across one wall and was stocked with expensive liquor and cheap illegal drugs the kitchen was fully automated soulless and appeared to have been used rarely there was an office with a highend computer system and holophone and a playroom equipped with vr and a mood tube a servant droid stood in the corner shut down and blankeyed holloway was in the master suite stretched over a watertoair mattress trussed in sparkly silver garland and staring blindly at his own reflection in the mirrored canopy the tattoo had been painted low on his belly and four plump birds flew on the silver choke chain around his neck looks like hed been to a health center eve commented his nose was only slightly swollen whatever bruising there might have been was expertly concealed with cosmetics roarke stood back knowing he wasnt permitted in the room hed seen her work before competent thorough with a gentleness under the professional moves as she tended the dead he watched her run the standard field test to establish time of death recording it herself until peabody and the crime scene techs arrived ligature marks both wrists both ankles indicate victim was restrained prior to death death occurred twentythree fifteen bruising on throat indicates cause of death to be strangulation she glanced up as the buzzer sounded ill let her in roarke said okay roarke she hesitated only a moment he was here after all and he was able can you reactivate the droid bypass the programmed commands i think i could handle that yeah there was very little he couldnt do to bypass security systems she tossed him a can of sealit coat your hands i cant have your prints on it he gave the can a mild look of distaste but carried it with him she turned back to the body continuing her work she could hear the muted conversation in the other room as roarke spoke to peabody moving to the doorway she waited peabody was back in uniform her recorder pinned to her lapel her hair ruthlessly slicked down in its usual straight bowl around her face and her face was pale her eyes horrified oh shit dallas tell me if you cant deal with it i have to know now before you go in shed asked herself the same question over and over since shed received the call because she still wasnt sure of the answer she kept her eyes on eves its my job to handle it i know that i tell you what your job is theres a droid you can work that you can check the links the security discs you can start the doortodoors it was an out she hated herself for wanting to take it wanting to do anything but step inside the room i prefer to work the scene sir eve studied her another moment then nodded engage your recorder she turned and walked back to the side of the bed the victim is holloway brent id established by investigating officer preliminary on body recorded by dallas lieutenant eve subsequent record by peabody officer delia time and apparent cause of death established peabodys stomach jittered when she forced herself to study the body its just like the others apparently sexual molestation has not yet been established nor has the victim been tested for drugs the exposed skin shows signs of disinfectant i can still smell it she took a visor out of her field kit fit it over her head adjusted the power on the eyepieces crime scene techs are late she muttered lights out she commanded and the spotlight beams trained on the bed went dark yeah hes been sprayed down the brushstrokes on the tattoo coincide with those on previous victims its damn good freehand she added with her nose all but pressing on holloways belly what have we got here give me the tweezers peabody i got hair or fiber here without looking back eve held out a hand felt the small metal tool when peabody passed it its white doesnt look manmade holding up the thin strand she studied it through the magnified visor hes got several of these on him i need a bag even as she said it peabody was holding one out id guess santas beard is shedding and he wasnt as careful cleaning up after himself this time carefully eve plucked white strands from the body bagged them he just made his first mistake take the visor eve pulled it off check the bathroom every corner pull the drains and bag the contents i want everything lights on she added missing cissy last night shook him peabody hes getting sloppy o o by the time eve turned the room over to the crime scene team shed found more than a dozen hairs and minute traces of fiber her eyes were dark with purpose when she found roarke with the droid in the playroom did you get it on of course staying comfortably in the bodymold chair he gestured toward the droid rodney this is lieutenant dallas lieutenant the droid was short and squat with a homely face and a clipped voice obviously holloway hadnt wanted any competition even in his electronics what time were you disengaged tonight at ten oh three shortly after mr holloway returned for the evening he prefers that i remain off unless he requires my services he didnt require them tonight apparently not did he have any visitors from the time he returned and you were disengaged no if i may say mr holloway didnt appear to be in the mood for companionship this evening how so he appeared upset the droid claimed then folded his lips rodney this is a police investigation youre required to answer my questions fully i dont understand has there been a burglary no your employer is dead did anyone come to the door before holloway returned i see rodney took a moment as if adjusting his circuits to the news no there were no visitors this evening mr holloway had an outside engagement he returned home at nine fifty he was angry he swore at me i noticed he had some facial bruises and i asked if i could be of assistance he suggested that i fuck myself which is a function i am not programmed to perform he ordered me to go to hell which was not possible then countermanded that order with one to come into this room and shut down for the night i was programmed to reengage at seven am out of the corner of her eye eve could see roarke grinning she ignored him your employer has illegal drugs and pornographic materials on the premises i am not programmed to comment on those matters did he entertain sexual partners here yes male or female both occasionally at the same time im looking for a man approximately six feet tall i believe he has long hands long fingers hes likely caucasian over thirty years of age but probably not more than fifty he has some artistic talent and interest in theater im sorry rodney inclined his head politely that is insufficient data youre telling me eve muttered o o eve waited until the body was bagged and removed theres more to this guy than we have on record she said to roarke look around here you can see he had money and liked to spend it on his face and body he liked to look at himself her gaze scanned the room noting mirrors on nearly every surface he uses a dating service claiming to be straight hetero but his droid says he was bi the dating service screens better than the candidate control division out of east washington but he slips all this by them he finger rapes peabody on their first meet if he did it once he did it before but he gets by with it she paced the living room while roarke said nothing nothing was required he knew she was using him as a bounce for her thoughts maybe hes connected to either rudy or piper a lover or hes helping to fund the place or hes got something on them so they let it all slide this guy wasnt a lonely heart he was a pervert they had to know it at least one of them had to know it she paused by the cabinet empty now of the discs already taken into evidence some of those were homemade jobs i wonder who well find doing nasty things with holloway she looked back at roarke they were alone for the moment but peabody would be back shortly she struggled with the decision then thought of four body bags i have to go in with this i dont know when ill be home he knew her very well he moved close touched a hand to her cheek do you want to ask or do you want me to just do it and tell you after its done she blew out a breath ill ask she jammed her hands in her pockets as she did you can dig beneath the surface of what holloway put on record you can find out in hours what it would take feeney days he cant cut the corners you can i dont have days i dont want this bastard to give me another body to be bagged ill call you when i have something he was making it simple and that only made it worse ill transmit his file when i get into central she began then shut her mouth firmly when he grinned no point in wasting time when i can get it myself leaning down he kissed her i enjoy helping you you just like screwing compuguard and running illegal programs there is that added benefit he laid his hands on her shoulders rubbed briefly at the tension there if you work until you fall on your face im going to be annoyed im still standing i need the car and i dont have time to take you back home i think i can manage to get there he kissed her again before starting toward the door oh by the way lieutenant you have an appointment with trina at six tonight she and mavis will come to the house oh for christs sake ill entertain them if youre running a bit late ignoring her next curse he slipped outside she ended with a hiss then gathered her field kit called to peabody and sealed the scene i want to run the hair and fiber to the lab and light a fire under dickhead she said as they climbed into her vehicle well push the me too though i dont think were going to find out anything from the postmortem that we dont already know o o she slid a sidelong glance at her aide as she drove its going to be a long day peabody you might want to take some approved ups to get through you can requisition some alertall im okay i need you sharp i want you transformed and under by nine you have to pull off your bit with piper well hold the release of holloways name as long as possible i know what to do peabody stared out the window watching the night sweep by there was a lone glidecart on the corner at ninth the operator warming himself in the steam from his grill im not sorry i broke his goddamn nose she said abruptly i thought i would be i thought when i saw him there saw what had been done to him that id be sorry one doesnt have anything to do with the other i thought it would i thought it should i was afraid to go in that room but once i was in there doing the job i didnt feel all the stuff i thought i would youre a cop a good one i dont want to be the kind who stops feeling she turned her head studied eves profile youre not theyre not just slabs to you theyre people i dont want to stop remembering theyre people eve glanced right and left as she approached a red light then seeing her way clear breezed through it you wouldnt be working with me if i thought you would peabody took a long slow breath and felt her stomach settle thanks since youre grateful contact dickhead tell him i want his skinny ass in the lab within the hour peabody grimaced shifted in her seat i dont know if im that grateful make the call peabody if he balks ill take over and bribe him with a case of roarkes irish beer dickies got a weakness for it o o it took two cases and a threat to tie his tongue around his neck but at three am dickie was in his labcoat and testing hair and fiber eve paced the lab barking into her communicator as the assistant me claimed a holiday backup on autopsies look you little drone i can call commander whitney and fry your ass this is priority one you want me to let it drop to the media that my investigation was delayed because some ame wanted to read his christmas cards instead of doing a cut come on dallas im working a double i got stiffs stacked like bricks in the drawers here put my brick on the table and have the report to me by oh six hundred or im coming over there and im going to show you what a y cut feels like she cut transmission and turned around gimme dickie dont crowd me dallas you dont scare me i dont see no priority one tab on this evidence there will be by nine she walked over and gave his hair a hard quick yank i havent had my fucking coffee dickie you dont want to mess with me here jeez get some then behind his microgoggles his eyes were as big as an owls im running the damn stuff arent i you want it quick or you want it right i want it both because she was desperate she walked over and ordered a cup of the lab sludge pretending to be coffee and forced down a swallow hairs human he called out treated with a salon fixer and an herbal disinfectant that perked eve up enough to have her drinking more coffee as she crossed to him what kind of fixer whats it for to preserve color and texture itll keep the white from yellowing or getting stiff two of your samples have some adhesive on one end these hairs likely came from a wig a good expensive one this is real human hair and that puts it highend ill have to run more to tag the adhesive might be able to get you a brand name on the fixer after some more tests what about the fibers the stuff peabody got from the drains i havent done it yet jesus im not a droid okay she pressed her fingers to her eyes i need to go to the morgue make sure holloways on the table dickie she laid a hand on his shoulder he was a pain in the ass but he was the best i need everything you can get me and i need it fast this guys taken out four and hes already looking for number five ill get it to you a hell of a lot faster if you stop breathing down my neck im leaving peabody sir peabody jerked from her doze in a lab chair and blinked blindly were moving eve said shortly dickie im counting on you yeah yeah you know i dont think i got my invite to your big party tomorrow night he smiled thinly musta gotten lost ill make sure we find it after you give me what i need you got it pleased he turned back and bent over his work greedy little bastard here eve pushed the coffee into peabodys hand as they headed back out to the car drink this itll either wake you up or kill you eve badgered the ame until she had confirmed cause of death she stood over his shoulder until hed run the tox test and reported the overthecounter tranq in holloways system back at central she ordered peabody to the cramped area commonly known as the resort it consisted of one dark room with three twolevel bunks while her aide slept eve settled into her office and wrote up the reports she transmitted the necessary copies and fueled herself with more coffee and what might have been a cranberry muffin from the vending machine it was still shy of dawn when her link beeped and roarkes image swam onto her screen lieutenant youre pale enough to see through im solid enough i have something for you her heart bumped once hed know to say nothing more on a logged call im going to try to swing home shortly peabodys down for a couple of hours more you need to go down yourself yeah ive about done all i can here im coming in ill wait up for you she broke the call and left a brief memo for peabody should she wake before eve returned once she was in her car and headed out she put in another call to the lab anything more for me jesus youre relentless tagged your fiber its a sympoly blend trade name wulstrong simulated wool commonly in coats and sweaters this was dyed red like a santa suit yeah but not one of your bellringing suits those poor bastards cant afford this kind of weight and quality this is good shit next best thing to real wool the manufacturers claim its better warmer more durable and blah blah blah thats bullshit cause nothings better than genuine but this is good pricey just like the hair your guy isnt worried about spending credits good nice work dickie you find my invitation dallas yeah it fell behind my desk those things happen get me the results of the drain lift dickie and ill have it messengered over she watched dawn flirt with the eastern sky as she turned toward home o o she knew where to find roarke in a room that shouldnt have existed manning equipment that she shouldnt know about she ignored the kneejerk reaction a cops reaction as she approached the room and laid her palm on the plate dallas lieutenant eve her palm and voiceprints were analyzed quickly and she was cleared inside hed left the curtains open on the wide glass the glass itself was treated no one could see inside the room was large the floor a fancy marble the walls accented with art but for one which was dominated by several screens all but one screen was blank now on that roarke ran stock reports while he sat behind the slick ushaped console toying with an unregistered computer you were faster than i figured there werent that many layers to go through he gestured to a chair beside him sit down eve were they thin enough that i can slide it through indicate i found it myself without falsifying my report his cop roarke thought fondly would always worry about such niceties if youd know just where to look just what to question which i imagine you would have given another day or two sit he repeated and this time took her hand and pulled her into the chair hed tied his hair back which always made her want to tug it free of the thin leather band hed pushed up the sleeves of his black sweater she found herself looking at his hands thinking about his hands gorgeous clever hands she realized she was drifting and snapped herself back when she blinked her vision clear his face was close and one of those gorgeous clever hands held her chin his thumb brushing over the shallow dent in its center nearly went out didnt you i was just thinking uhhuh thinking im going to make a trade with you lieutenant ill give you what ive found if in exchange for it youll be here at six tonight youll take a soother hey im not bargaining for information you are if you want the information i can wipe it he reached out a hand and let it hover over some controls she couldnt identify youll be here take a soother he repeated and let trina give you a full treatment i havent got time for a stupid haircut it wasnt the hair styling he was thinking of but the body massage and relaxation program he was going to arrange thats the deal take it or leave it ive got four murder discs on my desk right at this moment i dont give a damn if you have four hundred whatever your priorities you happen to be mine thats my price do you want the data youre as bad as dickhead i beg your pardon she snorted out a laugh at the insult in his voice then rubbed her hands over her face she really hated when he was right she was running on fumes okay ill take the deal what did you find he frowned at her for a moment then dropped his hand and turned to the screen wall save data on screen four screen off holloway file up on all screens our friend here had a costly id change four years ago under his birth name john b boyd shit she got to her feet and walked closer to the screens to read the first of several police reports sexual offender rape charges dropped by victim coerced sexual partnership convicted six months psych treatment and community service bullshit possession of illegal sexual paraphernalia pleaded out voluntary treatment for sexual obsessions treatment complete records sealed fuck that this guy was twisted and the system let him slide he had money roarke pointed out its easy to buy your way out of midlevel sex charges he slithered his way clear then ends up sodomized and strangled irony eve or justice he should have gotten his justice in the courts she snapped i dont give a damn about irony would personally yours have found this during screening i would have he moved his shoulders it depends on how deep they go but as i said it was only a few layers down any fullsecurity screen would have popped it sealing the records only protects him from a standard employee or credit screen did you get his financials of course subject financials screen six you can see he did very well monetarily at his work had a decent broker who invested well he liked to spend but he had it to spend there are however several reasonably good deposits which are over and above his modeling fees or investment dividends ten thousand at threemonth intervals over a twoyear period yeah again she stepped closer to the screen i see them were you able to trace i wonder why i tolerate these small insults he only sighed when she turned back and scowled at him naturally they were etransfers swung through a variety of sources in a decent attempt to conceal the original source however all of them bounce back to one location she nodded her head personally yours youre an excellent detective so he was blackmailing them or one of them do you have initials of the name authorizing transfer the account is under both names it could have been either piper or rudy their account uses a passcode rather than a signature okay it gives me enough to bring them into interview and cook them awhile she drew a long breath im going to let peabody have a go at them first shake them up then ill move in just make sure youre home by six impatient she turned back to him the morning was breaking light slipping through the treated glass and accenting her pale cheeks and shadowed eyes i made the deal ill keep it of course you will if he had to go down to cop central and carry her out personally chapter thirteen eve decided the best strategy was to hit her targets hard and clean while they were already bruised if peabody played it right rudy and piper would be shaken working frantically to avoid bad publicity and a potential lawsuit brought by a horrified client and when peabody moved out eve thought she would move in at nine thirty she was in the salon showing holloways picture to the reception clerk if it went as timed she would be finishing up when peabody came in and gave her the go signal sure i know mr holloway he had a regular once a week and a standing monthly once a week for what hair style facial manicure massage and aromarelax yvette friendly and helpful now leaned over the counter and let out a little sigh as she studied holloways picture again this guys got a mag shell and he knew how to maintain once a month he got the works full day of treatments same consultant oh sure he wouldnt settle for anybody but simon a few months ago simon took a vacation mr holloway pitched a big one right here in the wait area we gave him a free spin in the mood tube and a deluxe o to chill him down deluxe o o for orgasm honey privacy room with his choice of vr holo or droid lc we arent set up for human licensed companions but we have all the alternatives the deluxe runs five hundred but it was worth it to take him down you gotta keep your regulars happy a client like holloway drops like five thousand a month in here not counting product purchases and theres nothing like a deluxe orgasm to keep the customer satisfied you got it she grinned grateful that eve didnt appear to hold grudges so did he do something you could say that but he wont be doing it again simon around hes back in studio three you dont want to go back there she began when eve turned yes i do eve walked down a short hallway and through frosted glass doors etched with silhouettes of perfect human forms there were muted voices and music the sounds of water splashing tunefully birds chirping breezes blowing she could smell eucalyptus rose musk pastelcolored doors lined both sides through an open one she could see a long padded table and complicated equipment tubes mirrors a small computer station all of which reminded her uncomfortably of a health center as she continued down another door opened and a consultant in a white uniform led a woman covered from head to toe in green glop toward another area studio three corridor to the left the doors marked uhhuh eve watched while the consultant drew her client away telling her that ten minutes in the desert room would make her a new woman it took all eves willpower not to shudder when the corridor forked she saw the large bubbling spa framed with miniature weeping cherry trees three women were already relaxing in it breasts bobbing cheerfully on the surface of the sugarpink froth another woman drifted alone submerged to the chin in the thickened green fluid of a sensory tube just beyond it in what eve supposed was the wet area was a narrow pool called the plunge where the sharply blue water was held at a temperature of thirtysix degrees even looking at it made her teeth chatter she turned left after a quick knock on the eastereggblue door marked three she stepped in it was a tossup who was more surprised herself simon or mcnab who reclined in a relaxation chair with his face coated with what appeared to be black mud this is a treatment area hands flapping simon rushed to block her way youre not allowed in here while im consulting out out out i need to talk to you itll only take a couple minutes im working here simon spread his hands sending a few blobs of mud sailing two minutes she said and had to clamp down on the urge to laugh as mcnab rolled his eyes dramatically behind simons back out out he said again snagging a towel i do apologize he said to mcnab your slather needs to set in any case please just relax let your mind rest ill just be a moment no problem mcnab muttered no no shh with a benign smile simon tapped a finger to his lips no talking let your face relax completely let your mind empty this is your time now close your eyes imagine all impurities flowing out ill be just outside his smile fell away the minute he shut the door and looked at eve i wont have you disturbing my clients sorry but one of your clients was really disturbed last night he wont be coming in for his standing monthly anymore what are you talking about holloway brent holloway hes dead dead brent simon leaned back against the glossy wall the hand he hadnt quite wiped clean pressed against his heart but i saw him only a few days ago there must be a mistake i saw him this morning in a drawer at the morgue theres no mistake i cant breathe cape fluttering simon dashed down the hall eve found him in a plush waiting area collapsed on a silk settee his head between his knees i didnt know you were that close im his was his consultant no one not even a spouse is more intimate she tried to think of intimacy with trina and had to block off another shudder im sorry for your loss simon you want something water yes no oh dear god he lifted his head and reached out with a trembling hand to engage the popup refreshment screen on the table beside him his face was a sickly gray framed by the brilliant red of his hair i need a soother camomile chilled then he leaned back shut his eyes how did it happen were investigating tell me about him tell me who he was involved with he was a very exacting man i respected that he knew precisely how he wanted to appear and was dedicated to maintaining his face his body oh god he snagged the tall slim glass from the server droid the minute it scooted in im sorry dear heart give me just a moment he drank deeply taking slow even breaths between sips some of the color that had washed away from his face came back he never missed an appointment and sent me many referrals he appreciated my work did he hook up with anyone around here on a personal level stylists consultants other clients our staff isnt permitted to date the clientele as to other clients i dont recall him mentioning any he enjoyed women he had a varied and satisfying sexual life he told you about that what is discussed between consultant and client is absolutely sacred simon sniffed once then set his empty glass aside did he go for men too simons mouth flattened he never mentioned an interest in samesex relationships i dont feel comfortable with these questions lieutenant holloways not real comfortable now either she waited a beat saw simon pause take it in then nod youre right of course youre right i apologize its just such a shock did any of your male staff members show an interest in him a romantic or sexual interest no at least i honestly never noticed any signals or vibrations if you will such behavior is soundly discouraged here were professionals right who have you got on staff who does freehand tattoos he sighed long and loud we have several consultants who are excellent freehand body artists names simon ask yvette at the desk shell give you what you need i must get back to my client he pressed his fingers to his eyes i cant allow my personal feelings to interfere with my work lieutenant simon dropped his hands back into his lap and his eyes were dark and damp brent had no family what will happen to his what will happen to him the city will take care of it if theres no one no that wouldnt be right he pressed his lips together then pushed himself to his feet id like to make the arrangements if thats allowed it would be the last thing i could do for him we can work it that way youll have to come down to the morgue fill out the paperwork to the his mouth trembled but he drew in a breath and nodded yes i will ill let them know to expect you because he looked so devastated she added you wont have to see him simon weve done an id already you just make the application and theyll release the body to whatever mortuary or memorial center you choose oh his breath came out in a rush thank you my clients waiting he said dully he hasnt been caring for his skin fortunately hes young so theres a great deal i can do to help its our obligation to present an attractive appearance beauty soothes the soul yeah go take care of your client simon ill be in touch she headed back out and was just taking the printout of names from yvette when peabody came in she looked flushed and holloweyed but she gave eve a quick nod before turning to the desk clerk i have a chit from personally yours she began for the diamond day plan oh thats our very best yvette beamed at her and honey you look exhausted this is just what you need well fix you right up thanks she wandered off ostensibly to study the glass cabinet full of colorful bottles that guaranteed beauty and vitality with regular use in a fast whisper she gave eve her report they were both shaken tried to cover it worked on convincing me id misinterpreted she bit back a snort went into placatetheclient mode like it was programmed promised to look into the matter right away offered me a free second consult and this deal here i saw the brochure the diamond day goes for five thousand i didnt let them off the hook told them i was going to take the day to calm down before i spoke to my lawyer good work talk to as many of the consultants as you can while youre getting slathered and rubbed bring up holloways name i want reactions gossip opinions make sure you get some male consultants in there anything for the job sir ms peabody peabody turned and thought her mouth must have hit her shoes as she stared at the polished golden god im uh yes im anton ill be assisting you with your herbal detox if youd like to come with me now oh yeah peabody managed to shoot eve one sidelong eyeroll before anton took her hand and gently led her away hoping for the best eve tucked the printout in her bag and headed up to the office level of personally yours rudy and piper are unavailable the receptionist announced with just enough snip in her voice to put eves back up oh theyre going to want to become available she slapped her badge on the counter trust me im aware of who you are lieutenant rudy and piper arent available if youd care to make an appointment id be happy to schedule one for you eve leaned companionably on the counter ever hear the term obstruction of justice the womans eyes flickered im just doing my job heres what weve got you clear me through to your bosses now or i take you down to cop central and charge you with obstruction for impeding an officer and for being basically stupid you got ten seconds to decide how you want to play it excuse me the woman turned switched on her headset and murmured into it quickly her face was stiff when she turned back youre to go right in lieutenant there that wasnt such a tough choice was it pocketing her badge eve strode back through the glass doors and met rudy and piper at the doorway of their office was it necessary to bully our receptionist rudy demanded yeah you got a reason for wanting to dodge me this morning were very busy youre about to get busier youll have to come with me come with you piper put a hand on rudys arm why where to cop central brent holloway was murdered last night and we have a lot to talk about murdered piper swayed and might have fallen if rudys arm hadnt whipped up to support her oh god oh dear god like the others was it like the others rudy hush now he drew his sister closer while his eyes held eves it isnt necessary to go into central well thats where we disagree your choice is to come voluntarily or for me to call a few uniforms up here and have you escorted you cant possibly have cause to arrest either one of us youre not being arrested or charged at this time but youre required to come in upon demand for formal interview with piper trembling against him rudy let out a careful breath im going to contact our attorneys you can do that downtown o o okay we keep them separated eve said to feeney as they studied piper through the glass piper sat at the little scarred table in interview a rocking herself as one of the attorneys murmured to her we could double team them but i think we can get more done if we each take one you want her or rudy feeney considered lips pursed ill start with him i say we switch off toss them out of balance once they get used to the rhythm if either of them shake enough then we go in double good enough did mcnab check in just did hes about finished at the salon hell be in and have his report up before were done here tell him to stand by if we get enough here we may be able to juggle a warrant for their computer system if he can work on their machine he might dig something out otherwise she thought she was going to have to ask roarke to work his magic again buzz when you want to switch she told feeney same goes eve pulled open the door of the interview room and stepped inside the lawyer immediately got to his feet puffed out his chest and went into the expected song and dance lieutenant this is an outrage my client is overwrought emotionally distressed you have no cause to demand this interview at this time you want to block it get a court order record on dallas lieutenant eve id bq interviewer subject piper hoffman initial date and time interviewer has requested representation attorney is present these proceedings are being recorded subject hoffman has been read the revised miranda do you understand your rights and obligations ms hoffman piper looked at her lawyer waited for him to nod yes you knew brent holloway she jerked her head into a nod let the record show interviewee answered in the affirmative he was a client of your service personally yours yes through that service you matched the deceased with female clients thats thats the purpose to match couples with common interests and goals to afford them an opportunity to meet and explore relationships romantic and or sexual relationships the tone of the relationships is up to each individual couple or client and these clients are screened before their application is accepted before they pay the fee before they are put on any match lists carefully screened piper seemed to breathe a sigh of relief at the avenue of questioning she straightened a bit skimmed back her silvery hair with long fingers its our responsibility to see that our clientele meets certain standards do those standards include sexual offenders convicted sexual offenders certainly not she went prim head lifting mouth firming thats your company policy a very firm policy but you made an exception for brent holloway i the hands piper had folded neatly on the table clenched to whiten the knuckles i dont know what her voice trailed off and she stared helplessly at her lawyer my client has explained her companys policy in this area lieutenant please move on brent holloway was convicted of sexual coercion was charged more than once with sexual molestation harassment perversions eve spoke briskly as every ounce of color in pipers cheeks drained youve established for the record that your clientele is screened carefully youve explained your policy in this area im asking you why you exempted holloway from this policy we i we didnt her hands began to twist and something like fear moved into her eyes we have no record of that information on brent holloway maybe you recognize the name john b boyd because her eyes were trained on pipers face she saw it the flicker of knowledge the shadow of guilt your system is top of the line so you told me it would be your responsibility to do a search for this kind of information on an applicant is your company irresponsible or inept ms hoffman i dont like the tone of that question the lawyer protested so noted for the record your answer piper i dont know what happened her breath came quickly now and both hands were crossed over her beautiful breasts i dont know oh yes eve thought yes you do and he scared the hell out of you four clients of your service are dead four each one of them came to you and each one of them was terrorized raped and strangled its a terrible terrible coincidence just a coincidence piper began to shake with her breath hitching out in little forced gasps rudy said so you dont believe that eve said it softly as she leaned closer you dont believe that for a minute theyre dead brutally she laid four photos on the table the crime scene shots were vivid and cruel these dont look coincidental do they oh god oh god she covered her face with her hands dont dont dont im going to be ill that was uncalled for redcheeked with fury the lawyer sprang up murders uncalled for eve tossed back and got to her feet ill give your client a few minutes to compose herself record off she turned her back and walked out as she watched through the glass she buzzed feeneys communicator ive got her on the edge she said when he joined her you can push her over id go in light sympathetic be her uncle you always get to be the bad cop feeney complained im better at it pat her hand then ask her why they were paying holloway off i didnt get there yet okay rudys holding tight hes got a snippy attitude you ask me arrogant little putz good im in the mood to kick some putz since it was there she reached into feeneys bag of nuts and popped a handful she claims they didnt know about holloways record shes lying but that might get us into their system ill try for the warrant before i hit rudy she took time for that and one quick jolt of coffee before going into interview b record on she ordered interview continuing with dallas lieutenant eve initialize time and date she sat smiled at rudy and the lawyer at his side well boys lets get started she ran him through a pattern similar to what shed used on piper rather than paling and shaking rudy seemed to go stiffer harder id like to see my sister he said abruptly interrupting her rhythm your sister is being interviewed shes delicate her emotions are very close to the surface this entire ugly business will damage her ive got four people a lot more damaged ace are you worried what piper has to say in there i talked to her just a bit ago instinct had her leaning back shrugging a shoulder shes not holding up real well shell do better once you clear things up eve watched his hands fist and wondered what mira would conclude about his violence potential she should be allowed to rest he bit off the words his exotic green eyes flat as a cats to have a soother and a meditation break were not big on meditation breaks around here and shes got her lawyer in there just like youve got yours i guess youre pretty close being twins naturally holloway ever make a move on her rudys mouth thinned of course not on you maybe no he reached for his glass of water with a steady hand why were you paying him off the water slopped toward the rim before he hastily set it down i dont know what youre talking about regular payments ten thousand each over a twoyear period what did he have on you rudy his eyes stormy he whirled to his lawyer they have no right to access financial records do they certainly not the lawyer leveled his shoulders hooking a hand pompously in his lapel where trendy medallions dangled lieutenant if youve searched my clients financials without probable cause and proper warrant did i say that eve only smiled i dont have to explain how i came by certain information that pertains to this homicide you wont find a departmental search of financials but you paid him didnt you rudy she swung back hitting low and fast you paid him time after time let him blackmail you into putting him on match lists when you knew he was a sexual deviant how many clients did you have to placate or pay or intimidate to keep the wraps on it i dont know what youre talking about but his hand wasnt quite so steady now as he picked up the water in front of him dark red streaks of emotion began to burn along the milkwhite skin eve knew if shed had him on a truth tester the graph would have cracked through the screen yes you do and i bet it wouldnt be too tough for me to dig out a couple of your clients who holloway jumped during one of those nice polite meets you recommend once i do i can charge you and your sister for soliciting for fraud for accessory to several types of sex crimes she shot a look over and your lawyer knows i can make at least some of that stick and itll stick long and hard enough to put your business in the sewer to put your face and pipers on every screen in the city for newsflashes we cant be held responsible she cant be held responsible for what that that deviant did rudy the lawyer held up a hand then laid it on rudys shoulder id like a moment to confer lieutenant no problem record off you got five she warned and left them alone with her eyes on them through the glass she pulled out her communicator mcnab while she waited for response she rocked back and forth on her heels judging the body language inside the room rudy had his arms crossed his fingers digging into his biceps the lawyer was hunched over talking fast mcnab im heading in dallas then head back im getting a warrant to put you into the system at personally yours wait for it can i take a sixeight grab some lunch hit a glidecart on the way back i want you in place the minute the authorization comes in she heard his sigh and smiled thinly how was the facial mcnab great i got cheeks like a babys ass and i saw peabody naked well mostly she was coated with green shit but i got the picture just put that picture out of your mind and get ready to dig i can do both hell of a picture shes really pissed too eve did her best not to grin back at him and shut him off before she lost the battle times up pal she murmured and walked back into interview after resetting the record she sat down lifted a brow sometimes silence worked a subject better than hammering my client wishes to make a statement thats what were here for so what do you have to say rudy brent holloway was extorting money from my company through me i did my best to protect my clients but he was blackmailing me and part of what he demanded was regular consultations and matches he was in my opinion difficult and irritating but not dangerous to the women we matched him with thats your professional opinion yes it is we advise all our clients to meet their matches in a public place any who agreed to meet him privately subsequent to that were making their own decision all clients sign a waiver uhhuh so you figure that covers your ass ethically speaking im pretty sure the courts may have a different view but lets get to the meat first what did he have on you its not relevant oh yeah it is it deals with my personal life it deals with homicide rudy but if you dont want to tell me about it ill go back and talk to your sister she started to rise but rudys hand flew out and gripped her arm leave her alone shes delicate one of you will talk to me your choice his fingers tightened on her arm dug in hard before he released it and sat back piper and i have a unique and special relationship were twins were connected he kept his eyes level were matched you and your sister have a sexual relationship its not for you to judge he snapped nor do i expect you to understand the bond between us no one can and though what we have together isnt strictly illegal society disapproves incest isnt a pretty word rudy the image of her father his face red with effort his eyes hard with purpose flashed into her mind under the table she clenched her hands into fists and forced the image and the sickness it caused back were matched he said again for most of our lives we refused to act on what was in our hearts we tried to be with other people to live separate lives and we were miserable are we supposed to be unhappy unfulfilled because people like you say its wrong it doesnt matter what i say or what i think how did holloway find out it was in the west indies piper and i had taken a vacation wed been careful were discreet we understand that wed lose clients if they knew wed gone away where we could have a little time alone together to be free to be together openly as any other couple can holloway was there he didnt know us nor we him we had registered under different names he paused sipped his water a few months later he came in for a consult it was just fate i didnt even recognize him at first but after his screening when the data on him showed up and we refused his application he reminded us where wed met and how rudy stared into his water shifted the glass from hand to hand he was very clear as to how it would be handled what he wanted piper was destroyed terrified we both believe very strongly in the service we provide you see we know just what it means to be matched with someone who fills your life who makes the difference in it were dedicated to helping others find what we have your dedications earned you a nice fat portfolio making a profit doesnt negate the worth of the service you live well lieutenant he said quietly does that negate the worth of your marriage walked into that one she told herself but only lifted her eyebrows lets talk about you and how you handled holloway i wanted to stand against him but she couldnt he closed his eyes he managed to get her alone to threaten her he even tried to induce her to he opened his eyes again and they were brimming with fury he wanted her his kind they want what belongs to someone else so we paid we did everything he demanded still if he came in and caught her alone he would touch her you must have hated him for that yes yes i hated him for that for everything but most of all for that enough to kill him rudy yes he said evenly before his lawyer could stop him yes enough to kill him chapter fourteen we dont have enough to charge him she knew it damn it she knew it but eve went to battle with the assistant prosecuting attorney anyway hes got the means hes got the opportunity and god knows he had a motive with holloway he had access to the enhancements used on all four victims she continued before apa rollins could speak he knew all of them you dont even have a decent circumstantial case against him carla rollins held her ground she was barely fivetwo despite the skyscraper heels she habitually wore her eyes were the color of blackberries exotically slanted in a round face her complexion was creamy and smooth her figure neat her hair a ribbonstraight ebony that fell precisely one inch above her slim shoulders she looked and sounded like a child care professional and had a core as tough as moon rock she liked to win and didnt see a victory in the state v hoffman you want me to bag him when hes got his hands around the next victims throat that would be handy rollins said evenly barring that get me a confession eve paced the length of whitneys office i cant get you a confession if we spring him so far all hes guilty of is banging his sister rollins said in her soft sweet voice and paying blackmail maybe we could cook him on illegal and unlicensed solicitation since he knew holloways predilections but its a stretch i cant give you murder dallas without more evidence or a confession then i need to sweat him longer his lawyers called for a humane break we cant hold him any longer today she added as eve snorted you can pick him up again tomorrow after the standard twelve hours out i want a bracelet on him this time rollins sighed dallas i dont have cause to order a security bracelet on hoffman at this time at this point hes only a suspect and not a solid one at that hes entitled under the law to his privacy and freedom of motion christ give me something eve dragged both hands through her hair her eyes were burning from lack of sleep her stomach raw from caffeine her stillhealing wound was throbbing i want him tested and profiled i want mira to do him itll have to be voluntary rollins held up one delicate hand before eve could swear at her she was used to cops swearing at her and it didnt particularly bother her but she was thinking and didnt want the interruption i might be able to convince his attorney its in his best interest cooperation in this area would influence the pas office not to pursue the solicitation charges satisfied with the idea rollins rose clear it with mira and ill see what i can do but spring him dallas within the hour whitney waited until rollins breezed out then shifted in his chair sit down lieutenant commander sit he repeated and jabbed a finger at the chair across from his desk im concerned he began when she took her seat i need more time to squeeze him mcnabs working the system at personally yours we could have something by the end of the day you concern me lieutenant he leaned back as eve frowned youve been on this case nearly twentyfour seven for more than a week so has the killer its unlikely the killer is still recovering from lifethreatening wounds received in the line of duty my health charts clear she heard the edge of resentment in her own voice and took a careful breath if she couldnt maintain with whitney shed only prove his point your concern is appreciated sir but unnecessary is it he lifted his brows as his sharp eyes scanned her face pale shadowed running up fast on exhaustion was his considered opinion then youre willing to go down to the clinic and take a physical the resentment bounced back all but vibrating down to the fingers she fought not to curl into fists is that an order commander whitney he could make it so ill give you a choice dallas take the physical abide by the results or go off duty until oh nine hundred tomorrow i dont consider those viable options at this time one or the other or i take you off the case she nearly sprang from the chair he saw her bunch and brace then vibrate but she stayed in her seat color rushed into her face but it didnt stay long hes killed four times and im the only one whos close to knowing him you take me off we lose time and we lose people its your choice dallas go home he said more quietly get a decent meal and some sleep and while im doing that rudy walks i cant hold him i cant bracelet him but that doesnt mean i cant put a tag on him now whitney smiled a little hell be watched and tomorrow well hold a press conference you called that right dallas the mayor and the chief will bare the brunt of it but youll get flack i can handle it i know well release as many details as we can to alert the public he lifted his hand rubbing the back of his neck peace on earth goodwill toward men he let out a short laugh go home dallas youre going to need to be fresh tomorrow she went because the alternatives were unacceptable she couldnt back off from the case and she couldnt risk a departmental physical whatever she said out loud she had a suspicion she wouldnt pass one at the moment she ached all over enough to warn her she was going to have to break down and take a painkiller to get through worse she couldnt quite focus not now that she was in the car and heading home her head insisted on floating somewhere inches above her shoulders when she nearly clipped a glidecart while making the turn onto madison she shifted into auto and let the program guide her through traffic okay so maybe she needed a nap and a little fuel but being off duty didnt mean she couldnt run some more scans and searches it didnt mean she couldnt work on her own from her home office she needed more coffee and something solid in her stomach that was all and she nearly nodded off as the car slid through the gates and up the drive toward the house the lights in the windows blazed against the dark and made her eyes smart her head pounded like the back beat in one of maviss more enthusiastic numbers her shoulder thrummed when she stepped out of the car her legs felt rubbery and disconnected because she felt weak her mood was foul as she pushed through the grand front door and there was summerset your guests have already arrived he announced you were expected twenty minutes ago kiss my ass was her best suggestion as she stripped off her jacket and deliberately dropped it over the newel post the prospect holds no appeal for me one moment of your time however lieutenant he simply stepped in front of her before she could head up the stairs lifes too short to spend a moment with you out of the way or ill take you out she looked ill he thought and her threat lacked its usual bite the book you requested for roarke has been located he said stiffly but his eyes were narrowed as he studied her face oh she braced a hand on the newel post as she tried to get through the fog in her brain to think fine good shall i order it to be shipped yeah yeah thats the idea youll need to transfer the price plus shipping to the book searchers account as the book searcher knows me hes agreed to send the item immediately and trust that youll transfer the appropriate funds within twentyfour hours i noted the details on your email okay fine ill take care of it she had to swallow pride thank you and she turned toward the stairs looked up she thought it would be like climbing a mountain but she couldnt swallow another gulp of pride and take the elevator while he was watching youre quite welcome he murmured then stepped away to the inhouse screen while she moved up the steps roarke the lieutenant is home and on her way up he hesitated then sighed she looks unwell she was going to take a hot shower fuel up and get to work eve calculated she could at least run a probability scan on rudy with the data she had if it clicked she might be able to pressure the pa into slapping a surveillance bracelet on him but when she stepped into the bedroom roarke was already waiting youre late i hit traffic she said as she unhooked her weapon harness strip she knew she was punchy but she was pretty sure this was a first well thats real romantic roarke but strip he said again and picked up a robe put this on trinas set up for you in the pool house oh for christs sake she raked her hands through her hair do i look in the mood for a goddamn beauty session no you look like youre in the mood for a goddamn hospital session temper snapping he tossed down the robe take care of yourself here or thats where youre going her eyes went dark and dangerous dont push me youre my spouse not my keeper a fucking keepers just what you need he grabbed her arm and because her reflexes were slow shoved her into a chair stay down he warned in a voice that sizzled with barely restrained fury or ill tie you down she gripped the arm of the chair fingers digging in as he stalked across the room to the recessed autochef what the hells gotten into you you have you looked at yourself recently you stand over bodies that have more color than you do right now there are shadows under your eyes thick enough to hide in and youre hurting that was what snapped it for him do you think i cant see it he came back with a tall glass filled with amber liquid drink it youre not tranqing me i can pour it down your throat ive done it before he leaned over until their faces were close and the bitter anger in his eyes made her want to shrink away i wont let you make yourself sick youll drink this eve and youll do what i tell you or ill make you we both know youre too damn tired to stop me she snatched the glass and though she thought there would be lovely satisfaction gained from heaving it across the room she didnt think she was up to dealing with the consequences her eyes burned into his over the rim as she gulped it down there happy now youll have something solid later he bent down to tug off her boots i can undress myself shut up eve for forms sake she tried to tug her foot free but he simply held on and pried off her boot i want a shower and a meal and i want you to leave me alone he pulled off the other boot then started on the buttons of her shirt did you hear me i said leave me alone the fact that she could hear the petulance in her own voice only added depression to exhaustion not in this or any other lifetime i dont like to be taken care of it irritates me then youre going to be irritated for quite a while ive been irritated since i met you she closed her eyes on that but thought she caught a nicker of a smile around his mouth he undressed her quickly efficiently then bundled her into the robe the limpness of her muscles told him the painkiller hed added to the nutridrink hed made her was already at work the mild tranq hed laced it with should have done no more than relax her but in her current state he imagined it would knock her out very shortly all for the best still she slapped at him as he lifted her dont carry me i hate to repeat myself but shut up eve he walked to the elevator and stepped inside with her i dont wanna be babied her head spun once one long lilting circle that forced her to let it drop on his shoulder what the hell was in that drink all manner of things just relax you know i hate tranqs i know he turned his head brushed his lips over her hair you can give me grief about it tomorrow will i let you push me round youll get used to it im gonna lie down for a minute thats right he felt her head loll back and the arm around his neck slid off and dangled as he stepped out into the pool house mavis raced out from under the fanning fronds of a palm jesus roarke is she hurt i tranqued her he moved through the lush flowering plants skirted the side of the shimmering waters of the pool and laid his wife on the long padded table trina had already set up man shell be pissed royal when she comes out of it i imagine so gently he brushed the untidy hair back from eves forehead not so tough now are you lieutenant he bent down and kissed her lightly on the lips dont worry about the styling trina she needs relaxation therapy can do trina decked out in a fleshcolored skinsuit with a shimmering purple duster rubbed her hands together but since shes out anyway why dont i give her the works shes always bitching about treatments this way shell be nice and quiet roarke lifted a brow at the gleam in the womans eye and laid a protective hand on eves shoulder keep it simple then remembering who he was dealing with he cleared his throat he didnt mind facing his wifes wrath but not over his passive agreement to having her hair dyed pink why dont i order us down some dinner ill just stick around o o she heard voices laughter all so distant and disconnected in part of her mind eve knew she was fogged out by the drug roarke would pay for that she wished he would hold her again just hold her in that way that made everything inside her stretch and yearn someone was rubbing her back her shoulders the moan of pleasure was trapped in her mind but it was low and it was long she smelled him just a whiff in passing of the scent that was roarke then there was water warm bubbling swirling around her she was floating in it weightless mindless as a fetus in the womb she drifted there endlessly feeling nothing but peace a flash of heat on her shoulder a shock someone was whimpering inside her head then cool cool liquid over the heat soothing as a kiss and under she went again sliding down and down until she rocked on the soft bottom and curled there sleeping deep o o when she surfaced it was dark disoriented she lay very still counting her own breaths she was warm and naked stretched flat on her stomach under the billowing cloud of the duvet home in bed she realized as the last hours of her life slipped in and out of focus trying to bring it clear she rolled over and her legs tangled with roarkes awake his voice sounded alert a little skill of his that was a mild irritation to her what its nearly morning she was indeed warm and naked her skin soft as dewed petals thanks to trina and she smelled like the cool juice of hothouse peaches how do you feel she wasnt entirely sure everything in her was so loose and smooth im fine she said automatically good then youre ready for the final phase of your relaxation program his mouth took hers whispersoft his tongue already sliding in to tangle her mind which had just started to clear clouded again this time with pure and healthy lust hold on im not let me taste you his mouth skimmed down her throat to nibble and destroy touch you his hand glided up to her hip down parted her legs have you when he slipped inside her slowly she was already hot and ready she couldnt see the predawn light was like ink he was a shadow moving over her a steady glorious force moving inside her she tripped over the first peak before she could find the rhythm with long slow torturous strokes he pleasured them both her breathing thickened to match his her hips lifted and fell until their paces meshed now when their mouths met they swallowed each others groans warm soft waves of sensation cradled her then swept her up and over silky crests when she felt his body tense she enfolded him wrapping herself around him welcoming that final thrust that pinned them both to peak he buried his face in her hair and breathed her in you are feeling better he murmured it his breath tickling her skin and making her smile then her mind cleared goddamn it uhoh chuckling he rolled taking her with him until her body was sprawled over his you think its funny she shoved up and away blowing at her hair as she sat up you think its a joke you push me around bully me into taking some tranq i wouldnt have been able to bully you into anything if you hadnt been ready to drop he sat up as well lights ten percent at his order the room filled with a soft glow you look good he said after a moments study of her furious and rested face despite her rather extreme personal taste trina knows what suits you the way her mouth dropped open and her eyes bugged out had roarke fighting back a roar of laughter you let her work on me while i was out you sadistic treacherous son of a bitch she might have taken a swing at him but she was already leaping out of bed toward the mirror the relief that she looked normal fairly much the way she looked every other morning wasnt quite enough to cut through the temper i ought to throw you both in a cage for this mavis was in on it too he said cheerfully she hadnt moved that quickly or easily in several days he noted and her eyes were free of shadows oh and summerset now she had no choice but to sit down she staggered back to the bed and dropped down on the edge summerset it was a horrified croak he worked on your shoulder after i ran a quick diagnostic the muscles had flamed up why the hell dont you take normal steps to deal with discomfort summerset was all she could say hes had medical training as you know he simply treated your shoulder how does it feel maybe it was pain free for the first time in days maybe her entire body felt gloriously energized and fresh that didnt make roarkes methods acceptable she pushed off the bed snagged the robe that was draped over a chair and shoved her arms into the sleeves im going to kick your ass all right he got up agreeably and found a robe for himself itll be a fairer match than it was last night you want to go at me here or down in the gym before the last word was out of his mouth she sprang she came in low he had time to start a pivot but not to complete it and ended up sprawled on the bed his wife on top of him with her knee planted firmly worrisomely between his legs ah id say youre back lieutenant damn right i ought to knock your balls up to your ears smart guy well at least we both got one last use of them first he grinned and risked serious damage then he reached up and feathered his fingers over her cheek and distracted her just enough to allow him to counter the move he flipped her over and pinned her down now you listen the grin was gone whatever it takes is what ill do whenever its needed is when ill do it you dont have to like it but youll damn well live with it he pushed off shifting to the balls of his feet when he saw her eyes narrow with purpose then he let out a sigh and jammed his hands into his pockets bloody hell i love you shed been poised to spring those two sentences said with equal parts frustration and weariness arrowed straight to her heart he stood there his hair tousled from sleep and sex and struggle his eyes deeply blue and filled with annoyance and love everything inside her shifted then settled into the pattern she supposed it was fated for i know im sorry you were right she tunneled her fingers through her hair distracted enough not to see the flicker of surprise on his face i dont like your methods but you were right i was pushing too hard before i was a hundred percent youve been telling me to recharge for days and i didnt want to hear it why i was scared it was hard to admit it even to a man she knew she could tell every secret scared he crossed to her sat down and took her hand in his of what that i wouldnt be able to go back not all the way back that i wouldnt be strong enough or sharp enough to be back on the job and if i couldnt she squeezed her eyes shut ive got to be a cop i have to do the job if i cant ive lost myself you could have talked to me about this i wouldnt even talk to myself about it she rubbed her fingers over her eyes irritated that there were tears brewing behind them since i went back ive been mostly doing paperwork court dates this is my first homicide since i got off disability leave if i cant handle it you are handling it whitney ordered me home last night either that or he was taking me off the case i get here and you threaten to pour drugs down my throat well he gave her hand a sympathetic squeeze that was lousy timing but i believe in both cases it was a matter of wanting you to rest rather than a criticism of your abilities he took her chin in his hand rubbing his thumb over the center dent eve there are times when you are astonishingly unaware of self you push yourself to the wall on every case the only difference with this is that you were physically shaky to begin with youre the same cop you were when i met you last winter and occasionally thats a frightening thought yeah im counting on that she studied their joined hands but im not the same person i was last winter with her fingers linked with his she lifted her head looked into his eyes i dont want to be i like who i am now who we are now good he leaned over to kiss her because were stuck she fisted a hand in his hair to deepen the kiss its turned out to be a pretty good deal but she nibbled lightly at his bottom lip then bit it sharply enough to make him yelp in surprise and pain if you ever again let summerset put his hands on me when im out she rose breathed deeply and decided she felt incredible ill shave you bald in your sleep im starving she said abruptly want breakfast he considered her for a moment then ran a considering hand over his long black hair he was fortunately a very light sleeper yeah i could eat chapter fifteen armed with the results of the probability scan on rudy eve paced dr miras outer office she needed the weight of miras profile on him to yank him back into interview and hopefully into a cell time was passing with or without the tag she expected him to move on to number five that night does she know im out here eve demanded of miras assistant well used to impatient cops the woman didnt bother to glance up from her own work shes in a session shell be with you as soon as possible pumped by refreshed energy eve paced to the far wall and eyed with suspicion a dreamy watercolor of some seacoast town she paced back and scowled at the mini autochef she knew it wouldnt be stocked with coffee mira preferred her patients and associates to sip soothers or tea the minute miras door opened eve whirled and pounced dr mira she broke off when she spotted nadine furst the reporter flushed then straightened her shoulders and met eves annoyed glare dead on if you start going around me to pump my profiler for data youre going to find yourself without a departmental source and up on charges pal im here on personal business nadine said stiffly save the bullshit for your viewing audience i said im here on personal business nadine held up a hand before mira could interfere dr mira counseled me after the incident last spring you kept me alive dallas but she kept me sane now and again i need a little help thats all now if youll get the hell out of my way im sorry eve wasnt sure if she was more surprised or ashamed but neither sensation sat well it was rough on you i know what its like to carry around bad memories im sorry nadine yeah right she jerked a shoulder striding out quickly her heels tapped on tile and the sound echoed away please come in eve mira her face carefully blank stepped back then shut the door behind eve okay i jumped and i shouldnt have she jammed her hands in her pockets to keep from squirming under the air of disapproval mira created with a quiet look shes been nagging me about this case and weve got a press conference set up in a couple of hours i figured she was trying to cut some corners you have difficulty trusting even after a measure of trust has been established mira sat smoothed her skirt you were also quick with an apology that came from the heart you are and always have been a study of contradictions eve im not here on personal business eves tone was flat and dismissive but she glanced back toward the door with concern in her eyes is she okay nadine is a strong and determined woman traits you should recognize i cant discuss this with you eve its privileged yeah she blew out a breath shes pissed at me now ill give her a oneonone and smooth her out again she values your friendship not only the information you give her are you going to sit down i dont intend to scold you eve grimaced then cleared her throat and held out the file she carried i have the probability scan on rudy with current data he comes out at eightysix point six percent thats high enough to poke at him again but i can tie him up tighter after you test him rollins said rudys lawyer popped to it yes i have him scheduled for this afternoon as you flagged it priority one i need to know his head his violence potential so i can put him away long enough for me to dig up evidence i dont think hes going to break or deal if the sister knows anything i can work on her shell fold eventually ill give you what i can as soon as i can i understand the pressure you and your team are under however she added tilting her head you look well rested the last time i saw you i was a little concerned i still think you came back to full duty sooner than was wise you and everyone else then she shrugged i feel good better i had a toplevel relaxation therapy session last night and about ten hours sleep really miras lips curved and how did roarke manage that he drugged me at miras delighted burst of laughter eve scowled figures youd be on his side oh completely how well you suit each other eve its a pleasure to watch what grows between you i look forward to seeing you both tonight the party right whoopee she thought irritably but her mouth twitched when mira laughed again get me that profile and maybe ill be in a party mood o o but she wasnt when she walked into her office and found mcnab rifling through her desk i dont keep my candy stash there anymore ace he straightened so quickly his hip hit the drawer and shoved it closed on his fingers his pained yelp greatly lifted eves mood jesus dallas pouting he sucked his throbbing fingers you might as well blast me as scare me to death i ought to give you a jolt stealing a superior officers candy bars is no small matter mcnab i need my candy fix okay okay trying for contrite he smiled and pulled out her desk chair for her looking good this morning dallas dont suck up mcnab its pathetic she dropped down in her chair and stretched her legs out which bumped her boots against the wall you want to make points give me some news i verified the financials and found eight complaints lodged against holloway buried in the fi file fi fuck it file he said with a quick grin its a place businesses stick cranks and other shit they dont intend to deal with but all eight women were given free perks just like peabody salon treatments or free match lists credit in the boutiques who authorized both of them depending she knew what was up all right i got her initials on three of the complaints okay that puts piper in but it doesnt win us a prize i can use it to squeeze her some something elses a little interesting he said and sat down on the corner of her desk eve eyed him balefully interesting enough for me not to kick your ass off my desk well lets find out i found a memo on donnie ray dated six months ago and updated the first of december eve felt a little tickle under her heart what kind of memo from rudy to the consulting staff donnie ray was not to be put through to piper rudy would do his consults personally or oversee them the update was a little slap restating the original notice and reprimanding some drone who didnt shield a call thats fairly interesting so he didnt want donnie ray sniffing around piper i can use that anything on the other two victims nothing that popped out she drummed her fingers on the desk medical mental or physical treatments theyre both sterilized mcnab squirmed on the desk as he imagined the cold tongue of the laser on his own genitals they opted out of the reproductive market about five years back that follows pipers had regular shrink work weekly sessions at inner balance for as long as they have records on file last year she did a month at one of their retreats on optima ii i hear they do colonies sleep in mood tubes and eat nothing but grain noodles what a party what about him zip well hes going to get some shrink work this afternoon decent job mcnab she looked over as peabody came in good timing the two of you nail down that last piece of jewelry i want to know where he bought those four calling birds he got a little sloppy at the scene maybe he tripped up with the necklace too peabody studiously avoided looking at mcnab but sir im going to squeeze piper so i cant take you with me if you leave the building either of you you leave together she rose if he hasnt picked out number five by now hes looking i want you both where i can find you relax shebody mcnab sneered as eve headed out im a professional bite me though eve managed to swallow a chuckle at her aides use of her own standard response to annoyances she didnt quite make it over mcnabs cheerful where o o eves timing was well calculated if rudys lawyer had any brains hed have his client in some locked room being prompted on the upcoming tests she had she decided at least an hour to rattle piper before she had to get back to central for the press conference this time the receptionist didnt bother to stall but simply cleared her through lieutenant pale holloweyed piper stood at the doorway of the office my lawyer informs me that im not under any obligation to speak with you and advises me against it unless its in formal interview with my counsel present you can play it that way piper we can go in right now or we can stay here be comfortable and you can tell me why rudy didnt want you dealing with donnie ray michael that was nothing distress shimmered into her voice as she linked her hands that was nothing at all you cant make anything bad out of it fine why dont you just clear it up for me so we can put it away without waiting for an invitation eve slipped into the room and took a chair she waited saying nothing and let the little war so obvious on pipers face play out it was just that donnie ray had a little crush on me thats all it was nothing it was harmless then why the staff memos it was just a precaution to avoid any unpleasantness is there often unpleasantness no piper shut the door and hurried over there were spots of agitated color in her cheeks the silvery hair had been twisted back today leaving her face unframed adding a contrast of sophistication and fragility no not at all were dedicated to helping people find pleasantness in companionship romance often marriage lieutenant she steepled her hands folded the fingers down i could show you dozens of endorsements from satisfied clients from people we helped to find each other love true love matters eve kept her eyes level you believe in true love piper absolutely completely what would you do for your true love to keep him whatever i had to do tell me about donnie ray he asked me out a couple of times he wanted me to hear him play she sighed then seemed to melt into a chair he was just a boy lieutenant he wasnt it wasnt the way it was with holloway but rudy felt rightly so that in order to fulfill our obligation to him as a client it would be best if contact with me was eliminated were you interested in hearing donnie ray play a smile ghosted around her mouth i might have enjoyed that if that was all but it was clear that he had hopes for more i didnt want to hurt his feelings i cant bear to bruise a heart and what about yours how does your relationship with your brother sit on your heart i cant wont discuss that with you she sat straight again folded her hands who made the decision that youd be sterilized piper you go too far do i youre twentyeight years old she pushed because shed seen pipers lips tremble and youve eliminated the chance to have children because you cant risk conceiving one with your own brother youve been in therapy for years youve been cut off from developing a relationship with another man you conceal the relationship you do have paid a blackmailer to insure it continued to be concealed because incest is a dark and shameful secret you cant possibly understand oh yes i can but shed been forced eve reminded herself shed been a child shed had no choice i know what youre living with i love him if its wrong if its shameful if its wretched that doesnt change hes my life then why are you afraid eve leaned forward why are you so afraid that youll cover for him even when you wonder if hes killed anything for true love you let holloway prey on your clients and that makes you the same as a pimp for an unlicensed whore no we did our best to find him likeminded women and when you didnt and they complained you paid them off eve finished is that what you wanted to do or was it rudy it was business rudy understands the business better than me is that how you live with it or maybe neither one of you could live with it anymore was he with you the night donnie ray was killed can you look at me and swear he was with you all that night rudy couldnt hurt anyone he couldnt are you so sure so sure youll risk another death if not tonight then tomorrow whoever is killing these people is insane vicious cruel and insane if i thought it could be rudy i couldnt live were part of each other so it would be in me the way its in him i couldnt live she covered her face with her hands i cant stand any more of this i wont talk to you if you accuse rudy you accuse me and i wont talk to you eve rose but paused by the chair for a moment youre not half of a whole piper whatever hes told you if you want a way out i know someone who can help you though she felt it was a useless attempt she took one of her own cards and noted dr miras name and number on the back she left it on the arm of the chair and walked away o o her emotions were in upheaval when she got into her car she took a moment to settle them then glanced at her wrist unit not much time she mused but enough she used her personal portalink rather than her car unit and tagged nadine what do you want dallas im under the gun here the press conference is in an hour meet me at the d and d bring your crew fifteen minutes i cant yeah you can eve broke transmission and drove downtown shed picked the down and dirty club partly for sentiment partly because it would be fairly private on a midweek afternoon and the proprietor was a friend who would see that she wasnt hassled what you doing here white girl crack all six and a half feet of him grinned at her his face was dark and homely his scalp recently shaved and oiled to a mirror gleam he sported a vest of peacock feathers leathers so snug she wondered his balls werent bruised and shinbreaking boots in cherry red got a meet she told him and did a quick scan of the club it was mostly empty but for the six dancers practicing a routine on stage and a scatter of customers who being what they were marked her as a cop in the time it takes to pick a tourists pocket in times square she imagined several ounces of illegals would shortly be swimming into new yorks sewer system you bringing more cops into my place he glanced over as two skinny dealers made a beeline for the johns somebodys business gonna suffer tonight im not here for a bust i got press coming got a privacy room we can use you got nadine coming down now she be fine you use room three honeypot i look out for you awhile appreciate it she glanced over her shoulder as the door opened letting in sunlight nadine and a camera operator it wont take long eve pointed toward the room and strode over and in without waiting for nadines assent you frequent such interesting places dallas wrinkling her nose nadine stared at the stained walls and rumpled bed the only piece of furniture the room could boast you liked the place well enough as i recall enough to strip down to your undies and dance on stage i was impaired at the time nadine said with some dignity when her operator snickered shut up mike you got five minutes eve sat on the side of the bed you can either hit me with questions or ill give you a straight statement im not going to give you more than what well release at the press conference but youll have it on a good twenty minutes before anyone else im also giving you the goahead to use data already discussed why because eve said quietly were friends step outside a minute mike nadine waited until hed finished grumbling and had closed the door behind him i dont want any pity favors thats not what this is you kept the deal holding information until i cleared it im keeping my end thats professional i trust you to report the truth thats professional i like you even when youre irritating thats personal now do you want the oneonone or not nadines smile bloomed slowly yeah i want it i like you dallas and youre always irritating give me a quick rundown of your take on rudy and piper charming absolutely they can spout their company line like champs every button i pushed they came back with the perfect reaction well programmed whos in charge oh he is no question hes a little overprotective of her for a brother if you ask me and its mildly creepy the way they dress alike down to their lip dye but its probably a twin thing did you interview any of the staff sure picked a few consultants at random theyve got a very slick operation going there gossip about the owners nothing but praise i couldnt elbow out one spiteful sentence she cocked a brow is that what youre looking for im looking for a killer eve said flatly lets get this going fine nadine reached back rapping her knuckles on the door to signal mike straight statement with followup questions one or the other dont be so pissy start with the statement nadine glanced at the bed calculating the varied body fluids that might have been spent there and opted to stand o o an hour later eve listened to chief of police and security tibble run nearly the identical statement shed given nadine he had a more impressive style she mused shivering a bit in the cold as hed chosen to give the statement on the steps of the tower where his offices spanned the top of the building air traffic had been rerouted for the thirtyminute event so that only a scatter of skycams and traffic choppers disturbed the sky overhead eve was certain he already knew shed gone onair with the data he could slap her down for it but as she had not been officially barred from preceding him with a statement it would be a waste of time eve knew tibble rarely wasted anything she respected him and respected him more when he managed to give a complete statement while withholding vital pieces of evidence they would need for trial as questions began to bullet out of the crowd of reporters he held up both hands ill turn questions over to the primary investigating officer lieutenant eve dallas he turned then bent down to her ear five minutes and dont give them any more than they already have next time dallas wear a goddamn coat she huddled in her jacket and stepped forward do you have any suspects eve didnt sigh but she wanted to she hated facing the media were questioning several individuals in connection with these cases were the victims sexually assaulted the cases are being handled as sexual homicides how are they connected did the victims know each other im not free to discuss that area of the investigation at this time she held up a hand to cut off the vicious barrage we are however treating the cases as connected as chief tibble stated the investigation thus far points to one killer santa claus is coming to town some comedian called out and set off a wave of laughter in the crowd yeah make a joke of it temper warmed her blood and made her forget her hands were freezing thats easy enough when you havent seen what he leaves behind when you havent had to tell mothers and partners that the person they loved is dead the crowd fell quiet enough that she heard the swish of copter blades overhead i imagine the person responsible for this misery for these deaths will get a big charge out of being played up in the media go ahead and give him what he wants make the murder of four people small and foolish and turn him into a star but inside cop central we know what he is hes pathetic even more pathetic than you ive got nothing more to say she turned ignoring the shouts and all but bumped into tibble inside one moment lieutenant he took her arm steering her quickly through guards and through the reinforced doors well done he said briefly and now that were done with that annoying spectacle i have to play politics with the mayor go do your job dallas and get me this son of a bitch yes sir and find some gloves for christs sake he added as he stalked away eve jammed one hand in her pocket to warm it and took out her communicator with the other she tried mira first and was told the doctor was still in testing she put in the next call to peabody anything pop on the necklace we got a possible baubles and bangles on fifth their jeweler designed and made the necklace this was a one of a kind commissioned theyre checking records now but the clerk said she thought she remembered the customer coming in personally to pick it up theyve got security cameras meet me there im on my way lieutenant she glanced over and into the hollow eyes of jerry vandoren jerry what are you doing here i heard about the press conference i wanted he lifted his hands then helplessly let them fall i wanted to hear what you had to say i listened i want to thank you he trailed off again looking around as if hed turned a corner and found himself on another planet jerry she took his arm guiding him away before the reporters scented fresh meat and pounced on him you should go home i cant sleep i cant eat i dream about her every night mariannas not dead when i dream about her he drew in a shuddering breath then i wake up and she is everyone says i need grief counseling i dont want to be counseled out of my grief lieutenant dallas i dont want to stop feeling what i feel for her it was out of her element she thought this raw desperation that looked to her for an answer but she couldnt turn away from it she wouldnt want you to go on hurting she loved you too much for that but when i stop hurting shell really be gone he squeezed his eyes shut then opened them i wanted just to say i appreciated what you said out there that you werent going to let them turn this into a joke i know youll stop him the plea swam in his eyes you will stop him wont you yeah im going to stop him come on gently she led him toward a side exit lets get you a cab where did you say your mother lived my mother yeah go see your mother jerry go stay with her for a while he blinked at the sunlight when they stepped outside its almost christmas yeah she signaled to a uniform leaning against his cruiser a better bet she decided than a cab you go spend christmas with your family jerry marianna would want you to o o eve had to put jerry vandoren and his grief out of her mind and focus on the next step after fighting through traffic she parked illegally in front of the jewelry store switched her on duty sign to active then bulled her way through the crowd jamming the sidewalk eve imagined it was the kind of place where roarke might breeze in have a glitter catch his eye and drop a few hundred thousand the shop was all pink and gold like the inside of a seashell music the quiet deep sort that made her think of churches hummed in the rarified air the flowers were fresh the carpet thick the guard at the door discreetly armed because he gave her jacket and boots a sneer of disdain she badged him it gave her a petty pull of satisfaction to see the sneer vanish she breezed by him her battered boots silent on the shellpink carpet a quick scan showed her a woman wrapped in miles of mink seated on a thickly padded chaise debating over diamonds or rubies a tall man with silvered hair with a topcoat folded neatly over his arm perusing gold wrist units two more guards and a giggling blonde being treated to a shopping spree by a pouchy man old enough to be her grandfather he obviously had more money than sense she tagged the security cameras little pinhole lenses tucked in the carved molding that framed a coffered ceiling a fluid spiral of stairs arched to the right or if madam was too weary from carting around pounds of gold and stones she was welcome to use the shining brass elevator only the weight of the diamond between her breasts prevented eve from a sneer of her own it was faintly embarrassing to know that roarke could buy everything in the place and the building it was housed in she approached a beveled glass counter where bracelets studded with colored gems were artfully draped and sized up the clerk behind the counter he didnt appear particularly thrilled to see her he was as polished as his wares but his mouth was pinched his eyes bored and his voice when he spoke dripped with sarcasm may i help you madam yeah i need the manager he sniffed inclining his head so that the lights gleamed on his gilt hair is there a problem that depends on how quickly you get me the manager now his mouth drew in as if something not quite fresh had landed on his tongue one moment and please dont touch the display case its just been cleaned little bastard eve thought mildly she managed to put half a dozen fingerprints on the sparkling glass by the time he came back with a slim attractive brunette good afternoon im ms kates the manager may i help you lieutenant dallas nypsd because the womans smile was a great deal warmer than her clerks eve held her badge at counter level and blocked it from the clientele with her back my aide called in earlier regarding a necklace yes i spoke with her shall we talk in my office fine she glanced around as peabody and mcnab came in saying nothing she signaled them to follow i remember the necklace distinctly kates began as she led them into a small feminine office she gestured toward two highbacked chairs before taking a seat behind a desk my husband designed it on commission i havent been able to reach him im sorry but i believe i can give you any information you need you have the paperwork on it i do i looked up the disc and printed out a hard copy for you efficiently she opened a file checked the contents then passed it to eve the necklace was done in fourteencarat gold interlinked chain choker length with four stylized birds a charming piece it hadnt looked so charming eve mused wrapped around holloways bruised neck nicholas claus she murmured reading the customers name she supposed hed thought of it as irony did you get id it wasnt necessary the customer paid in cash a twenty percent deposit on order the remainder on completion kates folded her hands i recognize you lieutenant am i to assume this necklace is part of a murder investigation you can assume that this claus he came in personally yes three times that i recall kates lifted her folded hands tapped her fingers against her mouth then lowered them again i spoke to him myself on his first visit about average height i suppose perhaps a little taller slender but not thin graceful she said after a moments thought very well presented dark hair rather long with silver streaks i remember him as very elegant very polite and very specific about his needs give me his voice his voice kates blinked a moment i cultured id say faintly accented european i suppose quiet im sure id recognize it again i remember taking a call from him and knowing who it was the minute he spoke he called in once or twice i think to check on the progress of the necklace im going to need your security discs and your link logs ill get them for you she got immediately to her feet it may take a little time mcnab give ms kates a hand with that sir he had to know wed check eve said to peabody when they were alone he left the necklace at the scene a one of a kind he commissioned himself he had to know wed track it here maybe he didnt think wed move this fast or that kates would have such a good memory no dissatisfied eve rose he knew this is just where he wants us to be its another show he played a role here and he doesnt look like the man were going to see on those discs any more than he looks like santa claus she paced to the door back again different props different costume different stage but its just his show he covered his ass peabody but hes not as smart as he thinks he is the voice prints from the link logs are going to nail him chapter sixteen jesus dallas feeney shrugged the shoulder she was leaning over stop breathing down my neck sorry she leaned back one stingy inch how long does it take to program the print into this thing twice as long as it would if you werent nagging on me okay okay she backed off stalked to the window of the conference room its sleeting she said more to herself than him traffics going to be ugly later traffics always ugly this time of year too many damn tourists i tried to do a little shopping last night wife wants this sweater thing people are like wolves on a dead deer out there im not going back video shoppings easier yeah but the fucking circuits are jammed everybody and his cousins on trying to scoop up bargains i dont come up with a dozen pretty boxes under the tree for her im bunking in the den till spring a dozen mildly horrified she swung back around you have to buy her more than one man dallas are you green in the marriage area he snorted working manually on the programming one present dont mean dick quantity pal think quantity great terrific im sunk you got a couple of days left and here we are her shopping dilemma cleared from her mind as she rushed back run it im getting to it heres our man on the link is mr or mrs kates available i cut out the other voices thats your pauses feeney explained good morning ms kates this is nicholas claus i wondered how the work on my necklace is progressing i can run the rest but thats enough for a match the accents vague eve mused he doesnt put a lot on it thats smart you got rudy in there coming up this is from the interview tape just him we advise all our clients to meet their matches in a public place any who agreed to meet him privately subsequent to that were making their own decision now we got prints this baby computes everything pitch inflection cadence tonal quality dont matter a damn if you disguise your voice its as reliable as fingerprints and dna you cant fake it shift to subject a graft style on screen and on audio working eve listened to the link call watched the lines of color skim and jump along the screen split the screen she told him put the interview blurb up under that one just hold on feeney ordered the function then pursed his lips got a problem here what whats wrong with it meld prints on screen he ordered then sighed as the points and valleys clashed they dont match dallas they arent even close you got two different voices here shit she tunneled her fingers through her hair because she could see it for herself her stomach started to burn let me think okay what if he used a distorter on his end of the link he could mess it up a little but id still get match points best i can do is ran a scan search for any electronic masking clean it out if i find it but ive seen enough of these to know when im looking at two different guys he sighed and sent her one of his mournful looks sorry dallas this sets things back a ways yeah she rubbed her eyes run the scan anyway will you feeney how about the featurebyfeature from the videos its coming coming slow i can run rudys ear shape eye shape against it lets go that route too im going to check with mira see if the profiles done to save herself time eve called miras office the doctor was gone for the day but a preliminary report had been transmitted to eves office link she headed over trying to pick apart the voice prints as she went the guy was smart she mused maybe hed figured on a voice print analysis anticipated it and found a way around it what if hed had someone else call the jewelers and that was reaching she admitted but it wasnt impossible she heard what she would have sworn was a giggle and stepped inside her office to see peabody chatting amiably with charles monroe peabody sir peabody sprang instantly to her feet and to attention charles ah mr monroe has some wanted to restrain your hormones officer charles dallas he smiled rising from his seat on the arm of her one pathetic chair your aide kept me company charmingly while i waited for you i bet whats the deal it might be nothing but he shrugged one of the women from my match list got in touch a couple of hours ago it seems her date for a jaunt upstate this weekend hit a snag she thought i might like to substitute though we didnt really connect before thats fascinating charles impatient to get on with her work eve dropped into a chair but i dont feel qualified to give you advice on your social life i can handle that on my own as if to prove it he winked at peabody and had her going rosy pink with pleasure i was toying with the idea of taking her up on it but knowing how things can go i chatted her up awhile to get a feel for it is there a point to this he leaned forward i like my moment in the sun lieutenant sugar both of them ignored peabodys gasping snort at the term she started unloading shed had a big bustup with the guy shed been seeing dumped all the crap on me she caught him cheating on her with some redhead then she tells me how he thought he could make up for it by having santa bring her a present last night eve sat up slowly and now her attention focused in keep going i thought that would do it with satisfaction charles leaned back she says the doorbell rings about ten last night and when she looks out theres santa with a big silver box he shook his head i have to tell you with what i knew my heart just about stopped but shes rambling on about how she wouldnt give the cheating bastard the satisfaction of opening the door she didnt want his pitiful makeup gift she didnt let him in eve murmured and i figure that was why she was alive to call me and bitch you happen to know what she does for a living shes a dancer ballet yeah that works eve murmured i need a name and address peabody ready cheryl zapatta shes on west twentyeighth thats all ive got well find her look i dont know if i did the right thing but i told her your oneonone with nadine furst had just run so i figured it was out i told her to turn on her screen and i filled her in he blew out a breath she panicked big time said she was getting out i dont know if youre going to find her for a while if shes scrambled we can get an order to enter and search you did the right thing charles eve said after a moment if she hadnt heard the report she might have had a change of heart and opened the door the next time i appreciate you coming in anything for you lieutenant sugar he got to his feet can you let me know what happens watch your screen eve advised yeah uh would you mind showing me the way out officer he sent a killer smile at peabody im a little turned around sure lieutenant go ahead eve waved them away then dived into miras report engrossed and frustrated she didnt notice that it took peabody twenty minutes to show charles to his choice of people glide or elevator shes cleared the son of a bitch eve sat back scrubbing her face over her hands when peabody came back in ive got nothing to hang on him rudy his personality index doesnt fit the profile his capacity for physical violence runs low on the scale hes devious intelligent obsessive possessive and sexually limited but in the doctors opinion he isnt our man damn it his lawyer gets a copy of this i wont be able to touch the little creep are you still looking at him for it i dont know what im looking at she tried to keep her head and her temper clear we go back and we start over from the beginning we reinterview starting with the first victim o o at eight fortyfive eve charged up the steps she was already irked as summerset had greeted her in the foyer with his bilious stare and the comment that she had precisely fifteen minutes to make herself presentable before guests began to arrive it didnt help to race into the bedroom and find roarke showered and dressing ill make it she blurted out and dashed into the bath its a party darling not an endurance test he wandered in behind her mainly for the pleasure of watching her strip take your time yeah like im going to walk in late and give that buttface another reason to complain about me shower all heads full oneohone degrees you arent required to meet summersets approval he leaned idly against the wall to watch her she showered as she did nearly everything quickly and efficiently no wasted time or moves in any case people traditionally arrive late for affairs like this im just running a little behind she hissed as shampoo ran into her eyes and stung i lost my prime suspect and im starting from scratch she sprang out took a step toward the drying tube then stopped shit am i supposed to put that glop on my hair when its wet or when its dry having a fairly good idea which glop she referred to roarke plucked a tube from the shelf and poured a dab in his palm here allow me the way his hands moved through her hair made her want to purr but she eyed him narrowly dont mess with me pal i dont have time for you i have no idea what you mean enjoying himself he chose another tube and poured a generous pool of body lotion into his hands im simply helping you get ready he began as he slid his slickened hands over her shoulders her breasts since you seem frazzled look then she closed her eyes and sighed when his hands slithered down to her waist slipped over her butt i think you missed a spot careless of me he lowered his head sniffed at her throat and bit want to be very very late yeah but im not going to she wiggled away and leaped into the drying tube but dont forget where you left off a pity you didnt get here twenty minutes ago having decided that watching her wasnt going to help his blood cool he strolled back into the bedroom i just have to gunk up my face some she whipped out of the tube and dashed for the mirror without bothering with a robe what am i supposed to wear to something like this i have it she stopped fumbling ineptly with her lash dye and scowled do i pick out your clothes eve please she had to laugh okay bad example but i dont have time to think of another one solving the problem of hairstyle by skimming her fingers briskly through what she had she turned into the bedroom to see roarke studying what she supposed some people would call a dress get out of here im not wearing that mavis brought it by the other night leonardo designed it for you itll look very good on you she frowned at the fluid panels of silver held together on the sides by thin sparkling straps the straps were repeated at the shoulders catching a drape of fabric in the front and much much lower in the back why dont i just go naked and save time lets see how it looks what do i wear under it he tucked his tongue in his cheek youre wearing it jesus christ with ill grace she stepped into it wiggled it up the material was soft as a waterfall and clung like a lover the seductive side slashes exposing smooth skin and slender curves darling eve he took her hand turning it over to nuzzle the palm in one of the gestures he used to turn her legs to putty sometimes you take my breath away here try these he took a pair of diamond drop earrings from the dresser and handed them to her were these already mine or what now he grinned youve had them for months no more presents until christmas she fastened them on and decided to take it philosophically when he selected her shoes theres no place in this thing to keep my communicator im on call here he offered her the ridiculously small evening bag that matched the shoes anything else youre perfect he smiled when he heard the beep that signaled the first car arriving at the gate and prompt lets go down so i can show off my wife im not a poodle she muttered and made him laugh o o within an hour the house was full of people and music and light scanning the ballroom eve could only be grateful roarke never expected her to have any input into the preparations there were huge tables groaning under silver platters of food honied ham from virginia glazed duck from france rare beef from montana lobster salmon oysters harvested from the rich beds on silas i an array of fresh vegetables picked only that morning and cleverly arranged in patterns desserts that would tempt a political prisoner from a hunger strike surrounded a threefoot tree fashioned out of sinfully rich cake and hung with gleaming marzipan ornaments she wondered that it could still amaze her what the man she had married could conjure a soaring pine decorated with thousands of white lights and silver stars stood at either end of the ballroom the floortoceiling windows showed not the nasty sleet that hissed over the city but a hologram of a dreamy snowscene where couples skated on a silver pond and young children raced down a gentle slope on shiny red sleds such details she thought were so utterly roarke hey sweetheart all alone in this palace she arched a brow when she felt the hand on her bottom and turned her head slowly to stare at mcnab he went red then white then red again christ lieutenant sir your hands on my ass mcnab i dont think you want it to be there he snatched it away as if scorched god man shit beg your pardon i didnt recognize you i mean he jammed the hand he sincerely hoped shed allow him to keep in his pocket i didnt know it was you i thought you look words failed him i believe detective mcnab is trying to compliment you eve roarke slipped up beside them and because it was too much to resist stared hard into mcnabs panicked eyes werent you ian yeah that is and if i believed hed realized it was your ass he was fondling id just have to kill him right here roarke reached out and flicked at the strings of mcnabs snazzy red tie right now oh id have already taken care of that myself eve said dryly you look like you could use a drink detective yes sir i could roarke why dont you take care of him mira just came in i want to talk to her delighted roarke draped an arm around mcnabs shoulder and squeezed just a little harder than comfort allowed it took longer than eve liked to make her way across the room it amazed her how much people wanted to talk at parties and about nothing in particular that was delay enough but she caught sight of peabody looking very unpeabodylike in sweeping evening pants of dull gold and a trim sleeveless jacket her bare arm was tucked comfortably through charles monroes mira eve decided could wait peabody dallas wow the place looks amazing yeah eve shifted her gaze and pinned charles with angry eyes monroe fabulous home youve got lieutenant i dont recall your name on the guest list peabody colored stiffened the invitation said i was free to bring a date is that what this is she asked keeping her eyes on charless a date yes he lowered his voice as a flicker of hurt clouded his eyes delia is aware of my profession are you giving her the cops standard discount dallas horrified peabody stepped forward its all right charles tugged her back im on my own time dallas and hoping to spend a pleasant evening with an attractive woman whose company i enjoy if youd rather i leave its your house your call shes a big girl yes she is peabody murmured just a second charles she added then gripped eves arm and tugged her aside hey no you hey fury bubbled into her voice as peabody boxed eve into a corner i dont have to clear my personal time or relationships with you and you have no right to embarrass me wait a minute im not done later peabody would recall the look of speechless shock on eves face but at the moment she was too revved to notice or react to it what i do off duty has nothing to do with the job if i want to take on table dancing in my personal time its my business if i want to pay six lcs to fuck me blind on sundays its my business and if i want to have a civilized date with an interesting attractive man who for some reason wants to have one with me its my business i was only im not done peabody said between clenched teeth on the job youre in charge but thats where it ends if you dont want me here with charles then well leave as peabody turned on her heel eve snagged her wrist i dont want you to leave her voice was quiet controlled and stiff as a petrified board i apologize for stepping into your personal life i hope it doesnt spoil your evening excuse me hurt unbelievably hurt she walked away her stomach was still jittering with it when she found mira i dont want to take you away from the party but id like a few minutes in private of course concerned by the dark eyes and pale cheeks mira reached out what is it eve in private she repeated and ordered herself to bury her feelings as she led the way out we can talk in the library oh the minute she stepped inside mira clasped her hands in sheer pleasure what a marvelous room oh what absolute treasures not enough people appreciate the feel and the smell of a real book in their hands any longer the delight of curling into a chair with the warmth of one instead of the cool efficiency of a disc roarkes into books eve said simply and shut the door the testing on rudy i question some of your findings yes i thought you might mira wandered through admiring then settled onto a soft leather chair smoothing the skirt of her rosepink cocktail suit hes not your killer eve nor is he the monster you want him to be it has nothing to do with what i want his relationship with his sister disturbs you on a deep and personal level she isnt like you though she isnt a child she isnt defenseless and while i do believe he has an unhealthy measure of control over her she isnt being forced he uses her yes and she him its mutual i agree that he is obsessive when it pertains to her he is sexually immature the very thing that eliminates him from your lists eve is the fact that i strongly believe he is impotent with anyone but his sister he was being blackmailed and the blackmailer is dead a client was hitting on his sister that client is dead yes and i admit that with that evidence i was prepared to find him capable of those murders he isnt he has some potential for physical violence when roused when threatened but its a flash its immediate it isnt in his makeup to plan to orchestrate to complete the kind of killings youre dealing with then we just turn him loose eve walked away let him go incest is against the law but it has to be proven to be coerced this isnt the case i understand your need to punish him and to in your mind release his sister from his hold this isnt about me oh i know that eve because it hurt her heart to watch she reached up to take eves hand and stop the restless pacing dont keep punishing yourself i focused on him because of this i know i did suddenly weary she sank down beside mira and because i did i might have missed something some detail that would have led to the killer you followed very logical very clearcut steps he had to be eliminated from the list but i took too long to do it and every time my gut told me i was looking at the wrong man i ignored it because i kept seeing myself id look at her and id think way back in my mind id think that could be me if i hadnt killed the son of a bitch that could be me she lowered her head into her hands then dragged them back through her hair christ im messing up all over the damn place how theres no point in getting into this mira merely stroked eves hair how i cant even seem to handle a perfectly ordinary holiday just the thought of trying to figure out what to do what to buy how to act makes my stomach ache oh eve laughing lightly mira shook her head christmas drives nearly everyone half crazy with just those problems its absolutely normal not for me it isnt i never had to worry about it before i didnt have so many people in my life now you do mira smiled indulged herself by stroking eves hair again who do you want to get rid of i think i just managed to kick peabody out disgusted eve shot to her feet again she comes in with an lc oh hes basically okay but hes a goddamn whore a great looking slick amusing one it disturbs you mira suggested that you like him on one level and despise him for what he does for a living this isnt about me its about peabody he says he wants a real relationship and shes got stars in her eyes over him and shes majorly pissed at me because i said something about it lifes messy eve and im afraid youve gone and carved yourself out a life with all the conflicts and problems and hurt feelings that entails if shes angry with you its because theres no one she admires or respects more oh christ being loved is a heavy responsibility youll mend your fences with her because she matters to you im getting damn crowded with people who matter the house screen across the room blinked on summersets pinched face filled it lieutenant your guests are inquiring about you fuck off she smiled thinly as mira swallowed a laugh at least thats one person i dont have to worry about mattering but i shouldnt have busted up your evening you havent i enjoy talking with you well eve started to stick her hands in her pockets remembered she didnt have any and sighed would you mind hanging out here for a minute theres something i want to get from my office all right may i look through the books sure help yourself not wanting to take the time to go out and down the stairs eve slipped into the elevator she was back in less than three minutes but mira was already cozied into a chair with a book jane eyre she sighed as she set it aside i havent read it since i was a girl its so wrenchingly romantic you can borrow it if you want roarke wouldnt mind i have my own copy i just havent taken the time but thank you i wanted to give you this its a couple of days early but i might not see you feeling ridiculously awkward she held out the elegantly wrapped box oh how sweet of you with obvious delight mira clasped the box in her hands may i open it now sure thats the deal right she shifted her feet then rolled her eyes as mira delicately untied the fussy bow and painstakingly unfolded the corners on the paper drives my family crazy too she said with a laugh i just cant bear to rip in then i save the paper and ribbon like a pack rat i have a closet full of it which i constantly forget to reuse but she trailed off as she opened the lid and found the bottle of scent inside why its lovely eve it has my name etched on it its this personalized sort of fragrance you give the guy physical and personality traits then he creates an individual fragrance charlotte mira murmured i wasnt sure you knew my first name i guess i heard it somewhere mira blinked at sentimental tears its wonderfully thoughtful she set the bottle down and turned to draw eve into a hug thank you swamped with warmth and embarrassment eve let herself be held im glad you like it im pretty new at this kind of thing you did very well she drew back but caught eves face in her hands im so fond of you now i need the powder room because another of my christmas traditions is to weep a little over my gifts i know where it is she added patting eves cheeks lightly you go dance with your husband and drink a little too much champagne the world outside will still be there tomorrow i need to stop him and you will but tonight you need your life go find roarke and take it chapter seventeen eve did what the doctor ordered it wasnt such a bad deal she decided getting a little lightheaded swaying in roarkes arms to some sort of dreamy music in a room filled with color and scent and light i can live with it she murmured hmm she smiled as his lips skimmed her ear i can live with it she repeated drawing back enough to look at his face all the roarke stuff well his hands stroked up her back then down again thats good to know you got a whole bunch of stuff roarke i do indeed have a whole bunch of stuff and a wife he thought with an amused glint in his eyes who was heading toward drunk sometimes its spooky but not now now its pretty nice sighing she rubbed her cheek against his what kind of music is this do you like it yeah its sexy twentieth century primarily the nineteen forties it was called big band thats a hologram of tommy dorseys band doing this little number moonlight serenade thats a million years ago almost how do you know all that stuff anyway maybe i was born out of my time she sighed in his arms as the music swelled no you hit your time just right she tilted her head on his shoulder so she could watch the room everybody looks happy feeneys dancing with his wife mavis is sitting on leonardos lap in the corner over there with mira and her husband theyre all laughing mcnabs hitting on every woman in the room and giving peabody the hairy eyeball while he sucks down your scotch idly roarke glanced over lifted a brow trinas got him now jesus shell eat that boy alive he doesnt look worried about it she leaned back again its a nice party the music changed a quick beat bouncing out eves mouth dropped open holy shit look at dickhead whats he doing grinning roarke slipped a hand around eves waist turning so they were hip to hip i believe its called jitterbug stunned she watched the lab chief tug and pull nadine furst around the room spinning her out whipping her back yeah i can see why i can never get him to move that fast in the lab whoa her eyes widened as dickie shoveled nadine through his legs nadine let out a burst of laughter as her feet hit the floor again and the crowd roared with approval eve found herself grinning leaning companionably against roarke looks like fun want to try it oh no but she laughed and began to tap her foot watchings just fine is that mag or what mavis bounced over pulling leonardo after her whoda thought nadine could move like that frigid party roarke its iced thanks youre looking festive mavis yeah we call it my gay apparel she laughed and did a quick twirl to show off the multicolored panels that fluttered from breast to ankle the movement parted them revealing flashes of skin that had been dusted with gold and matched her hair which fountained out from a wild topknot leonardo thought yours should be more refined she told eve no one shows off my designs as well as you and mavis towering over them leonardo smiled his gorgeous smile merry christmas dallas he bent down to kiss her cheek we have something for you both of you just a token he took a package from behind his back and put it in eves hands mavis and i are having our first christmas together thanks in a large part to you his gold eyes misted because she couldnt think of what to say eve set the package on one of the banquet tables and began to unwrap it inside was a box of carved and polished wood its brass hinges gleaming its beautiful open it up mavis prompted all but bouncing tell them what it means leonardo the woods for friendship the metal for love he waited until eve opened the lid to reveal the two silklined compartments within one part is for your memories the other for your wishes he thought of it mavis squeezed leonardos big hand isnt he mag yeah eve managed to nod its great really great understanding his wife roarke touched a hand to her shoulder then stepped forward to extend the other to leonardo its a lovely gift a perfect one thank you and with a smile he kissed mavis both of you now you can make a wish together on christmas eve delighted mavis threw her arms around eve held hard then swung back to leonardo lets dance im going to get sloppy eve murmured when her friends moved off its the season for it he lifted her chin smiled into her swimming eyes i love watching you feel riding the emotion she cupped a hand around the back of his neck and drew his mouth down to hers a long warm kiss that soothed rather than excited she was smiling when she drew back thats the first memory for our box lieutenant eve turned clearing her throat as she looked at whitney embarrassment fluttered as she thought of him catching her with her eyes wet and her mouth still soft from roarkes sir im sorry to disrupt things he offered roarke an apologetic glance ive just received word that piper hoffman has been attacked the cop snapped back into place do you have her location shes on her way to hayes memorial hospital her condition is unknown at this time is there a private place i can fill you and your team in on known details my office ill take the commander down roarke said get your people o o she was attacked in the living quarters above personally yours whitney began out of habit hed placed himself behind the desk but he didnt sit at this time its believed she was alone the responding uniform reports that it appears her brother walked in during the assault the assailant fled was the witness able to id eve demanded not as yet hes at the hospital with his sister the scene has been secured ive ordered the uniforms to leave it undisturbed and await your arrival ill take feeney well go to the hospital first she caught peabodys quick jolt of shock but kept her eyes on whitney i dont want to break peabodys and mcnabs cover at this time i prefer for them to remain here in contact until i move on the scene its your call whitney said simply and it was one he agreed with weve got witnesses this time and hes on the run hes scared he cant be sure he wasnt made and if piper stays alive this makes his third miss she turned to her team ive got to change out of this thing feeney ill be downstairs in five minutes peabody contact the hospital and see what you can find out on the victims status mcnab ill have a uniform bring you the security discs i want them run before we get back dallas whitney said as she strode to the elevator lets cage this bastard in one of these days feeney said as they walked down the hospital corridor im going to leave one of your parties with my wife cheer up feeney we mightve just caught the break that will put this away and give you a nice cozy christmas yeah theres that someone moaned behind an opened door as they passed and had feeney hunching his shoulders too many broken bodies around here to suit me the way the roads are tonight theyve probably been hauling in traffic accidents all night cheerful thought theres rudy ill take him see if you can find her attending and an update one look at the man slumped in a chair with his head in his hands and feeney couldnt have been happier to be somewhere else hes all yours kid they parted ways with eve going straight ahead until she stopped in front of rudy he lowered his hands slowly staring at her boots first then gradually lifting a face dominated by devastated eyes he raped her he raped her and he hurt her he tied her up i heard her crying i heard her begging and crying eve sat beside him who was he i dont know i didnt see i think he must have heard me come in he must have heard me i ran into the bedroom and i saw her oh god oh god oh god stop snapping out the order she took his wrists to drag his hands away from his face again that wont help her you came in and heard her where had you been shopping christmas shopping a single tear slid out of his eye and down his cheek shed seen a sculpture a fairy at a pond she left hints around the apartment a little sketch of it the address of the gallery everythings been so confused that i hadnt had time to buy it until tonight i never should have left her alone she could check on the gallery the timing and be certain eve thought be certain the man whod put piper in the hospital wasnt sitting beside her she knew she knew better than to let anyone in why would she have let her attacker in was the door secured when you got there yes i coded in then i heard her crying calling out i ran in his breath hitched he closed his eyes fisted his hands i saw her on the bed she was naked her hands and feet tied i think im not sure but i think i saw something out of the corner of my eye a movement or maybe i just sensed it then someone shoved me and i fell my head absently he lifted a hand to the side of his head i hit it on something the footboard i dont know i might have been out for a few seconds it couldnt have been long because i heard him running away i didnt go after him i should have but she was lying there and i couldnt think of anything but her she wasnt crying anymore i thought i thought she was dead you called for mts an ambulance i untied her first covered her i had to i couldnt stand then i called i couldnt wake her up i couldnt she never woke up and now they wont let me see her this time when he covered his face with his hands eve let him weep spotting feeney she rose and met him halfway shes in a coma he began doctors figure it for extreme shock rather than physical she was raped sodomized wrists and ankles abraded a couple of bruises they did a tox she was tranqd same overthecounter shit the tattoos on her right thigh they got a prognosis they say they cant do anything lots of medical mumbo but basically the girls closed herself up shell come back when and if she wants to okay were useless here lets put a uniform on her door and another on the brother you still looking at him dallas she glanced back watching him sob the stir of pity surprised her no but well put one on him anyway she took out her communicator and sent out the orders as they headed toward the elevator guys pretty busted up feeney commented wonder if hes crying over his sister or his lover yeah its a puzzle all right she stepped into the elevator and requested the street level so how did our man know shed be alone tonight he wouldnt have tried her if hed thought rudy was with her not his style he knew she was alone someone she knew couldve been watching the place couldve called and checked yeah he knew her knows them both and i dont think she was one of his true loves she stepped out into the lobby turned toward the doors she breaks pattern there piper isnt on any of the match lists he went for her to keep us focused on rudy heres how it plays for me she paused while they climbed into the car eve taking the wheel he knows weve had rudy into interview that i like him for the murders hes got a couple to make up anyway since he missed with cissy and the ballet dancer hes smart enough to know if he gets piper were going to run rudy again it just follows this wasnt for love it was for insurance feeney leaned back reaching into his pocket for his nut bag before remembering his wife hadnt let him carry it to the party he huffed once he knows her she knows him maybe thats how he got in she wouldnt have opened the door to a stranger and she sure as hell wouldnt have opened it up to some guy in a santa suit we need mcnab to run those discs you know what i think dallas i dont think were going to find any discs o o feeney was on the mark the uniform on the scene reported that the security cameras had been shut off from the main control at nine fifty no sign of forced entry eve said after an examination of the locks and palm plate she goes to the door looks out and sees a familiar face opens right up we wont find any internal security discs either she stepped into the apartment a white tree festooned with crystal ropes and balls stood in front of the windows that faced fifth there were stacks of prettily wrapped gifts under it and a single white dove where traditionalists would have put a star or an angel there were shopping bags scattered from just inside the doorway to the first arch off the main rooms right she could see rudy coming in hearing his sister dropping the bags on the run following the trail she crossed the soft white carpet and moved through a second seating area set up for screen viewing more white soft fabric chairs in ecru tables with glossy surfaces in ivory tones clear bowls and urns were overflowing with white flowers it was eve thought like stepping into a cloud smothering beyond the sitting area was a fitness room equipped with sunken spa air weights a mood tube and a multisetting treadmill bedrooms are at the far end she pointed out even at a run it would take rudy several seconds to get in from the front door she turned into a large bedroom the privacy screen was drawn over the window letting the night in and keeping prying eyes out along one wall was an enormous white counter where hundreds of colorful bottles and pots and tubes were arrayed a queen of vanities eve mused scanning the triple mirror and ring of lights two padded chairs she noted side by side they even painted their faces together the bed was heart shaped which made her want to roll her eyes scrolling chrome tubes framed it like icing on the side of a cake roped restraints dangled from four points he didnt take his toys away with him eve crouched down to examine the opened silver box on the floor weve got all kinds of goodies feeney heres the pressure syringe she tapped it with a sealed finger the tattoo works and this is pretty special there was a box inside the box it was simulated wood about two feet in length when she opened the lid three tiers shuffled out it was neatly packed with natural perfection enhancements i dont know much about this kind of shit but this doesnt look like civilian stuff it looks like a pros ho ho ho feeney bent down and picked up a snowy white beard maybe he came dressed for the party after all i say he got her down then dressed himself up habit eve leaned back on her heels he gets in tranqs her once hes got her in here restrained he takes the time to deck himself out he does the tattoo makes up her face the way he wants it all the while neatly storing his tools away no mess when she comes around enough to know whats going on eyes narrowed eve stared at the bed brought the scene into her mind she comes around shes disoriented confused she struggles she knows who he is it shocks her scares her because she knows what hes going to do maybe he talks to her while hes cutting off her clothes looks like this was a robe feeney lifted neat strips of a filmy white material yeah shes home comfortable in for the night shes probably excited knowing her brothers out buying her presents now shes naked terrified staring up at this face she knows she doesnt want to believe its happening you never want to believe it but it happened she thought as a clammy sweat sprung out on her skin couldnt be stopped he takes off his clothes my bet is he folds them neatly he takes off the beard too no need for disguises with her so she would see his face contorted eyes burning hes aroused now its really getting him off that she knows who he is he doesnt need or want the disguise maybe he thinks he loves her after all by now she belongs to him shes helpless hes got the power more power because she calls him by name when she begs him to stop but he doesnt stop he wont stop he just keeps ramming himself into her ripping her ramming her hey hey shaken feeney squatted down put his hands on eves shoulders her eyes had gone glassy her breath thick and uneven come on kid sorry she closed her eyes its okay he patted her awkwardly he knew what had been done to her as a child knew because roarke had told him but he wasnt sure if eve was aware he knew better he figured for both of them if they pretended he didnt know sometimes you get too close thats all yeah she had to wipe her mouth with the back of her hand she could smell the unlovely odor of sex going stale of sweat and she thought of helpless female terror you want uh some water or something no im okay i just i hate sex crimes like this lets bag this stuff and finish going through we might get lucky here and pick up some prints steadier she got to her feet then well see what the sweepers can suck up wait abruptly she put her hand on feeneys arm somethings missing what five this is five what is it she juggled the song through her mind where are the five golden rings they did a thorough search every room but found nothing that fit the pattern of jewelry left at the scene eves blood went cold he took it with him he still needs number five but he doesnt have his tools im going to check the salon downstairs see if he broke into it can you finish here and call the sweepers yeah watch your back dallas hes gone feeney hes back in his hole but she was careful as she made her way down to the store level she could see no signs of forced entry on the elegant doors of the salon beyond the glass it was black following instinct she used her master code to disengage the locks and drew her weapon lights on she ordered then blinked into the sudden glare when her eyes adjusted she saw the cash credit drawer behind the reception counter standing open and empty oh yeah you stopped by she swept the room first eyes and weapon then sidestepped toward the display cases the glass was whole and she could spot no spaces between the neat lines of products moving left she walked toward the treatment rooms each was empty and surgically neat she uncoded another door and stepped into the staff lounge and locker area it was like the rest of the salon scrupulously clean almost obsessively so she decided as her blood began to hum she scanned the lockers wishing for roarkes skill with manual locks her master wouldnt get her into the compartments shed need a warrant for that the next room was storage and here the stringent tidiness was broken cases of products were upended bottles and tubes scattered she imagined hed rushed in desperate to replace his supply furious that hed panicked and left it behind upstairs hed torn into the boxes grabbing his choices stuffing them into a bag or another box quickly now she went out to check each consultants station only one was disturbed the drawers in the shiny white counter yanked out rifled through a thick blob of liquid of some kind had been spilled on the top and left to spread and gel though she already knew she stuck to routine and searched for the stylists license when she found it she studied the photo didnt keep your area clean this time simon and ive got your ass she whipped out her communicator striding quickly toward the doors to secure the scene dispatch dallas lieutenant eve all points required on lastrobe simon last known address east sixtythird unit subject may be armed and dangerous current photo will be transmitted immediately pick this guy up suspicion of sexual homicide multiple first degree dispatch acknowledged and authorized feeney eve shot a transmission to his communicator as she relocked the doors and pulled a crime scene tag out of her kit secure up there im calling peabody in to handle the sweepers weve gotta ride o o our guys a face painter jesus feeney shook his head in disgust as eve drove east like a bullet whats the world coming to dallas swear to god yeah he painted their faces their bodies played with their hair listened to the stories of their lives fell in love and killed them for it you figure he worked on all of them in that salon maybe but if not he saw them picked them out he could have accessed the match lists easy enough gotten data on them doesnt explain the christmas fetish itll come out once we have him she squealed to a stop fishtailing behind two cruisers already blocking the street her badge was in her hand as she jumped out you been up she shouted through the wind and sleet yes sir subject doesnt answer the door men are posted on it and on the rear exit windows are dark no movement spotted feeney the entry warrant come through yet still waiting were going in hell with it she started up shoving through the grilled doors you muck the case you go in without a warrant he reminded her grumping a bit when she pounded up the stairs rather than wait for the elevator i could find the door unsecured she sent one hot look over her shoulder as he rushed up behind her couldnt i shit dallas give me five here ill light a fire under the warrant he was puffing a bit when they reached the third floor and his rumpled face was bright pink but he shoved in front of her and stood in front of the door to just hold on damn it lets take him clean you know the drill she wanted to argue wanted the sheer physical satisfaction of kicking the door in because it was personal she thought certain she felt her own bones vibrating against tensed muscles she wanted her hands on him wanted him to feel fear and helplessness and pain wanted it she realized with a sick jolt much too much okay with an effort she pulled herself in when we go through the door if we find him you take him down feeney kid its your collar you take him down i cant swear itll be clean if i do he studied her face saw the strain and nodded ill take him for you dallas he yanked out his communicator when it beeped heres our pass were clean to move you want high or low her lips curved without humor you always wanted high in the old days still do low hurts my knees they turned a unit drawing that hard breath together then slamming the door as hinges popped she went low crouching under feeneys arm weapon out guarding each others back they did a full sweep of the room dimly lit by the backwash of streetlights tidy as a church feeney whispered smells like a hospital its the disinfectant im calling for lights ill take the left go lights on she ordered then swung left simon this is the police were armed and warranted all exits are blocked she gestured toward a doorway received feeneys goahead nod leading with her laser she moved in shoving the door with her elbow so that it bounced against the wall hes been here she told feeney scanning the disordered room packed up what he could hes gone under chapter eighteen heres what weve got eve began once her team had regrouped in her home office hes good at disguises we can give his photo to the media let them blast it every half hour but he wont look like his picture we suspect he has enough cash loose credits or alternate id to travel freely well put out the traces but the odds of tagging him that way are slim she rubbed the fatigue out of her eyes and pumped more caffeine into her system i want miras take but mine is that his being interrupted tonight after the rape before the payoff will have him sexually frustrated on edge shaken hes an obsessively neat individual but he left his workspace and his living space upended in his rush to get what he needed and get out lieutenant though she didnt raise her hand for attention peabody felt as if she should it was cop to cop and nothing else when eve looked at her do you think hes still in the city the data weve been able to gather so far indicates he was born here raised here hes lived here all of his life and its unlikely he would seek safety elsewhere captain feeney and mcnab will continue to dig for personal data but for now we assume hes still in the area he doesnt own transpo feeney put in never took any vehicle pilot tests he has to depend on public for his movements and public transpo in out and around the city is at peak usage right now this was from mcnab who barely glanced up from his work at the computer only way hes getting out of the city if he didnt have prebooked reservations is to sprout wings and fly agreed added to that the other targets on his agenda are here all previous victims have been in the city spooked or not hes going to be compelled to go for number five the christmas holidays are his trigger eve moved over to the wall screen run evidence disc simon h she ordered we confiscated dozens of video discs with holiday themes from his apartment she continued as the first flashed on screen this is vintage stuff some twentiethcentury film its a wonderful life roarke said from the doorway jimmy stewart donna reed he only smiled pleasantly at eves scowl am i interrupting this is police business eve told him didnt the man ever sleep ignoring her roarke came in and sat on the arm of peabodys chair youve put in a long night can i order some food for you roarke man i could eat mcnab said over eves objections there are several other like videos she continued turning back to the screen as roarke rose and strolled into the kitchen area he collected them and print discs such as a christmas carol in addition we found a large supply of porn in both print and video that follow the theme run evidence disc simon a for example she said dryly when the screen behind her filled roarke stepped back just in time to see a woman wearing nothing but reindeer antlers and a strapon tail purr just call me dancer as she took santas waiting dick into her mouth now thats entertainment he commented there are more than a dozen of these another dozen underground snuff films also vintage that arent quite as cheery but this ones the award winner run evidence disc simon she flicked a glance at roarke then stepped away on screen marianna hawley struggled against restraints her head whipped frantically right and left she was weeping simon stepped into view still wearing his red suit and beard he mugged for the camera then grinned at the woman in bed have you been naughty or nice little girl be quiet little girl the smell of candy on his breath with liquor under it daddys going to give you a present the voice came into her mind like a whisper in the ear but eve forced her hands steady and kept her eyes on the screen oh i think youve been naughty very very naughty but im going to give you something nice anyway he turned back to the camera doing a stylish striptease he left the wig and beard in place as he began to stroke himself its the first day of christmas my true love he raped her it was quick and brutal while her screams echoed through the room eve picked up her coffee however bitter and foul it felt going down her throat she swallowed it he sodomized her and she stopped screaming and simply whimpered like a child his eyes were glassy when hed finished his welltoned chest heaving he took something out of his enhancement case swallowed it we believe that hes ingesting an herb and chemical mix partly exotica in order to maintain an erection eves voice was flat and her eyes stayed on the screen it was for her a responsibility to the dead and a challenge to herself she would look she would see and she would survive it marianna didnt struggle through the next rape shed gone away eve knew away where it couldnt hurt any longer deep inside where she was all alone in the dark she didnt struggle as simon began to weep began to curse her as a whore wrapping the pretty garland around her neck and yanking it taut until it snapped and he was forced to use his hands oh sweet jesus mcnabs choked whisper was full of horror and pity isnt that enough now he decorates her eve continued in the same empty voice pretties her face styles her hair drapes the garland you can see as he lifts her here the tattoo is already in place he lets the camera linger on her he wants this wants to be able to run this over and over again when hes alone see her as he left her as he made her the screen went blank he didnt need a record of the cleanup this disc ran thirtythree minutes and twelve seconds thats how long it took him to accomplish this section of his goal there are other discs of the subsequent murders all follow the same pattern hes a creature of habit and discipline hell find a comfortable place in the city he knows to recuperate to hide he wont go for a flop but a good hotel or another apartment booking a room this time of year wont be easy feeney put in no but its where we start looking uptown to start well question his friends and coworkers at start of business tomorrow we might get a handle on where hed go peabody youll meet me at the salon at nine hundred in uniform yes sir the best we can do is get some sleep for whats left of the night dallas i can hang with this for another hour if i could bunk right here i could get an early roll on it in the morning all right mcnab lets pack it in for now im for that feeney rose ill give you a lift home peabody dont play with my toys mcnab eve added as she walked out i get really cranky you need a sleep inducement tonight roarke took her arm as they started toward the bedroom dont start on me you dont need dreams tonight you need to turn it off for a few hours if not for yourself for the sake of that woman we watched being brutalized i can do my job she began to strip the minute she was inside peeling off her clothes in a rush she needed a shower viciously hot water to scrub the stench off her skin she left her clothes heaped on the floor strode directly into the bath and ordered water at blistering he just waited her out she would he knew need to fight it first even to fight him and his offer of comfort that prickly resistant shell was only one of the aspects of her that fascinated him and he knew as if hed been inside her head inside her heart what she had gone through viewing that disc so when she came out bundled in a robe her eyes too dark her cheeks too pale he simply opened his arms and took her in oh god god she clung her fingers digging into his back i could smell him on me i could smell him it tore him to pieces to see her break to feel her shudders and the quake of her heart against his he cant ever touch you again he touches me she buried her face in his shoulder filled herself with the scent of him every time he comes into my head he touches me i cant stop it from happening i can he picked her up and sat on the bed to cradle her dont think any more tonight eve just hold onto me i can do my job i know but at what cost he wondered and rocked her like a child i dont want drugs just you youre enough then go to sleep let go he turned his head to kiss her hair and sleep dont go away she burrowed into him and sighed once long and deep i need you too much not too much it cant be too much shed put a memory into their box he thought now he put a wish there one night or the few hours left in it she would sleep in peace so he held her until she slipped away into dreamless slumber and was holding her still when she woke they were wrapped around each other her head nestled into the curve of his shoulder sometime during the night hed undressed and slipped them both into bed she lay still a moment studying his face it seemed impossibly beautiful in the soft light strong lines long thick lashes that dreamy poets mouth she had an itch to stroke his hair the silky sweep of it but her arms were pinned she kissed him instead lightly as much to thank him as to rouse him enough to allow her to wiggle free but his hold merely tightened mmm another minute her brows lifted his voice was thick slurry and his eyes stayed closed youre tired god yes she pursed her lips youre never tired i am now quiet down it made her chuckle that edge of sleepy crossness in his tone stay in bed awhile damn right i have to get up she pried an arm free and did stroke his hair go back to sleep i would if youd shut up she laughed then slithered free roarke oh christ he rolled in defense and buried his face in the pillow what i love you he turned his head heavy eyes slitting open with a lazy gleam that had her juices flowing that she thought was the magic of him that he could make her yearn for sex after what shed seen what shed experienced well then come back here i can probably manage to stay awake long enough later his response was a grunt as he pushed his face back into the pillow deciding not to take it the wrong way she dressed ordered up coffee strapped on her weapon he hadnt stirred a muscle when she left the room she decided to check in with mcnab first and found him sprawled out flat in her sleep chair with galahad draped over his head like fat earmuffs both of them snored at her approach the cat slitted one eye open gave her a bored look then offered her an irritable meow mcnab when she got no response from him eve rolled her eyes and gave his shoulder a light punch he only snorted and turned his head the slight shift had the cat drooping lower galahad retaliated by digging in with his claws mcnab snorted again and smirked in his sleep watch the nails honey jesus eve punched harder no sick sex dreams in my chair pal huh come on baby his eyes opened glazed and heavy then focused on eves face uh dallas what where he lifted a hand to the weight on his shoulder and closed it over galahads head who you forgot why but dont ask me pull it together yeah yeah man he turned his head again and found himself eyeball to eyeball with galahad this your cat he lives here you awake enough to give me an update okay sure struggling to sit up he ran his tongue around his teeth coffee im begging you because she shared the addiction she was sympathetic enough to go into the kitchen and order him a doublesized mug strong and black the cat was in his lap when she came back kneading mcnabs thighs and watching him as if daring the man to protest mcnab took the mug in both hands and downed half the contents okay wow i dreamed i was off planet on some resort island and making it with this incredibly built mutant with fur instead of skin he eyed galahad again and grinned jesus i dont want to know about your prurient fantasies what have you got right i checked out all the highend hotels in the city no single man booked a room last night i ran the midlevel ones same results i got personal data discs on your desk marked she went over to pick it up and slipped it into her bag give me the highlights our mans fortyseven born here in new york parents divorced when he was twelve mother was custodial parent he yawned until his jaw cracked sorry she never remarried worked as an actress mostly nickelanddime productions shes got a history of mental illness in and out of nut palaces mostly depression they didnt do the trick because she offed herself last year guess when christmas thats a bullseye simon he got himself a good education double majored theater and cosmetology hes got a degree in both did some gigs as makeup producer took over the salon two years ago he never married shared living digs with his mama he paused to slurp down more coffee he isnt hurting for credits but his mothers treatments took big bites out of his accounts no criminal record nothing but standard exams and checkups on the physical end and no mental work copy the personal data to mira then see what you can dig up on the father stick with the hotel checks hes got to go somewhere can i get some breakfast you know where the kitchen is ill be in the field keep me updated sure uh dallas you and peabody okay eve lifted her brows why shouldnt we be just seemed like something was off with you keep me updated she repeated and left him drinking coffee scratching the cats ears and puzzling o o eve decided that her aide had either slept on a board or put extra starch in her uniform peabody was stiff and brittle as burned toast but she was prompt exchanging nods rather than words they walked into the salon together yvette was already behind her console busily plugging in the days schedule youre getting to be a regular she said to eve you ought to let me work in a manicure or something for you got an empty treatment room ive got a couple but no free consultants until two oclock take five yvette excuse me clock off i need to talk to you well use one of those empty rooms im really busy here or at cop central lets go oh for gods sake with an irritated huff yvette pushed off her stool let me set up the backup droid we dont like to use droids theyre not as personal she scooted around the corner and uncoded a tall cabinet the droid inside was beautifully groomed and coiffed outfitted in a smart pastel skinsuit that set off deep gold skin and fiery red hair when yvette initialized the droid opened big baby blue eyes blinked thick weighty lashes and smiled may i assist you take over the reception counter im happy to be of service youre looking lovely today right obviously annoyed yvette turned away shed say that if i had a face covered with warts thats the problem with droids i hope we can make this fast she added clicking her way toward the back simon doesnt like us to leave our posts except on scheduled breaks hes not going to be a problem eve stepped into the treatment room and wished it didnt remind her of an autopsy suite when did you last talk to simon yesterday since she was there yvette picked up a massage mitt slipped it on and engaged it hummed low as she ran it over her neck and shoulders he had a breast plumper at four finished up at six if you need him hell be here any minute fact is he was supposed to open up day before christmas were swamped with appointments i wouldnt expect him today yvette blinked and the massage mitt stuttered as her hand jerked is something wrong with simon did he have an accident somethings wrong with simon but no he didnt have an accident he attacked piper hoffman last night attacked simon yvette bubbled out a laugh youre out of orbit big time lieutenant hes killed four people raped and murdered four people and nearly did the same to piper last night hes gone under where would he go youre wrong yvettes hand shook as she ripped off the mitt you have to be wrong simons gentle and sweet he couldnt hurt anyone how long have you known him i a couple of years ever since he took over the salon you have to be wrong yvette held up her hands then pressed them to her cheeks piper you said piper was attacked how badly is she hurt where is she shes in a coma in the hospital simon was interrupted before hed finished with her and he ran hes been back to his apartment but hes not there now where would he go i dont know i cant believe this

open the door if he comes to your place i need to get into his locker and interview the rest of the staff okay ill fix it he hasnt been acting weird or anything yvette dashed a tear from her lashes as she rose he was all pumped up about christmas hes a real softie you know and last year losing his mother put a cloud over the holidays for him yeah well hes making up for it this time around eve stepped into the staff room and glanced briefly at a beefy consultant gulping down a mintgreen nutridrink hes changed the combo yvette murmured hes got it blocked i cant open this without his new code whos in charge around here with him gone yvette blew out a breath that would be me eve drew her weapon tilted her head thisll open it but you have to give me assent for forced entry yvette simply closed her eyes go ahead on record peabody yes sir eve adjusted the setting aimed and fired at the lock the gun gave a muffled blast sparked then metal sheered away and crashed to the floor jesus yvette what the hell its cop business stevie she waved a hand at the gaping consultant you got a nine thirty buffer go on and set up for it simons going to be pissed he said with a shake of his head as he left the room stepping to the side so peabody could get the right angle on record eve tapped a finger on the pull shit she winced and sucked her fingertip too hot try this peabody handed her a neatly folded handkerchief from her pocket their eyes met briefly thanks using the cloth eve covered the pull and opened the locker door santa was in a hurry she murmured the red suit was balled up and shoved into the locker high shiny black boots stood on top of it reaching down eve pulled a can of sealit out of her bag coated her hands lets see what else weve got there were two cans of disinfectant a half case of herbal soap tubes of protective cream an overthecounter gadget that promised to destroy germs with highfrequency sound waves she found another box of tattoo works along with templates for several complicated designs this nails it eve took out a thin sheet with stylized letters my true love bag everything peabody and arrange for a pickup i want it all in the lab within the hour ill be in that treatment room doing the interviews she didnt get anything more from the staff simon had been loved and appreciated by his people eve heard words like compassionate generous sympathetic and she thought of the horror and pain in marianna hawleys eyes the drive to the hospital to check on piper was made in silence though the new vehicles climate control pumped out pleasant heat the air seemed very chilly fine eve thought that was just fine if peabody wanted to walk around with a stick up her ass that was her problem it wouldnt affect the work bounce a call to mcnab eve stepped into the elevator stared straight ahead see if hes got any more on possible locations for simon then see if mira got the personal data yes sir you call me sir again in that snotty tone im going to belt you with this eve marched off the elevator and left peabody scowling after her status on piper eve said and slapped her badge on the counter at the nurses station patient piper is sedated what do you mean sedated did she come out of the coma the nurse wore a colorful tunic crowded with spring flowers and a harried expression patient piper regained consciousness about twenty minutes ago why wasnt i contacted her chart was supposed to be flagged it was lieutenant but patient piper regained consciousness at the top of her lungs she was incoherent hysterical and violent we were forced to restrain and sedate at the attendings recommendation and next of kins approval wheres the next of kin now hes in the room with her where hes been all night page the attending get him up here turning on her heel eve strode down the hall and into pipers room she looked like a fairy sleeping pale and blond and pretty delicate shadows were under her eyes and a faint flush of pink from the medication traced her cheekbones a short distance from the bed monitors hummed the room itself was decked out like the parlor of a classy hotel suite patients who had the means could afford to heal in class and comfort eves first memory of medical treatment had been a horrid narrow room lined with horrid narrow beds where women and girls moaned in pain or misery the walls were gray the windows black and the air thick with the stench of urine shed been eight broken and alone without even the memory of her own name to comfort her but piper wouldnt wake to such discomfort her brother sat beside the bed holding her hand gently as if it would shatter like thin glass at the wrong pressure there were already sweeps and flows of flowers in baskets in bowls in tall spearing vases music something soothing with strings played quietly she woke up screaming he didnt look over but kept his bruised eyes on his sisters face screaming for me to help her she made sounds that didnt even sound human he lifted that long narrow hand and stroked it over his cheek but she didnt recognize me she beat at me at the nurses she didnt know who i was where she was she thought she was still she thought he was still with her did she say anything rudy did she say his name she shrieked it his face seemed to have lost its texture as well as his color as he lifted his head it was flat waxy she said his name oh please god she said simon dont dont dont dont over and over and over again pity for both of them squeezed her heart rudy i have to talk to her she needs to sleep she needs to forget he lifted his other hand and stroked pipers hair when shes better when shes able im going to take her away somewhere warm and sunny and full of flowers shell heal there away from all this i know what you think of me of us i dont care it doesnt matter what i think of you shes what matters she moved closer so that they could face each other on either side of the bed wont she heal cleaner rudy knowing the man who did this to her is locked away i need to talk to her she cant be made to talk about it you cant understand what shell feel what its like for her i can understand i know what shes been through i know exactly what shes been through eve said pacing her words while rudy studied her face i wont hurt her i want to put this man away rudy before he does what he did to her and worse to someone else i have to be here he said after a long moment shell need me here and the doctor the doctor has to stay if shes too upset i want him to sedate her again all right but you have to let me do my job he nodded and shifted his eyes back to pipers face will she how long if you know what its like for her how long will it take her to forget oh jesus shell never forget eve said flatly but shell live with it chapter nineteen this will bring her out gradually the doctor was young with eyes that still held compassion and devotion to his art he added the medication to the iv himself rather than ordering the pesky task to a nurse or physicians assistant im going to keep her down a couple of levels so that she wont be overly agitated i need her coherent eve told him and he flicked those soft brown eyes over her face i know what you need lieutenant ordinarily i wouldnt agree to deactivate sedation on a woman in patient pipers condition but i understand the necessity in this case now you understand she needs to remain as calm as possible he gave his attention to the monitors while keeping his fingers on pipers wrist shes steady he said then looked back at eve recovering both physically and emotionally from a trauma of this kind is a difficult journey you ever been to the rape wards down in alphabet city there arent any rape wards in that area there were up until about five years ago until they restructured the license requirements and standard fees for street lcs they were mostly street whores in the wards mostly young ones too boys and girls fresh off the farm who didnt know how to handle a john pumped up on zeus or exotica i worked that sector for six miserable months i know what im doing here the doctor nodded lifted his patients eyelid shes coming around rudy let her see you first talk to her reassure her keep your voice quiet and calm piper rudy put on a hideous excuse for a smile as he leaned over the bed darling its rudy youre okay youre with me youre absolutely safe youre with me can you hear me rudy she slurred the word keeping her eyes closed but turning her face toward the sound of his voice rudy what happened what happened where were you im right here now a tear trickled down his cheek ill be right here simon hes hurting me i cant move hes gone youre safe piper eve could read the panic under the sheen of medication in her eyes when she blinked them open do you remember me the police the lieutenant you wanted me to say bad things about rudy no i just want you to tell me the truth rudys right here hes going to stay right here while you talk to me tell me what happened to you tell me about simon simon the lights on the monitors scrambled where is he hes not here he cant hurt you now gently eve took the hand piper waved as if to ward off a blow no ones going to hurt you im going to keep him very far away from you but you have to help me you have to tell me what he did he came to the door her eyes closed and eve could see the rapid movement behind the delicate lids happy to see him i had his christmas gift and he had a big silver box a present i thought simons brought a present for me and for rudy i said rudys not here he knew no youre all alone alone with me he smiled at me and he he put his hand on my shoulder dizzy she murmured i was so dizzy and i couldnt see very well have to lie down feel so strange i hear him hear him talking to me but i dont understand i cant move cant open my eyes i cant think can you remember anything he said then anything at all i was beautiful he knew how to make me more beautiful something cool on my leg tickling my thigh and hes talking to me he loves me only me true love he wants me to be his true love i wasnt the one but i could be the others dont matter only me he keeps talking but i cant answer all the other loves are dead because they werent true not pure not innocent no abruptly she ripped her hand out of eves and tried to roll aside its all right youre safe i know he hurt you piper i know how much it hurt you and you were so afraid but you dont have to be afraid now firmly now eve took her hand look at me talk to me i wont let him hurt you again he tied me up tears streamed down her face now he tied me up on the bed he took my clothes i begged him not to he was my friend he dressed up horrible there was a camera and he posed and smiled and told me id been a bad girl his eyes something was wrong with his eyes i was screaming but no one could hear me wheres rudy im here he choked out the words pressed his lips to her brow her temple im here he did things to me he raped me and it hurt so much he said i was a whore most women were whores actresses who pretended to be different but were just whores and most men just used them then left them i was a whore and he could do whatever he wanted and he did he kept hurting me rudy i kept calling for you to make him stop make him stop rudy came eve told her rudy came and made him stop rudy came yes he heard you and he came and he took care of you he stopped yes he stopped she closed her eyes again there was shouting and noise and someones crying very hard crying for his mother i dont remember any more okay you did fine youre not going to let him come back her fingers tightened on eves you wont let him find me no i wont let him come back he put stuff on me piper remembered he sprayed something all over me she bit her lip into me his body its been waxed its hairless he has a tattoo on his hip that was new eve mused hed had no tattoo in the videos shed screened do you remember what it looked like it said my true love he showed it to me wanted me to look at it he said it was new permanent not a temp because he was tired of being temporary to everyone he loved and i was crying telling him id never hurt him then he cried too he said he knew he was sorry he didnt know what else to do can you remember anything else he said i would always love him because hed be my last and that hed always remember me because id been his friend the glaze had cleared out of her eyes now they just seemed weary he was going to kill me he wasnt simon anymore lieutenant the man who did this to me i didnt know him he became someone else in that room and i think it frightened him almost as much as it frightened me you dont have to be frightened now i promise you stepping back eve looked over at rudy lets step outside a minute and let the doctor examine your sister ill be right back he pressed his lips to pipers knuckles im just outside the door i dont want to leave her he said to eve as soon as the door closed behind them shes going to need to talk to someone shes talked enough she told you everything for gods sake shell need counseling eve interrupted shell need treatment taking her away isnt going to help her cope i gave her a card a couple of days ago one of mine with a name and number on the back contact dr mira rudy let her help your sister he opened his mouth then closed it again and seemed to make an effort to level himself you were very kind to her in there lieutenant very gentle and hearing her describe what happened to her i understand why you were neither kind nor gentle with me when you believed i was responsible for what was done to the others im grateful to you you can be grateful when ive taken him down she rocked back on her heels you know him pretty well right i thought i did where would he go is there a place a person i would have said hed come to me or piper we spent a great deal of time in each others company professionally and personally he closed his eyes which explains how he was able to access the match lists he wouldnt have been questioned by anyone in the organization if i had told you that if i had opened those doors to you freely rather than trying to protect myself and my business i might have prevented this open them now tell me about him his mother she selfterminated i dont know if anyones aware of that but me absently rudy pinched the bridge of his nose he broke down one night and told me she was a troubled woman mentally unstable he blamed his father there was a divorce when simon was a child and his mother never got over it she was certain that her husband would come back one day her one true love oh god now he covered his face yes yes i suppose she was an actress not a particularly successful one but simon thought she was marvelous stunning he worshipped her but he was often distressed by her behavior she would slide into a depression and there were men she used men to bolster her moods he was the most tolerant of men but in this area he was very closeminded she was his mother and had no right to give herself sexually he only spoke about it to me once shortly after her death when he was lost in grief shed hanged herself he found her christmas morning o o its a perfect fit peabody sat rigidly in the passenger seat as eve fought through traffic he has a mother complex and hes replacing her punishing her loving her every time he picks out a victim the two males either represent his father or his own dominant sexual preferences thanks for the bulletin eve said dryly then rapped the wheel with the heel of her hand as she was jammed in once again on all sides this fucking christmas shit no wonder hospitals and mental clinics do booming business in december its christmas eve i know what the hell day it is goddamn it she jammed the controls into straight vertical veered sharply to the left and zipped across the roofs of stopped cars uh the maxibus i got eyes eve skimmed past the bus with a stingy inch to spare that rapid cabs going to peabody braced and shut her eyes as the cab obviously in the same mood as eve shot up out of the line of traffic eve swore swerved skinned bumpers and hit the siren full blast set it down you stupid son of a bitch she tipped squeezed over and dumped her car so that it teetered half on the street half on the sidewalk in front of a mass of irritated pedestrians she slammed out and stalked toward the cab the driver slammed out and stalked toward her peabody could have told him if he wanted to go nosetonose with a cop hed picked the wrong one but she thought as she climbed out and elbowed through the crowd maybe kicking a cabbies ass would put eve in a better mood i signaled i gotta right to a vertical lift same as you you didnt have your lights or siren going did ya the citys gonna pay for that bumper right you cops dont own the road i aint taking the credit dip on the damage here sister sister peabody actually shuddered at the jagged ice in eves tone behind eves back she shook her head with pity for the driver and took out her violation coder let me tell you something brother first thing you do is step back out of my face before i write you up for assault on an officer hey i never laid hands on i said step back lets see how fast you can assume the position jesus its only a skinned bumper you want resisting no muttering under his breath he turned splayed his legs and laid his hands on the roof of his cab man its christmas eve lets cut each other a break here whaddaya say id say youd better learn a little respect for cops lady my cousins a cop with the fourone teeth set eve whipped out her badge and stuck it in his face see that it says lieutenant not sister not lady you could ask your cousin the cop with the fourone brinkleman he muttered sergeant brinkleman you tell sergeant brinkleman with the fourone to contact dallas homicide cop central and tell her why his cousins an asshole if he explains this factor to my satisfaction i wont pull your license and report the fact that you cut an official vehicle off in air traffic you got that yeah i got it lieutenant now get the hell out of here chastised the driver slunk back into his vehicle hunched down and waited patiently for a break in traffic because her temper was still on the boil eve spun on her heel and jabbed a finger at peabody and you you want to ride with me any more today you yank the stick out of your butt respectfully lieutenant i was unaware of any foreign object in that region your attempt at humor isnt appreciated at this time officer peabody if youre dissatisfied in your position as my aide you can request reassignment peabodys heart clogged in her throat i dont want reassignment sir im not dissatisfied in my position barely muffling a scream eve pivoted away and plowed through the pedestrian traffic earned a few bruises and rude comments then plowed back you keep it up you keep using that academy tone on me were going a few rounds you just threatened to ditch me i did not i offered you the option of assignment elsewhere peabodys voice wavered so she clamped down i felt and still feel that you overstepped the boundaries last night in reference to my relationship with charles monroe yeah you made that clear it was inappropriate for my superior officer to criticize my choice of escort it was a personal matter and goddamn right it was personal eves eyes went dark but not peabody noted with shock in anger there was hurt i wasnt speaking as your superior officer last night i never considered myself addressing my aide i thought i was talking to a friend shame washed up from peabodys toes to the top of her head dallas a friend she barreled on who was sloppyeyed over an lc an lc who was a suspect in an ongoing investigation but charles low on the list eve snapped but still on it as hed been matched with one victim and with one of the attempts you never believed charles was the killer no i believed it was rudy and i was wrong i could have been wrong about charles monroe too and the possibility clawed at her take the vehicle back to central update captain feeney and commander whitney on the latest data regarding our current case advise them that i remain in the field but take the fucking vehicle into central eve snapped thats an order from a superior officer to her aide she turned and pushed her way through the crowd this time she didnt come back oh shit peabody slumped down on the hood of the car ignoring the badtempered horns the blast of insidious holiday music pouring out of the storefront on the other side of the packed sidewalk peabody youre an idiot she sniffed reached into her pocket for her handkerchief then remembered eve hadnt given it back swiping the back of her hand under nose she climbed into the car and prepared to follow orders o o by the time eve reached the corner at fortyfirst shed blown off enough steam to realize she wasnt going to walk another thirty blocks to the lab to pick on dickie one glance at the jammed humanity crammed onto the overhead people glides convinced her she wasnt about to go that route either a new wave of pedestrians caught her full in the back and swept her another half block before she could manage to dig in and shove her way clear she choked on the steam of a glidecart doing a brisk business on grilled soy dogs blinked the resulting tears out of her eyes and dug for her badge she clawed her way out to the curb risked life and limb by stepping directly into the path of an oncoming cab then slapped her badge on the windshield climbing in she tried to rub the stress of the last few minutes off her face then dropped her hands into her lap and met the drivers miserable eyes in the mirror recognizing detective brinkleman from the fourones cousin she let out one short bark of laughter it just figures doesnt it its been a crap day altogether he muttered i hate christmas i aint too fond of it myself right at the moment get me down to eighteenth ill take it from there you could walk quicker she took another look at the teeming sidewalk go over and punch it you get tagged ill handle it with traffic youre the boss lieutenant he took off like a lightning bolt and eve closed her eyes admitting that the headache scrambling in her temples wasnt going to vacate the premises without a chemical shove you going to get grief over the bumper she asked him the way these units get banged around nah he angled over the corner at eighteenth i shouldnt oughtave disrespected you lieutenant this holiday traffic it can turn you mean yeah she dug out credits slipped them through his pay slot well call it even appreciate it anyway merry freaking christmas her laugh was a little looser as she got out same to you pedestrian traffic was light in the sector that held crime labs and morgues and holding stations not a hell of a lot to buy she mused as she jogged the half block over she turned into the ugly steel building that had been some idiot architects vision of hightech economy crossed the soulless lobby and went through the security arch the droid on duty nodded to her as she slapped her palm on the plate recited her name rank code and destination cleared she took the glide down and frowned when she saw the hallways and offices empty middle of the afternoon middle of the week she thought where the hell was everybody she cleared herself into the lab and found a hell of a party going on music blasted over wild laughter someone shoved a cup with a suspicious green fluid swimming inside it into her hand a woman wearing nothing but a lab coat and microgoggles danced by eve managed to snag the sleeve of the coat and spin her back wheres dickie oh around and about i gotta get me a refill here eve shoved the cup into her hand and worked her way through bodies and equipment she spotted dickie sitting on top of a sample table with his hand well up a drunk technicians skirt at least eve assumed the tech was drunk how else could she let those spidery fingers between her legs hey dallas join the party not as classy as your little gettogether but we try where the hell are my reports where are my results what the fucks going on around here hey its christmas eve lighten up her hand snapped out grabbed him by the shirtfront and yanked him off the table ive got four bodies and a woman in the hospital dont you fucking tell me to lighten up you little crosseyed son of a bitch i want my test results lab closes two oclock christmas eve he tried to shove her hand away but didnt budge it thats official its after three hotshot for christs sake hes out there did you see what he did to those people do you want me to show you the goddamn videos he took while he was doing it you want to wake up tomorrow morning and find out he did it again because you couldnt do the job can you swallow your christmas goose over that damn it dallas i got next to nothing new anyway let go of me with surprising dignity he smoothed down his shirt when she released him well take a look in the side lab no use spoiling everybodys good time he snaked through the crowd and unlocked the door of a side room jesus feinstein you cant go banging her in here take her into storage like everybody else eve pressed her fingers to her eyes as a busily copulating couple unlinked and sputtered as they grabbed discarded clothes was everybody insane this time of year eve wondered as they darted by giggling like loons we mixed a hell of a brew dickie explained all legal stuff but its a punch with real punch he dropped down at the computer station and called up the file we got his prints this time but you already know that no question on the id same disinfectant traces on scene the enhancements left behind match those used on the prior victims the suit and shit you had sent down is consistent with the fibers already identified you got your guy dallas this goes to court hes cooked what about the sweep i need something to find him dickie sweep of scene didnt turn up anything you wouldnt expect the one of his digs we didnt get much this guys a clean fanatic everythings been wiped and scrubbed and sucked but there were fibers again match the suit a couple of stray hairs that are consistent with those from the last murder and the beard he left on scene last night you get him bring him down i got plenty to help you lock the cage thats all i can give you okay i need you to shoot this to my unit at central copy feeney since they both knew he should have already done so dickie just jerked a shoulder sorry i took you away from the fun and games citys going to close down in an hour or two anyway dallas people need their holiday theyre entitled yeah ive got a woman spending her christmas in a hospital bed shes entitled too she went outside to let the cold air clear her head wished shed thought to ask dickie for something potent enough to block the thudding behind her eyes the light was already going she realized these were the long nights the black month of december where the daylight barely bounced to earth before it bounced away again she pulled out her portalink and called home youre working she said when roarke picked up his private line and she saw the laser fax behind him spewing out paper just a bit longer ive got a couple of more things to do i dont think ill be home for a couple of hours anyway he could see the headache in her eyes where are you heading i want to do a followup on simons apartment i never did a searchthrough personally maybe the team missed something i need to look roarke i know listen i sent peabody off with my vehicle the apartments closer to home can you send a car or something to that location of course thanks ill call back when im done there let you know when ill make it home do what you need to do but take a blocker for that headache eve she smiled a little i dont have one lets drink lots of wine after i get home okay and make love like animals well i had planned on a quiet evening of trilevel chess but if thats what you really want to do it felt awfully good eve thought as she broke transmission to really laugh so it shouldnt have surprised her to find not only the car but roarke there when she got to simons building you couldve sent it with a droid did you think i would no she pushed a hand at her hair and i dont think youre going to agree to wait in the car until im done in there either see how well we know each other he reached in the pocket of his gorgeous topcoat took out a small enameled box and removed a tiny blue pill open up when she frowned and firmed her lips into an uncooperative line he only lifted an eyebrow its a simple blocker eve youll think more clearly without the headache no funny stuff none open he took her chin when she opened her mouth then used his hand to close it again after hed dropped the pill on her tongue swallow it theres a good girl bite me darling ive thought of nothing else all day i brought your backup field kit well one of us is thinking clearly thanks she said when he got it out of the car ive got him cold she added as they started into the building physical evidence eyewitness motivation opportunity the works you can add the fact that the enhancement case he left behind in piper hoffmans apartment is a one of a kind he ordered it custommade roarke ran a hand over the back of eves neck rubbing lightly to help the blocker along my company offers that option to licensed cosmeticians great now all i have to do is find him he hasnt checked into a hotel roarke smiled at her mcnabs been very busy no hotel and no private lodging at least that he could access on a day where no one wants to work tell me about it i walked into an orgy at the lab and we werent invited thats insulting i have a feeling an invite might have included the rare treat of seeing dickhead naked she took out her master and bypassed the police seal and block on the door of thats something i really dont want for christmas you gotta seal up if youre coming in roarke glanced at the can with a hefty sigh cant the department use something with a more pleasant odor but he coated his hands his shoes then waited for eve to do the same record on dallas lieutenant eve entering subject simons personal residence december twentyfour sixteen twelve investigating officer accompanied by roarke civilian in capacity of temporary aide she entered ordered lights then simply stood and studied the room it wasnt quite so neat now the cs team had done its work and left a fine sheen on surfaces while checking for prints and trace evidence the sweepers had shoved furniture out of place upended cushions removed art from the walls the link had been disconnected and taken in since youre here she said to roarke poke around anything that strikes you call me im going to do the bedroom shed barely started on the closet when roarke came in holding a disc between his thumb and forefinger this struck me lieutenant where the hell did you find that they should have swept all the discs into evidence holiday help what can you do it was sealed inside a hologram frame i assume the woman in the holo was his mother it seemed the sentimental choice of hiding places ive got nothing to run it on they took all the electronics ill need to go in and her voice trailed off as roarke took a slim black case out of his pocket swiveled the lid and opened it to reveal a small screen new toy he said as she frowned at it we werent able to get all the bugs out for the christmas market itll be ready for the presidents day sales is it safe i cant have that disc damaged i reworked this unit personally its a little jewel he slipped the disc into a slot lifted a brow again shall i yeah lets see what weve got chapter twenty it was a rambling and rather pitiful video journal a year in a mans life when that life shatters into pieces and begins to fall away from the core eve supposed mira would have called it a cry for help he referred to his mother a dozen times or more his true love whom he canonized in one entry and vilified in the next she was a saint she was a whore the one thing eve was certain of at the end was that she had been a burden one that simon had never shirked and never understood every christmas she had reboxed and rewrapped the gold cuff bracelet she had purchased for her husband engraved with the words my true love and placed it under the tree for the man who had left her and her young son and every christmas she had told her son that his father would be there on christmas morning for a long time he believed her for a longer time he allowed her to believe then on christmas eve the year before sick of it revolted by the men she let use her hed smashed the box and destroyed her illusion and she hanged herself with the pretty garland her son had strung around the tree not a cheerful seasonal tale roarke murmured poor bastard a lousy childhoods not an excuse to rape and murder no its not but its a root we grow our own way eve one choice leading to another and the choices we make were responsible for she dug out an evidence bag and held it open after a moment roarke ejected the disc and dropped it inside taking out her communicator eve called mcnab no luck on his hideyhole dallas i traced the father he relocated to nexus station nearly thirty years ago got a second wife two kids grandchildren ive got data if you want to contact whats the point she murmured ive got a video diary from simons place the crime scene techs and the sweepers missed it ill transmit to edd go in and file it will you mcnab then youre off duty relay that same status to peabody both of you remain on call as long as subject is at large thats affirmative hey hes got to come out sometime dallas then well have him right go hang your stocking mcnab lets hope we all get what we want for christmas dallas out roarke watched her pocket the communicator youre too hard on yourself eve hell have to move tonight hell need to move and hes the only one who knows where and who she turned back to the closet hes got his clothes organized color fabric even more obsessive about it than you i see nothing obsessive with organizing your wardrobe yeah especially if you own two hundred black silk shirts wouldnt want to pull out the wrong one and make a fashion faux pas i take that to mean you didnt buy me a black silk shirt for christmas she glanced over her shoulder grimaced i kind of messed up on the shopping i didnt understand the deal until feeney pointed out youre supposed to buy in bulk for a spouse ive just got this one thing he tucked his tongue in his cheek do i get a hint no youre too good at puzzles she looked back in the closet so puzzle this youve got shirts and trousers here white to cream to whatever this color is id say taupe fine then it goes into blues greens all of them hung in order now theres a gap then we pick up browns grays to black what color do you suppose is missing best guess is red right no other red in here maybe he only wore red for special occasions he had a backup suit and he took it with him something else the sweepers didnt come up with the rest of the tokens six geese whatever and so on hes got them too hell be ready for the show but where has he stashed it all wheres he keeping it and himself she circled the room theres no coming back here for him he knows that he risked coming back because hes got to finish and he cant finish without his tools his costume his props but hes too smart hes too organized too fucking anal not to have had a place to go his life was here with his mother and the memories roarke pointed out and it was at his work she closed her eyes as it struck god he went back to the building hes in that building then lets find him o o street traffic was vicious the road skinned with thin icy patches but the pedestrian jam had whittled down to a trickle people rushed over the sidewalk hurrying home to family to friends the few who were desperate for the eleventhhour gift haunted the handful of shops and stores still open streetlights blinked on and offered cold pools of light eve watched an animated billboard santa fly in his sleigh and wish merry christmas to all and it began to rain ice perfect when roarke pulled to the curb she got out quickly slipped out her master code then hesitated after a brief internal debate she bent over and unstrapped a weapon from her ankle holster take my clutch piece just in case they stepped out of the cold and into the glow of security lights there were people in and out of the salon the shops the health clubs all day hed need privacy theres probably some empty offices and we can run a check to save time but my hunch is hed use pipers apartment hed know shes in the hospital and hed know rudy wouldnt leave her not even to come back here it wouldve been safe and quiet no reason for the cops to go back in after the sweep was done she jabbed the control for the elevator swore shut down would you like me to activate them for you lieutenant dont be a smart ass ill take that as a yes he slipped the weapon away and took out a small tool kit just take a moment he removed the control plate flicked a few keys on the mother board with his quick clever fingers there was a quiet hum then the light over the glass doors blinked on slick work for a businessman thank you he gestured then followed her into the car hoffman apartment im sorry that floor is only accessible with a key code or clearance eve bared her teeth and started to reach for her master again but roarke already had the controls unplated just as quick this way he said and neatly overrode the block the elevator rose smooth and fast and quiet as it began to slow eve shifted putting her body between roarkes and the door he narrowed his eyes at her back waited when the doors slid open he bumped her aside pivoted out and swept the foyer with his weapon dont you ever do that again she hissed it at him leaping out to cover his back dont you ever use yourself as a shield for me id say were clear here ready for the door she was still vibrating with outrage something else to deal with later she decided i go low she murmured bypassing the locks thats the way i like it fine on three then one two they hit the door smooth as a training program inside the lights blazed and the recording system had been switched on to play bouncy christmas tunes though the privacy screens had been pulled tight over the windows the christmas tree glowed in front of the glass she pointed toward the left on the route to the bedroom she noticed small things the smears and smudges the sweep would have left had been polished away the air smelled of flowers and disinfectant there was a faint haze of steam over the spa the water was still hot the bedroom was tidied the bed made the spills mopped up eve tugged up the spread swore under her breath he put on fresh sheets the bastard slept in the bed where he raped her with fury edging along her stomach she yanked open the closet there among the flowing styles rudy and piper preferred several shirts and slacks were neatly hung making himself right at home she crouched down and opened the trim black suitcase lying on the closet floor the rest of his props heart thudding she nudged through the jewelry muttering the numbers and lyrics all the way to twelve this hair clip with a dozen guys drumming theyre all here except number five hes got that with him she rose he took himself a nice relaxing bath dressed in his suit packed up his tools and went out and hes planning on coming back so we wait she wanted to agree more than she could stand to admit she wanted to be the one to take him down to look in his face when she did to know shed beaten him and that part of herself she faced in nightmares im calling it in well have a few slobs whodve drawn duty tonight ill need some men on the building some inside itll take an hour or so to set it up then well go home you dont want to turn this over to someone else eve no i dont maybe thats why i need to and she turned back to him thinking of miras words im entitled to the life ive started to carve out for myself with you then make the calls he reached out to touch her cheek and lets go home o o peabody filed the last of her paperwork let out a long selfpitying sigh then caught sight of mcnab in the doorway what just passing by i told you dallas said youre off duty im off when my reports are finished and filed he smiled blandly as her machine reported filing complete then i guess youre off hot date with mr slick youre really ignorant mcnab peabody pushed away from the desk you dont spend christmas eve with a guy youve only dated once besides she thought charles had already been booked for the evening your familys not around here are they no stalling willing him to leave she fussed around the desk couldnt get home for christmas not this year me either this case has eaten away at my social life i got no plans either he hooked his thumbs in his pockets what do you say peabody want to call a truce like a christmas moratorium im not at war with you she turned to get her uniform coat from a hook you look a little down its been a long day well if youre not going to spend christmas eve with mr slick why dont you spend it with a fellow cop its a bad night to be alone ill buy you a drink some dinner she kept her head lowered as she buttoned her coat christmas eve alone or a couple of hours with mcnab neither were very appealing but she decided alone was worse i dont like you well enough for you to buy me dinner she looked up shrugged we split the check deal o o she didnt expect to enjoy herself but after a couple of st nick specials she decided she wasnt miserable at least shoptalk was a way to kill a few hours she picked at the chicken nibbles she knew were going to go straight to her ass her diet could just go to hell how can you eat like that she asked mcnab watching with hate and envy as he plowed through a doublecrust pizza with the works why arent you pig fat metabolism he said with his mouth full mines always on overdrive want some she knew better fighting off the chunkies was a constant personal battle but she took half a slice and reveled in it you and dallas straighten things out peabody swallowed hard and glared she talk to you about it hey im a detective i notice shit the two drinks had loosened her tongue just enough shes really pissed at me you screw up i guess so did she peabody said brow furrowing but i screwed up bigger i dont know if i can make it right again you got somebody whod go to the wall for you and you screw it up you fix it in my family we yell then we brood then we apologize this isnt family he laughed hell it isnt and he smiled at her you going to eat all those nibbles she felt something loosen around her heart the man might be a pain in the ass she thought but when he was right he was right ill trade you six nibbles for another slice of pizza o o eve made an effort to put the surveillance operation out of her mind she had good experienced officers in place electronic scans set up in a fourblock radius the minute simon entered the perimeter hed be tagged she couldnt wonder couldnt question couldnt think of where he was what he was doing if someone else would die it was out of her control before the night was out theyd have him her case was solid and hed go into a cage never come out it had to be enough you said something about wine yeah i did it was easier to smile than shed expected the simplest of matters to take the glass roarke handed her and making love like animals i recall suggesting that it was simpler yet to put the wine aside and jump him o o peabody stayed out later than shed intended enjoyed herself more than shed imagined of course she thought as she clomped up the stairs to her apartment that was probably the result of the liquor and not the company though she could admit mcnab hadnt been as much of an asshole as usual now that she was pleasantly oiled she thought shed like to bundle into her ratty robe turn on her tree and curl up in bed to watch some sappy christmas special on screen at midnight shed call her parents and theyd all get sloppy and sentimental it had turned out to be a halfway decent christmas eve after all she turned at the top of the stairs and humming a bit walked toward her door santa claus stepped around the corner with his big silver box in hand and beamed at her out of mad eyes hello little girl youre out late i was afraid id miss giving you your christmas present oh peabody thought oh shit she had a split second to make up her mind run or stand her stunner was strapped inside her coat and her coat was buttoned but the communicator was in the pocket within reach she opted to stand straining for a smile she slid her hand into her pocket engaged the unit wow santa claus i never expected to run into you right here in front of my apartment door bearing gifts too i dont even have a chimney he threw back his head and laughed o o eve groaned rolled over and stretched theyd never made it to the bed but had torn into each other on the floor she felt bruised used and fabulous that was pretty good for starters beside her roarke chuckled and slid a fingertip down her warm damp breast i was just thinking the same thing but i want my christmas present wasnt that it but she laughed sat up and rubbed her hands over her hair but next year she broke off as she heard peabodys voice coming out of a pile of discarded clothes wow santa claus i never expected to run into you right in front of my apartment door oh my god oh god she was already up ripping at the clothes dragging on trousers call it in call it in officer needs assistance oh jesus roarke he was pulling on his pants onehanded and snatching his portalink with the other lets move go well call on the run o o ive been waiting for you simon told her with something very special stall stall stall do i get a hint something someone who loves you chose just for you he started toward her and she kept the smile in place as she frantically flipped open the buttons of her coat yeah who loves me santa loves you delia pretty delia she saw his hand come up caught a glimpse of the pressure syringe palmed in it pivoting she brought up her elbow to block fighting to get past the stiff wool to her weapon naughty his breath wheezed out as he slapped her into the wall she countered with a backhand punch but it bounced off the box and now her weapon hand was trapped between her body and the wall get off me you son of a bitch she swiveled and kicked back to hook her foot around his ankle cursing herself for indulging in that last drink she felt the quick sting of the syringe against her neck even as he went down behind her damn oh damn she managed as she stumbled two steps away then just slid bonelessly down the wall look what youve done just look he scolded her as he opened her bag searched through for her key card you might have broken something im going to be very angry if youve broken any of my things now you be a good girl and lets go inside he hauled her up first steering her to the door where he disengaged the locks then simply let her drop she felt the jolt but it was distant as if her body were padded with foam her mind was screaming for her to move the message so loud she imagined herself springing up but she couldnt feel her legs dimly she heard him come in and close the door now lets get you into bed we have a great deal to do its nearly christmas you know theres my love he murmured and carried her into the bedroom as if she were a doll o o i dont give a flying fuck about skeleton crews and available units eve shouted into the link officer peabody is down shes down goddamn you profanity is unacceptable on this channel dallas lieutenant eve this offense will be on record units are being dispatched eta twelve minutes she doesnt have twelve minutes if shes injured you asshole im personally going to come in and rip out every one of your circuits she pounded her fist into the link droids they put goddamn droids on dispatch on the desk every place because its christmas jesus roarke cant you get this thing to go any faster he was already up to a hundred and ten screaming through the vicious curtain of icy rain but he pushed it nearly there eve well be in time she was suffering unspeakable agonies listening to simons voice through her communicator she could picture it too clearly in her mind he was securing the restraints carefully cutting away her clothes eves mouth went dry spraying her inside and out so she would be clean and perfect she was out of the car before roarke had fully screamed to a stop her boots skidded slid then she dug in and flew to the door because her hands werent steady it took her two tries to bypass the locks when she pounded up the steps roarke was beside her and now at last in the distance came the shriek of sirens eve slipped the master through the slot and shoved the door open police weapon out she charged the bedroom peabodys eyes were wide and dazed naked and bound she shivered violently as the cold air rushed through the open window he went out down the fire escape he ran im okay eve hesitated for a heartbeat then dived for the window stay with her she called to roarke no no shaking her head frantically peabody strained against the restraints shell kill him roarke she means to kill him try to stop her you hold on he snatched the blanket off the floor tossed it over her then went out the window after his wife o o her ankles sang as she leaped the last two feet to the ground and her feet slid out from under her on the slick ground she went down hard on one knee then scrambled up she could see him heading east in a limping run his bright red suit like a beacon police stop where you are but she was already running after him knowing she was wasting her breath with the order there were a thousand bees buzzing in her head a thousand of them stinging on her skin in her gut was a ball of hate so hard and bitter it burned in a deliberate move she jammed her weapon into the waist of her slacks she wanted to take him down with her own hands she leaped on him like a tiger on the hunt sent him skidding on his face and belly over the pavement she was clawing at him pounding on him but couldnt feel it cursing him between harsh labored breaths but couldnt hear it then she was dragging him onto his back and her weapon was in her hand at his throat eve roarke stood where he was a foot away and kept his voice quiet i told you to stay with her stay out of this she stared into the bleeding weeping face under hers and god help her she could see her father her weapon was on full stun not fatal except when pressed directly to a pulse she jammed it harder against his throat and wanted to craved youve beaten him youve stopped him suffering with her roarke moved closer crouched down and looked into her eyes taking that next step its not your way its not who you are her finger trembled on the trigger little bullet points of ice hissed and cracked against the ground pricked her skin it could be no he brushed a gentle hand over her hair not anymore no she shuddered shifted her weapon not anymore while the man beneath her cried for his mother she rose on the pavement simon curled into a ball hot tears cut through the happy color hed painted on his face and made him pitiful beaten eve thought destroyed over i need you to get a couple of uniforms back here she said to roarke i dont have my restraints i have mine feeney crossed trie pavement i still had my communicator tuned for her and mcnab the boy and i got here right behind you he held her gaze for a moment good job dallas ill take him in for you you oughta go check on your aide yeah okay she wiped blood from her face unsure if it was simons or her own thanks feeney roarke wrapped his arm around her shoulder neither of them had stopped for a coat her shirt was soaked through and she was just starting to shiver around or up up she glanced at the iron steps above her head its quicker give me a boost and ill pull you up after me he cupped his hands and lifted when she set her boot in them then watched as she vaulted agilely onto the platform ill wait for you out front he told her youll want a little time with her yeah i do she stayed there kneeling in the wind her nose was beginning to run from the cold from the storm of emotion still beating inside her i couldnt do it roarke i wondered if i could i was afraid i could but when it came down to it i couldnt i know it youve grown your own way eve he reached up and squeezed the hand she held down to him go inside youre cold ill be in the car it had been easier eve realized to go out of the window than to talk herself back in she took a couple of bracing breaths then pushed up the window and tossed her leg over the sill peabody sat in bed wrapped in a blanket with a whitefaced mcnabs arm around her shes okay he said quickly he didnt shes just shaken up i told the uniforms to stay out there thats good were under control here mcnab go on home get some rest i i can bunk on the couch if you want he said to peabody no thanks really im okay ill just he didnt have a clue what to do or how to do it and rose awkwardly should i report in the morning to close this out day afters soon enough take your christmas you earned it he managed a quick grin at eve yeah guess we all did ill see you in a couple of days he was really nice peabody let out a long breath when he left the room he kept everyone out and got me loose and just let me sit closed the window because i was cold so cold god she covered her face with her hands do you want me to take you to a health center no im okay a little woozy yet worse i guess cause id had a few drinks before i got home you got him didnt you yeah i got him peabody dropped her hands she fought to keep her face blank and calm but her eyes were stark is he alive yes good i thought so did i i didnt abruptly the tears welled up and overflowed oh man shit here it comes okay let it rip eve sat down wrapped her arms around peabody and held on while she cried it out i was so scared so scared i didnt expect him to be that strong i couldnt get to my weapon you should have run would you have she drew in a shuddering breath let it out they both knew the answer i knew youd come to back me up but when i came out of it and i was here and i didnt think youd be in time you did good you stalled and held him off just long enough eve wanted to hang on to hold on to the sturdiness that was peabody instead she rose you want a soother or something you can take an inducer he only used overthecounters no i think id rather not alcohol and tranqs are a bad enough mix without topping it with a soother im going to cut the uniforms loose do you want me to call someone to stay with you no the distance was forming peabody noted inch by inch dallas im sorry last night this isnt an appropriate time to discuss it peabody set her jaw then opened and closed the blanket im not in uniform so im not speaking as aide to superior officer that means i can say what the hell i want i didnt like the things you said i still dont but im glad it mattered enough that you said them im not sorry i jumped you for it but i am sorry i didnt see it as a friends concern eve waited a beat okay but if you ever do hire twelve lcs to fuck you blind i want details peabody sniffed and managed a watery grin its just a little fantasy of mine i dont actually make enough to afford twelve at once but i did have another little fantasy come true tonight roarke saw me naked christ peabody on a shaky laugh eve pulled her close again this time she held on were okay o o she looked so steady roarke thought as he watched her stride out of the building so in charge and in control as she stood in the brisk wind in damp shirtsleeves and issued orders to the uniforms at the door there was blood on her hands he doubted she knew it and the wave of love struck him like a fist as she shoved one of those smeared hands through her hair and started toward the car do you want to stay with her eve settled into the warmth of the car shes okay good cop so are you he tipped her face up and laid his lips on hers in a soft sweet stirring kiss she blinked her eyes open and laid a hand over his what time is it just about midnight okay do that again she fit her mouth to his settled in sighed theres a memory for the box and a tradition merry christmas
