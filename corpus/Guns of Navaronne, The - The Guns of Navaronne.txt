the guns of navaronne by alistair maclea chapter the match scratched noisily across the rusted metal of the corrugated iron shed fizzled then burst into a sputtering pool of light the harsh sound and sudden brilliance alike strangely alien in the stillness of the desert night mechanically mallorys eyes followed the cupped sweep of the flaring match to the cigarette jutting out beneath the commodores clipped moustache saw the light stop inches away from the face saw too the sudden stillness of that face the unfocused vacancy of the eyes of a man lost in listening then the match was gone ground into the sand of the airfield perimeter i can hear them the commodore said softly i can hear them coming in five minutes no more no wind tonight theyll be coming in on no come on lets meet them in the interrogation room he paused looked quizzically at mallory and seemed to smile but the darkness deceived for there was no humour in his voice just curb your impatience young man just for a little longer things havent gone too well tonight youre going to have all your answers im afraid and have them all too soon he turned abruptly strode off towards the squat buildings that loomed vaguely against the pale darkness that topped the level horizon mallory shrugged then followed on more slowly step for step with the third member of the group a broad stocky figure with a very pronounced roll in his gait mallory wondered sourly just how much practice jensen had required to achieve that sailorly effect thirty years at sea of course and jensen had done exactly that were sufficient warrant for a man to dance a hornpipe as he walked but that wasnt the point as the brilliantly successful chief of operations of the subversive operations executive in cairo intrigue deception imitation and disguise were the breath of life to captain james jensen dso rn as a levantine stevedore agitator he had won the awed respect of the docklabourers from alexandretta to alexandria as a cameldriver he had blasphemously outcameldriven all available bedouin competition and no more pathetic beggar had ever exhibited such realistic sores in the bazaars and marketplaces of the east tonight however he was just the bluff and simple sailor he was dressed in white from capcover to canvas shoes the starlight glinted softly on the golden braid on epaulettes and cap peak their footsteps crunched in companionable unison over the hardpacked sand rang sharply as they moved on to the concrete of the runway the hurrying figure of the air commodore was already almost lost to sight mallory took a deep breath and turned suddenly towards jensen look sir just what is all this whats all the flap all the secrecy about and why am i involved in it good lord sir it was only yesterday that i was pulled out of crete relieved at eight hours notice a months leave i was told and what happens well jensen murmured what did happen no leave mallory said bitterly not even a nights sleep just hours and hours in the soe headquarters answering a lot of silly damnfool questions about climbing in the southern alps then hauled out of bed at midnight told i was to meet you and then driven for hours across the blasted desert by a mad scotsman who sang drunken songs and asked hundreds of even more silly damnfool questions one of my more effective disguises ive always thought jensen said smugly personally i found the journey most entertaining one of your mallory broke off appalled at the memory of the things he had said to the elderly bewhiskered scots captain who had driven the command vehicle i im terribly sorry sir i never realised of course you didnt jensen cut in briskly you werent supposed to just wanted to find out if you were the man for the job im sure you are i was pretty sure you were before i pulled you out of crete but where you got the idea about leave i dont know the sanity of the soe has often been questioned but even we arent given to sending a flyingboat for the sole purpose of enabling junior officers to spend a month wasting their substance among the fleshpots of cairo be finished dryly i still dont know patience laddie patience as our worthy commodore has just advocated time is endless to wait and to keep on waiting that is to be of the east to total four hours sleep in three days is not mallory said feelingly and thats all ive had here they come both men screwed up their eyes in automatic reflex as the fierce glare of the landing lights struck at them the flare path arrowing off into the outer darkness in less than a minute the first bomber was down heavily awkwardly taxiing to a standstill just beside them the grey camouflage paint of the after fuselage and tailplanes was riddled with bullet and cannon shells an aileron was shredded and the port outer engine out of commission saturated in oil the cabin perspex was shattered and starred in a dozen places for a long time jensen stared at the holes and scars of the damaged machine then shook his head and looked away four hours sleep captain mallory he said quietly four hours im beginning to think that you can count yourself damn lucky to have had even that much the interrogation room harshly lit by two powerful unshaded lights was uncomfortable and airless the furniture consisted of some battered wallmaps and charts a score or so of equally scuffed chairs and an unvarnished deal table the commodore flanked by jensen and mallory was sitting behind this when the door opened abruptly and the first of the flying crews entered blinking rapidly in the fierceness of the unaccustomed light they were led by a darkhaired thickset pilot trailing helmet and flyingsuit in his left hand he had an anzac bush helmet crushed on the back of his head and the word australia emblazoned in white across each khaki shoulder scowling wordlessly and without permission he sat down in front of them produced a pack of cigaottes and rasped a match across the surface of the table mallory looked furtively at the commodore the commodore just looked resigned he even sounded resigned gentlemen this is squadron leader torrance squadron leader torrance he added unnecessarily is an australian mallory had the impression that the commodore rather hoped this would explain some things squadron leader torrance among them he led tonights attack on navarone bill these gentlemen here captain jensen of the royal navy captain mallory of the long range desert group have a very special interest in navarone how did things go tonight navarone so thats why im here tonight mallory thought navarone he knew it well rather knew of it so did everyone who had served any time at all in the eastern mediterranean a grim impregnable iron fortress off the coast of turkey heavily defended by it was thought a mixed garrison of germans and italians one of the few aegean islands on which the allies had been unable to establish a mission far less recapture at some period of the war he realised that torrance was speaking the slow drawl heavy with controlied anger bloody awful sir a fair cow it was a real suicide do he broke off abruptly stared moodily with compressed lips through his own drifting tobacco smoke but wed like to go back again he went on me and the boys here just once we were talking about it on the way home mallory caught the deep murmur of voices in the background a growl of agreement wed like to take with us the joker who thought this one up and shove him out at ten thousand over navarone without benefit of parachute as bad as that bill as bad as that sir we hadnt a chance straight up we really hadnt first off the weather was against us the jokers in the met office were about as right as they usually are they gave you clear weather yeah clear weather it was tentenths over the target torrance said bitterly we had to go down to fifteen hundred not that it made any difference we would have to have gone down lower than that anyway about three thousand feet below sealevel then fly up the way that cliff overhang shuts the target clean off might as well have dropped a shower of leaflets asking them to spike their own bloody guns then theyve got every second aa gun in the south of europe concentrated along this narrow degree vector the only way you can approach the target or anywhere near the target russ and conroy were belted good and proper on the way in didnt even get halfway towards the harbour they never had a chance i know i know the commodore nodded heavily we heard w t reception was good and mcilveen ditched just north of alex yeah but hell be all right the old crate was still awash when we passed over the big dinghy was out and it was as smooth as a millpond hell be all right torrance repeated the commodore nodded again and jensen touched his sleeve may i have a word with the squadron leader of course captain you dont have to ask thanks jensen looked across at the burly australian and smiled faintly just one little question squadron leader you dont fancy going back there again too bloody right i dont torrance growled because because i dont believe in suicide because i dont believe in sacrificing good blokes for nothing because im not god and i cant do the impossible there was a flat finality in torrances voice that carried conviction that brooked no argument it is impossible you say jensen persisted this is terribly important sos my life so are the lives of all these jokers torrance jerked a big thumb over his shoulder its impossible sir at least its impossible for us he drew a weary hand down his face maybe a dornier flyingboat with one of these newfangled radiocontrolled gliderbombs might do it and get off with it i dont know but i do know that nothing weve got has a snowballs chance in hell not he added bitterly unless you cram a mosquito full of tnt and order one of us to crashdive it at four hundred into the mouth of the gun cave that way theres always a chance thank you squadron leader and all of you jensen was on his feet i know youve done your very best no one could have done more and im sorry commodore right with you gentlemen he nodded to the bespectacled intelligence officer who had been sitting behind them to take his place led the way out through a side door and into his own quarters well that is that i suppose he broke the seal of a bottle of talisker brought out some glasses youll have to accept it as final jensen bill torrances is the senior most experienced squadron left in africa today used to pound the ploesti oil wells and think it a helluva skylark if anyone could have done tonights job it was bill torrance and if he says its impossible believe me captain jensen it cant be done yes jensen looked down sombrely at the golden amber of the glass in his hand yes i know i almost knew before but i couldnt be sure and i couldnt take the chance of being wrong a terrible pity that it took the lives of a dozen men to prove me right theres just the one way left now theres just the one the commodore echoed he lifted his glass shook his head heres luck to kheros heres luck to kheros jensen echoed in turn his face was grim look mallory begged im completely lost would somebody please tell me kheros jensen interrupted that was your cue call young man all the worlds a stage laddie etcetera and this is where you tread the boards in this particular little comedy jensens smile was quite mirthless sorry youve missed the first two acts but dont lose any sleep over that this is no bit part youre going to be the star whether you like it or not this is it kheros act scene enter captain keith mallory neither of them had spoken in the last ten minutes jensen drove the big humber command car with the same sureness the same relaxed efficiency that hallmarked everything he did mallory still sat hunched over the map on his knees a largescale admiralty chart of the southern aegean illuminated by the hooded dashboard light studying an area of the sporades and northern dodecanese heavily squared off in red pencil finally he straightened up and shivered even in egypt these late november nights could be far too cold for comfort he looked across at jensen i think ive got it now sir good jensen gazed straight ahead along the winding grey ribbon of dusty road along the white glare of the headlights that cleaved through the darkness of the desert the beams lifted and dipped constantly hypnotically to the cushioning of the springs on the rutted road good he repeated now have another look at it and imagine yourself standing in the town of navarone thats on the almost circular bay on the north of the island tell me what would you see from there mallory smiled i dont have to look again sir four miles or so away to the east id see the turkish coast curving up north and west to a point almost due north of navarone a very sharp promontory that for the coastline above curves back almost due east then about sixteen miles away due north beyond this promontory cape demirci isnt it and practically in a line with it id see the island of kheros finally six miles to the west is the island of maidos the first of the lerades group they stretch away in a northwesterly direction maybe fifty miles sixty jensen nodded you have the eye my boy youve got the guts and the experience a man doesnt survive eighteen months in crete without both youve got one or two special qualifications ill mention by and by he paused for a moment shook his head slowly i only hope you have the luck all the luck god alone knows youre going to need it mallory waited expectantly but jensen had sunk into some private reverie three minutes passed perhaps five and there was only the swish of the tyres the subdued hum of the powerful engine presently jensen stirred and spoke again quietly still without taking his eyes off the road this is saturday rather its sunday morning now there are one thousand two hundred men on the island of kheros one thousand two hundred british soldiers who will be dead wounded or prisoner by next saturday mostly theyll be dead for the first time he looked at mallory and smiled a brief smile a crooked smile and then it was gone how does it feel to hold a thousand lives in your hands captain mallory for long seconds mallory looked at the impassive face beside him then looked away again he stared down at the chart twelve hundred men on kheros twelve hundred men waiting to die kheros and navarone kheros and navarone what was that poem again that little jingle that hed learnt all these long years ago in that little upland village in the sheeplands outside queenstown chimborazo that was it chimborazo and cotopaxi you have stolen my heart away kheros and navarone they had the same ring the same indefinable glamour the same wonder of romance that took hold of a man and stayed with him kheros and angrily almost he shook his head tried to concentrate the pieces of the jigsaw were beginning to click into place but slowly jensen broke the silence eighteen months ago you remember after the fall of greece the germans had taken over nearly all the islands of the sporades the italians of course already held most of the dodecanese then gradually we began to establish missions on these islands usually spearheaded by your people the long range desert group or the special boat service by last september we had retaken nearly all the larger islands except navarone it was too damned hard a nut so we just bypassed it and brought some of the garrisons up to and beyond battalion strength he grinned at mallory you were lurking in your cave somewhere in the white mountains at the time but youll remember how the germans reacted violently jensen nodded exactly very violently indeed the political importance of turkey in this part of the world is impossible to overestimate and shes always been a potential partner for either axis or allies most of these islands are only a few miles off the turkish coast the question of prestige of restoring confidence in germany was urgent so so they flung in everything paratroopers airborne troops crack mountain brigades hordes of stukas im told they stripped the italian front of divebombers for these operations anyway they flung everything in the lot in a few weeks wed lost over ten thousand troops and every island wed ever recaptured except kheros and now its the turn of kheros yes jensen shook out a pair of cigarettes sat silently until mallory had lit them and sent the match spinning through the window towards the pale gleam of the mediterranean lying north below the coast road yes kheros is for the hammer nothing that we can do can save it the germans have absolute air superiority in the aegean but but how can you be so sure that its this week jensen sighed laddie greece is fairly hotching with allied agents we have over two hundred in the athenspiraeus area alone and two hundred mallory interrupted incredulously did you say i did jensen grinned a mere bagatelle i assure you compared to the vast hordes of spies that circulate freely among our noble hosts in cairo and alexandria he was suddenly serious again anyway our information is accurate an armada of caiques will sail from the piraeus on thursday at dawn and islandhop across the cyclades holing up in the islands at night he smiled an intriguing situation dont you think we darent move in the aegean in the daytime or wed be bombed out of the water the germans dont dare move at night droves of our destroyers and mtbs and gunboats move into the aegean at dusk the destroyers retire to the south before dawn the small boats usually lie up in isolated islands creeks but we cant stop them from getting across theyll be there saturday or sunday and synchronise their landings with the first of the airborne troops theyve scores of junkers s waiting just outside athens kheros wont last a couple of days no one could have listened to jensens carefully casual voice his abnormal matteroffactness and not have believed him mallory believed him for almost a minute he stared down at the sheen of the sea at the faery tracery of the stars shimmering across its darkly placid surface suddenly he swung around on jensen but the navy sir evacuation surely the navy the navy jensen interrupted heavily is not keen the navy is sick and tired of the eastern med and the aegean sick and tired of sticking out its longsuffering neck and having it regularly chopped off and all for sweet damn all weve had two battleships wrecked eight cruisers out of commission four of them sunk and over a dozen destroyers gone i couldnt even start to count the number of smaller vessels weve lost and for what ive told you for sweet damn all just sos our high command can play roundandround theruggedrocks and whos thekingofthecastle with their opposite numbers in berlin great fun for all concerned except of course for the thousand or so sailors whove been drowned in the course of the game the ten thousand or so tommies and anzacs and indians who suffered and died on these same islands and died without knowing why jensens hands were whiteknuckled on the wheel his mouth tightdrawn and bitter mallory was surprised shocked almost by the vehemence the depth of feeling it was so completely out of character or perhaps it was in character perhaps jensen knew a very great deal indeed about what went on on the inside twelve hundred men you said sir mallory asked quietly you said there were twelve hundred men on kheros jensen flickered a glance at him looked away again yes twelve hundred men jensen sighed youre right laddie of course youre right im just talking off the top of my head of course we cant leave them there the navy will do its damnedest whats two or three more destroyers sorry boy sorry there i go again now listen and listen carefully taking em off will have to be a night operation there isnt a ghost of a chance in the daytime not with twothree hundred stukas just begging for a glimpse of a royal naval destroyer itll have to be destroyers transports and tenders are too slow by half and they cant possibly go northabout the northern tip of the lerades theyd never get back to safety before daylight its too long a trip by hours but the lerades is a pretty long string of islands mallory ventured couldnt the destroyers go through between a couple of them impossible jensen shook his head mined to hell and back again every single channel you couldnt take a dinghy through and the maidosnavarone channel stiff with mines also i suppose no thats a clear channel deep water you cant moor mines in deep water so thats the route youve got to take isnt it sir i mean theyre turkish territorial waters on the other side and we wed go through turkish territorial waters tomorrow and in broad daylight if it would do any good jensen said flatly the turks know it and so do the germans but all other things being equal the western channel is the one were taking its a clearer channel a shorter route and it doesnt involve any unnecessary international complications all other things being equal the guns of navarone jensen paused for a long time then repeated the words slowly expressionlessly as one would repeat the name of some feared and ancient enemy the guns of navarone they make everything equal they cover the northern entrances to both channels we could take the twelve hundred men off kheros tonightif we could silence the guns of navarone mallory sat silent said nothing hes coming to it now he thought these guns are no ordinary guns jensen went on quietly our naval experts say theyre about nineinch rifle barrels i think myself theyre more likely a version of the mm crunch guns that the germans are using in italy our soldiers up there hate and fear those guns more than anything on earth a dreadful weapon shell extremely slow in flight and damnably accurate anyway he went on grimly whatever they were they were good enough to dispose of the sybaris in five minutes flat mallory nodded slowly the sybaris i think i heard an eightinch cruiser we sent up there about four months ago to try conclusions with the hun just a formality a routine exercise we thought the sybaris was blasted out of the water there were seventeen survivors good god mallory was shocked i didnt know two months ago we mounted a largescale amphibious attack on navarone jensen hadnt even heard the interruption commandos royal marine commandos and jellicoes special boat service less than an even chance we knew navarones practically solid cliff all the way round but then these were very special men probably the finest assault troops in the world today jensen paused for almost a minute then went on very quietly they were cut to ribbons they were massacred almost to a man finally twice in the past ten daysweve seen this attack on kheros coming for a long time now we sent in parachute saboteurs special boat service men he shrugged his shoulders helplessly they just vanished just like that just like that and then tonight the last desperate fling of the gambler and what have you jensen laughed briefly and without humour that interrogation hut i kept pretty quiet in there tonight i tell you i was the joker that torrance and his boys wanted to heave out over navarone i knew it was hopelessbut it had to be done the big humber was beginning to slow down now running silently between the tumbledown shacks and hovels that line the western approach to alexandria the sky ahead was already beginning to streak in the first tenuous greys of the false dawn i dont think id be much good with a parachute mallory said doubtfully in fact quite frankly ive never even seen a parachute dont worry jensen said briefly you wont have to use one youre going into navarone the hard way mallory waited for more but jensen had fallen silent intent on avoiding the large potholes that were beginning to pock the roadway after a time mallory asked why me captain jensen jensens smile was barely visible in the greying darkness he swerved violently to avoid a gaping hole and straightened up again scared certainly im scared no offence intended sir but the way you talk youd scare anyone but that wasnt what i meant i know it wasnt just my twisted humour why you special qualifications laddie just like i told you you speak greek like a greek you speak german like a german skilled saboteur firstclass organiser and eighteen unscathed months in the white mountains of crete a convincing demonstration of your ability to survive in enemyheld territory jensen chuckled youd be surprised to know just how complete a dossier i have on you no i wouldnt mallory spoke with some feeling and he added i know of at least three other officers with the same qualifications there are others jensen agreed but there are no other keith mallorys keith mallory jensen repeated rhetorically who hadnt heard of keith mallory in the palmy balmy days before the war the finest mountaineer the greatest rock climber new zealand has ever produced and by that of course new zealanders mean the world the human fly the climber of the unclimbable the scaler of vertical cliffs and impossible precipices the entire south coast of navarone said jensen cheerfully consists of one vast impossible precipice nary a hand or foothold in sight i see mallory murmured i see indeed into navarone the hard way that was what you said that was jensen acknowledged you and your gang just four others mallorys merry mountaineers handpicked every man a specialist youll meet them all tomorrow this afternoon rather they travelled in silence for the next ten minutes turned up right from the dock area jounced their uncomfortable way over the massive cobbles of the rue souers slewed round into mohammed all square passed in front of the bourse and turned right down the sherif pasha mallory looked at the man behind the wheel he could see his face quite clearly now in the gathering light where to sir to see the only man in the middle east who can give you any help now monsieur eugene viachos of navarone you are a brave man captain mallory nervously eugene viachos twisted the long pointed ends of his black moustache a brave man and a foolish one i would say but i suppose we cannot call a man a fool when he only obeys his orders his eyes left the large drawing lying before him on the table and sought jensens impassive face is there no other way captain he pleaded jensen shook his head slowly there are weve tried them all sir they all failed this is the last he must go then there are over a thousand men on kheros sir vlachos bowed his head in silent acceptance then smiled faintly at mallory he calls me sir me a poor greek hotelkeeper and captain jensen of the royal navy calls me sir it makes an old man feel good he stopped gazed off vacantly into space the faded eyes and tired lined face soft with memory an old man captain mallory an old man now a poor man and a sad one but i wasnt always not always once i was just middleaged and rich and well content once i owned a lovely land a hundred square miles of the most beautiful country god ever sent to delight the eyes of his creatures here below and how well i loved that land he laughed selfconsciously and ran a hand through his thick greying hair ah well as you people say i suppose its all in the eye of the beholder a lovely land i say that blasted rock as captain jensen has been heard to describe it out of my hearing he smiled at jensens sudden discomfiture but we both give it the same name navarone startled mallory looked at jensen jensen nodded the vlachos family has owned navarone for generations we had to remove monsieur viachos in a great hurry eighteen months ago the germans didnt care overmuch for his kind of collaboration it was how do you say touch and go vlachos nodded they had reserved three very special places for my two sons and myself in the dungeons in navarone but enough of the viachos family i just wanted you to know young man that i spent forty years on navarone and almost four days he gestured to the table on that map my information and that map you can trust absolutely many things will have changed of course but some things never change the mountains the bays the passes the caves the roads the houses and above all the fortress itself these have remained unchanged for centuries captain mallory i understand sir mallory folded the map carefully stowed it away in his tunic with this theres always a chance thank you very much it is little enough god knows viachoss fingers drummed on the table for a moment then he looked up at mallory captain jensen informs me that most of you speak greek fluently that you will be dressed as greek peasants and will carry forged papers that is well you will be what is the word selfcontained will operate on your own he paused then went on very earnestly please do not try to enlist the help of the people of navarone at all costs you must avoid that the germans are ruthless i know if a man helps you and is found out they will destroy not only that man but his entire village men women and children it has happened before it will happen again it happened in crete mallory agreed quietly ive seen it for myself exactly vlachos nodded and the people of navarone have neither the skifi nor the experience for suecessful guerrilla operations they have not had the chance german surveillance has been especially severe in our island i promise you sir mallory began vlachos held up his hand just a moment if your need is desperate really desperate there are two men to whom you may turn under the first plane tree in the village square of margaritha at the mouth of the valley about three miles south of the fortress you will find a man called louki he has been the steward of our family for many years louki has been of help to the british before captain jensen will confirm that and you can trust him with your life he has a friend panayis he too has been useful in the past thank you sir ill remember louki and panayis and margaritha the first plane tree in the square and you will refuse all other aid captain vlachos asked anxiously louki and panayis only these two he pleaded you have my word sir besides the fewer the safer for us as well as your people mallory was surprised at the old mans intensity i hope so i hope so viachos sighed heavily mallory stood up stretched out his hand to take his leave youre worrying about nothing sir theyll never see us he promised confidently nobody will see us and well see nobody were after only one thing the guns ay the guns those terrible guns vlachos shook his head but just suppose please it will be all right mallory insisted quietly we will bring harm to none and least of all to your islanders god go with you tonight the old man whispered god go with you tonight i only wish that i could go too chapter sunday night coffee sir mallory stirred and groaned and fought his way up from the depths of exhausted sleep painfully he eased himself back on the metalframed bucketseat wondering peevishly when the air force was going to get round to upholstering these fiendish contraptions then he was fully awake tired heavy eyes automatically focusing on the luminous dial of his wristwatch seven oclock just seven oclock hed been asleep barely a couple of hours why hadnt they let him sleep on coffee sir the young airgunner was still standing patiently by his side the inverted lid of an ammunition box serving as a tray for the cups he was carrying sorry boy sorry mallory struggled upright in his seat reached up for a cup of the steaming liquid sniffed it appreciatively thank you you know this smells just like real coffee it is sir the young gunner smiled proudly we have a percolator in the galley he has a percolator in the galley mallory shook his head in disbelief ye gods the rigours of war in the royal air force he leaned back sipped the coffee luxuriously and sighed in contentment next moment he was on his feet the hot coffee splashing unheeded on his bare knees as he stared out the window beside him he looked at the gunner gestured in disbelief at the mountainous landscape unrolling darkly beneath them what the hell goes on here were not due till two hours after dark and its barely gone sunset has the pilot thats cyprus sir the gunner grinned you can just see mount olympus on the horizon nearly always going to casteirosso we fly a big dogleg over cyprus its to escape observation sir and it takes us well clear of rhodes to escape observation he says the heavy transatlantic drawl came from the bucketseat diagonally across the passage the speaker was lying collapsed there was no other word for it in his seat the bony knees topping the level of the chin by several inches my gawd to escape observation he repeated in awed wonder doglegs over cyprus twenty miles out from alex by launch so that nobody ashore can see us taldn off by plane and then what he raised himself painfully in his seat eased an eyebrow over the bottom of the window then fell back again visibly exhausted by the effort and then what then they pack us into an old crate thats painted the whitest white you ever saw guaranteed visible to a blind man at a hundred miles specially now that its gettin dark it keeps the heat out the young gunner said defensively the heat doesnt worry me son the drawl was tireder more lugubrious than ever i like the heat what i dont like are them nasty cannon shells and bullets that can ventilate a man in all the wrong places he slid his spine another impossible inch down the seat closed his eyes wearily and seemed asleep in a moment the young gunner shook his head admiringly and smiled at mallory worried to hell isnt he sir mallory laughed and watched the boy disappear forard into the control cabin he sipped his coffee slowly looked again at the sleeping figure across the passage the blissful unconcern was magnificent corporal dusty miller of the united states and more recently of the long range desert force would be a good man to have around he looked round at the others and nodded to himself in satisfaction they would all be good men to have around eighteen months in crete had developed in him an unerring sense for assessing a mans capacity for survival in the peculiar kind of irregular warfare in which he himself bad been so long engaged offhand hed have taken long odds on the capacity of these four to survive in the matter of picking an outstanding team captain jensen he reckoned had done him proud he didnt know them all yet not personally but he was intimately acquainted with the exhaustive dossier that jensen held on each one of them these were reassuring to say the least or was there perhaps a slight question mark against stevenss mallory wondered looked across the passage at the fairhaired boyish figure gazing out eagerly beneath the gleaming white wing of he sunderland lieutenant andy stevens rnvr had been chosen for this assignment for three reasons he would navigate the craft that was to take them to navarone he was a firstclass alpinist with several outstanding climbs to his record and the product of the classical side of a redbrick university he was an almost fanatical philheliene fluent in both ancient and modern greek and had spent his last two long vacations before the war as a tourist courier in athens but he was young absurdly young mallory thought as he looked at him and youth could be dangerous too often in that island guerrilla warfare it had been fatal the enthusiasm the fire the zeal of youth was not enough rather it was too much a positive handicap this was not a war of bugle calls and roaring engines and magnificent defiance in the clamour of battle this was a war of patience and endurance and stability of cunning and craft and stealth and these were not commonly the attributes of youth but he looked as if he might learn fast mallory stole another glance at miller dusty miller he decided had learnt it all a long long time ago dusty miller on a white charger the bugle to his lips no his mind just refused to encompass the incongruity of it he just didnt look like sir launcelot he just looked as if he bad been around for a long long time and had no illusions left corporal miller had in fact been around for exactly forty years by birth a californian by descent three parts irish and one part central european he had lived and fought and adventured more in the previous quarter a century than most men would in a dozen lifetimes silverminer in nevada tunneler in canada and oilfire ihooter all over the globe he had been in saudi arabia when hitler attacked poland one of his more remote maternal ancestors some time around the turn of the century had lived in warsaw but that had been affront enough for millers irish blood he had taken the first available plane to britain and lied his way into the air force where to his immense disgust and because of his age he was relegated to the rear turret of a wellington his first operational flight had been bis last within ten minutes of taking off from the menidi airfield outside athens on a january night in engine failure had brought them to an ignominious though welicushioned end in a paddy field some miles northwest of the city the rest of the winter he had spent seething with rage in a cookhouse back in menidi at the beginning of april he resigned from the air force without telling anyone and was making his way north towards the fighting and the albanian frontier when he met the germans coming south as miller afterwards told it he reached nauplion two blocks ahead of the nearest panzer division was evacuated by the transport slamat sunk picked up by the destroyer wryneck sunk and finally arrived in alexandria in an ancient greek caique with nothing left him in the world but a fixed determination never again to venture in the air or on the sea some months later he was operating with a longrange striking force behind the enemy lines in libya he was mallory mused the complete antithesis to lieutenant stevens stevens young fresh enthusiastic correct and immaculately dressed and miller driedup lean stringy immensely tough and with an almost pathological aversion to spit and polish how well the nickname dusty suited him there could hardly have been a greater contrast again unlike stevens miller had never climbed a mountain in his life and the only greek words he knew were invariably omitted from the dictionaries and both these facts were of no importance at all miller had been picked for one reason only a genius with explosives resourceful and cool precise and deadly in action he was regarded by middle east intelligence in cairo as the finest saboteur in southern europe behind miller sat casey brown short dark and compact petty officer telegraphist brown was a clydesider in peacetime an installation and testing engineer in a famous yachtbuilders yard on the garelock the fact that he was a born and readymade engineroom artificer had been so blindingly obvious that the navy had missed it altogether and stuck him in the communications branch browns ill luck was mallorys good f ortune brown would act as the engineer of the boat taking them to navarone and would maintain radio contact with base he had also the further recommendation of being a firstclass guerrilla fighter a veteran of the special boat service he held the dcm and dsm for his exploits in the aegean and off the coast of libya the fifth and last member of the party sat directly behind mallory mallory did not have to turn round to look at him he already knew him knew him better than he knew anyone else in the world better even than he knew his own mother andrea who had been his lieutenant for all these eighteen interminable months in crete andrea of the vast bulk the continual rumbling laughter and tragic past with whom he had eaten lived and slept in caves rockshelters and abandoned shepherds huts while constantly harried by german patrols and aircraft that andrea had become his alter ego his doppelganger to look at andrea was to look in a mirror to remind himself what he was like there was no question as to why andrea had come along he wasnt there primarily because he was a greek himself with an intimate knowledge of the islanders language thought and customs nor even because of his perfect understanding with mallory although all these things helped he was instead there exclusively for the protection and safety he afforded endlessly patient quiet and deadly tremendously fast in spite of his bulk and with a feline stealth that exploded into berserker action andrea was the complete fighting machine andrea was their insurance policy against failure mallory turned back to look out the window again then nodded to himself in imperceptible satisfaction jensen probably couldnt have picked a better team if hed scoured the whole mediterranean theatre it suddenly occurred to mallory that jensen probably had done just that miller and brown had been recalled to alexandria almost a month ago it was almost as long since stevenss relief had arrived aboard his cruiser in malta and if their batterycharging engine hadnt slipped down that ravine in the white mountains and if the sorely harassed runner from the nearest listening post hadnt taken a week to cover fifty miles of snowbound enemy patrolled mountains and another five days to find them he and andrea would have been in alexandria almost a fortnight earlier mallorys opinion of jensen already high rose another notch a farseeing man who planned accordingly jensen must have had all his preparations for this made even before the first of the two abortive parachute landings on navarone it was eight oclock and almost totally dark inside the plane when mallory rose and made his way forard to the control cabin the captain face wreathed in tobacco smoke was drinking coffee the copilot waved a languid hand at his approach and resumed a bored scanning of the scene ahead good evening mallory smiled mind if i come in welcome in my office any time the pilot assured him no need to ask i only thought you might be busy mallory stopped and looked again at the scene of masterly inactivity just who is flying this plane he asked george the automatic pilot he waved a coffeecup in the direction of a black squat box its blurred outlines just visible in the near darkness an industrious character and makes a damn sight fewer mistakes than that idle hound whos supposed to be on watch anything on your mind captain yes what were your instructions for tonight just to set you blokes down in castelrosso when it was good and dark the pilot paused then said frankly i dont get it a ship this size for only five men and a couple of hundred odd pounds of equipment especially to castelrosso especially after dark last plane that came down here after dark just kept on going down underwater obstruction dunno what it was two survivors i know i heard im sorry but im under orders too as for the rest forget it and i mean forget impress on your crew that they mustnt talk theyve never seen us the pilot nodded glumly weve all been threatened with courtmartial already youd think there was a ruddy war on there is well be leaving a couple of cases behind were going ashore in different clothes somebody will be waiting for our old stuff when you get back roger and the best of luck captain official secrets or no official secrets ive got a hunch youre going to need it if we are you can give us a good sendoff mallory grinned just set us down in one piece will you reassure yourself brother said the pilot firmly just set your mind at ease dont forget im in this ruddy plane too the clamour of the sunderlands great engines was still echoing in their ears when the stubby little motorboat chugged softly out of the darkness and nosed alongside the gleaming hull of the flyingboat there was no time lost there were no words spoken within a minute the five men and all their gear had been embarked within another the little boat was rubbing to a stop against the rough stone navy jetty of castelrosso two ropes went spinning up into the darkness were caught and quickly secured by practised hands amidships the rustscaled iron ladder recessed deep into the stone stretched up into the stardusted darkness above as mallory reached the top a figure stepped forward out of the gloom captain mallory yes captain briggs army have your men wait here will you the colonel would like to see you the nasal voice peremptory in its clipped affectation was far from cordial mallory stirred in slow anger but said nothing briggs sounded like a man who might like his bed or his gin and maybe their late visitation was keeping him from either or both war was hell they were back in ten minutes a third figure following behind them mallory peered at the three men standing on the edge of the jetty identified them then peered around again wheres miller got to he asked here boss here miller groaned eased his back off a big wooden bollard climbed wearily to his feet just restin boss recuperatin as you might say from the nerverackin rigours of the trip when youre all quite ready briggs said acidly matthews here will take you to your quarters you are to remain on call for the captain matthews colonels orders briggss tone left no doubt that he thought the colonels orders a piece of arrant nonsense and dont forget captain two hours the colonel said i know i know mallory said wearily i was there when he said it it was to me he was talking remember all right boys if youre ready our gear sir stevens ventured just leave it there right matthews lead the way will you matthews led the way along the jetty and up interminable flights of steep worn steps the others following in indian file rubber soles noiseless on the stone he turned sharply right at the top went down a narrow winding alley into a passage climbed a flight of creaking wooden stairs opened the first door in the corridor above here you are sir ill just wait in the corridor outside better wait downstairs mallory advised no offence matthews but the less you know of this the better he followed the others into the room closing the door behind him it was a small bleak room heavily curtained a table and half a dozen chairs took up most of the space over in the far corner the springs of the single bed creaked as corporal miller stretched himself out luxuriously hands clasped behind his head gee he murmured admiringly a hotel room just like home kinda bare though a thought occurred to him where are all you other guys gonna sleep we arent mallory said briefly neither are you were pulling out in less than two hours miller groaned come on soldier mallory went on relentlessly on your feet miller groaned again swung his legs over the edge of the bed and looked curiously at andrea the big greek was quartering the room methodically pulling out lockers turning pictures peering behind curtains and under the bed whats he doin miller asked lookin for dust testing for listening devices mallory said curtly one of the reasons why andrea and i have lasted so long he dug into the inside pocket of his tunic a dark naval battledress with neither badge nor insignia pulled out a chart and the map vlachos had given him unfolded and spread them out round the table all of you i know youve been bursting with curiosity for the past couple of weeks asking yourselves a hundred questions well here are all the answers i hope you like them let me introduce you to the island of navarone mallorys watch showed exactly eleven oclock when he finally sat back folded away the map and chart he looked quizzically at the four thoughtful faces round the table well gentlemen there you have it a lovely setup isnt it he smiled wryly if this was a film my next line should be any questions men but well dispense with that because i just wouldnt have any of the answers you all know as much as i do a quarter of a mile of sheer cliff four hundred feet high and he calls it the only break in the defences miller his head bent moodily over his tobacco tin rolled a long thin cigarette with one expert hand this is just crazy boss me i cant even climb a bloody ladder without falling off he puffed strong acrid clouds of smoke into the air suicidal thats the word i was lookin for suicidal one buck gets a thousand we never get within five miles of them gawddamned guns one in a thousand eh mallory looked at him for a long time without speaking tell me miller what odds are you offering on the boys on kheros yeah miller nodded heavily yeah the boys on kheros fd forgotten about them i just keep thinkin about me and that damned cliff he looked hopefully across the table at the vast bulk of andrea or maybe andrea there would carry me up hes big enough anyway andrea made no reply his eyes were halfclosed his thoughts could have been a thousand miles away well tie you hand and foot and haul you up on the end of a rope stevens said unkindly well try to pick a fairly sound rope he added carelessly the words the tone were jocular enough but the worry on his face belied them mallory apart only stevens appreciated the almost insuperable technical difficulties of climbing a sheer unknown cliff in the darkness he looked at mallory questioningly going up alone sir or excuse me please andrea suddenly sat forward his deep rumble of a voice rapid in the clear idiomatic english he had learnt during his long association with mallory he was scribbling quickly on a piece of paper i have a plan for climbing this cliff here is a diagram does the captain think this is possible he passed the paper across to mallory mallory looked at it checked recovered all in the one instant there was no diagram on it there were only two large printed words keep talking i see mallory said thoughtfully very good indeed andrea this has distinct possibilities he reversed the paper held it up before him so that they could all see the words andrea had already risen to his feet was padding catfooted towards the door ingenious isnt it corporal miller he went on conversationally might solve quite a lot of our difficulties yeah the expression on millers face hadnt altered a fraction the eyes were still halfclosed against the smoke drifting up from the cigarette dangling between his lips reckon that might solve the problem andrea and get me up in one piece too he laughed easily concentrated on screwing a curiouslyshaped cylinder on to the barrel of an automatic that had magically appeared in his left hand but i dont quite get that funny line and the dot at it was all over in two seconds literally with a deceptive ease and nonchalance andrea opened the door with one hand reached out with the other plucked a wildlystruggling figure through the gap set him on the ground again and closed the door all in one concerted movement it had been as soundless as it had been swift for a second the eavesdropper a hatchetfaced swarthy levantine in badlyfitting white shirt and blue trousers stood there in shocked immobility blinking rapidly in the unaccustomed light then his hand dived in under his shirt look out millers voice was sharp the automatic lining up as mallorys hand closed over his watch mallory said softly the men at the table caught only a flicker of blued steel as the knife arm jerked convulsively back and plunged down with vicious speed and then incredibly hand and knife were stopped dead in midair the gleaming point only two inches from andreas chest there was a sudden scream of agony the ominous cracking of wrist bones as the giant greek tightened his grip and then andrea had the blade between finger and thumb had removed the knife with the tender reproving care of a parent saving a wellloved but irresponsible child from himself then the knife was reversed the point was at the levantines throat and andrea was smiling own pleasantly into the dark and terror stricken eyes miller let out a long breath halfsigh halfwhistle well now he murmured i guess mebbe andrea has done that sort of thing before i guess maybe he has mallory mimicked lets have a closer look at exhibit a andrea andrea brought his prisoner close up to the table well within the circle of light he stood there sullenly before them a thin ferretfaced man black eyes dulled in pain and fear left hand cradling his crushed wrist how long do you reckon this fellows been outside andrea mallory asked andrea ran a massive hand through his thick dark curling hair heavily streaked with grey above the temples i cannot be sure captain i imagined i heard a noise a kind of shuffle about ten minutes ago but r thought my ears were playing tricks then i heard the same sound a minute ago so i am afraid ten minutes eh mallory nodded thoughtfully then looked at the prisoner whats your name he asked sharply what are you doing here there was no reply there were only the sullen eyes the sullen silence a silence that gave way to a sudden yelp of pain as andrea cuffed the side of his head the captain is asking you a question andrea said reproachfully he cuffed him again harder this time answer the captain the stranger broke into rapid excitable speech gesticulating wildly with both hands the words were quite unintelligible andrea sighed shut off the torrent by the simple expedient of almost encircling the scrawny throat with his left hand mallory looked questioningly at andrea the giant shook his head kurdistan or armenian captain i think but i dont understand it i certainly dont mallory admitted do you speak english he asked suddenly black hatefilled eyes glared back at him in silence andrea cuffed him again do you speak english mallory repeatea relentlessly eenglish eenglish shoulders and upturned palms lifted in the ageold gesture of incomprehension ka eenglish he says he dont speak english miller drawled maybe he doesnt and maybe he does mallory said evenly all we know is that he has been listening and that we cant take any chances there are far too many lives at stake his voice suddenly hardened the eyes were grim and pitiless andrea captain you have the knife make it clean and quick between the shoulder blades stevens cried out in horror sent his chair crashing back as be leapt to his feet good god sir you cant he broke off and stared in amazement at the sight of the prisoner catapulting himself bodily across the room to crash into a distant corner one arm upcurved in rigid defence stark unreasoning panic limned in every feature of his face slowly stevens looked away saw the triumphant grin on andreas face the dawning comprehension in browns and millers suddenly he felt a complete fool characteristically miller was the first to speak waal waal whaddya know mebbe he does speaka da eenglish after all maybe he does mallory admitted a man doesnt spend ten minutes with his ear glued to a keyhole if he doesnt understand a word thats being said give matthews a call will you brown the sentry appeared in the doorway a few seconds later get captain briggs here will you matthews he asked at once please the soldier hesitated captain briggs has gone to bed sir he left strict orders that he wasnt to be disturbed my heart bleeds for captain briggs and his broken slumbers mallory said acidly hes had more sleep in a day than ive had in the past week he glanced at his watch and the heavy brows came down in a straight line over the tired brown eyes weve no time to waste get him here at once understand at once matthews saluted and hurried away miller cleared his throat and clucked his tongue sadly these hotels are all the same the goinson youd never believe your eyes remember once i was at a convention in cincinnati mallory shook his head wearily you have a fixation about hotels corporal this is a military establishment and these are army officers billets miller made to speak but changed his mind the american was a shrewd judge of people there were those who could be ribbed and those who could not be ribbed an almost hopeless mission miller was quietly aware and as vital as it was in his opinion suicidal but he was beginning to understand why theyd picked this tough sunburnt new zealander to lead it they sat in silence for the next five minutes then looked up as the door opened captain briggs was hatless and wore a white silk muffler round his throat in place of the usual collar and tie the white contrasted oddly with the puffed red of the heavy neck and face above these had been red enough when mallory had first seen them in the colonels office high blood pressure and even higher living mallory had supposed the extra deeper shades of red and purple now present probably sprung from a misplaced sense of righteous indignation a glance at the choleric eyes gleaming lightblue prawns afloat in a sea of vermilion was quite enough to confirm the obvious i think this is a bit much captain mallory the voice was high pitched in anger more nasal than ever im not the duty errandboy you know ive had a damned hard day and save it for your biography mallory said curtly and take a gander at this character in the corner briggss face turned an even deeper hue he stepped into the room fists balled in anger then stopped in his tracks as his eye lit on the crumpled dishevelled flgure still crouched in the corner of the room good god he ejaculated nicolai you know him it was a statement not a question of course i know him briggs snorted everybody knows him nicolal our laundryboy your laundryboy do his duties entail snooping around the corridors at night listening at keyholes what do you mean what i say mallory was very patient we caught him listening outside the door nicolai i dont believe it watch it mister miller growled careful who you call a liar we all saw him briggs stared in fascination at the black muzzle of the automatic waving negligently in his direction gulped looked hastily away well what if you did he forced a smile nicolai cant speak a word of english maybe not mallory agreed dryly but he understands it well enough he raised his hand ive no desire to argue all night and i certainly havent the time will you please have this man placed under arrest kept in solitary confinement and incommunicado for the next week at least its vital whether hes a spy or just too damned nosy he knows far too much after that do what you like my advice is to kick him out of castelrosso your advice indeed briggss colour returned and with it his courage who the hell are you to give me advice or to give me orders captain mallory there was a heavy emphasis on the word captain then im asking it as a favour mallory pleaded wearily i cant explain but its terribly important there are hundreds of lives hundreds of lives briggs sneered melodramatic stuff and nonsense he smiled unpleasantly i suggest you keep that for your cloakanddagger biography captain mallory mallory rose walked round the table stopped a foot away from briggs the brown eyes were still and very cold i could go and see your colonel i suppose but im tired of arguing youll do exactly as i say or ill go straight to naval hq and get on the radiotelephone to cairo and if i do mallory went on i swear to you that youll be on the next ship home to england and on the troopdeck at that his last words seemed to echo in the little room for an interminable time the stillness was intense and then as suddenly as it had arisen the tension was gone and briggss face a now curiously mottled white and red was slack and sullen in defeat all right all right he said no need for all these damned stupid threats not if it means all that much to you the attempt to bluster to patch up the shredded rags of his dignity was pathetic in its transparency matthews call out the guard the torpedoboat great engines throttled back half speed pitched and lifted pitched and lifted with monotonous regularity as it thrust its way into the long gentle swell from the wnw for the hundredth time that night mallory looked at his watch running behind time sir stevens suggested mallory nodded we should have stepped straight into this thing from the sunderland there was a holdup brown grunted engine trouble for a flyer the aydeside accent was very heavy yes thats right mallory looked up surprised how did you know always the same with these blasted mtb engines brown growled temperamental as a film star there was silence for a time in the tiny blackedout cabin a silence broken only by the occasional clink of a glass the navy was living up to its traditional hospitality if were late miller observed at last why doesnt the skipper open her up they tell me these crates can do forty to fifty knots you look green enough already stevens said tactlessly obviously youve never been in an mtb full out in a heavy sea miller fell silent a moment clearly he was trying to take his mind off his internal troubles captain yes what is it mallory answered sleepily he was stretched full length on a narrow settee an almost empty glass in his fingers none of my business i know boss but would you have carried out that threat you made to captain briggs mallory laughed it is none of your business but well no corporal i wouldnt i wouldnt because i couldnt i havent all that much authority invested in me and i didnt even know whether there was a radiotelephone in castelrosso yeah yeah do you know i kinda suspected that corporal miller rubbed a stubbled chin if hed called your bluff what would you have done boss id have shot nicolai mallory said quietly if the colonel had failed me id have had no choice left i knew that too i really believe you would for the first time im beginning to believe weve got a chance but i kinda wish you had shot him and little lord fauntleroy i didnt like the expression on old briggs face when you went out that door mean wasnt the word he coulda killed you then you trampled right over his pride boss and to a phoney like that nothin else in the world matters mallory made no reply he was already sound asleep his empty glass fallen from his hand not even the banshee clamour of the great engines opening full out as they entered the sheltered calm of the rhodes channel could plumb his bottomless abyss of sleep chapter monday my dear fellow you make me feel dreadfully embarrassed moodily the officer switched his ivoryhandled flyswat against an immaculately trousered leg pointed a contemptuous but gleaming toecap at the ancient caique broadbeamed and twomasted moored stern on to the even older and more dilapidated wooden pier on which they were standing i am positively ashamed the clients of rutledge and company i assure you are accustomed only to the best mallory smothered a smile major rutledge of the buffs eton and sandhurst as to intonation millimetrically toothbrushed as to moustache savile row as to the quite dazzling sartorial perfection of his khaki drill was so magnificently out of place in the wild beauty of the rocky treelined bluffs of that winding creek that his presence there seemed inevitable such was the majors casual assurance so dominating his majestic unconcern that it was the creek if anything that seemed slightly out of place it does look as if it has seen better days mallory admitted nevertheless sir its exactly what we want cant understand it i really cant understand it with an irritable but welltimed swipe the major brought down a harmless passing fly ive been providing chaps with everything during the past eight or nine months caiques launches yachts fishing boats everything but no one has ever yet specified the oldest most dilapidated derelict i could lay hands on quite a job laying hands on it too i tell you a pained expression crossed his face the chaps know i dont usually deal in this line of stuff what chaps mallory asked curiously oh up the islands you know rutledge gestured vaguely to the north and west but but those are enemy held sos this one chaps got to have his hq somewhere rutledge explained patiently suddenly his expression brightened i say old boy i know just the thing for you a boat to escape observation and investigation that was what cairo insisted i get how about a german eboat absolutely perfect condition one careful owner could get ten thou for her at home thirtysix hours pal of mine over in bodrum bodrum mallory questioned bodrum but but thats in turkey isnt it turkey well yes actually i believe it is rutledge admitted chap has to get his supplies from somewhere you know he added defensively thanks all the same mallory smiled but this is exactly what we want we cant wait anyway on your own heads be it rutledge threw up his hands in admission of defeat ill have a couple of my men shove your stuff aboard id rather we did it ourselves sir its well its a very special cargo right you are the major acknowledged no questions rutledge they call me leaving soon mallory looked at his watch half an hour sir bacon eggs and coffee in ten minutes thanks very much mallory grinned thats one offer well be very glad to accept he turned away walked slowly down to the end of the pier he breathed deeply savouring the heady herbscented air of an aegean dawn the salt tang of the sea the drowsily sweet perfume of honeysuckle the more delicate sharper fragrance of mint all subtly merged into an intoxicating whole indefinable unforgettable on either side the steep slopes still brilliantly green with pine and walnut and holly stretched far up to the moorland pastures above and from these faintly borne on the perfumed breeze came the distant melodic tinkling of goats bells a haunting a nostalgic music true symbol of the leisured peace the aegean no longer knew unconsciously almost mallory shook his head and walked more quickly to the end of the pier the others were still sitting where the torpedo boat had landed them just before dawn miller inevitably was stretched his full length hat tilted against the golden level rays of the rising sun sorry to disturb you and all that but were leaving in half an hour breakfast in ten minutes lets get the stuff aboard he turned to brown maybe youd like to have a look at the engine he suggested brown heaved himself to his feet looked down unenthusiastically at the weatherbeaten paintpeeled caique right you are sir but if the engine is on a par with this bloody wreck he shook his head in prophetic gloom and swung nimbly over the side of the pier mallory and andrea followed him reaching up for the equipment as the other two passed it down first they stowed away a sackful of old clothes then the food pressure stove and fuel the heavy boots spikes mallets rock axes and coils of wirecentred rope to be used for climbing then more carefully the combined radio receiver and transmitter and the firing generator fitted with the oldfashioned plunge handle next came the guns two schmeissers two brens a mauser and a colt then a case containing a weird but carefully selected hodgepodge of torches mirrors two sets of identity papers and incredibly bottles of hock moselie ouzo and retsima finally and with exaggerated care they stowed away forard in the forepeak two wooden boxes one green in colour medium sized and bound in brass the other small and black the green box held high explosive tnt amatol and a few standard sticks of dynamite together with grenades guncotton primers and canvas hosing in one corner of the box was a bag of emery dust another of ground glass and a sealed jar of potassium these last three items having been included against the possibility of dusty millers finding an opportunity to exercise his unique talents as a saboteur the black box held only detonators percussion and electrical detonators with fulminates so unstable that their exposed powder could be triggered off by the impact of a falling feather the last box had been stowed away when casey browns head appeared above the engine hatch slowly he examined the mainmast reaching up above his head as slowly turned forard to look at the foremast his face carefully expressionless he looked at mallory have we got sails for these things sir i suppose so why because god only knows were going to need them brown said bitterly have a look at the engineroom you said this isnt an engineroom its a bloody scrapyard and the biggest most rusted bit of scrap down there is attached to the propeller shaft and what do you think it is an old kelvin twocylinder job built more or less on my own doorstep about thirty years ago brown shook his head in despair his face as stricken as only a clydeside engineers can be at the abuse of a beloved machine and its been falling to bits for years sir place is littered with discarded bits and spares ive seen junk heaps off the gallowgate that were palaces compared to this major rutledge said it was running only yesterday mallory said mildly anyway come on ashore breakfast remind me were to pick up a few heavy stones on the way back will you stones miller looked at him in horror aboard that thing mallory nodded smiling but that gawddamned ship is sinkin already miller protested what do you want stones for wait and see three hours later miller saw the caique was chugging steadily north over a glassy windless sea less than a mile off the coast of turkey when he mournfully finished lashing his blue battledress into a tight ball and heaved it regretfully over the side weighted by the heavy stone he had carried aboard it was gone from sight in a second morosely he surveyed himself in the mirror propped up against the forard end of the wheelhouse apart from a deep violet sash wrapped round his lean middle and a fancifully embroidered waistcoat with its former glory mercifully faded be was dressed entirely in black black lacing jackboots black baggy trousers black shirt and black jacket even his sandy hair had been dyed to the same colour he shuddered and turned away thank gawd the boys back home cant see me now he said feelingly he looked critically at the others dressed with some minor variations like himself waal mebbe i aint quite so bad after all just what is all this quickchange business for boss they tell me youve been behind the german lines twice once as a peasant once as a mechanic mallory heaved his own ballasted uniform over the side well now you see what the welldressed navaronian wears the double change i meant once in the plane and now oh i see army khaki and naval whites in alex blue battledress in casteirosso and now greek clothes could have been almost certainly were snoopers in alex or casteirosso or major rutledges island and weve changed from launch to plane to mtb to caique covering our tracks corporal we just cant take any chances miller nodded looked down at the clothes sack at his feet wrinkled his brows in puzzlement stooped and dragged out the white clothing that had caught his eye he held up the long voluminous clothes for inspection to be used when passing through the local cemeteries i suppose he was heavily ironic disguised as ghosts camouflage mallory explained succinctly snowsmocks what snow that white stuff there are some pretty high mountains in navarone and we may have to take to them so snowsmocks miller looked stunned wordlessly he stretched his length on the deck pillowed his head and closed his eyes mallory grinned at andrea picture of a man getting his full quota of sunshine before battling with the arctic wastes not a bad idea maybe you should get some sleep too ill keep watch for a couple of hours for five hours the caique continued on its course parallel to the turkish coast slightly west of north and rarely more than two miles offshore relaxed and warm in the still kindly november sun mallory sat wedged between the bulwarks of the blunt bows his eyes ceaselessly quartering sky and horizon amidships andrea and miller lay asleep casey brown still defied all attempts to remove him from the engineroom occasionally very occasionally he came up for a breath of fresh air but the intervals between his appearances steadily lengthened as he concentrated more and more on the aged kelvin engine regulating the erratic dripfed lubrication constantly adjusting the air intake an engineer to his fingertips he was unhappy about that engine he was drowsy too and headachy the narrow hatchway gave hardly any ventilation at all alone in the wheelhouse an unusual feature in so tiny a caique lieutenant andy stevens watched the turkish coast slide slowly by like mallorys his eyes moved ceaselessly but not with the same controlled wandering they shifted from the coast to the chart from the chart to the islands up ahead off the port bow islands whose position and relation to each other changed continually and deceptively islands gradually lifting from the sea and hardening in definition through the haze of blue refraction from the islands to the old alcohol compass swinging almost imperceptibly on rusted gimbals and from the compass back to the coast again occasionally he peered up into the sky or swung a quick glance through a degree sweep of the horizon but one thing his eyes avoided all the time the chipped flyblown mirror had been hung up in the wheelhouse again but it was as if his eyes and the mirror were of opposite magnetic poles he could not bring himself to look at it his forearms ached he had been spelled at the wheel twice but still they ached abominably his lean tanned hands were ivoryknuckled on the cracked wheel repeatedly consciously he tried to relax to ease the tension that was bunching up the muscles of his arms but always as if possessed of independent volition his hands tightened their grip again there was a funny taste in his mouth too a sour and salty taste in a dry parched mouth and no matter how often he swallowed or drank from the sunwarmed pitcher at his side the taste and the dryness remained he could no more exorcise them than he could that twisting cramping ball that was knotting up his insides just above the solar plexus or the queer uncontrollable tremor that gripped his right leg from time to time lieutenant andy stevens was afraid he had never been in action before but it wasnt that this wasnt the first time he had been afraid he had been afraid all his life ever since he could remember and he could remember a long way back even to his early prepschool days when his famous father sir cedric stevens the most celebrated explorer and mountaineer of his time bad thrown him bodily into the swimming pool at home telling him that this was the only way he could learn to swim he could remember still how he had fought and spluttered his way to the side of the pool panicstricken and desperate his nose and mouth blocked with water the pit of his stomach knotted and constricted in that nameless terrifying ache he was to come to know so well how his father and two elder brothers big and jovial and nerveless like sir cedric himself had wiped the tears of mirth from their eyes and pushed him in again his father and brothers it had been like that all through his schooldays together the three of them bad made his life thoroughly miserable tough hearty openair types who worshipped at the shrine of athleticism and physical fitness they could not understand bow anyone could fail to revel in diving from a fivemetre springboard or setting a hunter at a fivebarred gate or climbing the crags of the peak district or sailing a boat in a storm all these things they had made him do and often he had failed in the doing and neither his father nor his brothers could ever have understood how he had come to dread those violent sports in which they excelled for they were not cruel men nor even unkind but simply stupid and so to the simple physical fear he sometimes and naturally felt was added the fear of failure the fear that he was bound to fail in whatever he had to do next the fear of the inevitable mockery and ridicule and because he had been a sensitive boy and feared the ridicule above all else he had come to fear these things that provoked the ridicule finally he had come to fear fear itself and it was in a desperate attempt to overcome this double fear that he had devoted himself this in his late teens to crag and mountain climbing in this he had ultimately become so proficient developed such a reputation that father and brothers had come to treat him with respect and as an equal and the ridjcule had ceased but the fear had not ceased rather it had grown by what it fed on and often on a particularly difficult climb be had all but fallen to his death powerless in the grip of sheer unreasoning terror but this terror he had always sought successfully so far to conceal as now he was trying to overcome to conceal that fear now he was afraid of failing in what he wasnt quite sure of not measuring up to expectation he was afraid of being afraid and he was desperately afraid above all things of being seen of being known to be afraid the startling incredible blue of the aegean the soft hazy silhouette of the anatolian mountains against the washedout cerulean of the sky the heartcatching magical blending of the blues and violets and purples and indigoes of the sunsoaked islands drifting lazily by almost on the beam now the iridescent rippling of the water fanned by the gentle scentladen breeze newly sprung from the southeast the peaceful scene on deck the reassuring interminable thumpthump thumpthump of the old kelvin engine all was peace and quiet and contentment and warmth and languor and it seemed impossible that anyone could be afraid the world and the war were very far away that afternoon or perhaps after all the war wasnt so far away there were occasional pinpricks and constant reminders twice a german arado seaplane had circled curiously overhead and a savoia and fiat flying in company had altered course dipped to have a look at them and flown off apparently satisfied italian planes these and probably based on rhodes they were almost certainly piloted by germans who had rounded up their erstwhile rhodian allies and put them in prison camps after the surrender of the italian government in the morning they had passed within half a mile of a big german caique if flew the german flag and bristled with mounted machineguns and a twopounder far up in the bows and in the early afternoon a highspeed german launch had roared by so closely that their caique had rolled wickedly in the wash of its passing mallory and andrea had shaken their fists and cursed loudly and fluently at the grinning sailors on deck but there had been no attempts to molest or detain them neither british nor german hesitated at any time to violate the neutrality of turkish territorial waters but by the strange quixotry of a tacit gentlemens agreement hostilities between passing vessels and planes were almost unknown like the envoys of warring countries in a neutral capital their behaviour ranged from the impeccably and frigidly polite to a very pointed unawareness of one anothers existence these then were the pinpricksthe visitations and bygoings harmless though they were of the ships and planes of the enemy the other reminders that this was no peace but an illusion an ephemeral and a frangible thing were more permanent slowly the minute hands of their watches circled and every tick took them nearer to that great wall of cliff barely eight hours away that had to be climbed somehow and almost dead ahead now and less than fifty miles distant they could see the grim jagged peaks of navarone topping the shimmering horizon and reaching up darkly against the sapphired sky desolate and remote and strangely threatening at halfpast two in the afternoon the engine stopped there had been no warning coughs or splutters or missed strokes one moment the regular reassuring thumpthump the next sudden completely unexpected silence oppressive and foreboding in its absoluteness mallory was the first to reach the engine hatch whats up brown his voice was sharp with anxiety engine broken down not quite sir brown was stifi bent over the engine his voice muffled i shut it off just now he straightened his back hoisted himself wearily through the hatchway sat on deck with his feet dangling sucking in great draughts of fresh air beneath the heavy tan his face was very pale mallory looked at him closely you look as if you had the fright of your life not that brown shook his head for the past twothree hours ive been slowly poisoned down that ruddy hole only now i realise it he passed a hand across his brow and groaned top of my blinkin head just about lifting off sir carbon monoxide aint a very healthy thing exhaust leak aye but its more than a leak now he pointed down at the engine see that standpipe supporting that big iron ball above the engine the watercooler that pipes as thin as paper must have been leaking above the bottom flange for hours blew out a bloody great hole a minute ago sparks smoke and flames six inches long had to shut the damned thing off at once sir mallory nodded in slow understanding and now what can you repair it brown not a chance sir the shake of the head was very definite would have to be brazed or welded but theres a spare down there among the scrap rusted to hell and about as shaky as the one thats on ill have a go sir ill give him a hand miller volunteered thanks corporal how long brown do you think lord only knows sir two hours maybe four most of the nuts and bolts are locked solid with rust have to shear or saw em and then hunt for others mallory said nothing he turned away heavily brought up beside stevens who had abandoned the wheelhouse and was now bent over the sail locker he looked up questioningly as mallory approached mallory nodded just get them out and up maybe four hours brown says andrea and i will do our landlubberly best to help two hours later with the engine still out of commission they were well outside territorial waters closing on a big island some eight miles away to the wnw the wind warm and oppressive now had backed to a darkening and thundery east and with only a lug and a jib all the sails they had found bent to the foremast they could make no way at all into it mallory had decided to make for the island the chances of being observed there were far less than in the open sea anxiously he looked at his watch then stared back moodily at the receding safety of the turkish shore then he stiffened peered closely at the dark line of sea land and sky that lay to the east andrea do you see i see it captain andrea was at his shoulder caique three miles coming straight towards us he added softly coming straight towards us mallory acquiesced tell miller and brown have them come here mallory wasted no time when they were all assembled were going to be stopped and investigated he said quickly unless im much mistaken its that big caique that passed us this morning heaven only knows how but theyve been tipped off and theyre going to be as suspicious as hell thisli be no kidglove handsinthe pockets inspection theyll be armed to the teeth and hunting trouble theres going to be no halfmeasures lets be quite clear about that either they go under or we do we cant possibly survive an inspection not with all the gear weve got aboard and he added softly were not going to dump that gear rapidly he explained his plans stevens leaning out from the wheelhouse window felt the old sick ache in his stomach felt the blood leaving his face he was glad of the protection of the wheelhouse that bid the lower part of his body that old familiar tremor in his leg was back again even his voice was unsteady but sir sir yes yes what is it stevens even in his hurry mallory paused at the sight of the pale set face the bloodless nails clenched over the sill of the window you you cant do that sir the voice burred harshly under the sharp edge of strain for a moment his mouth worked soundlessly then he rushed on its massacre sir its its just murder shut up kid miller growled thatll do corporal mallory said sharply he looked at the american for a long moment then turned to stevens his eyes cold lieutenant the whole concept of directing a successful war is aimed at placing your enemy at a disadvantage at not giving him an even chance we kill them or they kill us they go under or we do and a thousand men on kheros its just as simple as that lieutenant its not even a question of conscience for several seconds stevens stared at mallory in complete silence he was vaguely aware that everyone was looking at him in that instant he hated mallory could have killed him he hated him becausesuddenly he was aware that he hated him only for the remorseless logic of what he said he stared down at his clenched hands mallory the idol of every young mountaineer and cragsman in prewar england whose fantastic climbing exploits had made world headlines in and mallory who had twice been baulked by the most atrocious illfortune from surprising rommel in his desert headquarters mallory who had three times refused promotion in order to stay with his beloved cretans who worshipped him the other side of idolatry confusedly these thoughts tumbled through his mind and he looked up slowly looked at the lean sunburnt face the sensitive chiselled mouth the heavy dark eyebrows barstraight over the lined brown eyes that could be so cold or so compassionate and suddenly he felt ashamed knew that captain mallory lay beyond both his understanding and his judgment i am very sorry sir he smiled faintly as corporal miller would say i was talking out of turn he looked aft at the caique arrowing up from the southeast again he felt the sick fear but his voice was steady enough as he spoke i wont let you down sir good enough i never thought you would mallory smiled in turn looked at miller and brown get the stuff ready and lay it out will you casual easy and keep it hidden theyll have the glasses on you he turned away walked forard andrea followed him you were very hard on the young man it was neither criticism nor reproach merely statement of fact i know mallory shrugged i didnt like it either i had to do it i think you had andrea said slowly yes i think you had but it was hard do you think theyll use the big gun in the bows to stop us might they havent turned back after us unless theyre pretty sure were up to something fishy but the warning shot across the bows they dont go in for that captain teach stuff normally andrea wrinkled his brows captain teach never mind mallory smiled time we were taking up position now remember wait for me you wont have any trouble in hearing my signal he finished dryly the creaming bowwave died away to a gentle ripple the throb of the heavy diesel muted to a distant murmur as the german boat slid alongside barely six feet away from where he sat on a fishbox on the port of the focsle industriously sewing a button on to the old coat lying on the deck between his legs mallory could see six men all dressed in the uniform of the regular german navy one crouched behind a belted spandau mounted on its tripod just aft of the twopounder three others bunched amidships each armed with an automatic machine carbine schmeissers he thought the captain a hard coldfaced young lieutenant with the iron cross on his tunic looking out the open door of the wheelhouse and finally a curious head peering over the edge of the engineroom hatch from where he sat mallory couldnt see the poopdeck the intermittent ballooning of the lugsail in the uncertain wind blocked his vision but from the restricted foreandaft lateral sweep of the spandau hungrily traversing only the forard half of their own caique be was reasonably sure that there was another machinegunner similarly engaged on the germans poop the hardfaced young lieutenant a real product of the hitler jugend that one mallory thought leaned out of the wheelhouse cupped his hand to his mouth lower your sails he shouted mallory stiffened froze to immobility the needle had jammed hard into the palm of his band but he didnt even notice it the lieutenant had spoken in english stevens was so young so inexperienced hell fall for it mallory thought with a sudden sick certainty hes bound to fall for it but stevens didnt fall for it he opened the door leaned out cupped his hand to his ear and gazed vacantly up to the sky his mouth wide open it was so perfect an imitation of dullwitted failure to catch or comprehend a shouted message that it was almost a caricature mallory could have hugged him not in his actions alone but in his dark shabby clothes and hair as blackly counterfeit as millers stevens was the slow suspicious island fisherman to the life eh he bawled lower your sails we are coming aboard english again mallory noted a persistent fellow this stevens stared at him blankly looked round helplessly at andrea and mallory their faces registered a lack of comprehension as convincing as his own he shrugged his shoulders in despair i am sorry i do not understand german he shouted can you not speak my language stevenss greek was perfect fluent and idiomatic it was also the greek of attica not of the islands but mallory felt sure that the lieutenant wouldnt know the difference he didnt he shook his head in exasperation called in slow halting greek stop your boat at once we are coming aboard stop my boat the indignation was so genuine the accompanying flood of furious oaths so authentic that even the lieutenant was momentarily taken back and why should i stop my boat for you you you you have ten seconds the lieutenant interrupted he was on balance again cold precise then we will shoot stevens gestured in admission of defeat and turned to andrea and mallory our conquerors have spoken he said bitterly lower the sails quickly they loosened the sheets from the cleats at the foot of the mast mallory pulled the jib down gathered the sail in his arms and squatted sullenly on the deck he knew a dozen hostile eyes were watching him close by the fish box the sail covering his knees and the old coat his forearms on his thighs he sat with head bowed and hands dangling between his knees the picture of heartstruck dejection the lugsail weighted by the boom at the top came down with a rush andrea stepped over it walked a couple of uncertain paces aft then stopped huge hands hanging emptily by his sides a sudden deepening in the muted throbbing of the diesel a spin of the wheel and the big german caique was rubbing alongside quickly but carefully enough to keep out of the line of fire of the mounted spandaus there was a second clearly visible now on the poop the three men armed with the schmeissers leapt aboard immediately one ran forward whirled round level with the foremast his automatic carbine circling gently to cover all of the crew all except mallory and be was leaving mallory in the safe bands of the spandan gunner in the bows detachedly mallory admired the precision the timing the clockwork inevitability of an old routine he raised his head looked around him with a slow peasant indifference casey brown was squatting on the deck abreast the engineroom working on the big bailsilencer on top of the batchcover dusty miller two paces farther forard and with his brows furrowed in concentration was laboriously cutting a section of metal from a little tin box presumably to help in the engine repairs he was holding the wirecutting pliers in his left hand and miller mallory knew was righthanded neither stevens nor andrea had moved the man beside the foremast still stood there eyes unwinking the other two were walking slowly aft bad just passed andrea their carriage relaxed and easy the bearing of men who know they have everything so completely under control that even the idea of trouble is ridiculous carefully coldly and precisely at pointblank range and through the folds of both coat and sail mallory shot the spandau machinegunner through the heart swung the still chattering bren round and saw the guard by the mast crumple and die half his chest torn away by the tearing slugs of the machinegun but the dead man was still on his feet still had not hit the deck when four things happened simultaneously casey brown had had his band on millers silenced automatic lying concealed beneath the ballsilencer for over a minute now he squeezed the trigger four times for he wanted to mak siccar the after machinegunner leaned forward tiredly over his tripod lifeless fingers locked on the firingguard miller crimped the threesecond chemical fuse with the pliers lobbed the tin box into the enemy engineroom stevens spun the armed stickgrenade into the opposite wheelhouse and andrea his great arms reaching out with all the speed and precision of striking cobras swept the schmeisser gunners beads together with sickening force and then all five men had hurled themselves to the deck and the german caique was erupting in a roar of flame and smoke and flying debris gradually the echoes faded away over the sea and there was left only the whining stammer of the spandau emptying itself uselessly skyward and then the belt jammed and the aegean was as silent as ever more silent than it had ever been slowly painfully dazed by the sheer physical shock and the earshattering proximity of the twin explosions mallory pushed himself off the wooden deck and stood shakily on his feet his first conscious reaction was that of surprise incredulity almost the concussive blast of a grenade and a couple of lashed blocks of tnt even at such close range was far beyond anything he had expected the german boat was sinking sinking fast millers homemade bomb must have torn the bottom out of the engineroom she was heavily on fire amidships and for one dismayed instant mallory had an apprehensive yision of towering black columns of smoke and enemy reconnaissance planes but only for an instant timbers and planking tinderdry and resinous were burning furiously with hardly a trace of smoke and the flaming crumbling deck was already canted over sharply to port she would be gone in seconds his eyes wandered to the shattered skeleton of the wheelhouse and he caught his breath suddenly when he saw the lieutenant impaled on the splintered wreck of the wheel a ghastly mangled caricature of what had once been a human being decapitated and wholly horrible vaguely some part of mallorys mind registered the harsh sound of retching violent and convulsive coming from the wheelhouse and he knew stevens must have seen it too from deep within the sinking caique came the muffled roar of rupturing fuel tanks a flameveined gout of oily black smoke erupted from the engineroom and the caique miraculously struggled back on even keel her gunwales almost awash and then the hissing waters had overflowed and overcome the decks and the twisting flames and the caique was gone her slender masts sliding vertically down and vanishing in a turbulent welter of creaming foam and oilfilmed bubbles and now the aegean was calm and peaceful again as placid as if the caique had never been and almost as empty a few charred planks and an inverted helmet drifted lazily on the surface of the shimmering sea with a conscious effort of will mallory turned slowly to look to his own ship and his own men brown and miller were on their feet staring down in fascination at where the caique had been stevens was standing at the wheelhouse door he too was unhurt but his face was ashen during the brief action he had been a man above himself but the aftermath the brief glimpse hed had of the dead lieutenant had hit him badly andrea bleeding from a gash on the cheek was looking down at the two schmeisser gunners lying at his feet his face was expressionless for a long moment mallory looked at him looked in slow understanding dead he asked quietly andrea inclined his head yes his voice was heavy i hit them too bard mallory turned away of all the men he had ever known andrea he thought had the most call to hate and to kill his enemies and kill them he did with a ruthless efficiency appalling in its singlemindedness and thoroughness of execution but he rarely killed without regret without the most bitter selfcondemnation for he did not believe that the lives of his fellowmen were his to take a destroyer of his fellowman he loved his fellowman above all things a simple man a good man a killer with a kindly heart be was for ever troubled by his conscience ill at ease with his inner self but over and above the wonderings and the reproaches he was informed by an honesty of thought by a clearsighted wisdom which sprang from and transcended his innate simplicity andrea killed neither for revenge nor from hate nor nationalism nor for the sake of any of the other isms which selfseekers and fools and knaves employ as beguilement to the battlefield and justification for the slaughter of millions too young and too unknowing to comprehend the dreadful futility of it all andrea killed simply that better men might live anybody else hurt mallorys voice was deliberately brisk cheerful nobody good right lets get under way as fast as possible the farther and the faster we leave this place behind the better for all of us he looked at his watch almost four oclock time for our routine check with cairo just leave that scrapyard of for a couple of minutes chief see if you can pick them up he looked at the sky to the east a sky now purply livid and threatening and shook his head could be that the weather forecast might be worth bearing it was reception was very poor brown blamed the violent static on the dark convoluted thunderheads steadily creeping up astern now overspreading almost half the sky but adequate adequate enough to hear information they had never expected to hear information that left them silenced eyes stilled in troubled speculation the tiny loudspeaker boomed and faded boomed and faded against the scratchy background of static rhubarb calling pimpernel rhubarb calling pimpernell these were the respective code names for cairo and mallory are you receiving me brown tapped an acknowledgment the speaker boomed again rhubarb calling pimpernel now x minus one repeat x minus one mallory drew in his breath sharply x dawn on saturday had been the assumed date for the german attack on kheros it must have been advanced by one day and jensen was not the man to speak without certain knowledge friday dawn just over three days send x minus one understood mallory said quietly forecast east anglia the impersonal voice went on the northern sporades mallory knew severe electrical storms probable this evening with heavy rainfall visibility poor temperature falling continuing to fall next twentyfour hours winds east to southeast force six locally eight moderating early tomorrow mallory turned away ducked under the billowing lugsail walked slowly aft what a setup he thought what a bloody mess three days to go engine u s and a firstclass storm building up he thought briefly hopefully of squadron leader torrances low opinion of the backroom boys of the met office but the hope was never really born it couldnt be not unless he was blind the steeppiled buttresses of the thunderheads towered up darkly terrifying now almost directly above looks pretty bad huh the slow nasal drawl came from immediately behind him there was something oddly reassuring about that measured voice about the steadiness of the washedout blue of the eyes enmeshed in a spiders web of fine wrinkles its not so good mallory admitted whats all this force eight business boss a wind scale mallory explained if youre in a boat this size and youre good and tired of life you cant beat a force eight wind miller nodded dolefully i knew it i might have known and me swearing theyd never get me on a gawddamned boat again he brooded a while sighed slid his legs over the engineroom hatchway jerked his thumb in the direction of the nearest island now less than three miles away that doesnt look so hot either not from here mallory agreed but the chart shows a creek with a rightangle bend itll break the sea and the wind inhabited probably germans probably miller shook his head in despair and descended to help brown forty minutes later in the semidarkness of the overcast evening and in torrential rain lancestraight and strangely chill the anchor of the caique rattled down between the green walls of the forest a dank and dripping forest hostile in its silent indifference chapter monday evening brilliant said mallory bitterly ruddy well brilliant come into my parlour said the spider to the fly he swore in chagrin and exasperated disgust eased aside the edge of the tarpaulin that covered the forard hatchway peered out through the slackening curtain of rain and took a second and longer look at the rocky bluff that elbowed out into the bend of the creek shutting them off from the sea there was no difficulty in seeing now none at all the drenching cloudburst had yielded to a gentle drizzle and grey and white cloud streamers shredding in the lifting wind had already pursued the blackly towering cuniulonimbus over the far horizon in a clear band of sky far to the west the sinking flamered sun was balanced on the rim of the sea from the shadowed waters of the creek it was invisible but its presence unmistakable from the goldshot gauze of the falling rain high above their heads the same golden rays highlighted the crumbling old watchtower on the very point of the cliff a hundred feet above the river they burnished its finegrained white parian marble mellowed it to a delicate rose they gleamed on the glittering steel the evil mouths of the spandau machineguns reaching out from the slotted embrasures in the massive walls illumined the hooked cross of the swastika on the flag that streamed out stiffly from the staff above the parapet solid even in its decay impregnable in its position commanding in its lofty outlook the tower completely dominated both waterborne approaches from the sea and upriver down the narrow winding channel that lay between the moored caique and the foot of the cliff slowly reluctantly almost mallory turned away and gently lowered the tarpaulin his face was grim as he turned round to andrea and stevens indefined shadows in the twilit gloom of the cabin brilliant he repeated sheer genius mastermind mallory probably the only bloody creek within a hundred miles and in a hundred islands with a german guard post on it and of course i had to go and pick it lets have another look at that chart will you stevens stevens passed it across watched mallory study it in the pale light filtering in under the tarpaulin leaned back against the bulkhead and drew heavily on his cigarette it tasted foul stale and acrid but the tobacco was fresh enough he knew the old sick fear was back again as strongly as ever he looked at the great bulk of andrea across from him felt an illogical resentment towards him for having spotted the emplacement a few minutes ago theyll have cannon up there he thought dully theyre bound to have cannon couldnt control the creek otherwise he gripped his thigh fiercely just above the knee but the tremor lay too deep to be controlled he blessed the merciful darkness of the tiny cabin but his voice was casual enough as he spoke youre wasting your time sir looking at that chart and blaming yourself this is the only possible anchorage within hours of sailing time from here with that wind there was nowhere else we could have gone exactly thats just it mallory folded the chart handed it back there was nowhere else we could have gone there was nowhere else anyone could have gone must be a very popular port in a storm this a fact which must have become apparent to the germans a long long time ago thats why i should have known they were almost bound to have a post here however spilt milk as you say he raised his voice chief halo browns muffled voice carried faintly from the depths of the engineroom hows it going not too bad sir assembling it now mallory nodded in relief how long he called an hour aye easy sir an hour again mallory glanced through the tarpaulin looked back at andrea and stevens just about right well leave in an hour dark enough to give us some protection from our friends up top but enough light left to navigate our way out of this damned corkscrew of a channel do you think theyll try to stop us sir stevenss voice was just too casual too matter of fact he was pretty sure mallory would notice its unlikely theyll line the banks and give us three hearty cheers mallory said dryly how many men do you reckon theyll have up there andrea ive seen two moving around andrea said thoughtfully maybe three or four altogether captain a small post the germans dont waste men on these i think youre about right mallory agreed most of themll be in the garrison in the village about seven miles from here according to the chart and due west its not likely he broke off sharply stiffened in rigid attention again the call came louder this time imperative in its tone cursing himself for his negligence in not posting a guard such carelessness would have cost him his life in crete mallory pulled the tarpaulin aside clambered slowly on to the deck he carried no arms but a halfempty bottle of moselle dangled from his left hand as part of a plan prepared before they had left alexandria hed snatched it from a locker at the foot of the tiny companionway he lurched convincingly across the deck grabbed at a stay in time to save himself from falling overboard insolently he stared down at the figure on the bank less than ten yards away it hadnt mattered about a guard mallory realised for the soldier carried his automatic carbine slung over his shoulder insolently he tilted the wine to his mouth and swallowed deeply before condescending to talk to him he could see the mounting anger in the lean tanned face of the young german below him mallory ignored it slowly an inherent contempt in the gesture he dragged the frayed sleeve of his black jacket across his lips looked the soldier even more slowly up and down in a minutely provocative inspection as disdainful as it was prolonged well he asked truculently in the slow speech of the islands what the hell do you want even in the deepening dusk he could see the knuckles whitening in the stock of the carbine and for an instant mallory thought he had gone too far he knew he was in no danger all noise in the engineroom had ceased and dusty millers hand was never far from his silenced automatic but he didnt want trouble not just yet not while there were a couple of manned spandaus in that watchtower with an almost visible effort the young soldier regained his control it needed little help from the imagination to see the draining anger the first tentative stirrings of hesitation and bewilderment it was the reaction mallory had hoped for greeks even halfdrunken greeks didnt talk to their overlords like that not unless they had an overpoweringly good reason what vessel is this the greek was slow and halting but passable where are you bound for mallory tilted the bottle again smacked his lips in noisy satisfaction he held the bottle at arms length regarded it with a loving respect one thing about you germans he confided loudly you do know how to make a fine wine ill wager you cant lay your hands on this stuff eh and the swill theyre making up above the island term for the mainland is so full of resin that its only good for lighting fires he thought for a moment of course if you know the right people in the islands they might let you have some ouzo but some of us can get ouzo and the best hocks and the best moselles the soldier wrinkled his face in disgust like almost every fighting man he despised quislings even when they were on his side in greece they were very few indeed i asked you a question he said coldly what vessel and where bound the caique aigion mallory replied loftily in ballast for samoa under orders he said significantly whose orders the soldier demanded shrewdly mallory judged the confidence as superficial only the guard was impressed in spite of himself herr commandant in vathy general graebel mallory said softly you will have heard of the herr general before yes he was on safe ground here mallory knew the reputation of graebel both as a paratroop commander and an iron disciplinarian had spread far beyond these islands even in the halflight mallory could have sworn that the guards complexion turned paler but he was dogged enough you have papers letters of authority mallory sighed wearily looked over his shoulder andrea he bawled what do you want andreas great bulk loomed through the hatchway he had heard every word that passed had taken his cue from mallory a newlyopened wine bottle was almost engulfed in one vast hand and he was scowling hugely cant you see im busy he asked surlily he stopped short at the sight of the german and scowled again irritably and what does this haifling want our passes and letters of authority from herr general theyre down below andrea disappeared grumbling deep in his throat a rope was thrown ashore the stern pulled in against the sluggish current and the papers passed over the papers a set different from those to be used if emergency arose in navarone proved to be satisfactory eminently so mallory would have been surprised had they been anything else the preparation of these even down to the photostatic facsimile of general graebels signature was all in the days work for jensens bureau in cairo the soldier folded the papers handed them back with a muttered word of thanks he was only a kid mallory could see now if he was more than nineteen his looks belied him a pleasant openfaced kid of a different stamp altogether from the young fanatics of the ss panzer division and far too thin mallorys chief reaction was one of relief he would have hated to have to kill a boy like this but he had to find out all he could he signalled to stevens to hand him up the almost empty crate of moselle jensen he mused had been very thorough indeed the man had literally thought of everything mallory gestured lazily in the direction of the old watchtower how many of you are up there he asked the boy was instantly suspicious his face had tightened up stified in hostile surmise why do you want to know he asked stiffly mallory groaned lifted his hands in despair turned sadly to andrea you see what it is to be one of them he asked in mournful complaint trust nobody think everyone is as twisted as he broke off hurriedly turned to the soldier again its just that we dont want to have the same trouble every time we come in here he explained well be back in samos in a couple of days and weve still another case of moselle to work through general graebel keeps his ah special envoys well supplied it must be thirsty work up there in the sun come on now a bottle each how many bottles the reassuring mention that they would be back again the equally reassuring mention of graebels name plus probably the attraction of the offer and his comrades reaction if he told them he had refused it tipped the balance overcame scruples and suspicions there are only three of us he said grudgingly three it is mallory said cheerfully well bring you some hock next time we return he tilted his own bottle prosit he said an islander proud of airing his german and then more proudly still auf wiedersehen the boy murmured something in return he stood hesitating for a moment slightly shamefaced then wheeled abruptly walked off slowly along the river bank clutching his bottles of moselle so mallory said thoughtfully there are only three of them that should make things easier well done sir it was stevens who interrupted his voice warm his face alive with admiration jolly good show jolly good show miller mimicked he heaved his lanky length over the coaming of the engine hatchway good be damned i couldnt understand a gawddamned word but for my money that rates an oscar that was terrific boss thank you one and all mallory murmured but im afraid the congratulations are a bit premature the sudden chill in his voice struck at them so that their eyes aligned along his pointing finger even before he went on take a look he said quietly the young soldier had halted suddenly about two hundred yards along the bank looked into the forest on his left in startled surprise then dived in among the trees for a moment the watchers on the boat could see another soldier talking excitedly to the boy and gesticulating in the direction of their boat and then both were gone lost in the gloom of the forest thats torn it mallory said softly he turned away right thats enough back to where you were it would look fishy if we ignored that incident altogether but it would look a damned sight fishier if we paid too much attention to it dont lets appear to be holding a conference miller slipped down into the engineroom with brown and stevens went back to the little forard cabin mallory and andrea remained on deck bottles in their hands the rain had stopped now completely but the wind was still rising climbing the scale with imperceptible steadiness beginning to bend the tops of the tallest of the pines temporarily the bluff was affording them almost complete protection mallory deliberately shut his mind to what it must be like outside they had to put out to sea spandaus permitting and that was that what do you think has happened sir stevenss voice carried up from the gloom of the cabin pretty obvious isnt it mallory asked he spoke loudly enough for all to hear theyve been tipped off dont ask me how this is the second time and their suspicions are going to be considerably reinforced by the absence of a report from the caique that was sent to investigate us she was carrying a wireless aerial remember but why should they get so damned suspicious all of a sudden miller asked it doesnt make sense to me boss must be in radio contact with their hq or a telephoneprobably a telephone theyve just been given the old tictac consternation on all sides so mebbe theyll be sending a small army over from their hq to deal with us miller said lugubriously mallory shook his head definitely his mind was working quickly and well and he felt oddly certain confident of himself no not a chance seven miles as the crow flies ten maybe twelve miles over rough hill and forest tracks and in pitch darkness they wouldnt think of it he waved his bottle in the direction of the watchtower tonights their big night so we can expect the spandaus to open up any minute again the abnormal matterof factness of stevenss voice mallory shook his head a second time they wont im positive of that no matter how suspicious they may be how certain they are that were the big bad wolf they are going to be shaken to the core when that kid tells them were carrying papers and letters of authority signed by general graebel himself for all they know curtains for us may be the firing squad for them unlikely but you get the general idea so theyre going to contact hq and the commandant on a small island like this isnt going to take a chance on rubbing out a bunch of characters who may be the special envoys of the herr general himself so what so he codes a message and radios it to vathy in samos and bites his nails off to the elbow till a message comes back saying graebel has never heard of us and why the hell havent we all been shot dead mallory looked at the luminous dial of his watch id say we have at least half an hour and meantime we all sit around with our little bits of paper and pencil and write out our last wills and testaments miller scowled no percentage in that boss we gotta do somethin mallory grinned dont worry corporal we are going to do something were going to hold a nice little bottle party right here on the poop the last words of their song a shockingly corrupted grecian version of lilli marlene and their third song in the past few minutes died away in the evening air mallory doubted whether more than faint snatches of the singing would be carried to the watchtower against the wind but the rhythmical stamping of feet and waving of bottles were in themselves sufficient evidence of drunken musical hilarity to all but the totally blind and deaf mallory grinned to himself as he thought of the complete confusion and uncertainty the germans in the tower must have been feeling then this was not the behaviour of enemy spies especially enemy spies who know that suspicions had been aroused and that their time was running out mallory tilted the bottle to his mouth held it there for several seconds then set it down again the wine untasted he looked round slowly at the three men squatting there with him on the poop miller stevens and brown andrea was not there but he didnt have to turn his head to look for him andrea he knew was crouched in the shelter of the wheelhouse a waterproof bag with grenades and a revolver strapped to his back right mallory said crisply nows your big chance for your oscar lets make this as convincing as we can he bent forward jabbed his finger into millers chest and shouted angrily at him miller shouted back for a few moments they sat there gesticulating angrily and to all appearances quarrelling furiously with each other then miller was on his feet swaying in drunken imbalance as he leaned threateningly over mallory clenched fists ready to strike he stood back as mallory struggled to his feet and in a moment they were fighting fiercely raining apparently heavy blows on each other then a haymaker from the american sent mallory reeling back to crash convincingly against the wheelhouse right andrea he spoke quietly without looking round this is it five seconds good luck he scrambled to his feet picked up a bottle by the neck and rushed at miller upraised arm and bludgeon swinging fiercely down miller dodged swung a vicious foot and mallory roared in pain as his shins caught on the edge of the bulwarks silhouetted against the pale gleam of the creek he stood poised for a second arms flailing wildly then plunged heavily with a loud splash into the waters of the creek for the next halfminuteit would take about that time for andrea to swim under water round the next upstream corner of the creek everything was a confusion and a bedlam of noise mallory trod water as he tried to pull himself aboard miller had seized a boathook and was trying to smash it down on his head and the others on their feet now had flung their arms round miller trying to restrain him finally they managed to knock him off his feet pin him to the deck and help the dripping mallory aboard a minute later after the immemorial fashion of drunken men the two combatants had shaken hands with one another and were sitting on the engineroom hatch arms round each others shoulders and drinking in perfect amity from the same freshlyopened bottle of wine very nicely done mallory said approvingly very nicely indeed an oscar definitely for corporal miller dusty miller said nothing taciturn and depressed he looked moodily at the bottle in his hand at last he stirred i dont like it boss he muttered unhappily i dont like the setup one little bit you shoulda let me go with andrea its three to one up there and theyre waiting and ready he looked accusingly at mallory dammit to hell boss youre always telling us how desperately important this mission is i know mallory said quietly thats why i didnt send you with him thats why none of us has gone with him wed only be a liability to him get in his way mallory shook his head you dont know andrea dusty it was the first time mallory had called him that miller was warmed by the unexpected familiarity secretly pleased none of you know him but i know him he gestured towards the watchtower its squarecut lines in sharp silhouette against the darkening sky just a big fat goodnatured chap always laughing and joking mallory paused shook his head again went on slowly hes up there now padding through that forest like a cat the biggest and most dangerous cat youll ever see unless they offer no resistance andrea never kills unnecessarily when i send him up there after these three poor bastards im executing them just as surely as if they were in the electric chair and i was pulling the switch in spite of himself miller was impressed profoundly so known him a long time boss huh it was half question half statement a long time andrea was in the albanian war he was in the regular army they tell me the italians went in terror of him his longrange patrols against the iulia division the wolves of tuscany did more to wreck the italian morale in albania than any other single factor fve heard a good many stories about them not from andrea and theyre all incredible and theyre all true but it was afterwards i met him when we were trying to hold the servia pass i was a very junior liaison lieutenant in the anzac brigade at the time andrea he paused deliberately for effect andrea was a lieutenantcolonel in the th greek motorised division a what miller demanded in astonishment stevens and brown were equally incredulous you heard me lieutenantcolonel outranks me by a fairish bit you might say he smiled at them quizzically puts andrea in rather a different light doesnt it they nodded silently but said nothing the genial hailfellow andrea a goodnatured almost simpleminded buffoon a senior army officer the idea had come too suddenly was too incongruous for easy assimilation and immediate comprehension but gradually it began to make sense to them it explained many things about andrea to them his repose his confidence the unerring sureness of his lightning reactions and above all the implicit faith mallory had in him the respect he showed for andreas opinions whenever he consulted him which was frequently without surprise now miller slowly recalled that hed never yet heard mallory give andrea a direct order and mallory never hesitated to pull his rank when necessary after servia mallory went on everything was pretty confused andrea had heard that trikkala a small country town where his wife and three daughters lived had been flattened by the stukas and heinkels he reached there all right but there was nothing he could do a landmine had landed in the front garden and there wasnt even rubble left mallory paused lit a cigarette he stared through the drifting smoke at the fading outlines of the tower the only person he found there was his brotherinlaw george george was with us in crete hes still there from george he heard for the first time of the bulgarian atrocities in thrace and macedonia and his parents lived there so they dressed in german uniforms you can imagine how andrea got those commandeered a german army truck and drove to protosami the cigarette in mallorys hand snapped suddenly was sent spinning over the side miller was vaguely surprised emotion or rather emotional displays were so completely foreign to that very tough new zealander but mallory went on quietly enough they arrived in the evening of the infamous protosami massacre george has told me how andrea stood there clad in his german uniform and laughing as he watched a party of nine or ten bulgarian soldiers lash couples together and throw them into the river the first couple in were his father and stepmother both dead my gawd above even miller was shocked out of his usual equanimity its just not possible you know nothing mallory interrupted impatiently hundreds of greeks in macedonia died the same way but usually alive when they were thrown in until you know how the greeks hate the bulgarians you dont even begin to know what hate is andrea shared a couple of bottles of wine with the soldiers found out that they had killed his parents earlier in the afternoon they had been foolish enough to resist after dusk he followed them up to an old corrugatediron shed where they were billeted for the night all he had was a knife they left a guard outside andrea broke his neck went inside locked the door and smashed the oil lamp george doesnt know what happened except that andrea went berserk he was back outside in two minutes completely sodden his uniform soaked in blood from head to foot there wasnt a sound not even a groan to be heard from the hut when they left george says he paused again but this time there was no interruption nothing said stevens shivered drew his shabby jacket closer round his shoulders the air seemed to have become suddenly chili mallory lit another cigarette smiled faintly at miller nodded towards the watchtower see what i mean by saying wed only be a liability to andrea up there yeah yeah i guess i do miller admitted i had no idea i had no idea not all of them boss he couldnt have killed he did mallory interrupted flatly after that he formed his own band made life hell for the bulgarian outposts in thrace at one time there was almost an entire division chasing him through the rhodope mountains finally he was betrayed and captured and he george and four others were shipped to stavros they were to go on to salonika for trial they overpowered their guards andrea got loose among them on deck at night and sailed the boat to turkey the turks tried to intern him they might as weli have tried to intern an earthquake finally he arrived in palestine tried to join the greek commando battalion that was being formed in the middle east mainly veterans of the albanian campaign like himself mallory laughed mirthlessly he was arrested as a deserter he was released eventually but there was no place for him in the new greek army but jensens bureau heard about him knew he was a natural for subversive operations and so we went to crete together five minutes passed perhaps ten but nobody broke the silence occasionally for the benefit of any watchers they went through the motions of drinking but even the halflight was fading now and mallory knew they could only be halfseen blurs shadowy and indistinct from the heights of the watchtower the caique was beginning to rock in the surge from the open sea round the bluff the tall reaching pines black now as midnight cypress and looming impossibly high against the stardusted cloud wrack that scudded palely overhead were closing in on them from either side sombre watchful and vaguely threatening the wind moaning in lost and mournful requiem through their swaying topmost branches a bad night an eerie and an ominous night pregnant with that indefinable foreboding that reaches down and touches the wellsprings of the nameless fears the dim and haunting memories of a million years ago the ancient racial superstitions of mankind a night that sloughed off the tissue veneer of civilisation and the shivering man complains that someone is walking over his grave suddenly incongruously the spell was shattered and andreas cheerful hail from the bank had them all on their feet in a moment they heard his booming laugh and even the forests seemed to shrink back in defeat without waiting for the stern to be pulled in he plunged into the creek reached the caique in half a dozen powerful strokes and hoisted himself easily aboard grinning down from his great height he shook himself like some shaggy mastiff and reached out a hand for a convenient wine bottle no need to ask how things went eh mallory asked smiling none at all it was just too easy they were only boys and they never even saw me andrea took another long swig from the bottle and grinned in sheer delight and i didnt lay a finger on them he went on triumphantly well maybe a couple of little taps they were all looking down here staring out over the parapet when i arrived held them up took their guns off them and locked them in a cellar and then i bent their spandaus just a little bit this is it mallory thought dully this is the end this is the finish of everything the strivings the hopes the fears the loves and laughter of each one of us this is what it all comes to this is the end the end for us the end for a thousand boys on kheros in unconscious futility his hand came up slowly wiped lips salt from the spray bulleting off the windflattened wavetops then lifted farther to shade bloodshot eyes that peered out hopelessly into the stormfilled darkness ahead for a moment the dullness lifted and an almost intolerable bitterness welled through his mind all gone everything everything except the guns of navarone the guns of navarone they would live on they were indestructible damn them damn them damn them dear god the blind waste the terrible uselessness of it alit the caique was dying coming apart at the seams she was literally being pounded to death being shaken apart by the constant battering shocks of wind and sea time and time again the poopdeck dipped beneath the foamstreaked cauldron at the stern the focsle rearing crazily into the air dripping forefoot showing clear then the plummetting drop the shotgun shuddering impact as broadbeamed bows crashed vertically down into the cliffwalled trough beyond an explosive collision that threw so unendurable a strain on the ancient timbers and planks and gradually tore them apart it had been bad enough when theyd cleared the creek just as darkness fell and plunged and wallowed their way through a quartering sea on a northward course for navarone steering the unwieldy old caique had become difficult in the extreme with the seas fine on the starboard quarter she had yawed wildly and unpredictably through a fifty degree arc but at least her seams had been tight then the rolling waves overtaking her in regular formation and the wind settled and steady somewhere east of south but now all that was gone with half a dozen planks sprung from the stempost and working loose from the apron and leaking heavily through the stuffinggland of the propeller shaft she was making water far faster than the ancient vertical handpump could cope with the windtruncated seas were heavier but broken and confused sweeping down on them now from this quarter now from that and the wind itself redoubled in its shrieking violence veered and backed insanely from southwest to southeast just then it was steady from the south driving the unmanageable craft blindly on to the closing iron cliffs of navarone cliffs that loomed invisibly ahead somewhere in that allencompassing darkness momentarily mallory straightened tried to ease the agony of the pincers that were clawing into the muscles of the small of his back for over two hours now hehad been bending and straightening bending and straightening lifting a thousand buckets that dusty miller filled interminably from the well of the hold god only knew how miller felt if anything he had the harder job of the two and he had been violently and almost continuously seasick for hours on end he looked ghastly and he must have been feeling like death itself the sustained effort the sheer iron willpower to drive himself on in that condition reached beyond the limits of understanding mallory shook his head wonderingly my god but hes tough that yank unbidden the words framed themselves in his mind and he shook his head in anger vaguely conscious of the complete inadequacy of the words fighting for his breath he looked aft to see how the others were faring casey brown of course he couldnt see bent double in the cramped confines of the engineroom be too was constantly sick and suffering a blinding headache from the oil fumes and exhaust gases still filtering from the replacement standpipe neither of which could find any escape in the unventilated engineroom but crouched over the engine he bad not once left his post since they had cleared the mouth of the creek had nursed the straining ancient kelvin along with the loving care the exquisite skill of a man born into a long and proud tradition of engineering that engine had only to falter once to break down for the time in which a man might draw a deep breath and the end would be as immediate as it was violent their steerage way their lives depended entirely on the continuous thrust of that screw the laboured thudding of that rusted old twocylinder it was the heart of the boat and when the heart stopped beating the boat died too slewed broadside on and foundering in the waiting chasms between the waves forard of the engineroom straddlelegged and braced against the corner pillar of the splintered skeleton that was all that remained of the wheelhouse andrea laboured unceasingly at the pump never once lifting his head oblivious of the crazy lurching of the deck of the caique oblivious too of the biting wind and stinging sleetcold spray that numbed bare arms and moulded the sodden shirt to the hunched and massive shoulders ceaselessly tirelessly his arm thrust up and down up and down with the metronomic regularity of a piston he had been there for close on three hours now and he looked as if he could go for ever mallory who had yielded him the pump in complete exhaustion after less than twenty minutes cruel labour wondered if there was any limit to the mans endurance he wondered too about stevens for four endless hours now andy stevens had fought and overcome a wheel that leapt and struggled in his hands as if possessed of a convulsive life and will of its own the will to wrench itself out of exhausted hands and turn them into the troughs be had done a superb job mallory thought had handled the clumsy craft magnificently he peered at him closely but the spray lashed viciously across his eyes and blinded him with tears all he could gather was a vague impression of a tightlyset mouth sleepless sunken eyes and little patches of skin unnaturally pale against the mask of blood that covered almost the entire face from hairline to throat the twisting towering comber that had stove in the planks of the wheelhouse and driven in the windows with such savage force had been completely unexpected stevens hadnt had a chance the cut above the right temple was particularly bad ugly and deep the blood still pulsed over the ragged edge of the wound dripped monotonously into the water that sloshed and gurgled about the floor of the wheelhouse sick to his heart mallory turned away reached down for another bucket of water what a crew he thought to himself what a really terrific bunch of of he sought for words to describe them even to himself but he knew his mind was far too tired it didnt matter anyway for there were no words for men like that nothing that could do them justice he could almost taste the bitterness in his mouth the bitterness that washed in waves through his exhausted mind god how wrong it was how terribly unfair why did such men have to die he wondered savagely why did they have to die so uselessly or maybe it wasnt necessary to justify dying even dying ingloriously empty of achievement could one not die for intangibles for the abstract and the ideal what had the martyrs at the stake achieved or what was the old tag dulce et decorum est pro patria mori if one lives well what matter how one dies unconsciously his lips tightened in quick revulsion and he thought of jensens remarks about the high commands playing whosthekingofthecastle well they were right bang in the middle of their playground now just a few more pawns sliding into the limbo not that it mattered they had thousands more left to play with for the first time mallory thought of himself not with bitterness of selfpity or regret that it was all over he thought of himself only as the leader of this party his responsibility for the present situation its my fault lie told himself over and over again its all my fault i brought them here i made them come even while one part of his mind was telling him that hed had no option that his hand had been forced that if they had remained in the creek they would have been wiped out long before the dawn irrationally he still blamed himself the more shackleton of all the men that ever lived maybe ernest shackleton could have helped them now but not keith mallory there was nothing he could do no more than the others were doing and they were just waiting for the end but he was the leader he thought dully he should be planning something he should be doing something but there was nothing he could do there was nothing anyone on gods earth could do the sense of guilt of utter inadequacy settled and deepened with every shudder of the ancient timbers he dropped his bucket grabbed for the security of the mast as a heavy wave swept over the deck the breaking foam quicksilver in its seething phosphorescence the waters swirled hungrily round his legs and feet but he ignored them stared out into the darkness the darkness that was the devil of it the old caique rolled and pitched and staggered and plunged but as if disembodied in a vacuum they could see nothing not where the last wave had gone nor where the next was coming from a sea invisible and strangely remote doubly frightening in its palpable immediacy mallory stared down into the hold was vaguely conscious of the white blur of millers face he had swallowed some seawater and was retching painfully salt water laced with blood but mallory ignored it involuntarily all his mind was concentrated elsewhere trying to reduce some fleeting impression as vague as it had been evanescent to a coherent realisation it seemed desperately urgent that he should do so then another and still heavier wave broke over the side and all at once he had it the wind the wind had dropped away was lessening with every second that passed even as he stood there arms locked round the mast as the second wave fought to carry him away he remembered how often in the high hills at home he had stood at the foot of a precipice as an onrushing wind seeking the path of least resistance had curved and lifted up the sheer face leaving him standing in a pocket of relative immunity it was a common enough mountaineering phenomenon and these two freak waves the surging backwash the significance struck at him like a blow the cliffs they were on the cliffs of navarone with a hoarse wordless cry of warning reckless of his own safety he flung himself aft dived full length through the swirling waters for the engineroom hatchway full astern he shouted the startled white smudge that was casey browns face twisted up to his for gods sake man full astern were heading for the cliffs he scrambled to his feet reached the wheelhouse in two strides hand pawing frantically for the flare pocket the cliffs stevens were almost on them andrea millers still down below he flicked a glance at stevens caught the slow nod of the set bloodmasked face followed the line of sight of the expressionless eyes saw the whitely phosphorescent line ahead irregular but almost continuous blooming and fading blooming and fading as the pounding seas smashed against and fell back from cliffs still invisible in the darkness desperately his hands fumbled with the flare and then abruptly it was gone hissing and spluttering along the nearhorizontal trajectory of its ifight for a moment mallory thought it had gone out and he clenched his fists in impotent bitterness then it smashed against the rock face fell back on to a ledge about a dozen feet above the water and lay there smoking and intermittently burning in the driving rain in the heavy spray that cascaded from the booming breakers the light was feeble but it was enough the cliffs were barely fifty yards away black and wetly shining in the fitful radiance of the flare a flare that illuminated a vertical circle of less than five yards in radius and left the cliff below the ledge shrouded in the treacherous dark and straight ahead twenty maybe fifteen yards from the shore stretched the evil length of a reef gaptoothed and needlepointed vanishing at either end into the outer darkness can you take her through he yelled at stevens god knows ill try he shouted something else about steerage way but mallory was already halfway to the forard cabin as always in an emergency his mind was racing ahead with that abnormal sureness and clarity of thought for which he could never afterwards account grasping spikes mallet and a wirecored rope he was back on deck in seconds he stood stock still rooted in an almost intolerable tension as he saw the towering jagged rock bearing down upon them fine on the starboard bow a rock that reached halfway up the wheelhouse it struck the boat with a crash that sent him to his knees rasped and grated along half the length of the buckled splintered gunwales and then the caique had rolled over to port and she was through stevens frantically spinning the wheel and shouting for full astern mallorys breath escaped in a long heavy sigh of relief he had been quite unaware that he had stopped breathing and he hurriedly looped the coil of rope round his neck and under his left shoulder and stuck spikes and hammer in his belt the caique was slewing heavily round now port side to plunging and corkscrewing violently as she began to fall broadside into the troughs of the waves waves shorter and steeper than ever under the double thrust of the wind and the waves and the backwash recoiling from the cliffs but she was still in the grip of the sea and her own momentum and the distance was closing with frightening speed its a chance i have to take mallory repeated to himself over and over again its a chance i have to take but that little ledge remote and just inaccessible was fates last refinement of cruelty the salt in the wound of extinction and he knew in his heart of hearts that it wasnt a chance at all but just a suicidal gesture and then andrea had heaved the last of the fenders worn truck tyres out board and was towering above him grinning down hugely into his face and suddenly mallory wasnt so sure any more the ledge andreas vast reassuring hand was on his shoulder mallory nodded knees bent in readiness feet braced on the plunging slippery deck jump for it andrea boomed then keep your legs stiff there was no time for any more the caique was swinging in broadside to teetering on the crest of a wave as high up the cliff as she would ever be and mallory knew it was now or never his hands swung back behind his body his knees bent farther and then in one convulsive leap he had flung himself upwards fingers scrabbling on the wet rock of the cliff then hooking over the rim of the ledge for an instant he hung there at the length of his arms unable to move wincing as he heard the foremast crash against the ledge and snap in two then his fingers left the ledge without their own volition and he was almost halfway over propelled by one gigantic heave from below he was not up yet he was held only by the buckle of his belt caught on the edge of the rock a buckle now dragged up to his breastbone by the weight of his body but he did not paw frantically for a handhold or wriggle his body or flail his legs in the air and any of these actions would have sent him crashing down again at last and once again he was a man utterly at home in his own element the greatest rock climber of his time men called him and this was what he had been born for slowly methodically he felt the surface of the ledge and almost at once he discovered a crack running back from the face it would have been better had it been parallel to the face and more than the width of a matchstick but it was enough for mallory with infinite care he eased the hammer and a couple of spikes from his belt worked a spike into the crack to obtain a minimal purchase slid the other in some inches nearer hooked his left wrist round the first held the second spike with the fingers of the same hand and brought up the hammer in his free hand fifteen seconds later he was standing on the ledge working quickly and surely catlike in his balance on the slippery shelving rock he hammered a spike into the face of the cliff securely and at a downward angle about three feet above the ledge dropped a clove hitch over the top and kicked the rest of the coil over the ledge then and only then he turned round and looked below him less than a minute had passed since the caique had struck but already she was a brokenmasted splintered shambles sides caving in and visibly disintegrating as he watched every seven or eight seconds a giant comber would pick her up and fling her bodily against the cliff the heavy truck tyres taking up only a fraction of the impact that followed the sickening rending crash that reduced the gunwales to matchwood holed and split the sides and cracked the oaken timber and then she would roll clear port side showing the hungry sea pouring in through the torn and ruptured planking three men were standing by what was left of the wheelhouse three men suddenly he realised that casey brown was missing realised too that the engine was still running its clamour rising and falling then rising again at irregular intervals brown was edging the caique backwards and forwards along the cliff keeping her as nearly as humanly possible in the same position for he knew their lives depended on mallory and on himself the fool mallory swore the crazy fool the caique surged back in a receding trough steadied then swept in against the cliff again heeling over so wildly that the roof of the wheelhouse smashed and telescoped against the wall of the cliff the impact was so fierce the shock so sudden that stevens lost both handgrip and footing and was catapulted into the rock face upflung arms raised for protection for a moment he hung there as if pinned against the wall then fell back into the sea limbs and head relaxed lifeless in his limp quiescence he should have died then drowned under the hammerblows of the sea or crushed by the next batteringram collision of caique and cliff he should have died and he would have died but for the great arm that hooked down and plucked him out of the water like a limp and sodden rag doll and heaved him inboard a bare second before the next bludgeoning impact of the boat against the rock would have crushed the life out of him come on for gods sake mallory shouted desperately shell be gone in a minute the rope use the rope he saw andrea and miller exchange a few quick words saw them shake and pummel stevens and stand him on his feet dazed and retching seawater but conscious andrea was speaking in his ear emphasising something and guiding the rope into his hands and then the caique was swinging in again stevens automatically shortening his grip on the rope a tremendous boost from below by andrea mallorys long arm reaching out and stevens was on the ledge sitting with his back to the cliff and hanging on to the spike dazed still and shaking a muzzy head but safe youre next miller mallory called hurry up man jump for it miller looked at him and mallory could have sworn that he was grinning instead of taking the rope from andrea he ran forard to the cabin just a minute boss he bawled ive forgotten my toothbrush he reappeared in a few seconds but without the toothbrush he was carrying the big green box of explosives and before mallory had appreciated what was happening the box all fifty pounds of it was curving up into the air upthrust by the greeks tireless arms automatically mallorys hands reached for and caught it he overbalanced stumbled and toppled forward still clutching the box then brought up with a jerk stevens still clutching the spike was on his feet now free hand hooked in mallorys belt he was shivering violently with cold and exhaustion and an oddly fearlaced excitement but like mallory he was a hillman at home again mallory was just straightening up when the waterproofed radio set came soaring up he caught it placed it down looked over the side leave that bloody stuff alone he shouted furiously get up here yourselves now two coils of rope landed on the ledge beside him then the first of the rucksacks with the food and clothing he was vaguely aware that stevens was trying to stack the equipment in some sort of order do you hear me mallory roared get up here at once thats an order the boats sinking you bloody idiots the caique was sinking she was filling up quickly and casey brown had abandoned the flooded kelvin but she was a far steadier platform now rolling through a much shorter arc less violent in her soggy yielding collisions with the cliff wall for a moment mallory thought the sea was dropping away then he realised that the tons of water in the caiqucs hold had drastically lowered her centre of gravity were acting as a counterbalancing weight miller cupped a hand to his ear even in the near darkness of the sinking flare his face had an oddly greenish pallor cant hear a word you say boss besides she aint sinkin yet once again he disappeared into the forard cabin within thirty seconds with all five men working furiously the remainder of the equipment was on the ledge the caique was down by the stern the poopdeck covered and water pouring down the engineroom hatchway as brown struggled up the rope the focsle awash as miller grabbed the rope and started after him and as andrea reached up and swung in against the cliff his legs dangled over an empty sea the caique had foundered completely gone from sight no drifting flotsam not even an air bubble marked where she had so lately been the ledge was narrow not three feet wide at its broadest tapering off into the gloom on either side worse still apart from the few square feet where stevens had piled the gear it shelved sharply outwards the rock underfoot treacherous and slippery backs to the wall andrea and miller bad to stand on their heels bands outspread and palms inward against the cliff pressing in to it as closely as possible to maintain their balance but in less than a minute mallory had another two spikes hammered in about twenty inches above the ledge ten feet apart and joined with a rope a secure lifeline for all of them wearily miller slid down to a sitting position leaned his chest in heartfelt thankfulness against the safe barrier of the rope he fumbled in his breast pocket produced a pack of cigarettes and handed them round oblivious to the rain that soaked them in an instant he was soaking wet from the waist downwards and both his knees had been badly bruised against the cliff wall he was bitterly cold drenched by heavy rain and the sheets of spray that broke continually over the ledge the sharp edge of the rock bit cruelly into the calves of his legs the tight rope constricted his breathing and he was still ashenfaced and exhausted from long hours of labour and seasickness but when he spoke it was with a voice of utter sincerity my gawd he said reverently aint this wonderfull chapter monday night ninety minutes later mallory wedged himself into a natural rock chimney on the cliff face drove in a spike beneath his feet and tried to rest his aching exhausted body two minutes rest he told himself only two minutes while andrea comes up the rope was quivering and he could just hear above the shrieking of the wind that fought to pluck him off the cliff face the metallic scraping as andreas boots struggled for a foothold on that wicked overhang immediately beneath him the overhang that had all but defeated him the obstacle that he had impossibly overcome only at the expense of torn hands and body completely spent of shoulder muscles afire with agony and breath that rasped in great gulping inhalations into his starving lungs deliberately he forced his mind away from the pains that racked his body from its insistent demands for rest and listened again to the ringing of steel against rock louder this time carrying clearly even in the gale he would have to tell andrea to be more careful on the remaining twenty feet or so that separated them from the top at least mallory thought wryly no one would have to tell him to be quiet he couldnt have made any noise with his feet if hed tried not with only a pair of torn socks as cover for his bruised and bleeding feet hed hardly covered the first twenty feet of the climb when he discovered that his climbing boots were quite useless had robbed his feet of all sensitivity the ability to locate and engage the tiny toeholds which afforded the only sources of purchase he had removed them with great difficulty tied them to his belt by the laces and lost them had them torn off when forcing his way under a projecting spur of rock the climb itself had been a nightmare a brutal gasping agony in the wind and the rain and the darkness an agony that had eventually dulled the danger and masked the suicidal risks in climbing that sheer unknown face an interminable agony of hanging on by fingertips and toes of driving in a hundred spikes of securing ropes then inching on again up into the darkness it was a climb such as he had not ever made before such as he knew he would not ever make again for this was insanity it was a climb that had extended him to the utmost of his great skill his courage and his strength and then far beyond that again and he had not known that such reserves such limitless resources lay within him or any man nor did he know the wellspring the source of that power that had driven him to where he was within easy climbing reach of the top the challenge to a mountaineer personal danger pride in the fact that he was probably the only man in southern europe who could have made the climb even the sure knowledge that time was running out for the men on kheros it was none of these things he knew that in the last twenty minutes it had taken him to negotiate that overhang beneath his feet his mind had been drained of all thought and all emotion and he had climbed only as a machine hand over hand up the rope easily powerfully andrea hauled himself over the smoothly swelling convexity of the overhang legs dangling in midair he was festooned with heavy coils of rope girdled with spikes that protruded from his belt at every angle and lent him the incongruous appearance of a comicopera corsican bandit quickly he hauled himself up beside mallory wedged himself in the chimney and mopped his sweating forehead as always he was grinning hugely mallory looked at him smiled back andrea he reflected had no right to be there it was stevenss place but stevens had still been suffering from shock had lost much blood besides it required a firstclass climber to bring up the rear to coil up the ropes as he came and to remove the spikes there must be no trace left of the ascent or so mallory had told him and stevens had reluctantly agreed although the hurt in his face had been easy to see more than ever now mallory was glad he had resisted the quiet plea in stevenss face stevens was undoubtedly a fine climber but what mallory had required that night was not another mountaineer but a human ladder time and time again during the ascent he had stood on andreas back his shoulders his upturned palm and once for at least ten seconds and while he was still wearing his steelshod boots on his head and not once had andrea protested or stumbled or yielded an inch the man was indestructible as tough and enduring as the rock on which he stood since dusk had fallen that evening andrea had laboured unceasingly done enough work to kill two ordinary men and looking at him then mallory realised almost with despair that even now he didnt look particularly tired mallory gestured at the rock chimney then upwards at its shadowy mouth limned in blurred rectangular outline against the pale glimmer of the sky he leant forward mouth close to andreas ear twenty feet andrea he said softly his breath was still coming in painful gasps itll be no bother its fissured on my side and the chances are that it goes up to the top andrea looked up the chimney speculatively nodded in silence better with your boots off mallory went on and any spikes we use well work in by hand even on a night like this high winds and rain cold and black as a pigs inside and on a cliff like this there was neither doubt nor question in andreas voice rather it was acquiescence unspoken confirmation of an unspoken thought they had been so long together had reached such a depth of understanding that words between them were largely superfluous mallory nodded waited while andrea worked home a spike looped his ropes over it and secured what was left of the long ball of twine that stretched four hundred feet below to the ledge where the others waited andrea then removed boots and spikes fastened them to the ropes eased the slender doubleedged throwing knife in its leather shoulder scabbard looked across at mallory and nodded in turn the first ten feet were easy palms and back against one side of the chimney and stockingsoled feet against the other mallory jackknifed his way upwards until the widening sheer of the walls defeated him legs braced against the far wall he worked in a spike as far up as he could reach grasped it with both hands dropped his legs across and found a toehold in the crevice two minutes later his hands hooked over the crumbling edge of the precipice noiselessly and with an infinite caution he fingered aside earth and grass and tiny pebbles until his hands were locked on the solid rock itself bent his knee to seek lodgement for the final toehold then eased a wary head above the clifftop a movement imperceptible in its slowmotion millimetric stealth he stopped moving altogether as soon as his eyes had cleared the level of the cliff stared out into the unfamiliar darkness his whole being the entire field of consciousness concentrated into his eyes and his ears illogically and for the first time in all that terrifying ascent he became acutely aware of his own danger and helplessness and he cursed himself for his folly in not borrowing millers silenced automatic the darkness below the high horizon of the lifting hills beyond was just one degree less than absolute shapes and angles heights and depressions were resolving themselves in nebulous silhouette contours and shadowy profiles emerging reluctantly from the darkness a darkness suddenly no longer vague and unfainliiar but disturbingly reminiscent in what it revealed clamouring for recognition and then abruptly almost with a sense of shock mallory had it the clifftop before his eyes was exactly as monsieur vlachos had drawn and described it the narrow bare strip of ground running parallel to the cliff the jumble of huge boulders behind them and then beyond these the steep screestrewn lower slopes of the mountains the first break theyd had yet mallory thought exultantly but what a break the sketchiest navigation but the most incredible luck right bang on the nose of the target the highest point of the highest most precipitous cliffs in navarone the one place where the germans never mounted a guard because the climb was impossible mallory felt the relief the high elation wash through him in waves jubijantly he straightened his leg hoisted himself halfway over the edge arms straight palms down on the top of the cliff and then he froze into immobility petrified as the solid rock beneath his hands his heart thudding painfully in his throat one of the boulders had moved seven maybe eight yards away a shadow had gradually straightened detached itself stealthily from the surrounding rock was advancing slowly towards the edge of the cliff and then the shadow was no longer it there could be no mistake now the long jackboots the long greatcoat beneath the waterproof cape the closefitting helmet were all too familiar damn viachos damn jensen damn all the knowails who sat at home the pundits of intelligence who gave a man wrong information and sent him out to die and in the same instant mallory damned himself for his own carelessness for he had been expecting this all along for the first two or three seconds mallory had lain rigid and unmoving temporarily paralysed in mind and body already the guard had advanced four or five steps carbine held in readiness before him head turned sideways as he listened into the high thin whine of the wind and the deep and distant booming of the surf below trying to isolate the sound that had aroused his suspicions but now the first shock was over and mallorys mind was working again to go up on to the top of the cliff would be suicidal ten to one the guard would hear him scrambling over the edge and shoot him out of hand and if he did get up he had neither the weapons nor after that exhausting climb the strength to tackle an armed fresh man he would have to go back down but he would have to slide down slowly an inch at a time at night mallory knew side vision is even more acute than direct and the guard might catch a sudden movement out of the corner of his eye and then he would only have to turn his head and that would be the end even in that darkness mallory realised there could be no mistaking the bulk of his silhouette against the sharp line of the edge of the cliff gradually every movement as smooth and controlled as possible every soft and soundless breath a silent prayer mallory slipped gradually back over the edge of the cliff stifi the guard advanced making for a point about five yards to mallorys left but still he looked away his ear turned into the wind and then mallory was down only his fingertips over the top and andreas great bulk was beside him his mouth to his ear what is it somebody there a sentry mallory whispered back his arms were beginning to ache from the strain hes heard something and hes looking for us suddenly he shrank away from andrea pressed himself as closely as possible to the face of the cliff was vaguely aware of andrea doing the same thing a beam of light hurtful and dazzling to eyes so long accustomed to the dark had suddenly stabbed out at the angle over the edge of the cliff was moving slowly along towards them the german had his torch out was methodically examining the rim of the cliff from the angle of the beam mallory judged that he was walking alone about a couple of feet from the edge on that wild and gusty night he was taking no chances on the crumbly treacherous topsoil of the cliff even more likely he was taking no chances on a pair of sudden hands reaching out for his ankles and jerking him to a mangled death on the rocks and reefs four hundred feet below slowly inexorably the beam approached even at that slant it was bound to catch them with a sudden sick certainty mallory realised that the german wasnt just suspicious he knew there was someone there and he wouldnt stop looking until he found them and there was nothing they could do just nothing at all then andreas head was close to his again a stone andrea whispered over there behind him cautiously at first then frantically mallory pawed the clifftop with his right hand earth only earth grass roots and tiny pebbles there was nothing even half the size of a marble and then andrea was thrusting something against him and his hand closed over the metallic smoothness of a spike even in that moment of desperate urgency with the slender searching beam only feet away mallory was conscious of a sudden brief anger with himself be had still a couple of spikes stuck in his belt and had forgotten all about them his arm swung back jerked convulsively forward sent the spike spinning away into the darkness one second passed then another he knew he had missed the beam was only inches from andreas shoulders and then the metallic clatter of the spike striking a boulder fell upon his ear like a benison the beam wavered for a second stabbed out aimlessly into the darkness and then whipped round probing into the boulders to the left and then the sentry was running towards them slipping and stumbling in his haste the barrel of the carbine gleaming in the light of the torch held clamped to it hed gone less than ten yards when andrea was over the top of the cliff like a great black cat was padding noiselessly across the ground to the shelter of the nearest boulder wraithlike he flitted in behind it and was gone a shadow long among shadows the sentry was about twenty yards away now the beam of his torch darting fearfully from boulder to boulder when andrea stuck the haft of his knife against a rock twice the sentry whirled round torch shining along the line of the boulders then started to run clumsily back again the skirts of the greatcoat fluttering grotesquely in the wind the torch was swinging wildly now and mallory caught a glimpse of a white straining face wideeyed and fearful incongruously at variance with the gladiatorial strength of the steel helmet above god only knew mallory thought what wild panicstricken thoughts were passing through his confused mind noises from the clifftop metallic sound from either side among the boulders the long eerie vigil afraid and companionless on a deserted cliff edge on a dark and tempestfilled night in a hostile land suddenly mallory felt a deep stab of compassion for this man a man like himself someones wellbeloved husband or brother or son who was only doing a dirty and dangerous job as best he could and because he was told to compassion for his loneliness and his anxieties and his fears for the sure knowledge that before he had drawn breath another three times he would be dead slowly gauging his time and distance mallory raised his head help he shouted help me im falling the soldier checked in midstride and spun round less than flve feet from the rock that hid andrea for a second the beam of his torch waved wildly around then settled on mallorys head for another moment he stood stock still then the carbine in his right hand swung up the left hand reaching down for the barrel then he grunted once a violent and convulsive exhalation of breath and the thud of the hilt of andreas knife striking home against the ribs carried clearly to mallorys ears even against the wind mallory stared down at the dead man at andreas impassive face as he wiped the blade of his knife on the greatcoat rose slowly to his feet sighed and slid the knife back in its scabbard so my keith andrea reserved the punctilious captain for company only this is why our young lieutenant eats his heart out down below that is why mallory acknowledged i knew it or i almost knew it so did you too many coincidences the german caique investigating the trouble at the watchtower and now this mallory swore softly and bitterly this is the end for our friend captain briggs of castelrosso hell be cashiered within the month jensen wifi make certain of that andrea nodded he let nicolai go who else could have known that we were to have landed here tipped off everyone all along the line mallory paused dismissed the thought caught andrea by the arm the germans are thorough even although they must know its almost an impossibility to land on a night like this theyli have a dozen sentries scattered along the cliffs unconsciously mallory had lowered his voice but they wouldnt depend on one man to cope with five so signals andrea finished for him they must have some way of letting the others know perhaps flares no not that mallory disagreed give their position away telephone it has to be that remember how they were in crete miles of field telephone wire all over the shop andrea nodded picked up the dead mans torch hooded it in his huge hand and started searching he returned in less than a minute telephone it is he announced softly over there under the rocks nothing we can do about it mallory said if it does ring ill have to answer or theyll come hotfooting along i only hope to heaven they havent got a bloody password it would be just like them he turned away stopped suddenly but someones got to come sometime a relief ser geant of the guard something like that probably hes supposed to make an hourly report someones bound to come and come soon my god andrea well have to make it fast and this poor devil andrea gestured to the huddled shadow at his feet over the side with him mallory grimaced in distaste wont make any difference to the poor bastard now and we cant leave any traces the odds are theyll think hes gone over the edge this topsoils as crumbly and treacherous as hell you might see if hes any papers on him never know how useful they might be not half as useful as these boots on his feet andrea waved a large hand towards the screestrewn slopes you are not going to walk very far there in your stocking soles five minutes later mallory tugged three times on the string that stretched down into the darkness below three answering tugs came from the ledge and then the cord vanished rapidly down over the edge of the overhang drawing with it the long steelcored rope that mallory paid out from the coil on the top of the cliff the box of explosives was the first of the gear to come up the weighted rope plummetted straight down from the point of the overhang and padded though the box was on every side with lashed rucksacks and sleepingbags it still crashed terrifyingly against the cliff on the inner arc of every winddriven swing of the pendulum but there was no time for finesse to wait for the diminishing swing of the pendulum after each tug securely anchored to a rope that stretched around the base of a great boulder andrea leaned far out over the edge of the precipice and reeled in the seventypound deadweight as another man would a trout in less than three minutes the ammunition box lay beside him on the clifftop five minutes later the firing generator guns and pistols wrapped in a couple of other sleepingbags and their lightweight reversible tent white on one side brown and green camouflage on the other lay beside the explosives a third time the rope went down into the rain and the darkness a third time the tireless andrea hauled it in hand over hand mallory was behind him coiling in the slack of the rope when he heard andreas sudden exclamation two quick strides and he was at the edge of the cliff his hand on the big greeks arm whats up andrea why have you stopped he broke off peered through the gloom at the rope in andreas hand saw that it was being held between only finger and thumb twice andrea jerked the rope up a foot or two let it fall again the weightless rope swayed wildly in the wind gone mallory asked quietly andrea nodded without speaking broken mallory was incredulous a wirecored rope i dont think so quickly andrea reeled in the remaining forty feet the twine was still attached to the same place about a fathom from the end the rope was intact somebody tied a knot just for a moment the giants voice sounded tired they didnt tie it too well mallory made to speak then flung up an instinctive arm as a great forked tongue of flame streaked between the clifftop and unseen clouds above their cringing eyes were still screwed tight shut their nostrils full of the acrid sulphurous smell of burning when the first volley of thunder crashed in titan fury almost directly overhead a deafening artillery to mock the pitiful efforts of embattled man doubly terrifying in the total darkness that followed that searing flash gradually the echoes pealed and faded inland in diminishing reverberation were lost among the valleys of the hills my god mallory murmured that was close wed better make it fast andrea this cliff is liable to be lit up like a fairground any minute what was in that last load you were bringing up he didnt really have to ask he himself had arranged for the breaking up of the equipment into three separate loads before hed left the ledge it wasnt even that he suspected his tired mind of playing tricks on him but it was tired enough too tired to probe the hidden compulsion the nameless hope that prompted him to grasp at nameless straws that didnt even exist the food andrea said gently all the food the stove the fuel and the compasses for five perhaps ten seconds mallory stood motionless one half of his mind conscious of the urgency the desperate need for haste was jabbing him mercilessly the other half held him momentarily in a vast irresolution an irresolution of coldness and numbness that came not from the lashing wind and sleety rain but from his own mind from the bleak and comfortless imaginings of lost wanderings on the harsh and hostile island with neither food nor fire and then andreas great hand was on his shoulder and he was laughing softly just so much less to carry my keith think how grateful our tired friend corporal miller is going to be this is only a little thing yes mallory said yes of course a little thing he turned abruptly tugged the cord watched the rope disappear over the edge fifteen minutes later in drenching torrential rain a great sheeting downpour almost constantly illumined by the jagged branching stilettos of the forked lightning casey browns bedraggled head came into view over the edge of the cliff the thunder too emptily cavernous in that flat and explosive intensity of sound that lies at the heart of a thunderstorm was almost continuous but in the brief intervals caseys voice rich in his native clydeside accent carried clearly he was expressing himself fluently in basic anglosaxon and with cause he had had the assistance of two ropes on the way up the one stretched from spike to spike and the one used for raising supplies which andrea had kept pulling in as he made the ascent casey brown had secured the end of this round his waist with a bowline but the bowline had proved to be nothing of the sort but a slipknot and andreas enthusiastic help had almost cut him in half he was still sitting on the clifftop exhausted head between his knees the radio still strapped to his back when two tugs on andreas rope announced that dusty miller was on his way up another quarter of an hour elapsed an interminable fifteen minutes when in the lulls between the thunderclaps every slightest sound was an approaching enemy patrol before miller materialised slowly out of the darkness halfway down the rock chimney he was climbing steadily and methodically then checked abruptly at the clifftop groping hands pawing uncertainly on the topsoil of the cliff puzzled mallory bent down peered into the lean face both the eyes were clamped tightly shut relax corporal mallory advised kindly you have arrived dusty miller slowly opened his eyes peered round at the edge of the cliff shuddered and crawled quickly on hands and knees to the shelter of the nearest boulders mallory followed and looked down at him curiously what was the idea of closing your eyes coming over the top i did not miller protested mallory said nothing i closed them at the bottom miller explained weanly i opened them at the top mallory looked at him incredulously what all the way its like i told you boss miller complained back in castelrosso when i cross a street and step up on to the sidewalk i gotta hang on to the nearest lamppost more or less he broke off looked at andrea leaning far out over the side of the cliff and shivered again brother oh brother was i scared fear terror panic do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain once twice a hundred times andy stevens repeated the words to himself over and over again like a litany a psychiatrist had told him that once and hed read it a dozen times since do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain the mind is a limited thing they had said it can only hold one thought at a time one impulse to action say to yourself i am brave i am overcoming this fear this stupid unreasoning panic which has no origin except in my own mind and because the mind can only hold one thought at a time and because thinking and feeling are one then you will be brave you will overcome and the fear will vanish like a shadow in the night and so andy stevens said these things to himself and the shadows only lengthened and deepened lengthened and deepened and the icy claws of fear dug ever more savagely into his dull exhausted mind into his twisted knotted stomach his stomach that knotted ball of jangled writhing nerveends beneath the solar plexus no one could ever know how it was how it felt except those whose shredded minds were going collapsing into complete and final breakdown the waves of panic and nausea and faintness that flooded up through a suffocating throat to a mind dark and spent and sinewless a mind fighting with woollen fingers to cling on to the edge of the abyss a tired and lacerated mind only momentarily in control wildly rejecting the clamorous demands of a nervous system which had already taken far too much that he should let go open the torn fingers that were clenched so tightly round the rope it was just that easy rest after toil port after stormy seas what was that famous stanza of spensers sobbing aloud stevens wrenched out another spike sent it spinning into the waiting sea three hundred long feet below pressed himself closely into the face and inched his way despairingly upwards fear fear had been at his elbow all his life his constant companion his alter ego at his elbow on in close prospect or immediate recall he had become accustomed to that fear at times almost reconciled but the sick agony of this night lay far beyond either tolerance or familiarity he had never known anything like this before and even in his terror and confusion he was dimly aware that the fear did not spring from the climb itself true the cliff was sheer and almost vertical and the lightning the icecold rain the darkness and the bellowing thunder were a waking nightmare but the climb technically was simple the rope stretched all the way to the top and all he had to do was to follow it and dispose of the spikes as he went he was sick and bruised and terribly tired his head ached abominably and he had lost a great deal of blood but then more often than not it is in the darkness of agony and exhaustion that the spirit of man burns most brightly andy stevens was afraid because his selfrespect was gone always before that had been his sheet anchor bad tipped the balance against his ancient enemy the respect in which other men had held him the respect he had had for himself but now these were gone for his two greatest fears had been realised he was known to be afraid he had failed his fellowman both in the fight with the german caique and when anchored above the watchtower in the creek he had known that mallory and andrea knew he had never met such men before and he had known all along that he could never hide his secrets from such men he should have gone up that cliff with mallory but mallory had made excuses and ten andrea instead mallory knew he was afraid and twice before in castelrosso and when the german boat had closed in on them he had almost failed his friends and tonight he had failed them terribly he had not been thought fit to lead the way with mallory and it was he the sailor of the party who had made such a botch of tying that last knot had lost all the food and the fuel that had plummetted into the sea a bare ten feet from where he had stood on the ledge and a thousand men on kheros were depending on a failure so abject as himself sick and spent spent in mind and body and spirit moaning aloud in his anguish of fear and selfloathing and not knowing where one finished and the other began andy stevens climbed blindly on the sharp highpitched callup buzz of the telephone cut abruptly through the darkness on the clifftop mallory stiffened and halfturned hands clenching involuntarily again it buzzed the jarring stridency carrying cleanly above the bass rumble of the thunder fell silent again and then it buzzed again and kept on buzzing peremptory in its harsh insistence mallory was halfway towards it when he checked in midstep turned slowly round and walked back towards andrea the big greek looked at him curiously you have changed your mind mallory nodded but said nothing they will keep on ringing until they get an answer andrea murmured and when they get no answer they will come they will come quickly and soon i know i know mallory shrugged we have to take that chance certainty rather the question is how long will it be before any one turns up instinctively he looked both ways along the windswept clifftop miner and brown were posted one on either side about fifty yards away lost in the darkness its not worth the risk the more i think of it the poorer i think my chances would be of getting away with it in matters of routine the old hun tends to be an inflexible sort of character theres probably a set way of answering the phone or the sentry has to identify himself by name or theres a password or maybe my voice would give me away on the other han the sentrys gone without trace all our gear is up and sos everyone except stevens in other words weve practically made it weve landed and nobody knows were here yes andrea nodded slowly yes you are right and stevens should be up in two or three minutes it would be foolish to throw away everything weve gained he paused then went on quietly but they are going to come running the phone stopped ringing as suddenly as it had started they are going to come now i know i hope to hell stevens mallory broke off spun on his heel said over his shoulder keep your eye open for him will you ill warn the others were expecting company mallory moved quickly along the clifftop keeping well away from the edge he hobbled rather than walked the sentrys boots were too small for him and chafed his toes cruelly deliberately he closed his mind to the thought of how his feet would be after a few hours walking over rough territory in these boots time enough for the reality he thought grimly without the added burden of anticipation he stopped abruptly as something hard and metallic pushed into the small of his bacl surrender or die the drawling nasal voice was positively cheerful after what he had been through on the caique and the cliff face just to set foot on solid ground again was heaven enough for dustymiller very funny mallory growled very funny indeed he looked curiously at miller the american had removed his oilskin cape the rain had ceased as abruptly as it had come to reveal a jacket and braided waistcoat even more sodden and saturated than his trousers it didnt make sense but there was no time for questions did you hear the phone ringing just now he asked was that what it was yeah i heard it the sentrys phone his hourly report or whatever it was must have been overdue we didnt answer it theyll be hotfooting along any minute now suspicious as hell and looking for trouble maybe your side maybe browns cant approach any other way unless they break their necks climbing over these boulders mallory gestured at the shapeless jumble of rocks behind them so keep your eyes skinned ill do that boss no shootin huh no shooting just get back as quickly and quietly as you can and let us know come back in five minutes anyway mallory hurried away retracing his steps andrea was stretched full length on the clifftop peering over the edge he twisted his head round as mallory approached i can hear him hes just at the overhang good mallory moved on without breaking step tell him to hurry please ten yards farther on mallory checked peered into the gloom ahead somebody was coming along the clifftop at a dead run stumbling and slipping on the loose gravelly soil brown mallory called softly yes sir its me brown was up to him now breathing heavily pointing back in the direction he had just come somebodys coming and coming fast torches waving and jumping all over the place must be running how many mallory asked quickly four or five at least brown was still gasping for breath maybe more four or five torches anyway you can see them for yourself again he pointed backwards then blinked in puzzlement thats bloody funny theyre all gone he turned back swiftly to mallory but i can swear dont worry mallory said grimly you saw them all right rye been expecting visitors theyre getting close now and taking no chances how far away hundred yards not more than a hundred and fifty go and get miller tell him to get back here fast mallory ran back along the cliff edge and knelt beside the huge length of andrea theyre coming andrea he said quickly from the left at least five probably more two minutes at the most wheres stevens can you see him i can see him andrea was magnificently unperturbed he is just past the overhang the rest of his words were lost drowned in a sudden violent thunderclap but there was no need for more mallory could see stevens now climbing up the rope strangely old and enfeebled in action hand over hand in paralysing slowness halfway now between the overhang and the foot of the chimney good god mallory swore whats the matter with him hes going to take all day he checked himself cupped his hands to his mouth stevens stevens but there was no sign that stevens had heard he still kept climbing with the same unnatural overdeliberation a robot in slow motion he is very near the end andrea said quietly you see he does not even lift his head when a climber does not lift his head he is finished he stirred i will go down for him no mallorys hand was on his shoulder stay here i cant risk you both yes what is it he was aware that brown was back bending over him his breath coming in great heaving gasps hurry sir hurry for gods sake a few brief words but he had to suck in two huge gulps of air to get them out theyre on top of us get back to the rocks with miller mallory said urgently cover us stevens stevens but again the wind swept up the face of the cliff carried his words away stevens for gods sake man stevens his voice was lowpitched desperate but this time some quality in it must have reached through stevens fog of exhaustion and touched his consciousness for he stopped climbing and lifted his head hand cupped to his ear some germans coming mallory called through funnelled hands as loudly as he dared get to the foot of the chimney and stay there dont make a sound understand stevens lifted his hand gestured in tired acknowledgment lowered his head started to climb up again he was going even more slowly now his movements fumbling and clumsy do you think he understands andrea was troubled i think so i dont know mallory stiffened and caught andreas arm it was beginning to rain again not heavily yet and through the drizzle hed caught sight of a hooded torch beam probing among the rocks thirty yards away to his left over the edge with the rope he whispered the spike at the bottom of the chimney will hold it come on lets get out of here gradually meticulous in their care not to dislodge the smallest pebble mallory and andrea inched back from the edge squirmed round and headed back for the rocks pulling themselves along on their elbows and knees the few yards were interminable and without even a gun in his hand mallory felt defenceless completely exposed an illogical feeling he knew for the first beam of light to fall on them meant the end not for them but for the man who held the torch mallory had complete faith in brown and miller that wasnt important what mattered was the complete escape from detection twice during the last endless few feet a wandering beam reached out towards them the second a bare arms length away both times they pressed their faces into the sodden earth lest the pale blur of their faces betray them and lay very still and then all at once it seemed they were among the rocks and safe in a moment miller was beside them a halfseen shadow against the darker dusk of the rocks around them plenty of time plenty of time he whispered sarcastically why didnt you wait another halfhour he gestured to the left where the ifickering of torches the now clearly audible murmur of guttural voices were scarcely twenty yards away wed better move farther back theyre looking for him among the rocks for him or for his telephone mallory murmured in agreement youre right anyway watch your guns on these rocks take the gear with you and if they look over and find stevens well have to take the lot no time for fancy work and to hell with the noise use the automatic carbines andy stevens had heard but he had not understood it was not that he panicked was too terrified to understand for he was no longer afraid fear is of the mind but his mind had ceased to function drugged by the last stages of exhaustion crushed by the utter damnable tiredness that held his limbs his whole body in leaden thrall he did not know it but fifty feet below he had struck his head against a spur of rock a shaip wicked projection that had torn his gaping temple wound open to the bone his strength drained out with the pulsing blood he had heard mallory had heard something about the chimney he had now reached but his mind had failed to register the meaning of the words all that stevens knew was that he was climbing and that one always kept on climbing until one reached the top that was what his father had always impressed upon him his brothers too you must reach the top he was halfway up the chimney now resting on the spike that mallory had driven into the fissure he hooked his fingers in the crack bent back his head and stared up towards the mouth of the chimney ten feet away no more he was conscious of neither surprise nor elation it was just there he had to reach it he could hear voices carrying clearly from the top he was vaguely surprised that his friends were making no attempt to help him that they bad thrown away the rope that would have made those last few feet so easy but he felt no bitterness no emotion at all perhaps they were trying to test him what did it matter anyway he had to reach the top he reached the top carefully as mallory had done before him he pushed aside the earth and tiny pebbles hooked his fingers over the edge found the same toehold as mallory had and levered himself upwards he saw the flickering torches heard the excited voices and then for an instant the curtain of fog in his mind lifted and a last tidal wave of fear washed over him and he knew that the voices were the voices of the enemy and that they had destroyed his friends he knew now that he was alone that be had failed that this was the end one way or another and that it had all been for nothing and then the fog closed over him again and there was nothing but the emptiness of it all the emptiness and the futility the overwhelming lassitude and despair and his body slowly sinking down the face of the cliff and then the hooked fingers they too were slipping away opening gradually reluctantly as the fingers of a drowning man releasing their final hold on a spar of wood there was no fear now only a vast and heedless indifference as his hands slipped away and he fell like a stone twenty vertical feet into the cradling bottleneck at the foot of the chimney he himself made no sound none at all the soundless scream of agony never passed his lips for the blackness came with the pain but the straining ears of the men crouching in the rocks above caught clearly the dull sickening crack as his right leg fractured cleanly in two snapping like a rotten bough chapter monday night the german patrol was everything that mallory had feared efficient thorough and very very painstaking it even had imagination in the person of its young and competent sergeant and that was more dangerous still there were only four of them in high boots helmets and green grey and brown mottled capes first of all they located the telephone and reported to base then the young sergeant sent two men to search another hundred yards or so along the cliff while he and the fourth soldier probed among the rocks that paralleled the cliff the search was slow and careful but the two men did not penetrate very far into the rocks to mallory the sergeants reasoning was obvious and logical if the sentry had gone to sleep or taken ill it was unlikely that he would have gone far in among that confused jumble of boulders mallory and the others were safely back beyond their reach and then came what mallory had feared an organised methodical inspection of the clifftop itself worse stifi it began with a search along the very edge securely held by his three men with interlinked arms the last with a hand hooked round his belt the sergeant walked slowly along the rim probing every inch with the spotlit beam of a powerful torch suddenly he stopped short exclaimed suddenly and stooped torch and face only inches from the ground there was no question as to what he had found the deep gouge made in the soft crumbling soil by the climbing rope that had been belayed round the boulder and gone over to the edge of the cliff softly silently mallory and his three companions straightened to their knees or to their feet gun barrels lining along the tops of boulders or peering out between cracks in the rocks there was no doubt in any of their minds that stevens was lying there helplessly in the crutch of the chimney seriously injured or dead it needed only one german carbine to point down that cliff face however carelessly and these four men would die they would have to die the sergeant was stretched out his length now two men holding his legs his head and shoulders were over the edge of the cliff the beam from his torch stabbing down the chimney for ten perhaps fifteen seconds there was no sound on the clifftop no sound at all only the high keening moan of the wind and the swish of the rain in the stunted grass and then the sergeant had wriggled back and risen to his feet slowly shaking his head mallory gestured to the others to sink down behind the boulders again but even so the sergeants soft bavarian voice carried clearly in the wind its ehrich all right poor fellow compassion and anger blended curiously in the voice i warned him often enough about his carelessness about going too near the edge of that cliff it is very treacherous instinctively the sergeant stepped back a couple of feet and looked again at the gouge in the soft earth thats where his heel slipped or maybe the butt of his carbine not that it matters now is he dead do you think sergeant the speaker was only a boy nervous and unhappy its hard to say look for yourself gingerly the youth lay down on the clifftop peering cautiously over the lip of the rock the other soldiers were talking among themselves in short staccato sentences when mallory turned to miller cupped his hands to his mouth and the americans ear he could contain his puzzlement no longer was stevens wearing his dark suit when you left him he whispered yeah miller whispered back yeah i think he was a pause no thmmit im wrong we both put on our rubber camouflage capes about the same time mallory nodded the waterproofs of the germans were almost identical with their own and the sentrys hair mallory remembered had been jet black the same colour as stevenss dyed hair probably all that was visible from above was a crumpled capeshrouded figure and a dark head the sergeants mistake in identity was more than understandable it was inevitable the young soldier eased himself back from the edge of the cliff and hoisted himself carefully to his feet youre right sergeant it is ebrich the boys voice was unsteady hes alive i think i saw his cape move just a little it wasnt the wind im sure of that mallory felt andreas massive hand squeezing his arm felt the quick surge of relief then elation wash through him so stevens was alive thank god for that theyd save the boy yet he heard andrea whispering the news to the others then grinned wryly to himself ironic at his own gladness jensen definitely would not have approved of this jubilation stevens had already done his part navigated the boat to navarone and climbed the cliff and now he was only a crippled liability would be a drag on the whole party reduce what pitiful chances of success remained to them for a high command who pushed the counters around crippled pawns slowed up the whole game made the board so damnably untidy it was most inconsiderate of stevens not to have killed himself so that they could have disposed of him neatly and without trace in the deep and hungry waters that boomed around the foot of the cliff mallory clenched his hands in the darkness and swore to himself that the boy would live come home again and to hell with total war and all its inhuman demands just a kid that was all a scared and broken kid and the bravest of them all the young sergeant was issuing a string of orders to his men his voice quick crisp and confident a doctor splints rescue stretcher anchored sheerlegs ropes spikes the trained wellordered mind missing nothing mallory waited tensely wondering how many men if any would be left on guard for the guards would have to go and that would inevitably betray them the question of their quick and silent disposal never entered his mind a whisper in andreas ear and the guards would have no more chance than penned lambs against a marauding wolf less chance even than that the lambs could always run and cry out before the darkness closed over them the sergeant solved the problem for them the assured competence the tough unsentimental ruthlessness that made the german nco the best in the world gave mallory the chance he never expected to have he bad just finished giving his orders when the young soldier touched him on the arm then pointed over the edge how about poor ehrich sergeant he asked uncertainly shouldnt dont you think one of us ought to stay with him and what could you do if you did stay hold his hand the sergeant asked acidly if he stirs and falls then he falls thats all and it doesnt matter then if a hundred of us are standing up here watching him off you go and dont forget the mallets and pegs to stay the sheerlegs the three men turned and went off quickly to the east without another word the sergeant walked over to the phone reported briefly to someone then set off in the opposite direction to check the next guard post mallory guessed he was stifi in sight a dwindling blur in the darkness when mallory whispered to brown and miller to post themselves on guard again and they could still hear the measured crunch of his firm footfalls on a patch of distant gravel as their belayed rope went snaking over the edge of the cliff andrea and mallory sliding swiftly down even before it had stopped quivering stevens a huddled twisted heap with a gashed and bleeding cheek lying cruelly along a razorsharp spur of rock was still unconscious breathing stertorously through his open mouth below the knee his right leg twisted upwards and outwards against the rock at an hapossible angle as gently as he could braced against either side of the chimney and supported by andrea mallory lifted and straightened the twisted limb twice from the depths of the dark stupor of his unconsciousness stevens moaned in agony but mallory had no option but to carry on his teeth clenched tight until his jaws ached then slowly with infinite care he rolled up the trouser leg winced and screwed his eyes shut in momentary horror and nausea as he saw the dim whiteness of the shattered tibia sticking out through the torn and purply swollen flesh compound fracture andrea gently his exploring fingers slid down the mangled leg beneath the lip of the jackboot stopped suddenly as something gave way beneath his feather touch oh my god he murmured another break just above the ankle this boy is in a bad way andrea he is indeed andrea said gravely we can do nothing for him here nothing just nothing well have to get him up first mallory straightened gazed up bleakly at the perpendicular face of the chimney although how in the name of heaven i will take him up there was no suggestion in andreas voice either of desperate resolve or consciousness of the almost incredible effort involved it was simply a statement of intention the voice of a man who never questioned his abifity to do what he said he would if you will help me to raise him to tie him to my back with his broken leg loose dangling from a piece of skin and torn muscle mallory protested stevens cant take much more hell die if we do this hell die if we dont andrea murmured mallory stared down at stevens for a long moment then nodded heavily in the darkness hell die if we dont he echoed tiredly yes we have to do this he pushed outwards from the rock slid half a dozen feet down the rope and jammed a foot in the crutch of the chimney just below stevenss body he took a couple of turns of rope round his waist and looked up ready andrea he called softly ready andrea stooped hooked his great hands under stevenss armpits and lifted slowly powerfully as mallory pushed from below twice three times before they had him up the boy moaned deep down in his tortured throat the long quavering aabs of agony setting mallorys teeth on edge and then his dangling twisted leg had passed from mallorys reach and he was held close and cradled in andreas encircling arm the rainlashed bleeding mask of a face lolling grotesquely backwards forlorn and lifeless with the dead pathos of a broken doll seconds later mallory was up beside them expertly lashing stevenss wrists together he was swearing softly as his numbed hands looped and tightened the rope softly bitterly continuously but he was quite unaware of this he was aware only of the broken head that lolled stupidly against his shoulder of the welling rainthinned blood that filmed the upturned face of the hair above the gashed temple emerging darkly fair as the dye washed slowly out inferior bloody bootblacking mallory thought savagely jensen shall know of this it could cost a mans life and then he became aware of his own thoughts and swore again stifi more savagely and at himself this time for the utter triviality of what he was thinking with both hands free stevenss bound arms were looped round his neck his body lashed to his own andrea took less than thirty seconds to reach the top if the dragging one hundred and sixty pound deadweight on his back made any difference to andreas climbing speed and power mallory couldnt detect it the mans endurance was fantastic once just once as andrea scrambled over the edge of the cliff the broken leg caught on the rock and the crucifying torture of it seared through the merciful shell of insensibility forced a brief shriek of pain from his lips a hoarse bubbling whisper of sound all the more horrible for its muted agony and then andrea was standing upright and mallory was behind him cutting swiftly at the ropes that bound the two together straight into the rocks with him andrea will you mallory whispered wait for us at the first open space you come to andrea nodded slowly and without raising his head his hooded eyes bent over the boy in his arms like a man sunk in thought sunk in thought or listening and all unawares mallory too found himself looking and listening into the thin lost moaning of the wind and there was nothing there only the lifting dying threnody and the chill of the rain hardening to an icecold sleet he shivered without knowing why and listened again then he shook himself angrily turned abruptly towards the cliff face and started reeling in the rope he had it all up lying round his feet in a limp and rainsodden tangle when he remembered about the spike still secured to the foot of the chimney the hundreds of feet of rope suspended from it he was too tired and cold and depressed even to feel exasperated with himself the sight of stevens and the knowledge of how it was with the boy had affected him more than he knew moodily almost he kicked the rope over the side again slid down the chimney untied the second rope and sent the spike spinning out into the darkness less than ten minutes later the wetlycoiled ropes over his shoulder he led miller and brown into the dark confusion of the rocks they found stevens lying under the lee of a huge boulder less than a hundred yards inland in a tiny cleared space barely the size of a billiard table an oilskin was spread beneath him on the sodden gravelly earth a camouflage cape covered most of his body it was bitterly cold now but the rock broke the force of the wind sheltered the boy from the driving sleet andrea looked up as the three men dropped into the hollow and lowered their gear to the ground already mallory could see andrea had rolled the trouser up beyond the knee and cut the heavy jackboot away from the mangled leg sufferin christ the words halfoath halfprayer were torn involuntarily from miller even in the deep gloom the shattered leg looked ghastly now he dropped on one knee and stooped low over it what a mess he murmured slowly he looked up ovór his shoulder weve gotta do something about that leg boss and weve no damned time to lose this kids a good candidate for the mortuary i know weve got to save him dusty weve just got to all at once this had become terribly important to mallory he dropped down on his knees lets have a look at him impatiently miller waved him away leave this to me boss there was a sureness a sudden authority in his voice that held mallory silent the medicine pack quick and undo that tent you sure you can handle this god knew mallory thought he didnt really doubt him he was conscious only of gratitude of a profound relief but he felt he had to say something how are you going look boss miller said quietly all my life ive worked with just three things mines tunnels and explosives theyre kinda tricky things boss ive seen hundreds of busted arms and legs and fixed most of them myself he grinned wryly in the darkness i was boss myself then just one of my privileges i reckon good enough mallory clapped him on the shoulder hes all yours dusty but the tent involuntarily he looked over his shoulder in the direction of the cliff i mean you got me wrong boss millers hands steady and precise with the delicate certainty of a man who has spent a lifetime with high explosives were busy with a swab and disinfectant i wasnt fixin on settin up a base hospital but we need tentpoles splints for his legs of course of course the poles never occurred to me for splints and rye been thinking of nothing else for theyre not too important boss miller had the medicine pack open now rapidly selecting the items he wanted with the aid of a hooded torch morphine thats the first thing or this kids goin to die of shock and then shelter warmth dry clothin warmth dry clothing mallory interrupted incredulously he looked down at the unconscious boy remembering how stevens had lost them the stove and all the fuel and his mouth twisted in bitterness his own executioner where in gods name are we going to find thorn i dont know boss miller said simply but we gotta find them and not just to lessen shock with a leg like this and soaked to the skin hes bound to get pneumonia and then as much sulfa as that bloody great hole in his leg will take one touch of sepsis in the state this kids in his voice trailed away into silence mallory rose to his feet i reckon youre the boss it was a very creditable imitation of the americans drawl and miller looked up quickly surprise melting into a tired smile then looked away again mallory could hear the chatter of his teeth as he bent over stevens and sensed rather than saw that he was shivering violently continuously but oblivious to it all in his complete concentration on the job in hand millers clothes mallory remembered again were completely saturated not for the first time mallory wondered how he had managed to get himself into such a state with a waterproof covering him you fix him up ill find a place mallory wasnt as confident as he felt still on the screestrewn volcanic slopes of these hills behind there ought to be a fair chance of finding a rock shelter if not a cave or there would have been in daylight as it was they would just have to trust to luck to stumble on one he saw that casey brown greyfaced with exhaustion and illness the aftereffects of carbon monoxide poisoning are slow to disappear had risen unsteadily to his feet and was making for a gap between the rocks where are you going chief back for the rest of the stuff sir are you sure you can manage mallory peered at him closely you dont look any too fit to me i dont feel it either brown said frankly he looked at mallory but with all respects sir i dont think youve seen yourself recently you have a point mallory acknowledged all right then come on ill go with you for the next ten minutes there was silence in the tiny clearing a silence broken only by the murmurs of miller and andrea working over the shattered leg and the moans of the injured man as he twisted and struggled feebly in his dark abyss of pain then gradually the morphine took effect and the struggling lessened and died away altogether and miller was able to work rapidly without fear of interruption andrea had an oilskin outstretched above them it served a double purpose it curtained off the sleet that swept round them from time to time and blanketed the pinpoint light of the rubber torch he held in his free hand and then the leg was set and bandaged and as heavily splinted as possible and miller was on his feet straightening his aching back thank gawd thats done he said wearily he gastured at stevens i feel just the way that kid looks suddenly he stiffened stretched out a warning arm i can hear something andrea he whispered andrea laughed its only brown coming back my friend hes been coming this way for over a minute now how do you know its brown miller challenged he felt vaguely annoyed with himself and unobtrusively shoved his ready automatic back into his pocket brown is a good man among rocks andrea said gently but he is tired but captain mallory he shrugged people call me the big cat i know but among the mountains and rocks the captain is more than a cat he is a ghost and that was how men called him in crete you will know he is here when he touches you on the shoulder miller shivered in a sudden icy gust of sleet i wish you people wouldnt creep around so much he complained he looked up as brown came round the corner of a boulder slow with the shambling stumbling gait of an exhausted man hi there casey how are things goin not too bad brown murmured his thanks as andrea took the box of explosives off his shoulder and lowered it easily to the ground this is the last of the gear captain sent me back with it we heard voices some way along the cliff hes staying behindto see what they say when they find stevens gone wearily he sat down on top of the box maybe hell get some idea of what theyre going to do next if anything seems to me he could have left you there and carried that damned box back himself miller growled disappointment in mallory made him more outspoken than hed meant to be hes much better off than you are right now and i think its a bit bloody much he broke off and gasped in pain as andreas fingers caught his arm like giant steel pincers it is not fair to talk like that my friend andrea said reproachfully you forget perhaps that brown here cannot talk or understand a word of german miller rubbed his bruised arm tenderly shaking his head in slow selfanger and condemnation me and my big mouth he said ruefully always talkin outa turn miller they call me your pardon one and all and what is next on the agenda gentlemen captain says were to go straight on into the rocks and up the right shoulder of this bill here brown jerked a thumb in the direction of the vague mass dark and strangely foreboding that towered above and beyond them hell catch us up within fifteen minutes or so he grinned tiredly at miller and were to leave this box and a rucksack for him to carry spare me miller pleaded i feel only six inches tall as it is he looked down at stevens lying quietly under the darkly gleaming wetness of the oilskins then up at andrea im afraid andrea of course of course andrea stooped quickly wrapped the oilskins round the unconscious boy and rose to his feet as effortlessly as if the oilskins had been empty ill lead the way miller volunteered mebbe i can pick an easy path for you and young stevens he swung generator and rucksacks on to his shoulder staggering under the sudden weight he hadnt realised he was so weak at first that is he amended later on youll have to carry us both mallory had badly miscalculated the time it would require to overtake the others over an hour had elapsed since brown had left him and still there were no signs of the others and with seventy pounds on his back he wasnt making such good time himself it wasnt all his fault the returning german patrol after the first shock of discovery had searched the clifftop again methodically and with exasperating slowness mallory had waited tensely for someone to suggest descending and expmining the chimney the gougemarks of the spikes on the rock would have been a dead giveaway but nobody even mentioned it with the guard obviously fallen to his death it would have been a pointless thing to do anyway after an unrewarding search they had debated for an unconscionable time as to what they should do next finally they had done nothing a replacement guard was left and the rest made off along the cliff carrying their rescue equipment with them the three men ahead had made surprisingly good time although the conditions admittedly were now much easier the heavy fall of boulders at the foot of the slope had petered out after another fifty yards giving way to broken scree and rainwashed rubble possibly he had passed them but it seemed unlikely in the intervals between these driving sleet showers it was more like hail now he was able to scan the bare shoulder of the hill and nothing moved besides he knew that andrea wouldnt stop until he reached what promised at least a bare minimum of shelter and as yet these exposed windswept slopes had offered nothing that even remotely approached that in the end mallory almost literally stumbled upon both men and shelter he was negotiating a narrow longitudinal spine of rock had just crossed its razorback when he heard the murmur of voices beneath him and saw a tiny glimmer of light behind the canvas stretching down from the overhang of the far wall of the tiny ravine at his feet miller started violently and swung round as he felt the hand on his shoulder the automatic was halfway out of his pocket before he saw who it was and sunk back heavily on the rock behind him come come now triggerhappy thankfully mallory slid his burden from his aching shoulders and looked across at the softly laughing andrea whats so funny our friend here andrea grinned again i told him that the first thing he would know of your arrival would be when you touched him on the shoulder i dont think he believed me you might have coughed or somethin miller said defensively its my nerves boss he added plaintively theyre not what they were fortyeight hours ago mallory looked at him disbelievingly made to speak then stopped short as he caught sight of the pale blur of a face propped up against a rucksack beneath the white swathe of a bandaged forehead the eyes were open looking steadily at him mallory took a step forward sank down on one knee so youve come round at last he smiled into the sunken parchment face and stevens smiled back the bloodless lips whiter than the face itself he looked ghastly how do you feel andy not too bad sir really im not the bloodshot eyes were dark and filled with pain his gaze fell and he looked down vacantly at his bandaged leg looked up again smiled uncertainly at mallory im terribly sorry about all this sir what a bloody stupid thing to do it wasnt a stupid thing mallory spoke with slow heavy emphasis it was criminal folly he knew everyone was watching them but knew also that stevens had eyes for him alone criminal unforgiveable folly he went on quietly and im the man in the dock id suspected youd lost a lot of blood on the boat but i didnt know you had these big gashes on your forehead i should have made it my business to find out he smiled wryly you should have heard what these two insubordinate characters had to say to me about it when they got to the top and they were right you should never have been asked to bring up the rear in the state you were in it was madness he grinned again you should have been hauled up like a sack of coals like the intrepid mountaineering team of miller and brown god knows how you ever made it im sure youll never know he leaned forward touched stevenss sound knee forgive me andy i honestly didnt realise how far through you were stevens stirred uncomfortably but the dead pallor of the highboned cheeks was stained with embarrassed pleasure please sir he pleaded dont talk like that it was just one of these things he paused eyes screwed shut and indrawn breath hissing sharply through his teeth as a wave of pain washed up from his shattered leg then he looked at mallory again and theres no credit due to me for the climb he went on quietly i hardly remember a thing about it mallory looked at him without speaking eyebrows arched in mild interrogation i was scared to death every step of the way up stevens said simply he was conscious of no surprise no wonder that he was saying the thing he would have died rather than say ive never been so scared in all my life mallory shook his head slowly from side to side stubbled chin rasping in his cupped palm he seemed genninely puzzled then he looked down at stevens and smiled quizzically now i know you are new to this game andy he smiled again maybe you think i was laughing and singing all the way up that cliff maybe you think i wasnt scared he lit a cigarette and gazed at stevens through a cloud of drifting smoke well i wasnt scared isnt the word i was bloody well terrified so was andrea here we know too much not to be scared andrea stevens laughed then cried out as the movement triggered off a crepitant agony in his boneshattered leg for a moment mallory thought he had lost consciousness but almost at once he spoke again his voice husky with pain andrea he whispered scared i dont believe it andrea was afraid the big greeks voice was very gentle andrea is afraid andrea is always afraid that is why i have lived so long he stared down at his great hands and why so many have died they were not so afraid as l they were not afraid of everything a man could be afraid of there was always something they forgot to fear to guard against but andrea was afraid of everything and he forgot nothing it is as simple as that he looked across at stevens and smiled there are no brave men and cowardly men in the world my son there are only brave men to be born to live to die that takes courage enough in itself and more than enough we are all brave men and we are all afraid and what the world calls a brave man he too is brave and afraid like all the rest of us only he is brave for five minutes longer or sometimes ten minutes or twenty minutes or the time it takes a man sick and bleeding and afraid to climb a cliff stevens said nothing his head was sunk on his chest and his face was hidden he had seldom felt so happy seldom so at peace with himself he had known that he could not hide things from men like andrea and mallory but he had not known that it would not matter he felt he should say something but he could not think what and he was deathly tired he knew deep down that andrea was speaking the truth but not the whole truth but he was too tired to care to try to work things out miller cleared his throat noisily no more talkin lieutenant he said firmly you gotta lie down get yourself some sleep stevens looked at him then at mallory in puzzled inquiry better do what youre told andy mallory smiled your surgeon and medical adviser talking he fixed your leg oh i didnt know thanks dusty was it very difficult miller waved a deprecatory hand not for a man of my experience just a simple break he lied easily almost let one of the others do it give him a hand to lie down will you andrea he jerked his head towards mallory boss the two men moved outside turning their backs to the icy wind we gotta get a fire dry clothing for that kid miller said urgently his pulse is about temperature hes rnnnin a fever and hes losin ground all the thne i know i know mallory said worriedly and theres not a hope of getting any fuel on this damned mountain lets go in and see how much dried clothing we can muster between us he lifted the edge of the canvas and stepped inside stevens was still awake brown and andrea on either side of him miller was on his heels were going to stay here for the night mallory announced so lets make things as snug as possible mind you he admitted were a bit too near the cliff for comfort but old jerry hasnt a clue were on the island and were out of sight of the coast might as well make ourselves comfortable boss miller made to speak then fell silent again mallory looked at him in surprise saw that he brown and stevens were looking at one another uncertainty then doubt and a dawning sick comprehension in their eyes a sudden anxiety the sure knowledge that something was far wrong struck at mallory like a blow whats up he demanded sharply what is it we have bad news for you boss miller said carefully we should have told you right away guess we all thought that one of the others would have told you remember that sentry you and andrea shoved over the side mallory nodded somberly he knew what was coming he fell on top of that reef twentythirty feet or so from the cliff miller went on wasnt much of him left i guess but what was was jammed between two rocks he was really stuck good and fast i see mallory murmured ive been wondering all night how you managed to get so wet under your rubber cape i tried four times boss miller said quietly the others had a rope round me he shrugged his shoulders not a chance them gawddamned waves just flung me back against the cliff every time it will be light in three or four hours mallory murmured in four hours they will know we are on the island they will see him as soon as its dawn and send a boat to investigate does it really matter sir stevens suggested he could still have fallen mallory eased the canvas aside and looked out into the night it was bitterly cold and the snow was beginning to fall all around them he dropped the canvas again five minutes he said absently we will leave in five minutes he looked at stevens and smiled faintly we are forgetful too we should have told you andrea stabbed the sentry through the heart the hours that followed were hours plucked from the darkest nightmare endless numbing hours of stumbling and tripping and falling and getting up again of racked bodies and aching tortured muscles of dropped loads and frantic pawing around in the deepening snow of hunger and thirst and allencompassing exhaustion they had retraced their steps now were heading wnw back across the shoulder of the mountain almost certainly the germans would think they had gone due north heading for the centre of the island without compass stars or moon to guide mallory had nothing to orientate them but the feel of the slope of the mountain and the map viachos had given them in alexandria but by and by he was reasonably certain that they had rounded the mountain and were pushing up some narrow gorge into the interior the snow was the deadly enemy heavy wet and feathery it swirled all around them in a blanketing curtain of grey sifted down their necks and jackboots worked its insidious way under their clothes and up their sleeves blocked their eyes and ears and mouths pierced and then anaesthetised exposed faces and turned gloveless hands into leaden lumps of ice benumbed and all but powerless all suffered and suffered badly but stevens most of all he had lost consciousness again within minutes of leaving the cave and clad in clinging sodden clothes as he was he now lacked even the saving warmth generated by physical activity twice andrea had stopped and felt for the beating of the heart for he thought that the boy had died but he could feel nothing for there was no feeling left in his bands and could only wonder and stumble on again about five in the morning as they were climbing up the steep valley head above the gorge a treacherous slippery slope with only a few stunted carob trees for anchor in the sliding scree mallory decided that they must rope up for safetys sake in single file they scrambled and struggled up the eversteepening slope for the next twenty minutes mallory in the lead did not even dare to think how andrea was getting on behind him suddenly the slope eased flattened out completely and almost before they realised what was happening they bad crossed the high divide still roped together and in driving blinding snow with zero visibility and were sliding down the valley on the other side they came to the cave at dawn just as the first grey stirrings of a bleak and cheerless day struggled palely through the lowering snowfilled sky to the east monsieur vlachos had told them that the south of navarone was honeycombed with caves but this was the first they had seen and even then it was no cave but a dark narrow tunnel in a great heap of piled volcanic slabs huge twisted layers of rock precariously poised in a gulley that threaded down the slope towards some broad and unknown valley a thousand two thousand feet beneath them a valley still shrouded in the gloom of night it was no cave but it was enough for frozen exhausted sleephaunted men it was more than enough it was more than they had ever hoped for there was room for them all the few cracks were quickly blocked against the drifting snow the entrance curtained off by the boulderweighted tent somehow impossibly almost in the cramped darkness they stripped stevens of his sea and rainsoaked clothes eased him into a providentially zipped sleepingbag forced some brandy down his throat and cushioned the bloodstained head on some dry clothing and then the four men even the tireless andrea slumped down to the sodden snowchilled floor of the cave and slept like men already dead oblivious alike of the rocks on the floor the cold their hunger and their clammy saturated clothing oblivious even of the agony of returning circulation in their frozen hands and faces chapter tuesday the sun rimeringed and palely luminous behind the drifting cloudwrack was far beyond its zenith and dipping swiftly westwards to the snowlimned shoulder of the mountain when andrea lifted the edge of the tent pushed it gently aside and peered out warily down the smooth sweep of the mountain side for a few moments he remained almost motionless behind the canvas automatically easing cramped and aching leg muscles narrowed roving eyes gradually accustoming themselves to the white glare of the glistening crystalline snow and then he had flitted noiselessly out of the mouth of the tunnel and reached far up the bank of the gully in half a dozen steps stretched full length against the snow he eased himself smoothly up the slope lifted a cautious eye over the top far below him stretched the great cpxved sweep of an almost perfectly symmetrical valley a valley born abruptly in the cradling embrace of steepwalled mountains and falling away gently to the north that towering buttressed giant on his right that brooded darkly over the head of the valley its peak hidden in the snow clouds there could be no doubt about that andrea thought mt kostos the highest mountain in navarone they had crossed its western flank during the darkness of the night due east and facing his own at perhaps five miles distance the third mountain was barely less high but its northern flank fell away more quickly debouchbig on to the plains that lay in the northeast of navarone and about four miles away to the northnortheast far beneath the snowline and the isolated shep herds huts a tiny flatroofed township lay in a fold in the hills along the bank of the little stream that wound its way through the valley that could only be the village of margaritha even as he absorbed the topography of the valley his eyes probing every dip and cranny in the hills for a possible source of danger andreas mind was racing back over the last two minutes of time trying to isolate to remember the nature of the alien sound that had cut through the cocoon of sleep and brought him instantly to his feet alert and completely awake even before his conscious mind had time to register the memory of the sound and then he heard it again three times in as many seconds the highpitched lonely wheep of a whistle shrill peremptory blasts that echoed briefly and died along the lower slopes of mt kostos the final echo still hung faintly on the air as andrea pushed himself backwards and slid down to the floor of the gully he was back on the bank within thirty seconds cheek muscles contracting involuntarily as the icechill eyepieces of mallorys zeissikon binoculars screwed into his face there was no mistaking them now he thought grimly his first fleeting impression had been all too accurate twentyfive perhaps thirty soldiers in all strung out in a long irregular line they were advancing slowly across the flank of kostos combing every gully each jumbled confusion of boulders that lay in their path every man was clad in a snowsuit but even at a distance of two miles they were easy to locate the arrowheads of their strapped skis angled up above shoulders and hooded heads startlingly black against the sheer whiteness of the snow the skis bobbed and weaved in disembodied drunkenness as the men slipped and stumbled along the screestrewn slopes of the mountain from time to time a man near the centre of the line pointed and gestured with an alpenstock as if coordinating the efforts of the search party the man with the whistle andrea guessed andrea the call from the cave mouth was very soft anything wrong finger to his lips andrea twisted round in the snow mallory was stinding by the canvas screen darkjowled and crumpleclothed he held up one hand against the glare of the snow while the other rubbed the sleep from his bloodshot eyes and then he was limping forward in obedience to the crooking of andreas finger wincing in pain at every step he took his toes were swollen and skinned gummed together with congealed blood he had not had his boots off since he had taken them from the feet of the dead german sentry and now he was almost afraid to remove them afraid of what he would find he clambered slowly up the bank of the gully and sank down in the snow beside andrea company the very worst of company andrea murmured take a look my keith he handed over the binoculars pointed down to the lower slopes of mt kostos your friend jensen never told us that they were here slowly maliory quartered the slopes with the binoculars suddenly the line of searchers moved into his field of vision he raised his head adjusted the focus impatiently looked briefly once more then lowered the binoculars with a restrained deliberation of gesture that held a wealth of bitter comment the wgb be said softly a jaeger battalion andrea conceded alpine corps their finest mountain troops this is most inconvenient my keith mallory nodded rubbed his stubbled chin if anyone can find us they can and theyll find us he lifted the glasses to look again at the line of advancing men the painstaking thoroughness of the search was disturbing enough but even more threatening more frightening was the snaillike relentlessness the inevitability of the approach of these tiny figures god knows what the alpenkorps is doing here mallory went on its enough that they are here they must know that weve landed and spent the morning searching the eastern saddle of kostos that was the obvious route for us to break into the interior theyve drawn a blank there so now theyre working their way over to the other saddle they must be pretty nearly certain that were carrying a wounded man with us and that we cant have got very far its only going to be a matter of time andrea a matter of time andrea echoed he glanced up at the sun a sun all but invisible in a darkening sky an hour an hour and a half at the most theyll be here before the sun goes down and well still be here he glanced quizzically at mallory we cannot leave the boy and we cannot get away if we take the boy and then he would die anyway we will not be here mallory said flatly if we stay we all die or finish up in one of those nice little dungeons that monsieur viachos told us about the greatest good of the greatest number andrea nodded slowly thats how it has to be has it not my keith the greatest number that is what captain jensen would say mallory stirred uncomfortably but his voice was steady enough when he spoke thats how i see it too andrea simple proportion twelve hundred to one you know it has to be this way mallory sounded tired yes i know but you are worrying about nothing andrea smiled come my friend let us tell the others the good news miller looked up as the two men came in letting the canvas screen fall shut behind them he had unzipped the side of stevenss sleepingbag and was working on the mangled leg a pencil flashlight was propped on a rucksack beside him when are we goin to do somethin about this kid boss the voice was abrupt angry like his gesture towards the sleepdrugged boy beside him this damned waterproof sleepingbag is soaked right through sos the kid and hes about frozen stiff his leg feels like a side of chilled beef hes gotta have heat boss a warm room and hot drinks or hes finished twentyfour hours miller shivered and looked slowly round the broken walls of the rockshelter i reckon hed have less than an even chance in a firstclass general hospital hes just wastin his time keepin on breathin in this gawddamned icebox miller hardly exaggerated water from the melting snow above trickled continuously down the clammy greenlichened walls of the cave or dripped directly on to the halffrozen gravelly slush on the floor of the cave with no through ventilation and no escape for the water accumulating at the sides of the shelter the whole place was dank and airless and terribly chill maybe hell be hospitalised sooner than you think mallory said dryly hows his leg worse miller was blunt a helluva sight worse ive just chucked in another handful of suipha and tied things up again thats all i can do boss and its just a waste of time anyway what was that crack about a hospital he added suspiciously that was no crack mallory said soberly but one of the more unpleasant facts of life theres a german search party heading this way they mean business theyll find us all right miller swore thats handy thats just wonderful he said bitterly how far away boss an hour maybe a little more and what are we goin to do with junior here leave him its his only chance i reckon stevens comes with us there was a flat finality in mallorys voice miller looked at him for a long time in silence his face was very cold stevens comes with us miller repeated we drag him along with us until hes dead that wont take long and then we leave him in the snow just like that huh just like that dusty absently mallory brushed some snow off his clothes and looked up again at miller stevens knows too much the germans will have guessed why were on the island but they dont know how we propose to get inside the fortress and they dont know when the navys coming through but stevens does theyll make him talk scopolamine will make anyone taik scopolamine on a dying man miller was openly incredulous why not id do the same myself if you were the german commandant and you knew that your big guns and half the men in your fortress were liable to be blown to hell any moment youd do the same miller looked at him grinned wryly shook his head me and my i know you and your big mouth mallory smiled and clapped him on the shoulder i dont like it one little bit more than you do dusty he turned away and crossed to the other side of the cave how are you feeling chief not too bad sir casey brown was only just awake numbed and shivering in sodden clothes anything wrong plenty mallory assured him search party moving this way well have to pull out inside half an hour he looked at his watch just on four oclock do you think you could raise cairo on the set lord only knows brown said frankly he rose stiffly to his feet the radio didnt get just the best of treatment yesterday ill have a go thanks chief see that your aerial doesnt stick up above the sides of the gully mallory turned to leave the cave but halted abruptly at the sight of andrea squatting on a boulder just beside the entrance his head bent in concentration the big greek had just finished screwing telescopic sights on to the barrel of his mm mauser and was now deftly wrapping a sleepingbag lining round its barrel and butt until the entire rifle was wrapped in a white cocoon mallory watched him in silence andrea glanced up at him smiled rose to his feet and reached out for his rucksack within thirty seconds he was clad from head to toe in his mountain camouflage suit was drawing tight the pursestrings of his snowhood and easing his feet into the rucked elastic anklets of his canvas boots then he picked up the mauser and smiled slightly i thought i might be taking a little walk captain he said apologetically with your permission of course mallory nodded his head several times in slow recollection you said i was worrying about nothing he murmured i should have known you might have told me andrea but the protest was automatic without significance mallory felt neither anger nor even annoyance at this tacit arrogation of his authority the habit of command died hard in andrea on such occasions as he ostensibly sought approval for or consulted about a proposed course of action it was generally as a matter of courtesy and to give information as to his intentions instead of resentment mallory could feel only an overwhelming relief and gratitude to the smiling giant who towered above him he had talked casually to miller about driving stevens till he died and then abandoning him talked with an indifference that masked a mind sombre with bitterness at what he must do but even so he had not known how depressed bow sick at heart this decision had left him until he knew it was no longer necessary i am sorry andrea was halfcontrite halfsmiling i should have told you i thought you understood it is the best thing to do yes it is the only thing to do mallory said frankly youre going to draw them off up the saddle there is no other way with their skis they would overtake me in minutes if i went down into the valley i cannot come back of course until it is dark you will be here some of us will mallory glanced across the shelter where a waking stevens was trying to sit up heels of his palms screwing into his exhausted eyes we must have food and fuel andrea he said softly i am going down into the valley tonight of course of course we must do what we can andreas face was grave his voice only a murmur as long as we can he is only a boy a child almost perhaps it will not be long he pulled back the curtain looked out at the evening sky i will be back by seven oclock seven oclock mallory repeated the sky he could see was darkening already darkening with the gloom of coming snow and the lifting wind was beginning to puff little clouds of airspun flossy white into the little gully mallory shivered and caught hold of the massive arm for gods sake andrea he urged quietly look after yourself myself andrea smiled gently no mirth in his eyes and as gently he disengaged his arm do not think about me the voice was very quiet with an utter lack of arrogance if you must speak to god speak to him about these poor devils who are looking for us the canvas dropped behind him and he was gone for some moments mallory stood irresolutely at the mouth of the cave gazing out sightlessly through the gap in the curtain then he wheeled abruptly crossed the floor of the shelter and knelt in front of stevens the boy was propped up against millers anxious arm the eyes lacklustre and expressionless bloodless cheeks deepsunken in a grey and parchment face mallory smiled at him he hoped the shock didnt show in his face well well well the sleeper awakes at last better late than never he opened his waterproof cigarette case profferred it to stevens how are you feeling now andy frozen sir stevens shook his head at the case and tried to grin back at mallory a feeble travesty of a smile that made mallory wince and the leg i think it must be frozen too stevens looked down incuriously at the sheathed whiteness of his shattered leg anyway i cant feel a thing frozen millers sniff was a masterpiece of injured pride frozen he says gawddanined ingratitude its the firstclass medical care if i do say so myself stevens smiled a fleeting absent smile that flickered over his face and was gone for long moments he kept staring down at his leg then suddenly lifted his head and looked directly at mallory look sir theres no good kidding ourselves the voice was soft quite toneless i dont want to seem ungrateful and i hate even the idea of cheap heroics but well im just a damned great millstone round your necks and leave you eh mallory interrupted leave you to die of the cold or be captured by the germans forget it laddie we can look after you and these ruddy guns at the same time but sir you insult us lootenant miller sniffed again our feelings are hurt besides as a professional man i gotta see my case through to convalescence and if you think im goin to do that in any gawddamned dripping german dungeon you can enough mallory held up his hand the subject is closed he saw the stain high up on the thin cheeks the glad light that touched the dulled eyes and felt the selfloathing and the shame well up inside him shame for the gratitude of a sick man who did not know that their concern stemmed not from solicitude but from fear that he might betray them mallory bent forward and began to unlace his high jackboots he spoke without looking up dusty yeah when youre finished boasting about your medical prowess maybe youd care to use some of it come and have a look at these feet of mine will you im afraid the sentrys boots havent done them a great deal of good fifteen painful minutes later miller snipped off the rough edges of the adhesive bandage that bound mallorys right foot straightened up stiffly and contemplated his handiwork with pride beautiful miller beautiful he murmured complacently not even in john hopkins in the city of baltimore he broke off suddenly frowned down at the thickly bandaged feet and coughed apologetically a small point has just occurred to me boss i thought it might eventually mallory said grimly just how do you propose to get my feet into these damned boots again he shivered involuntarily as he pulled on a pair of thick woollen socks matted and sodden with melted snow picked up the german sentrys boots held them at arms length and examined them in disgust sevens at the most and a darned small sevens at that nines stevens said laconically he handed over his own jackboots one of them slit neatly down the side where andrea had cut it open you can fix that tear easily enough and theyre no damned good to me now no arguments sir please he began to laugh softly broke off in a sharply indrawn hiss of pain as the movement jarred the broken bones took a couple of deep quivering breaths then smiled whitely my first and probably my last contribution to the expedition what sort of medal do you reckon theyll give me for that sir mallory took the boots looked at stevens a long moment in silence then turned as the tarpaulin was pushed aside brown stumbled in lowered the transmitter and telescopic aerial to the floor of the cave and pulled out a tin of cigarettes they slipped from his frozen fingers fell into the icy mud at his feet became brown and sodden on the instant he swore briefly and without enthusiasm beat his numbed hands across his chest gave it up and sat down heavily on a convenient boulder he looked tired and cold and thoroughly miserable mallory lit a cigarette and passed it across to him how did it go casey manage to raise them at all they managed to raise me more or less reception was lousy brown drew the grateful tobacco smoke deep down into his lungs and i couldnt get through at all must be that damned great hill to the south there probably mallory nodded and what news from our friends in cairo exhorting us to greater efforts telling us to get on with the job no news at all too damn worried about the silence at this end said that from now on they were going to come through every four hours acknowledgment or no repeated that about ten times then signed off thatll be a great help miller said acidly nice to know theyre on our side nothin like moral support he jerked his thumb towards the mouth of the cave reckon them bloodhounds would be scared to death if they knew did you take a gander at them before you came in i didnt have to brown said morosely i could hear them sounded like the officer in charge shouting directions mechanically almost he picked up his automatic rifle eased the clip in the magazine must be less than a mile away now the search party more closely bunched by this time was less than a mile was barely half a mile distant from the cave when the oberleutnant in charge saw that the right wing of his line on the steeper slopes to the south was lagging behind once more impatiently he lifted his whistle to his mouth for the three sharp peremptory blasts that would bring his weary men stumbling into line again twice the whistle shrilled out its imperative urgency the piercing notes echoing flatly along the snowbound slopes and dying away in the valley below but the third wheep died at birth caught up again and tailed off in a wailing eldritch diminuendo that merged with dreadful harmony into a long bubbling scream of agony for two or three seconds the oberleutnant stood motionless in his tracks his face shocked and contorted then he jackknifed violently forward and pitched down into the crusted snow the burly sergeant beside him stared down at the fallen officer looked up in sudden horrified understanding opened his mouth to shout sighed and toppled wearily over the body at his feet the evil whiplash crack of the mauser in his ears as he died high up on the western slopes of mount kostos wedged in the v between two great boulders andrea gazed down the darkening mountainside over the depressed telescopic sights of his rifle and pumped another three rounds into the wavering disorganised line of searchers his face was quite still as immobile as the eyelids that never flickered to the regular crashing of his mauser and drained of all feeling even his eyes reflected the face eyes neither hard nor pitiless but simply empty and almost frighteningly remote a remoteness that mirrored his mind a mind armoured for the moment against all thought and sensation for andrea knew that he must not think about this thing to kill to take the life of his fellows that was the supreme evil for life was a gift that it was not his to take away not even in fair fight and this was murder slowly andrea lowered the mauser peered through the drifting gunsmoke that hung heavily in the frosty evening air the enemy had vanished completely rolled behind scattered boulders or burrowed frantically into the blanketing anonymity of the snow but they were still there still potentially as dangerous as ever andrea knew that they would recover fast from the death of their officer there were no finer no more tenacious fighters in europe than the skitroops of the jaeger mountain battalion and would come after him catch and kill him if humanly possible that was why andreas first care had been to kill their officer he might not have come after him might have stopped to puzzle out the reason for this unprovoked flank attack andrea ducked low in reflex instinct as a sudden burst of automatic fire whined in murderous ricochet off the boulders before him he had expected this it was the old classic infantry attack pattern advance under covering fire drop cover your mate and come again swiftly andrea rammed home another charge into the magazine of his mauser dropped flat on his face and inched his way along behind the low line of broken rock that extended fifteen or twenty yards to his right he had chosen his ambush point with care and then petered out at the far end he pulled his snow hood down to the level of his brows and edged a wary eye round the corner of the rock another heavy burst of automatic fire smashed into the boulders he had just left and half a dozen men three from either end of the line broke cover scurried along the slope in a stumbling crouching run then pitched forward into the snow again along the slope the two parties had run in opposite directions andrea lowered his head and rubbed the back of a massive hand across the stubbled grizzle of his chin awkward damned awkward no frontal attack for the foxes of the wgb they were extending their lines on either side the points hooking round in a great encircling halfmoon bad enough for himself but he could have coped with that a carefully reconnoitred escape gully wound up the slope behind him but he hadnt foreseen what was obviously going to happen the curving crescent of line to the west was going to sweep across the rockshelter where the others lay hidden andrea twisted over on his back and looked up at the evening sky it was darkening by the moment darkening with the gloom of coming snow and daylight was beginning to fail he twisted again and looked across the great swelling shoulder of mount kostos looked at the few scattered rocks and shallow depressions that barely dimpled the smooth convexity of the slope he took a second quick look round the rock as the rifles of the wgb opened up once more saw the same encircling manoeuvre being executed again and waited no longer firing blindly downhill he halfrose to his feet and flung himself out into the open finger squeezing on the trigger feet driving desperately into the frozen snow as he launched himself towards the nearest rockcover forty yards away if an inch thirtyfive yards to go thirty twenty and still not a shot fired a slip a stumble on the sliding scree a catlike recovery ten yards still miraculously immune and then he had dived into shelter to land on chest and stomach with a sickening impact that struck cruelly into his ribs and emptied his lungs with an explosive gasp fighting for breath he struck the magazine cover rammed home another charge risked a quick peep over the top of the rock and catapulted himself to his feet again all inside ten seconds the mauser held across his body opened up again firing downhill at vicious random for andrea had eyes only for the smoothlytreacherous ground at his feet for the screelined depression so impossibly far ahead and then the mauser was empty useless in his hand and every gun far below had opened up the shells whistling above his head or blinding him with spurting gouts of snow as they ricochetted off the solid rock but twilight was touching the hills andrea was only a blur a swiftlyflitting blur against a ghostly background and uphill accuracy was notoriously difficult at any time even so the massed fire from below was steadying and converging and andrea waited no longer unseen hands plucking wickedly at the flying tails of his snowsmock he flung himself almost horizontally forward and slid the last ten feet face down into the waiting depression stretched full length on his back in the hollow andrea fished out a steel mirror from his breast pocket and held it gingerly above his head at first he could see nothing for the darkness was deeper below and the mirror misted from the warmth of his body and then the film vanished in the chill mountain air and he could see two three and then half a dozen men breaking cover heading at a clumsy run straight up the face of the hill and two of them had come from the extreme right of the line andrea lowered the mirror and relaxed with a long sigh of relief eyes crinkling in a smile he looked up at the sky blinked as the first feathery flakes of falling snow melted on his eyelids and smiled again almost lazily he brought out another charger for the mauser fed more shells into the magazine boss millers voice was plaintive yes what is it mallory brushed some snow off his face and the collar of his smock and peered into the white darkness ahead boss when you were in school did you ever read any stories about folks gettin lost in a snowstorm and wanderin round and round in circles for days we had exactly the same book in queenstown mallory conceded wanderin round and round until they died miller persisted oh for heavens sake mallory said impatiently his feet even in stevenss roomy boots hurt abominably how can we be wandering in circles if were going downhill all the time what do you think were on a bloody spiral staircase miller walked on in hurt silence mallory beside him both men ankledeep in the wet clinging snow that had been falling so silently so persistently for the past three hours since andrea had drawn off the jaeger search party even in midwinter in the white mountains in crete mallory could recall no snowfall so heavy and continuous so much for the isles of greece and the eternal sunshine that gilds them yet he thought bitterly he hadnt reckoned on this when hed planned on going down to margaritha for food and fuel but even so it wouldnt have made any difference in his decision although in less pain now stevens was becoming steadily weaker and the need was desperate with moon and stars blanketed by the heavy snowclouds visibility indeed was hardly more than ten feet in any direction the loss of their compasses had assumed a crippling importance he didnt doubt his ability to find the vifiage it was simply a matter of walking downhill till they came to the stream that ran through the valley then following that north till they came to margaritha but if the snow didnt let up their chances of locating that tiny cave again in the vast sweep of the hillsides mallory smothered an exclamation as millers hand closed round his upper arm dragged him down to his knees in the snow even in that moment of unknown danger he could feel a slow stirring of anger against himself for his attention had been wandering along with his thoughts he lifted his hand as vizor against the snow peered out narrowly through the wet velvety curtain of white that swirled and eddied out of the darkness before him suddenly he had it a dark squat shape only feet away they had all but walked straight into it its the hut he said softly in millers ear he had seen it early in the afternoon halfway between their cave and margaritha and almost in a line with both he was conscious of relief an increase in confidence they would be in the vifiage in less than half an hour elementary navigation my dear corporal he murmured lost and wandering in circles my foot just put your faith he broke off as millers fingers dug viciously into his arm as millers head came close to his own i heard voices boss the words were a mere breath of sound are you sure millers silenced gun mallory noticed was still in his pocket miller hesitated dammit to hell boss im sure of nothin he whispered irritably ive been imaginin every damn thing possible in the past hour he pulled the snow hood off his head the better to listen bent forward for a few seconds then sank back again anyway im sure i thought i heard somethin come on lets take a looksee mallory was on his feet again i think youre mistaken cant be the jaeger boys they were halfway back across mount kostos when we saw them last and the shepherds only use these places in the summer months he slipped the safety catch of his colt walked slowly at a halfcrouch towards the nearest wall of the hut miller at his shoulder they reached the hut put their ears against the frail tarpaper walls then seconds passed twenty half a minute then mallory relaxed nobody at home or if they are theyre keeping mighty quiet but no chances dusty you go that way ill go this meet at the door thatll be on the opposite side facing into the valley walk wide at the corners never fails to baffle the unwary a minute later both men were inside the hut the door shut behind them the hooded beam of mallorys torch probed into every corner of the ramshackle cabin it was quite empty an earthen floor a rough wooden bunk a dilapidated stove with a rusty lantern standing on it and that was all no table no chair no chimney not even a window mallory walked over to the stove picked up the lamp and sniffed it hasnt been used for weeks still full of kerosene though very useful in that damn dungeon up there if we can ever find the place he froze into a sudden listening immobility eyes unfocused and head cocked slightly to one side gently ever so gently he set the lamp down walked leisurely across to miller remind me to apologise at some future date he murmured we have company give me your gun and keep talking castelrosso again miller complained loudly he hadnt even raised an eyebrow this is downright monotonous a chinaman ill bet its a chinaman this time but he was already talking to himself the silenced automatic balanced at his waist mallory walked noiselessly round the hut four feet out from the walls he had passed two corners was just rounding the third when out of the corner of his eye he saw a vague figure behind him rising up swiftly from the ground and lunging out with upraised arm mallory stepped back quickly under the blow spun round swung his balled fist viciously and backwards into the stomach of his attacker there was a sudden explosive gasp of agony as the man doubled up moaned and crumpled silently to the ground barely in time mallory arrested the downward clubbing swipe of his reversed automatic gun reversed again the butt settled securely in his palm mallory stared down unblinkingly at the huddled figure at the primitive wooden baton still clutched in the gloved right hand at the unmilitary looking knapsack strapped to his back he kept his gun lined up on the fallen body waiting this had been just too easy too suspicious thirty seconds passed and still the figure on the ground hadnt stirred mallory took a short step forward and carefully deliberately and none too gently kicked the man on the outside of the right knee it was an old trick and hed never known it to fail the pain was brief but agonisung but there was no movement no sound at all quickly mallory stooped hooked his free hand round the knapsack shoulder straps straightened and made for the door halfcarrying halfdragging his captive the man was no weight at all with a proportionately much heavier garrison than even in crete there would be that much less food for the islanders mallory mused compassionately there would be very little indeed he wished he hadnt hit him so hard miller met him at the open door stooped wordlessly caught the unconscious man by the ankles and helped mallory dump him unceremoniously on the bunk in the far corner of the hut nice goin boss he complimented never heard a thing whos the heavyweight champ no idea mallory shook his head in the darkness just skin and bones thats all just skin and bones shut the door dusty and lets have a look at what weve got chapter tuesday a minute passed two then the little man stirred moaned and pushed himself to a sitting position mallory held his arm to steady him while he shook his bent head eyes screwed tightly shut as he concentrated on clearing the muzziness away finally he looked up slowly glanced from mallory to miller and back at mallory again in the feeble light of the newlylit shuttered lantern even as the men watched they could see the colour returning to the swarthy cheeks the indignant bristling of the heavy dark moustache the darkening anger in the eyes suddenly the man reached up tore mallorys hand away from his arm who are you he spoke in english clear precise with hardly a trace of accent sorry but the less you know the better mallory smiled deliberately to rob the words of offence i mean that for your own sake how are you feeling now tenderly the little man massaged his midriff flexed his leg with a grimace of pain you hit me very hard i had to mallory reached behind him and picked up the cudgel the man had been carrying you tried to hit me with this what did you expect me to do take my hat off so you could have a better swipe at me you are very amusing again he bent his leg experimentally looked up at mallory in hostile suspicion my knee hurts me he said accusingly first things first why the club i meant to knock you down and have a look at you he explained impatiently it was the only safe way you might have been one of the wgb why is my knee you had an awkward fall mallory said shamelessly what are you doing here who are you the little man countered miller coughed looked ostentatiously at his watch this is all very entertainin boss true for you dusty we havent all night quickly mallory reached behind him picked up the mans rucksack tossed it across to miller see whats in there will you strangely the little man made no move to protest food miller said reverently wonderful wonderful food cooked meat bread cheese and wine reluctantly miller closed the bag and looked curiously at their prisoner helluva funny time for a picnic so an american a yankee the little man smiled to himself better and better what do you mean miller asked suspiciously see for yourself the man said pleasantly he nodded casually to the far corner of the room look there mallory spun round realised in a moment that he had been tricked jerked back again carefully he leaned forward and touched millers arm dont look round too quickly dusty and dont touch your gun it seems our friend was not alone mallory tightened his lips mentally cursed himself for his obtuseness voices dusty had said there had been voices must be even more tired than he had thought a tall lean man blocked the entrance to the doorway his face was shadowed under an enveloping snowhood but there was no mistaking the gun in his hand a short lee enfleld rifle mallory noted dispassionately do not shoot the little man spoke rapidly in greek i am almost sure that they are those whom we seek panayis panayis mallory felt the wave of relief wash over him that was one of the names eugene viachos had given him back in alexandria the tables turned are they not the little man smiled at mallory the tired eyes crinkling the heavy black moustache lifting engagingly at one corner i ask you again who are you soe mallory answered unhesitatingly the man nodded in satisfaction captain jensen sent you mallory sank back on the bunk and sighed in long relief we are among friends dusty he looked at the little man before him you must be louki the first plane tree in the square in margaritha the little man beamed he bowed stretched out his hand louki at your service sir and this of course is panayis the tall man in the doorway dark saturnine unsmiling inclined his head briefly but said nothing you have us right the little man was beaming with delight louki and panayis they know about us in alexandria and cairo then he asked proudly of course mallory smothered a smile they spoke highly of you you have been of great help to the allies before and we will again louki said briskly come we are wasting time the germans are on the hills what help can we give you food louki we need food we need it badly we have it proudly louki gestured at the rucksacks we were on our way up with it you were on your way mallory was astonished how did you know where we were or even that we were on the island louki waved a deprecating hand it was easy since first light german troops have been moving south through margaritha up into the hills all morning they combed the east col of kostos we knew someone must have landed and that the germans had blocked the cliff path on the south coast at both ends so you must have come over the west col they would not expect that you fooled them so we came to find you but you would never have found us we would have found you there was complete certainty in the voice panayis and i we know every stone every blade of grass in navarone louki shivered suddenly stared out bleakly through the swirling snow you couldnt have picked worse weather we couldnt have picked better mallory said grimly last night yes lould agreed no one would expect you in that wind and rain no one would hear the aircraft or even dream that you would try to jump we came by sea miller interrupted he waved a negligent hand we climbed the south cliff what the south cliff louki was frankly disbelieving no one could climb the south cliff it is impossible thats the way we felt when we were about halfway up mallory said candidly but dusty here is right thats how it was louki had taken a step back his face was expressionless i say it is impossible he repeated flatly he is telling the truth louki miller cut in quietly do you never read newspapers of course i read newspapers louki bristled with indignation do you think i am how you say illiterate then think back to just before the war miller advised think of mountaineerin and the himalayas you must have seen his picture in the papers once twice a hundred times he looked at mallory consideringly only he was a little prettier in those days you must remember this is mallory keith mallory of new zealand mallory said nothing he was watching louki the puzzlement the ãomical screwing up of the eyes head cocked to one side then all at once something clicked in the little mans memory and his face lit up in a great crinkling smile that swamped every last trace of suspicion he stepped forward hand outstretched in wecome by heaven you are right mallory of course i know mallory he grabbed mallorys hand pumped it up and down with great enthusiasm it is indeed as the american says you need a shave and you look older i feel older mallory said gloomily he nodded at miller this is corporal miller an american citizen another famous climber louki asked eagerly another tiger of the hills yes he climbed the south cliff as it has never been climbed before mallory answered truthfully he glanced at his watch then looked directly at louki there are others up in the hifis we need help louki we need it badly and we need it at once you know the danger if you are caught helping us danger louki waved a contemptuous hand danger to louki and panayis the foxes of navarone impossible we are the ghosts of the night he hitched his pack higher up on his shoulders come let us take this food to your friends just a minute mallorys restraining hand was on his arm there are two other things we need heat a stove and fuel and we need heat a stove louki was incredulous your friends in the hifis what are they a band of old women and we also need bandages and medicine mallory went on patiently one of our friends has been terribly injured we are not sure but we do not think that he will live panayis louki barked back to the village louki was speaking in greek now rapidly he issued his orders had mallory describe where the rockshelter was made sure that panayis understood then stood a moment in indecision puffing at an end of his moustache at length he looked up at mallory could you find this cave again by yourself lord only knows mallory said franidy i honestly dont think so then i must come with you i had hoped you see it will be a heavy load for panayis i have told him to bring bedding as well and i dont think ill go along with him miller volunteered he thought of his backbreaking labours on the caique the climb up the cliff their forced march through the mountains the exercise will do me good louki translated his offer to panayis taciturn apparently only because of his complete lack of english and was met by what appeared to be a torrent of protest miller looked at him in astonishment whats the matter with old sunshine here he asked mallory doesnt seem any too happy to me says he can manage ok and wants to go by himself mallory interpreted thinks youll slow him up on the hills he shook his bead in mock wonder as if any man could slow dusty miller up exactly louki was bristling with anger again he turned to panayis fingers stabbing the empty air to emphasise his words miller turned looked apprehensively at mallory whats he tellin him now boss only the truth mallory said solemnly saying he ought to be honoured at being given the opportunity of marching with monsieur miller the worldfamous american climber mallory grinned panayis will be on his mettle tonight determined to prove that a navaronian can climb as well and as fast as any man oh my gawd miller moaned and on the way back dont forget to give panayis a hand up the steeper bits millers reply was luckily lost in a sudden flurry of snowladen wind that wind was rising steadily now a bitter wind that whipped the heavy snow into their bent faces and stung the tears from their blinking eyes a heavy wet snow that melted as it touched and trickled down through every gap and chink in their clothing until they were wet and chilled and thoroughly miserable a clammy sticky snow that built up layer after energysapping layer under their leadenfooted boots until they stumbled along inches above the ground leg muscles aching from the sheer accumulated weight of snow there was no visibility worthy of the name not even of a matter of feet they were blanketed swallowed up by an impenetrable cocoon of swirling grey and white unchanging featureless louki strode on diagonally upwards across the slope with the untroubled certainty of a man walking up his own garden path louki seemed as agile as a mountain goat and as tireless nor was his tongue less nimble less unwearied than his legs he talked incessantly a man overjoyed to be in action again no matter what action so long as it was against the enemy he told mallory of the last three attacks on the island and how they had so bloodily failed the germans had been somehow forewarned of the seaborne assault had been waiting for the special boat service and the commandos with everything they had and had cut them to pieces while the two airborne groups had had the most evil luck been delivered up to the enemy by misjudgment by a series of unforeseeable coincidences or how panayis and himself had on both occasions narrowly escaped with their lives panayis had actually been captured the last time had killed both his guards and escaped unrecognised of the disposition of the german troops and checkpoints throughout the island the location of the road blocks on the only two roads and finally of what little he himself knew of the layout of the fortress of navarone itself panayis the dark one could tell him more of that louki said twice panayis had been inside the fortress once for an entire night the guns the control rooms the barracks the officers quarters the magazine the turbo rooms the sentry points he knew where each one lay to the inch mallory whistled softly to himself this was more than he had ever dared hope for they had still to escape the net of searchers still to reach the fortress still to get inside it but once inside and panayis must know how to get inside unconsciously mallory lengthened his stride bent his back to the slope your friend panayis must be quite something he said slowly tell me more about him louki what can i tell you louki shook his head in a little flurry of snowflakes what do i know of panayis what does anyone know of panayis that he has the luck of the devil the courage of a madman and that sooner the lion will lie down with the lamb the starving wolf spare the flock than panayis breathe the same air as the germans we all know that and we know nothing of panayis all i know is that i thank god i am no german with panayis on the island he strikes by stealth by night by knife and in the back louki crossed himself his hands are full of blood mallory shivered involuntarily the dark sombre figure of panayis the memory of the expressionless face the hooded eyes were beginning to fascinate him theres more to him than that surely mallory argued after all you are both navaronians yes yes that is so this is a small island youve lived together all your lives ah but that is where the major is wrong mallorys promotion in rank was entirely loukis own idea despite mallorys protests and explanations he seemed determined to stick to it i louki was for many years in foreign lands helping monsieur viachos monsieur viachos louki said with pride is a very important government official i know mallory nodded a consul ive met him he is a very fine man you have met him monsieur vlachos there was no mistaking the gladness the delight in loukis voice that is good that is wonderful later you must tell me more he is a great man did i ever tell you we were speaking about panayis mallory reminded him gently ah yes panayis as i was saying i was away for a long time when i came back panayis was gone his father had died his mother had married again and panayis had gone to live with his stepfather and two little stepsisters in crete his stepfather halffisherman halffarmer was killed in fighting the germans near candia this was in the beginning panayis took over the boat of his father helped many of the allies to escape until he was caught by the germans strung up by his wrists in the village square where his family lived not far from casteli he was flogged till the white of his ribs of his backbone was there for all to see and left for dead then they burnt the village and panayiss family disappeared you understand major i understand mallory said grimly but panayis he should have died but he is tough that one tougher than a knot in an old carob tree friends cut him down during the night took him away into the hifis till he was well again and then he arrived back in navarone god knows how i think he came from island to island in a small rowingboat he never says why he came back i think it gives him greater pleasure to kill on his own native island i do not know major all i know is that food and sleep the sunshine women and wine all these are nothing and less than nothing to the dark one again louki crossed himself he obeys me for i am the steward of the vlachos family but even i am afraid of him to kill to keep on killing then kill again that is the very breath of his being louki stopped momentarily sniffed the air like a hound seeking some fugitive scent then kicked the snow off his boots and struck off up the hill at a tangent the little mans unhesitating sureness of direction was uncanny how far to go now louki two hundred yards major no more louki blew some snow off his heavy dark moustache and swore i shall not be sorry to arrive nor i mallory thought of the miserable draughty shelter in the dripping rocks almost with affection it was becoming steadily colder as they climbed out of the valley and the wind was rising climbing up the register with a steady moaning whine they had to lean into it now push hard against it to make any progress suddenly both men stopped listened looked at each other heads bent against the driving snow around them there was only the white emptiness and the silence there was no sign of what had caused the sudden sound you heard something too mallory murmured it is only i mallory spun round as the deep voice boomed out behind him and the bulky whitesmocked figure loomed out of the snow a milk wagon on a cobbled street is as nothing compared to yourself and your friend here but the snow muffled your voices and i could not be sure mallory looked at him curiously how come youre here andrea wood andrea explained i was looking for firewood i was high up on kostos at sunset when the snow lifted for a moment i could have sworn i saw an old hut in a gully not far from here it was dark and square against the snow so i left you are right louki interrupted the hut of old leri the mad one leri was a goatherd we all warned him but len would listen and speak to no man only to his goats he died in his hut in a landslide it is an ill wind andrea murmured old leri will keep us warm tonight he checked abruptly as the gully opened up at his feet then dropped quickly to the bottom surefooted as a mountain sheep he whistled twice a double highpitched note listened intently into the snow for the answering whistle walked swiftly up the gully casey brown gun lowered met them at the entrance to the cave and held back the canvas screen to let them pass inside the smoking tallow candle guttering heavily to one side in the icy draught filled every corner of the cave with dark and flickering shadows from its erratic flame the candle itself was almost gone the dripping wick bending over tiredly till it touched the rock and louki snowsuit cast aside was lighting another stump of candle from the dying flame for a moment both candles flared up together and mallory saw louki clearly for the first time a small compact figure in a darkblue jacket blackbraided at the seams and flamboyantly frogged at the breast the jacket tightly bound to his body by the crimson tsanta or cummerbund and above the swarthy smiling face the magnificent moustache that he flaunted like a banner a laughing cavalier of a man a miniature dartagnan splendidly behung with weapons and then mallorys gaze travelled up to the lined liquid eyes eyes dark and sad and permanent ly tired and his shock a slow uncomprehending shock had barely time to register before the stub of the candle had flared up and died and louki had sunk back into the shadows stevens was stretched in a sleepingbag his breathing harsh and shallow and quick he had been awake when they had arrived but had refused all food and drink and turned away and drifted off into an uneasy jerky sleep he seemed to be suffering no pain at all now a bad sign mallory thought bleakly the worst possible he wished miller would return casey brown washed down the last few crumbs of bread with a mouthful of wine rose stiffly to his feet pulled the screen aside and peered out mournfully at the falling snow he shuddered let the canvas fall lifted up his transmitter and shrugged into the shoulder straps gathered up a coil of nope a torch and a groundsheet mallory looked at his watch it was fifteen minutes to midnight the routine call from cairo was ahnost due going to have another go casey i wouldnt send a dog out on a night like this neither would i brown said morosely but i think id better sir reception is far better at night and im going to climb uphill a bit to get a clearance from that damned mountain there id be spotted right away if i tried to do that in daylight right you are casey you know best mallory looked at him curiously whats all the extra gear for putting the set under the groundsheet then getting below it myself with the torch brown explained and im pegging the rope here going to pay it out on my way up id like to be able to get back some time good enough mallory approved just watch it a bit higher up this gully narrows and deepens into a regular ravine dont you worry about me sir brown said firmly nothings going to happen to casey brown a snowladen gust of wind the flap of the canvas and brown was gone well if brown can do it mallory was on his feet now pulling his snowsmock over his head fuel gentlemen old leris hut whos for a midnight stroll andrea and louki were on their feet together but mallory shook his head ones enough i think someone should stay to look after stevens hes sound asleep andrea murmured he can come to no harm in the short time we are away i wasnt thinking of that its just that we cant take the chance of him falling into german hands theyd make him talk one way or another it would be no fault of his but theyd make him talk its too much of a risk pouf louki snapped his fingers you worry about nothing major there isnt a german within miles of here you have my word mallory hesitated then grinned youre right im getting the jumps he bent over stevens shook him gently the boy stirred and moaned opened his eyes slowly were going out for some firewood mallory said back in a few minutes you be ok of course sir what can happen just leave a gun by my side and blow out the candle he smiled be sure to call out before you come in mallory stooped blew out the candle for an instant the flame flared then died and every feature every perv son in the cave was swallowed up in the thick darkness of a winter midnight abruptly mallory turned on his heel and pushed out through the canvas into the drifting windblown snow already filling up the floor of the gully andrea and louki close behind it took them ten minutes to find the ruined hut of the old goatherd another five for andrea to wrench the door off its shattered hinges and smash it up to manageable lengths along with the wood from the bunk and table another ten to carry back with them to the rockshelter as much wood as they could conveniently rope together and carry the wind blowing straight north off kostos was in their faces now faces numbed with the chill wet lash of the driving snow and blowing almost at gale force they were not sorry to reach the gully again drop down gratefully between the sheltering walls mallory called softly at the mouth of the cave there was no reply no movement from inside he called again listened intently as the silent seconds went by turned his head and looked briefly at andrea and louki carefully he laid his bundle of wood in the snow pulled out his colt and torch eased aside the curtain lamp switch and colt safetycatch clicking as one the spotlight beam lit up the floor at the mouth of the cave passed on settled wavered probed into the farthest corner of the shelter returned again to the middle of the cave and steadied there as if the torch were clamped in a vise on the floor there was only a crumpled empty sleepingbag andy stevens was gone chapter tuesday night so i was wrong andrea murmured he wasnt asleep he certainly wasnt mallory agreed grimly he fooled me too and he heard what i said his mouth twisted he knows now why were so anxious to look after him he knows now that he was right when he spoke about a millstone i should hate to feel the way he must be feeling right now andrea nodded it is not difficult to guess why he has gone mallory looked quickly at his watch pushed his way out of the cave twenty minutes he cant have been gone more than twenty minutes probably a bit less to make sure we were well clear he can only drag himself fifty yards at the most well find him in four minutes use your torches and take the hoods off nobody will see us in this damn blizzard fan out uphill ill take the gully in the middle uphill loukis hand was on his arm his voice puzzled but his leg uphill i said mallory broke in impatiently stevens has brains and a damn sight more guts than he thinks we credit him with hell figure well think hes taken the easy way mallory paused a moment then went on sombrely any dying man who drags himself out in this lot is going to do nothing the easy way come on they found him in exactly three minutes he must have suspected that mallory wouldnt fall for the obvious or he had heard them stumbling up the slope for he had managed to burrow his way in behind the overhanging snowdrift that sealed off the space beneath a projecting ledge just above the rim of the gully an almost perfect place of concealment but his leg betrayed him in the probing light of his torch andreas sharp eyes caught the tiny trickle of blood seeping darkly through the surface of the snow he was already unconscious when they uncovered him from cold or exhaustion or the agony of his shattered leg probably from all three back in the cave again mallory tried to pour some ouzo the fiery breathcatching local spirit down ste venss throat he had a vague suspicion that this might be dangerous or perhaps it was only dangerous in cases of shock his memory was confused on that point but it seemed better than nothing stevens gagged spluttered and coughed most of it back up again but some at least stayed down with andreas help mallory tightened the loosened splints on the leg staunched the oozing blood and spread below and above the boy every dry covering he could find in the cave then he sat back tiredly and fished out a cigarette from his waterproof case there was nothing more he could do until dusty miller returned with panayis from the village he was pretty sure that there was nothing that dusty could do for stevens either there was nothing anybody could do for him already louki had a fire burning near the mouth of the cave the old tinderdry wood blazing up in a fierce crackling blaze with hardly a wisp of smoke almost at once its warmth began to spread throughout the cave and the three men edged gratefully nearer from half a dozen points in the roof thin steadilyincreasing streams of water from the melting snows above began to splash down on the gravelly floor beneath with these and with the heat of the blaze the ground was soon a quagmire but especially to mallory and andrea these discomforts were a small price to pay for the privilege of being warm for the first time in over thirty hours mallory felt the glow seep through him like a benison felt his entire body relax his eyelids grow heavy and drowsy back propped against the wall he was just drifting off to sleep still smoking that first cigarette when there was a gust of wind a sudden chilling flurry of snow and brown was inside the cave wearily slipping the transmitter straps from his shoulders lugubrious as ever his tired eyes lit up momentarily at the sight of the fire bluefaced and shuddering with cold no joke mallory thought grimly squatting motionless for half an hour on that bleak and frozen hillside he hunched down silently by the fire dragged out the inevitable cigarette and gazed moodily into the flames oblivious alike of the clouds of steam that almost immediately enveloped him of the acrid smell of his singeing clothes he looked utterly despondent mallory reached for a bottle poured out some of the heated retsimo mainland wine heavily reinforced with resin and passed it across to brown chuck it straight down the hatch mallory advised that way you wont taste it he prodded the transmitter with his foot and looked up at brown again no dice this time either raised them no bother sir brown grimaced at the sticky sweetness of the wine reception was first class both here and in cairo you got through mallory sat up leaned forward eagerly and were they pleased to hear from their wandering boys tonight they didnt say the first thing they told me was to shut up and stay that way brown poked moodily at the fire with a steaming boot dont ask me how sir but theyve been tipped off that enough equipment for two or three small monitoring stations has been sent here in the past fortnight mallory swore monitoring stations thats damned handy that is he thought briefly of the fugitive nomad existence these same monitoring stations had compelled andrea and himself to lead in the white mountains of crete dammit casey on an island like this the size of a soup plate they can pinpoint us with their eyes shut aye they can that sir brown nodded heavily have you heard anything of these stations louki mallory asked nothing major nothing louki shrugged i am afraid i do not even know what you are talking about i dont suppose so not that it matters its too late now lets have the rest of the good news casey thats about it sir no sending for me by order restricted to code abbreviations affirmative negative repetitive wilco and suchlike continuous sending only in emergency or when concealments impossible anyway like from the condemned cell in these ducky little dungeons in navarone mallory murmured i died with my boots on ma with all respects sir thats not funny brown said morosely their invasion fleet mainly caiques and eboats sailed this morning from the piraeus he went on about four oclock this morning cairo expects theyll be holing up in the cyclades somewhere tonight thats very clever of cairo where the hell else could they hole up mallory lit a fresh cigarette and looked bleakly into the fire anyway its nice to know theyre on the way that the lot casey brown nodded silently good enough then thanks a lot for going out better turn in catch up with some sleep while you can louki reckons we should be down in margaritha before dawn hole up there for the day hes got some sort of abandoned well all lined up for us and push on to the town of navarone tomorrow night my god brown moaned tonight a leaking cave tomorrow night an abandoned well halffull of water probably where are we staying in navarone sir the crypt in the local cemetery a singularly apt lodging the way things are going mallory said dryly well hope for the best were leaving before five he watched brown lie down beside stevens and transferred his attention to louki the little man was seated on a box on the opposite side of the fire occasionally turning a heavy stone to be wrapped in cloth and put to stevenss numbed feet and blissfully hugging the flames by and by he became aware of mallorys close scrutiny and looked up you look worried major louki seemed vexed you look what is the word concerned you do not like my plan no i thought we had agreed im not worried about your plan mallory said frankly im not even worried about you its that box youre sitting on enough he in it to blow up a battleship and youre only three feet from that fire its not just too healthy louki louki shifted uneasily on his seat tugged at one end of his moustache i have heard that you can throw this tnt into a fire and that it just burns up nicely like a pine full of sap true enough mallory acquiesced you can also bend it break it file it saw it jump on it and hit it with a sledgehammer and all youll get is the benefit of the exercise but if it starts to sweat in a hot humid atmosphere and then the exudation crystallises oh brother and its getting far too hot and sticky in this hole outside with it louki was on his feet backing farther into the cave outside with it he hesitated unless the snow the moisture you can also leave it immersed in salt water for ten years without doing it any harm mallory interrupted didactically but there are some primers there that might come to grief not to mention that box of detonators beside andrea well just stick the lot outside under a cape pouf louki has a far better idea the little man was already slipping into his cloak old leris hut the very place exactly we can pick it up there whenever we want and if you have to leave here in a hurry you do not have to worry about it before mallory could protest louki had bent over the box lifted it with an effort halfwalked halfstaggered round the fire making for the screen he had hardly taken three steps when andrea was by his side had relieved him firmly of the box and tucked it under one arm if you will permit me no no louki was affronted i can manage easily it is nothing i know i know andrea said pacifically but these explosives they must be carried a certain way i have been trained he explained so i did not realise of course it must be as you say i then will bring the detonators honour satisfied louki thankfully gave up the argument lifted the little box and scuffled out of the cave close on andreas heels mallory looked at his watch one oclock exactly miller and panayis should be back soon he thought the wind had passed its peak and the snow was almost gone the going would be all that easier but there would be tracks in the snow awkward these tracks but not fatal they themselves would be gone before light cutting straight downhill for the foot of the valley the snow wouldnt lie there and even if there were patches they could take to the stream that wound through the valley leaving no trace behind the fire was sinking and the cold creeping in on them again mallory shivered in his still wet clothes threw some more wood on the fire watched it blaze up and flood the cave with light brown huddled on a groundsheet was already asleep stevens his back to him was lying motionless his breathing short and quick god only knew how long the boy would stay alive he was dying miller said but dying was a very indefinite term when a man a terribly injured dying man made up his mind not to die he became the toughest most enduring creature on earth mallory had seen it happen before but maybe stevens didnt want to live to live to overcome these desperate injuries that would be to prove himself to himself and to others and he was young enough and sensitive enough and had been hurt and had suffered so much in the past that that could easily be the most important thing in the world to him on the other hand he knew what an appalling handicap he had become he had heard mallory say so he knew too that mallorys primary concern was not for his welfare but the fear that he would be captured crack under pressure and tell everything he bad heard mallory say so and he knew that he had failed his mends it was all very difficult impossible to say how the balance of contending forces would work out eventually mallory shook his head sighed lit a fresh cigarette and moved closer to the fire andrea and louki returned less than five minutes later and miller and panayis were almost at their heels they could hear miller coming some distance away slipping falling and swearing almost continuously as he struggled up the gully under a large and awkward load he practically fell across the threshold of the cave and collapsed wearily by the fire he gave the impression of a man who had been through a very great deal indeed mallory grinned sympathetically at him well dusty how did it go hope panayis here didnt slow you up too much miller didnt seem to hear him he was gazing incredulously at the fire lantern jaw dropping open as its significance slowly dawned on him hells teeth would you look at that he swore bitterly here i spend half the gawddamned night climbing up a gawddamned mountain with a stove and enough kerosene to bath a bloody elephant and what do i find he took a deep breath to tell them what he found then subsided into a strangled seething silence a man your age should watch his blood pressure mallory advised how did the rest of it go okay i guess miller had a mug of ouzo in his hand and was beginning to brighten up again we got the beddin the medicine kit if youll give me the bedding i will get our young friend into it now andrea interrupted and food mallory asked yeah we got the grub boss stacks of it this guy panayis is a wonder bread wine goatcheese garlic sausages rice everything rice it was mallorys turn to be incredulous but you cant get the stuff in the islands nowadays dusty panayis can miller was enjoying himself hugely now he got it from the german commandants kitchen guy by the name of skoda the german commandants youre joking so help me boss thats gospel truth miller drained half the ouzo at a gulp and expelled his breath in a long gusty sigh of satisfaction little ol miller hangs around the back door knees knockin like carmen mirandas castanets ready for a smart take off in any direction while junior here goes in and cracks the joint back home in the states hed make a fortune as a catburglar comes back in about ten minutes luggin that damned suitcase there miller indicated it with a casual wave of his hand not only cleans out the commandants pantry but also borrows his satchel to carry the stuff in i tell you boss associatin with this character gives me heart attacks but but how about guards about sentries taken the night off i guess boss old panayis is like a clam never says a word and even then i cant understand him my guess is that everybodys out lookin for us there and back and you didnt meet a soul mallory filled him a mug of wine nice going dusty panayiss doin not mine i just tagged along besides we did run into a couple of panayiss pals he hunted them up rather musta given him the tipoff about somethin he was hoppin with excitement just afterwards tried to tell me all about it miller shrugged his shoulders sadly we werent operatin on the same wavelength boss mallory nodded across the cave louki and panayis were close together louki doing all the listening while panayis talked rapidly in a low voice gesticulating with both hands hes still pretty worked up about something mallory said thoughtfully he raised his voice whats the matter louki matter enough major louki tugged ferociously at the end of his moustache we will have to be leaving soon panayis wants to go right away he has heard that the german garrison is going to make a housetohouse check in our village during the night about four oclock panayis was told not a routine check i take it mallory asked this has not happened for many months they must think that you have slipped their patrols and are hiding in the village louki chuckled if you ask me i dont think they know what to think it is nothing to you of course you will not be there and even if you were they would not find you and it will make it all the safer for you to come to margaritha afterwards but panayis and i we must not be found out of our beds things would go hard with us of course of course we must take no risks but there is plenty of time you will go down in an hour but first the fortress he dug into his breast pocket brought out the map eugene vlachos had drawn for him turned to panayis and slipped easily into the island greek come panayis i hear you know the fortress as louki here knows his own vegetable patch i already know much but i want you to tell me everything about it the layout guns magazines power rooms barracks sentries guard routine exits alarm systems even where the shadows are deep and the others less deep just everything no matter how tiny and insignificant the dotails may seem to you nevertheless you must tell me if a door opens outwards instead of inwards you must tell me that could savea thousand lives and how does the major mean to get inside louki asked i dont know yet i cannot decide until i have seen the fortress mallory was aware of andrea looking sharply at him then looking away they had made their plans on the mtb for entering the fortress but it was the keystone upon which everything depended and mallory felt that this knowledge should be confined to the fewest number possible for almost half an hour mallory and the three greeks huddled over the chart in the light of the flames mallory checking on what he had been told meticulously pencilling in all the fresh information that panayis had to give him and panayis had a very great deal to tell it seemed almost impossible that a man could have assimilated so much in two brief visits to the fortress and clandestine visits in the darkness at that he had an incredible eye and capacity for detail and it was a burning hatred of the germans mallory felt certain that bad imprinted these details on an all but photographic memory mallory could feel his hopes rising with every second that passed casey brown was awake again tired though he was the babble of voices had cut through an uneasy sleep he crossed over to where andy stevens halfawake now lay propped against the wall talking rationally at times incoherently at others there was nothing for him to do there brown saw miller cleaning dusting and rebandaging the wounds had had all the help he needed and very efficient help at that from andrea he moved over to the mouth of the cave listened blankly to the four men talking in greek moved out past the screen for a breath of the cold clean night air with seven people inside the cave and the fire burning continuously the lack of almost all ventilation had made it uncomfortably warm he was back in the cave in thirty seconds drawing the screen tightly shut behind him quiet everybody he whispered softly he gestured behind him theres something moving out there down the slope a bit i heard it twice sir panayis swore softly twisted to his feet like a wild cat a footlong twoedged throwing knife gleamed evilly in his hand and he had vanished through the canvas screen before anyone could speak andrea made to follow him but mallory stretched out his hand stay where you are andrea our friend panayis is just that little bit too precipitate he said softly there may be nothing or it might be some diversionary move oh damn stevens had just started babbling to himself in a loud voice he would start talking now cant you do something but andrea was already bent over the sick boy holding his hand in his own smoothing the hot forehead and hair with his free hand and talking to him soothingly softly conthuously at first he paid no attention kept on talking in a rambling inconsequential fashion about nothing in particular gradually however the hypnotic effect of the stroking hand the gentle caressing murmur took effect and the babbling died away to a barely audible muttering ceased altogether suddenly his eyes opened and he was awake and quite rational what is it andrea why are you shh mallory held up his hand i can hear someone its panayis sir brown had his eye at a crack in the curtain just moving up the gully seconds later panayis was inside the cave squatting down by the fire he looked thoroughly disgusted there is no one there he reported some goats i saw down the bill but that was all mallory translated to the others didnt sound like goats to me brown said doggedly different kind of sound altogether i will take a look andrea volunteered just to make sure but i do not think the dark one would make a mistake before mallory could say anything he was gone as quickly and silently as panayis he was back in three minutes shaking his head panayis is right there is no one i did not even see the goats and thats what it must have been casey mallory said still i dont like it snow almost stopped wind dropping and the valley probably swarming with german patrols i think its time you two were away for gods sake be careful if anyone tries to stop you shoot to kill theyll blame it on us anyway shoot to kill louki laughed dryly unnecessary advice major when the dark one is with us he never shoots any other way right away you go damned sorry youve got yourselves mixed up in all this but now that you are a thousand thanks for all youve done see you at halfpast six halfpast six louki echoed the olive grove on the bank of the stream south of the village we will be waiting there two minutes later they were lost to sight and sound and all was still inside the cave again except for the faint crackling of the embers of the dying fire brown had moved out on guard and stevens had already fallen into a restless painfilled sleep miller bent over him for a moment or two then moved softly across the cave to mallory his right hand held a crumpled heap of bloodstained bandages he held them out towards mallory take a sniff at that boss he asked quietly easy does it mallory bent forward drew away sharply his nose wrinkled in immediate disgust good lord dusty thats vile he paused paused in sure sick certainty he knew the answer before he spoke what on earth is it gangrene miller sat down heavily by his side threw the bandages into the fire all at once he sounded tired defeated gas gangrene spreadin like a forest fire and he would have died anyway im just wastin my time chapter tuesday night the germans took them just after four oclock in the morning while they were still asleep bonetired and deepdrugged with this sleep as they were they had no chance not the slightest hope of offering any resistance the conception timing and execution of the coup were immaculate surprise was complete andrea was the first awake some alien whisper of sound had reached deep down to that part of him that never slept and he twisted round and elbowed himself off the ground with the same noiseless speed as his hand reached out for his readycocked and loaded mauser but the white beam of the powerful torch lancing through the blackness of the cave bad blinded him frozen his stretching hand even before the clipped bite of command from the man who held the torch still all of you faultless english with barely a trace of accent and the voice glacial in its menace you move and you die another torch switched on a third and the cave was flooded with light wide awake now and motionless mallory squinted painfully into the dazzling beams in the backwash of reflected light he could just discern the vague formless shapes crouched in the mouth of the cave bent over the dulled barrels of automatic rifles hands clasped above the heads and backs to the wall a certainty an assured competence in the voice that made for instant obedience take a good look at them sergeant almost conversational now the tone but neither torch nor gun barrel had wavered a fraction no shadow of expression in their faces not even a flicker of the eyes dangerous men sergeant the english choose their killers well mallory felt the grey bitterness of defeat wash through him in an almost tangible wave he could taste the sourness of it in the back of his mouth for a brief heartsickening second he allowed himself to think of what must now inevitably happen and as soon as the thought had come he thrust it savagely away everything every action every thought every breath must be on the present hope was gone but not irrecoverably gone not so long as andrea lived he wondered if casey brown had seen or heard them coming and what had happened to him he made to ask checked himself just in time maybe he was still at large how did you manage to find us mallory asked quietly only fools burn juniper wood the officer said contemptuously we have been on kostos all day and most of the night a dead man could have smelt it on kostos miner shook his head how could enough the officer turned to someone behind him tear down that screen he ordered in german and keep us covered on either side he looked back into the cave gestured almost imperceptibly with his torch all right you three outside and you had better be careful please believe me that my men are praying for an excuse to shoot you down you murdering swine the venomous hatred in his voice carried utter conviction slowly hands still clasped above their heads the three men stumbled to their feet mallory had taken only one step when the whiplash of the germans voice brought him up short stop he stabbed the beam of his torch down at the unconscious stevens gestured abruptly at andrea one side you who is this you need not fear from him mallory said quietly he is one of us but he is terribly injured he is dying we will see the officer said tightly move to the back of the cave he waited until the three men had stepped over stevens changed his automatic rifle for a pistol dropped to his knees and advanced slowly torch in one hand gun in the other well below the line of fire of the two soldiers who advanced unbidden at his heels there was an inevitability a cold professionalism about it all that made mallorys heart sink abruptly the officer reached out his gunhand tore the covers off the boy a shuddering tremor shook the whole body his head rolied from side to side as he moaned in unconscious agony the officer bent quickly over him the hard clean lines of the face the fair hair beneath the hood highlit in the beam of his own torch a quick look at stevenss paintwisted emaciated features a glance at the shattered leg a brief distasteful wrinkling of the nose as he caught the foul stench of the gangrene and he had hunched back on his heels gently replacing the covers over the sick boy you speak the truth he said softly we are not barbarians i have no quarrel with a dying man leave him there he rose to his feet walked slowly backwards the rest of you outside the snow had stopped altogether mallory saw and stars were beginning to twinkle in the clearing sky the wind too had fallen away and was perceptibly warmer most of the snow would be gone by midday mallory guessed carelessly incuriously he looked around him there was no sign of casey brown inevitably mallorys hopes began to rise petty officer browns recommendation for this operation had come from the very top two rows of ribbons to which he was entitled but never wore bespoke his gallantry he had a formidable reputation as a guerrilla fighter and he had had an automatic rifle in his hand if he were somewhere out there almost as if he had divined his hopes the german smashed them at a word you wonder where your sentry is perhaps he asked mockingly never fear englishman he is not far from here asleep at his post very sound asleep im afraid youve killed him mallorys hands clenched until his palms ached the other shrugged his shoulder in vast indifference i really couldnt say it was all too easy one of my men lay in the gully and moaned a masterly performance really pitiable he almost had me convinced like a fool your man came to investigate i had another man waiting above the barrel of his rifle in his hand a very effective club i assure you slowly mallory unclenched his fists and stared bleakly down the gully of course casey would fall for that he was bound to after what had happened earlier in the night he wasnt going to make a fool of himself again cry wolf twice in succession inevitably he had gone to check first suddenly the thought occurred to mallory that maybe casey brown had heard something earlier on but the thought vanished as soon as it had come panayis did not look like the man to make a mistake and andrea never made a mistake mallory turned back to the officer again well where do we go from here margaritha and very shortly but one thing first the german his own height to an inch stood squarely in front of him levelled revolver at waist height switchedoff torch dangling loosely from his right hand just a little thing englishman where are the explosives he almost spat the words out explosives mallory furrowed his brow in perplexity what explosives be asked blankly then staggered and fell to the ground as the heavy torch swept round in a vicious halfcircle caught him flush on the side of the face dizzily he shook his head and climbed slowly to his feet again the explosives the torch was balanced in the hand again the voice silky and gentle i asked you where they were i dont know what you are talking about mallory spat out a broken tooth wiped some blood off his smashed lips is this the way the germans treat their prisoners he asked contemptuously shut up again the torch lashed out mallory was waiting for it rode the blow as best he could even so the torch caught him heavily high up on the cheekbone just below the temple stunning him with its jarring impact seconds passed then he pushed himself slowly off the snow the whole side of his face afire with agony his vision blurred and unfocused we fight a clean war the officer was breathing heavily in barely controlled fury we fight by the geneva conventions but these are for soldiers not for murdering spies we are no spies mallory interrupted he felt as if his head was coming apart then where are your uniforms the officer demanded spies i say murdering spies who stab in the back and cut mens throats the voice was trembling with anger mallory was at a loss nothing spurious about this indignation cut mens throats he shook his head in bewilderment what the heli are you talking about my own batman a harmless messenger a boy only and he wasnt even armed we found him only an hour ago ach i waste my time he broke off as he turned to watch two men coming up the gully mallory stood motionless for a moment cursing the ifi luck that had led the dead man across the path of panayis it could have been no one else then turned to see what had caught the officers attention he focused his aching eyes with difficulty looked at the bent figure struggling up the slope urged on by the ungentle prodding of a bayoneted rifle mallory let go a long silent breath of relief the left side of browns face was caked with blood from a gash above the temple but he was otherwise unharmed right sit down in the snow all of you he gestured to several of his men bind their hands you are going to shoot us now perhaps mallory asked quietly it was suddenly desperately urgent that he should know there was nothing they could do but die but at least they could die on their feet fighting but if they werent to die just yet almost any later opportunity for resistance would be less suicidal than this not yet unfortunately my section commander in margaritha hauptmann skoda wishes to see you first maybe it would be better for you if i did shoot you now then the herr kommandant in navarone officer commanding of the whole island the german smiled thinly but only a postponement englishman you will be kicking your heels before the sun sets we have a short way with spies in navarone but sir captain hands raised in appeal andrea took a step forward brought up short as two rifle muzzles ground into his chest not captain lieutenant the officer corrected him oberleutnant turzig at your service what is it you want fat one he asked contemptuously spies you said spies i am no spy the words rushed and tumbled over one another as if he could not get them out fast enough before god i am no spy i am not one of them the eyes were wide and staring the mouth working soundlessly between the gaspedout sentences i am only a greek a poor greek they forced me to come along as an interpreter i swear it lieutenant turzig i swear it you yellow bastard miller ground out viciously then grunted in agony as a rifie butt drove into the small of his back just above the kidney he stumbled fell forward on his hands and knees realised even as he fell that andrea was only playing a part that mallory had only to speak half a dozen words in greek to expose andreas lie miller twisted on his side in the snow shook his fist weakly and hoped that the contorted pain on his face might be mistaken for fury you twofaced doublecrossing dago you gawddamned swine ill get you there was a hollow sickening thud and miller collapsed in the snow the heavy skiboot had caught him just behind the ear mallory said nothing he did not even glance at miller fists balled helplessly at his sides and mouth compressed he glared steadily at andrea through narrowed slits of eyes he knew the lieutenant was watching him felt he must back andrea up all the way what andrea intended he could not even begin to guess but he would back him to the end of the world so turzig murmured thoughtfully thieves fall out eh mallory thought he detected the faintest overtones of doubt of hesitancy in his voice but the lieutenant was taking no chances no matter fat one you have cast your lot with these assassins what is it the english say you have made your bed you must lie on it he looked at andreas vast bulk dispassionately we may need to strengthen a special gallows for you no no no andreas voice rose sharply fearfully on the last word it is true what i tell you i am not one of them lieutenant turzig before god i am not one of them he swung his hands in distress his great moonface contorted in anguish why must i die for no fault of my own i didnt want to come i am no fighting man lieutenant turzig i can see that turzig said dryly a monstrous deal of skin to cover a quivering jellybag your size and every inch of it precious to you he looked at mallory and at miller still lying face down in the snow i cannot congratulate your friends on their choice of companion i can tell you everything lieutenant i can tell you everything andrea pressed forward excitedly eager to consolidate his advantage to reinforce the beginnings of doubt i am no friend of the allies i will prove it to you and then perhaps you damned judas mallory made to fling himself forward but two burly soldiers caught him and pointed his arms from behind he struggled briefly then relaxed looked balefully at andrea if you dare to open your mouth i promise you youll never live to be quiet turzigs voice was very cold i have had enough of recriminations of cheap melodrama another word and you join your friend in the snow there he looked at him a moment in silence then swung back to andrea i promise nothing i will hear what you have to say he made no attempt to disguise the repugnance in his voice you must judge for yourself a nice mixture of relief earnestness and the dawn of hope of returning confidence andrea paused a minute and gestured dramatically at mallory miller and brown these are no ordinary soldiers they are jellicoes men of the special boat service tell me something i couldnt have guessed myself turzig growled the english earl has been a thorn in our flesh these many months past if that is all you have to tell me fat one wait andrea held up his hand they are stili no ordinary men but a specially picked force an assault unit they call themselves flown last sunday night from alexandria to casteirosso they left that same night from castelrosso in a motorboat a torpedo boat turzig nodded so much we know already go on you know already but how never mind how hurry up of course lieutenant of course not a twitch in his face betrayed andreas relief this had been the only dangerous point in his story nicolai of course had warned the germans but never thought it worth while mentioning the presence of a giant greek in the party no reason of course why he should have selected him for special mention but if he had done so it would have been the end the torpedo boat landed them somewhere in the islands north of rhodes i do not know where there they stole a caique sailed it up through turkish waters met a big german patrol boat and sunk it andrea paused for effect i was less than hail a mile away at the time in my fishing boat turzig leaned forward how did they manage to sink so big a boat strangely he didnt doubt that it had been sunk they pretended to be harmless fishermen like myself i had just been stopped investigated and cleared andrea said virtuously anyway your patrol boat came alongside this old caique close alongside suddenly there were guns firing on both sides two boxes went flying through the air into the engineroom of your boat i think pouf andrea threw up his hands draniatically that was the end of that we wondered turzig said softly well go on you wondered what lieutenant turzigs eyes narrowed and andrea hurried on their interpreter had been killed in the fight they tricked me into speaking english i spent many years in cyprus kidnapped me let my sons sail the boat why should they want an interpreter turzig demanded suspiciously there are many british officers who speak greek i am coming to that andrea said impatiently how in gods name do you expect me to finish my story if you keep interrupting all the time where was i ah yes they forced me to come along and their engine broke down i dont know what happened i was kept below i think we were in a creek somewhere repairing the engine and then there was a wild bout of drinking you will not believe this lieutenant turzig that men on so desperate a mission should get drunk and then we sailed again on the contrary i do believe you turzig was nodding his head slowly as if in secret understanding i believe you indeed you do andrea contrived to look disappointed well we ran into a fearful storm wrecked the boat on the south cliff of this island and climbed stop turzig had drawn back sharply suspicion flaring in his eyes almost i believed you i believed you because we know more than you think and so far you have told the truth but not now you are clever fat one but not so clever as you think one thing you have forgotten or maybe you do not know we are of the wurttembergische gebirgsbataillon we know mountains my friend better than any troops in the world i myself am a prussian but i have climbed everything worth climbing in the alps and transylvania and i tell you that the south cliff cannot be climbed it is impossible impossible perhaps for you andrea shook his head sadly these cursed allies will beat you yet they are clever lieutenant turzig damnably clever explain yourself turzig ordered curtly just this they knew men thought the south cliff could not be climbed so they determined to climb it you would never dream that this could be done that an expedition could land on navarone that way but the allies took a gamble found a man to lead the expedition he could not speak greek but that did not matter for what they wanted was a man who could climb and so they picked the greatest rockclimber in the world today andrea paused for effect flung out his arm dramatically and this is the man they picked lieutenant turzig you are a mountaineer yourself and you are bound to know him his name is mallory keith mallory of new zealand there was a sharp exclamation the click of a switch and turzig had taken a couple of steps forward thrust the torch almost into mallorys eyes for almost ten seconds he stared into the new zealanders averted screwedup face then slowly lowered his arm the harsh spotlight limning a dazzling white circle in the snow at his feet once twice half a dozen times turzig nodded his head in slow understanding of course he murmured mallory keith mallory of course i know him theres not a man in my abteilung but has heard of keith mallory he shook his head i should have known him i should have known him at once he stood for some time with his head bent aimlessly screwing the toe of his right boot into the soft snow then looked up abruptly before the war even during it i would have been proud to have known you glad to have met you but not here not now not any more i wish to god they had sent someone else he hesitated made to carry on then changed his mind turned wearily to andrea my apologies fat one indeed you speak the truth go on certainly andreas round moon face was one vast smirk of satisfaction we climbed the cliff as i said although the boy in the cave there was badly hurt and silenced the guard mallory killed him andrea added unblushingly it was fair fight we spent most of the night crossing the divide and found this cave before dawn we were almost dead with hunger and cold we have been here since and nothing has happened since on the contrary andrea seemed to be enjoying himself hugely revelling in being the focus of attention two people came up to see us who they were i do not know they kept their faces hidden all the time nor do i know where they came from it is as well that you admitted that turzig said grimly i knew someone had been here i recognised the stove it belongs to hauptmann skoda indeed andrea raised his eyebrows in polite surprise i did not know well they talked for some time and did you manage to overhear anything they were talking about turzig interrupted the question came so naturally so spontaneously that mallory held his breath it was beautifully done andrea would walk into it he couldnt help it but andrea was a man inspired that night overhear them andrea clamped his lips shut in sorelytried forbearance gazed heavenwards in exasperated appeal lieutenant turzig how often must i tell you that i am the interpreter they could only talk through me of course i know what they were talking about they are going to blow up the big guns in the harbour i didnt think they had come here for their health turzig said acidly ah but you dont know that they have the plans of the fortress you dont know that kheros is to be invaded on saturday morning you dont know that they are in radio contact with cairo all the time you dont know that destroyers of the british navy are coming through the maidos straits on friday night as soon as the big guns have been silenced you dont know enough turzig clapped his hands together his face alight with excitement the royal navy eh wonderful wonderful that is what we want to hear but enough keep it for hauptmann skoda and the commandant in the fortress we must be off but first one more thing the explosives where are they andreas shoulders slumped in dejection he spread out his arms palms upward alas lieutenant turzig i do not know they took them out and hid them some talk about the cave being too hot he waved a hand towards the western col in the diametrically opposite direction to leris hut that way i think but i cannot be sure for they would not tell me he looked bitterly at mallory these britishens are all the same they trust nobody heaven only knows that i dont blame them for that turzig said feelingly he looked at andrea in disgust more than ever i would like to see you dangling from the highest scaffold in navarone but herr kommandant in the town is a kindly man and rewards informers you may yet live to betray some more comrades thank you thank you thank you i knew you were fair and just i promise you lieutenant turzig shut up turzig said contemptuously he switched into german sergeant have these men bound and dont forget the fat one later we can untie him and he can carry the sick man to the post leave a man on guard the rest of you come with me we must find those explosives could we not make one of them tell us sir the sergeant ventured the only man who would tell us cant hes already told us all he knows as for the rest well i was mistaken about them sergeant he turned to mallory inclined his head briefly spoke in english an error of judgment herr mallory we are all very tired i am almost sorry i struck you he wheeled abruptly climbed swiftly up the bank two minutes later only a solitary soldier was left on guard for the tenth time mallory shifted his position uncomfortably strained at the cord that bound his hands together behind his back for the tenth time recognised the futility of both these actions no matter how he twisted and turned the wet snow soaked icily through his clothes until he was chilled to the bone and shaking continually with the cold and the man who had tied these knots had known his job all too well mallory wondered irritably if turzig and his men meant to spend all night searching for the explosives they had been gone for more than half an hour already he relaxed lay back on his side in the cushioning snow of the gully bank and looked thoughtfully at andrea who was sitting upright just in front of him he had watched andrea with bowed head and hunched and lifting shoulders making one single titanic effort to free himself seconds after the guard had gestured to them to sit down had seen the cords bite and gouge until they had almost disappeared in his flesh the fractional slump of his shoulders as he gave up since then the giant greek had sat quite still and contented himself with scowling at the sentry in the injured fashion of one who has been grievously wronged that solitary test of the strength of his bonds had been enough oberleutnant turzig had keen eyes and swollen chafed and bleeding wrists would have accorded ill with the character andrea had created for himself a masterly creation mallory mused all the more remarkable for its spontaneity its improvisation andrea had told so much of the truth so much that was verifiable or could be verified that belief in the rest of his story followed almost automatically and at the same time he had told turzig nothing of importance nothing the germans could not have found out for themselves except the proposed evacuation of kheros by the navy wryly mallory remembered his dismay his shocked unbelief when he heard andrea telling of it but andrea had been far ahead of him there was a fair chance that the germans might have guessed anyway they would reason perhaps that an assault by the british on the guns of navarone at the same time as the german assault on kheros would be just that little bit too coincidental again escape for them all quite clearly depended upon how thoroughly andrea managed to convince his captors that he was all he claimed and the relative freedom of action that he could thereby gain and there was no doubt at all that it was the news of the proposed evacuation that had tipped the scales with turzig and the fact that andrea had given saturday as the invasion date would only carry all the more weight as that had been jensens original date obviously false information fed to his agents by german counterintelligence who had known it impossible to conceal the invasion preparations themselves and finally if andrea hadnt told turzig of the destroyers he might have failed to carry conviction they might all yet finish on the waiting gallows in the fortress the guns would remain intact and destroy the naval ships anyway it was all very complicated too complicated for the state his head was in mallory sighed and looked away from andrea towards the other two brown and a now conscious miller were both sitting upright hands bound behind their backs staring down into the snow occasionally shaking muzzy heads from side to side mallory could appreciate all too easily how they felt the whole righthand side of his face ached cruelly continuously nothing but aching broken heads everywhere mallory thought bitterly he wondered how andy stevens was feeling glanced idly past the sentry towards the dark mouth of the cave stiffened in sudden almost uncomprehending shock slowly with an infinitely careful carelessness he let his eyes wander away from the cave let them light indifferently on the sentry who sat on browns transmitter hunched watchfully over the schmeisser cradled on his knees finger crooked on the trigger pray god he doesnt turn round mallory said to himself over and over again pray god he doesnt turn round let him sit like that just for a little while longer only a little while longer in spite of himself mallory felt his gaze shifting being dragged back again towards that cavemouth andy stevens was coming out of the cave even in the dim starlight every movement was terribly piain as he inched forward agonisingly on chest and belly dragging his shattered leg behind him he was placing his hands beneath his shoulders levering himself upward and forward while his head dropped below his shoulders with pain and the exhaustion of the effort lowering himself slowly on the soft and sodden snow then repeating the same heartsapping process over and over again exbausted and painfilled as the boy might be mallory thought his mind was still working he bad a white sheet over his shoulders and back as camouflage against the snow and he carried a climbing spike in his right hand he must have heard at least some of tuizigs conversation there were two or three guns in the cave he could easily have shot the guard without coming out at all but he must have known that the sound of a shot would have brought the germans running bad them back at the cave long before he could have crawled across the gully far less cut loose any of his mends five yards stevens had to go mallory estimated five yards at the most deep down in the gully where they were the south wind passed them by was no more than a muted whisper in the night that apart there was no sound at all nothing but their own breathing the occasional stirring as someone stretched a cramped or frozen leg hes bound to hear him if he comes any closer mallory thought desperately even in that soft snow hes bound to hear him mallory bent his head began to cough loudly almost continuously the sentry looked at him in surprise first then in irritation as the coughing continued be quiet the sentry ordered in german stop that coughing at once husten hüsten coughing is it i cant help it mallory protested in english he coughed again louder more persistently than before it is your oberleutnants fault he gasped he has knocked out some of my teeth mallory broke into a fresh paroxysm of coughing recovered himself with an effort is it my fault that im choking on my own blood he demanded stevens was less than ten feet away now but his tiny reserves of strength were almost gone he could no longer raise himself to the full stretch of his arms was advancing only a few pitiful inches at a time at length he stopped altogether lay still for half a minute malory thought he had lost consciousness but by and by ho raised himself up again to the full stretch this time had just begun to pivot himself forward when he collapsed fell heavily in the snow mallory began to cough again but he was too late the sentry leapt off his box and whirled round all in one movement the evil mouth of the schmeisser lined up on the body almost at his feet then he relaxed as he realised who it was lowered the barrel of his gun so he said softly the fledgling has left its nest poor little fledgling mallory winced as he saw the backswing of the gun ready to smash down on ste venss defenceless head but the sentry was a kindly enough man his reaction had been purely automatic he arrested the swinging butt inches above the tortured face bent down and almost gently removed the spike from the feebly threatening hand sent it spinning over the edge of the gully then he lifted stevens carefully by the shoulders slid in the bunchedup sheet as pillow for the unconscious head against the bitter cold of the snow shook his head wonderingly sadly went back to his seat on the ammunition box hauptmann skoda was a small thin man in his late thirties neat dapper debonair and wholly evil there was something innately evil about the long corded neck that stretched up scrawnily above his padded shoulders something repellent about the incongruously small bullet head perched above when the thin bloodless lips parted in a smile which was often they revealed a perfect set of teeth far from lighting his face the smile only emphasised the sallow skin stretched abnormally taut across the sharp nose and high cheekbones puckered up the sabre scar that bisected the left cheek from eyebrow to chin and whether he smiled or not the pupils of the deepset eyes remained always the same stifi and black and empty even at that early hour it was not yet six oclock he was immaculately dressed freshly shaven the wetlygleaming hair thin dark heavily indented above the temples brushed straight back across his head seated behind a flattopped table the sole article of furniture in the benchlined guardroom only the upper half of his body was visible even so one instinctively knew that the crease of the trousers the polish of the jackboots would be beyond reproach he smiled often and he was smiling now as oberleutinant turzig finished his report leaning far back in his chair elbows on the armrests skoda steepled his lean fingers under his chin smiled benignly round the guardroom the lazy empty eyes missed nothing the guard at the door the two guards behind the bound prisoners andrea sitting on the bench where he had just laid stevens one lazy sweep of those eyes encompassed them all excellently done oberleutnant turzigl he purred most efficient really most efficient he looked speculatively at the three men standing before him at their bruised and bloodcaked faces switched his glance to stevens lying barely conscious on the bench smiled again and permitted himself a fractional lift of his eyebrows a little trouble perhaps turzig the prisoners were not too ahcooperative they offered no resistance sir no resistance at all turzig said stiffly the tone the manner were punctilious correct but the distaste the latent hostility were mirrored in his eyes my men were maybe a little onthusiastic we wanted to make no mistake quite right lieutenant quite right skoda murmured approvingly these are dangerous men and one cannot take chances with dangerous men he pushed back his chair rose easily to his feet strolled round the table and stopped in front of andrea except maybe this one lieutenant he is dangerous only to his friends turzig said shortly it is as i told you sir he would betray his mother to save his own skin and claiming friendship with us eh skoda asked musingly one of our gallant allies lieutenant skoda reached out a gentle hand brought it viciously down and across andreas cheek the heavy signet ring on his middle finger tearing skin and flesh andrea cried out in pain clapped one hand to his bleeding face and cowered away his right arm raised above his head in blind defence a notable addition to the armed forces of the third reich skoda murmured you were not mistaken lieutenant a poltroon the instinctive reaction of a hurt man is an infallible guide it is curious he mused how often very big men are thus part of natures compensatory process i suppose what is your name my brave friend papagos andrea muttered sullenly peter papagos he took his hand away from his cheek looked at it with eyes slowly widening with horror began to rub it across his trouser leg with jerky hurried movements the repugnance on his face plain for every man to see skoda watched him with amusement you do not like to see blood papagos eh he suggested especially your own blood a few seconds passed in silence then andrea lifted his head suddenly his fat face screwed up in misery he looked as if he were going to cry i am only a poor fisherman your honour he burst out you laugh at me and say i do not like blood and it is true nor do i like suffering and war i want no part of any of these things his great fists were clenched in futile appeal his face puckered in woe his voice risen an octave it was a masterly exhibition of despair and even mallory found himself almost believing in it why wasnt i left alone he went on pathetically god only knows i am no fighting man a highly inaccurate statement skoda interrupted dryly that fact must be patently obvious to every person in the room by this time he tapped his teeth with a jade cigaretteholder his eyes speculative a fisherman you call yourself hes a damned traitor mallory interrupted the commandant was becoming just that little bit too interested in andrea at once skoda wheeled round stood in front of mallory with his hands clasped behind his back teetering on heels and toes and looked him up and down in mocking inspection so he said thoughtfully the great keith mallory a rather different proposition from our fat and fearful friend on the bench there eh lieutenant he did not wait for an answer what rank are you mallory captain mallory answered briefly captain mallory eh captain keith mallory the greatest mountaineer of our time the idol of prewar europe the conqueror of the worlds most impossible climbs skoda shook his head sadly and to think that it should all end like this i doubt whether posterity will rank your last climb as among your greatest there are only ten steps leading to the gallows in the fortress of navarone skoda smiled hardly a cheerful thought is it captain mallory i wasnt even thinking about it the new zealander answered pleasantly what worries me is your face he frowned somewhere or other im sure ive seen it or something like it before his voice trailed off into silence indeed skoda was interested in the bernese alps perhaps often before the war i have it now mallorys face cleared he knew the risk he was taking but anything that concentrated attention on himself to the exclusion of andrea was justified he beamed at skoda three months ago it was in the zoo in cairo a plains buzzard that had been captured in the sudan a rather old and mangy buzzard im afraid mallqry went on apologetically but exactly the same scrawny neck the same beaky face and bald head mallory broke off abruptly swayed back out of reach as skoda his face livid and gleaming teeth bared in rage swung at him with his fist the blow carried with it all skodas wiry strength but anger blurred his timing and the fist swung harmlessly by he stumbled recovered then fell to the floor with a shout of pain as mallorys heavy boot caught him flush on the thigh just above the knee he had barely touched the floor when he was up like a cat took a pace forward and coliapsed heavily again as his injured leg gave under him there was a moments shocked stillness throughout the room then skoda rose painfully supporting himself on the edge of the heavy table he was breathing quickly the thin mouth a hard white line the great sabre scar flaming redly in the sallow face drained now of all colour he looked neither at mallory nor anyone else but slowly deliberately in an almost frightening silence began to work his way round to the back of the table the scuffing of his sliding palms on the leather top rasping edgily across overtautened nerves mallory stood quite still watching him with expressionless face cursing himself for his folly he had overplayed his hands there was no doubt in his mind there could be no doubt in the mind of anyone in that room that skoda meant to kill him and he mallory would not die only skoda and andrea would die skoda from andreas throwing knife andrea was rubbing blood from his face with the inside of his sleeve fingertips only inches from the sheath and andrea front the guns of the guards for the knife was all he had you fool you fool you bloody stupid fool mallory repeated to himself over and over again he turned his head slightly and glanced out of the corner of his eye at the sentry nearest him nearest him but still six or seven feet away the sentry would get him mallory knew the blast of the slugs from that schmeisser would tear him in half before he could cover the distance but he would try he must try it was the least he owed to andrea skoda reached the back of the table opened a drawer and lifted out a gun an automatic mallory noted with detachment a little bluemetal snubnosed toy but a murderous toy the kind of gun he would have expected skoda to have unhurriedly skoda pressed the release button checked the magazine snapped it home with the palm of his hand ificked off the safety catch and looked up at mallory the eyes hadnt altered in the slightest they were cold dark and empty as ever mallory ificked a glance at andrea and tensed himself for one convulsive fling backwards here it comes he thought savagely this is how bloody fools like keith mallory die and then all of a sudden and unknowingly he relaxed for his eyes were still on andrea and he had seen andrea doing the same the huge hand slipping down unconcernedly from the neck empty of any sign of knife there was a scuffle at the table and mallory was just in time to see turzig pin skodas gunhand to the tabletop not that sir turzig begged for gods sake not that way take your hands away skoda whispered the staring empty eyes never left mallorys face take your hands away i say unless you want to go the same way as captain mallory you cant kill him sir turzig persisted doggedly you just cant herr kommandants orders were very clear hauptmann skoda the leader must be brought to him alive he was shot while trying to escape skoda said thickly its no good turzig shook his head we cant kill them all and the other prisoners would talk he released his grip on skodas hands alive herr kommandant said but he didnt say how much alive he lowered his voice confidentially perhaps we may have some difficulty in making captain mallory talk he suggested what what did you say abruptly the deaths head smile flashed once more and skoda was completely on balance again you are overzealous lieutenant remind me to speak to you about it some time you underestimate me that was exactly what i was trying to do frighten mallory into talking and now youve spoilt it all the smile was still on his face the voice light almost bantering but mallory was under no fflusions he owed his life to the young wgb lieutenant how easily one could respect form a friendship with a man like turzig if it werent for this damned crazy war skoda was standing in front of him again he had left his gun on the table but enough of this fooling eh captain mallory the germans teeth fairly gleamed in the bright light from the naked lamps overhead we havent all night have we mallory looked at him then turned away in silence it was warm enough stuffy almost in that little guardroom but he was conscious of a sudden nameless chili he knew all at once without knowing why but with complete certainty that this little man before him was utterly evil well well well we are not quite so talkative now are we my friend he hummed a little to himself looked up abruptly the smile broader than ever where are the explosives captain mallory explosives mallory lifted an interrogatory eyebrow i dont know what you are talking about you dont remember eh i dont know what you are talking about so skoda hummed to himself again and walked over in front of miller and what about you my mend sure i remember miller said easily the captains got it all wrong a sensible man skoda purred but mallory could have sworn to an undertone of disappointment in the voice proceed my friend captain mallory has no eye for detail miller drawled i was with him that day he is malignin a noble bird it was a vulture not a buzzard just for a second skodas smile slipped then it was back again as rigidly fixed and lifeless as if it had beeii painted on very very witty men dont you think turzig what the british would call musichall comedians let them laugh while they may until the hangmans noose begins to tighten he looked at casey brown perhaps you why dont you go and take a running jump to yourself brown growled a running jump the idiom escapes me but i fear it is hardly complimentary skoda selected a cigarette from a thin case tapped it thoughtfully on a thumb nail hmm not just what one might call too cooperative lieutenant turzig you wont get these men to talk sir there was quiet finality in turzigs voice possibly not possibly not skoda was quite unruffled nevertheless i shall have the information i want and within five minutes he walked unhurriedly across to his desk pressed a button screwed his cigarette into its jade holder and leaned against the table an arrogance a careless contempt in every action even to the leisurely crossing of the gleaming jackboots suddenly a side door was flung open and two men stumbled into the room prodded by a rifle barrel mallory caught his breath felt his nails dig savagely into the palms of his hands louki and panayisi louki and panayis bound and bleeding louki from a cut above the eye panayis from a scalp wound so theyd got them too and in spite of his warnings both men were shirtsleeved lould minus his magnificently frogged jacket scarlet tsanta and the small arsenal of weapons that he carried stuck beneath it looked strangely pathetic and woebegone strangely for he was redfaced with anger the moustache bristling more ferociously than ever mallory looked at him with eyes empty of all recognition his face expressionless come now captain mallory skoda said reproachfully have you no word of greeting for two old friends no or perhapi you are just overwhelmed he suggested smoothly you had not expected to see them so soon again eh captain mallory what cheap trick is this mallory asked contemptuously ive never seen these men before in my life his eyes caught those of panayis held there involuntarily the black hate that stared out of those eyes the feral malevolence there was something appaffing about it of course not skoda sighed wearily oh of course not human memory is so short is it not captain mallory the sigh was pure theatre skoda was enjoying himself immensely the cat playing with the mouse however we will try again he swung round crossed over to the bench where stevens lay pulled off the blanket and before anyone could guess his intentions chopped the outside of his right hand against stevenss smashed leg just below the knee stevenss entire body leapt in a convulsive spasm but without even the whisper of a moan he was still fully conscious smiling at skoda blood trickling down his chin from where his teeth had gashed his lower lip you shouldnt have done that hauptmann skoda mallory said his voice was barely a whisper but unnaturally loud in the frozen silence of the room you are going to die for that hauptmann skoda so i am going to die am i again he chopped his hand against the fractured leg again without reaction then imay as well die twice over eh captain mallory this young man is very very tough but the british have soft hearts have they not my dear captain gently his hand slid down stevenss leg closed round the stockinged ankle you have exactly five seconds to tell me the truth captain mallory and then i fear i will be compelled to rearrange these splints gott in himmel whats the matter with that great oaf andrea had taken a couple of steps forward was standing only a yard away swaying on his feet outside let me outside his breath came in short fast gasps he bowed his head one hand to his throat one over his stomach i cannot stand it air air i must have air ah no my dear papagos you shall remain here and enjoy corporal quickly he had seen andreas eyes roll upwards until only the whites showed the fool is going to faint take him away before he falls on top of us mallory had one fleeting glimpse of the two guards hurrying forwards of the incredulous contempt on loukis face then he ificked a glance at miller and brown caught the lazy droop of the americans eyelid in return the millimetric inclination of browns head even as the two guards came up behind andrea and lifted the flaccid arms across their shoulders mallory glanced halfleft saw the nearest sentry less than four feet away now absorbed in the spectacle of the toppling giant easy dead easy the gun dangling by his side he could bit him between wind and water before he knew what was happening fascinated mallory watched andreas forearms slipping nervelessly down the shoulders of the supporting guards till his wrists rested loosely beside their necks palms facing inwards and then there was the sudden leap of the great shoulder muscles and mallory had hurled himself convulsively sidewards and back his shoulder socketing with vicious force into the guards stomach inches below the breastbone an explosive ouf of agony the crash against the wooden walls of the room and mallory knew the guard would be out of action for some time to come even as he dived mallory had heard the sickening thud of heads being swept together now as he twisted round on his side he had a fleeting glimpse of another guard thrashing feebly on the floor under the combined weights of miller and brown and then of andrea tearing an automatic rifle from the guard who had been standing at his right shoulder the schmeisser was cradled in his great hands lined up on skodas chest even before the unconscious man had hit the floor for one second maybe two all movement in the room ceased every sound sheared off by a knife edge the silence was abrupt absoluteand infinitely more clamorous than the clamour that had gone before no one moved no one spoke no one even breathed the shock the utter unexpectedness of what had happened held them all in thrall and then the silence erupted in a staccato crashing of sound deafening in that confined space once twice three times wordlessly and with great care andrea shot hauptmann skoda through the heart the blast of the shells lifted the little man off his feet smashed him against the wall of the hut pinned him there for one incredible second arms outfiung as though nailed against the rough planks in spreadeagle crucifixion and then he eollapsed fell limply to the ground a grotesque and broken doll that struck its heedless head against the edge of the bench before coming to rest on its back on the floor the eyes were still wide open as cold as dark as empty in death as they had been in life his schmeisser waving in a gentle arc that covered turzig and the sergeant andrea picked up skodas sheath knife sliced through the ropes that bound mallorys wrists can you hold this gun my captain mallory flexed his stiffened hands once or twice nodded took the gun in silence in three steps andrea was behind the blind side of the door leading to the anteroom pressed to the wall waiting gesturing to mallory to move as far back as possible out of the line of sight suddenly the door was flung open andrea could just see the tip of the rifle barrel projecting beyond it oberleutnant turzig was ist los wer schoss the voice broke off in a coughing grunt of agony as andrea smashed the sole of his foot against the door he was round the outside of the door in a moment caught the man as he fell pulled him clear of the doorway and peered into the adjacent hut a brief inspection then he closed the door bolted it from the inside nobody else there my captain andrea reported just the one gaoler it seems fine cut the others loose will you andrea he wheeled round towards louki smiled at the comical expression on the little mans face the tentative spreading finally eartoear grin that cut through the baffled incredulity where do the men sleep louki the soldiers i mean in a hut in the middle of the compound major this is the officers quarters compound you mean barbed wire louki said succinctly ten feet high and all the way round exits one and one only two guards good andrea everybody into the side room no not you lieutenant you sit down here he gestured to the chair behind the big desk somebodys bound to come tell him you killed one of us trying to escape then send for the guards at the gate for a moment turzig didnt answer he watched unseeingly as andrea walked past him dragging two unconscious soldiers by their collars then he smiled it was a wry sort of smile i am sorry to disappoint you captain mallory too much has been lost already through my blind stupidity i wont do it andrea mallory called softly yes andrea stood in the anteroom doorway i think i hear someone coming is there a way out of that side room andrea nodded silently outside the front door take your knife if the lieutenant but he was talking to himself andrea was already gone slipping out through the back door soundless as a ghost you will do exactly as i say mallory said softly he took position himself in the doorway to the side room where he could see the front entrance between doot and jamb his automatic rifle was trained on turzig if you dont andrea will kill the man at the door then we will kill you and the guards inside then we will knife the sentries at the gate nine dead men and all for nothing for we will escape anyway here he is now mallorys voice was barely a whisper eyes pitiless in a pitiless face nine dead men lieutenant and just because your pride is hurt deliberately the last sentence was in german fluent colloquial and mallorys mouth twisted as he saw the almost imperceptible sag of turzigs shoulders he knew he had won that turzig had been going to take a last gamble on his ignorance of german that this last hope was gone the door burst open and a soldier stood on the threshhold breathing heavily he was armed but clad only in a singlet and trousers oblivious of the cold lieutenant lieutenant he spoke in german we heard the shots it is nothing sergeant turzig bent his head over an open drawer pretended to be searching for something to account for his solitary presence in the room one of our prisoners tried to escape we stopped him perhaps the medical orderly im afraid we stopped him rather permanently turzig smiled tiredly you can organise a burial detail in the morning meantime you might tell the guards at the gate to come here for a minute then get to bed yourself youll catch your death of cold shall i detail a relief guard of course not turzig said impatiently its just for a minute besides the only people to guard against are already in here his lips tightened for a second as he realised what he had said the unconscious irony of the words hurry up man we havent got all night he waited till the sound of the running footsteps died away then looked steadily at mallory satisfied perfectly and my very sincere apologies mallory said quietly i hate to do a thing like this to a man like you he looked round the door as andrea came into the room andrea ask louki and panayis if theres a telephone switchboard in this block of huts tell them to smash it up and any receivers they can find he grinned then hurry back for our visitors from the gate id be lost without you on the reception committee turzigs gaze followed the broad retreating back captain skoda was right i still have much to learn there was neither bitterness nor rancour in his voice he fooled me completely that big one youre not the first mallory reassured him hes fooled more people than ill ever know youre not the first he repeated but i think you must be just about the luckiest because im still alive because youre still alive mallory echoed less than ten minutes later the two guards at the gates had joined their comrades in the back room captured disarmed bound and gagged with a speed and noiseless efficiency that excited turzigs professional admiration chagrined though he was securely tied hand and foot he lay in a corner of the room not yet gagged i think i understand now why your high command chose you for this task captain mallory if anyone could succeed you would but you must fail the impossible must always remain so nevertheless you have a great team we get by mallory said modestly he took a last look round the room then grinned down at stevens ready to take off on your travels again young man or do you find this becoming rather monotonous ready when you are sir lying on a stretcher which louki had miraculously procured he sighed in bliss firstclass travel this time as befits an officer sheer luxury i dont mind how far we go speak for yourself miller growled morosely he had been allocated first stint at the front or heavy end of the stretcher but the quirk of his eyebrows robbed the words of all offence right then were off one last thing where is the camp radio lieutenant turzig so you can smash it i suppose precisely i have no idea what if i threaten to blow your head off you wont turzig smiled though the smile was a trifle lopsided given certain circumstances you would kill me as you would a fly but you wouldnt kill a man for refusing such information you havent as much to learn as your late and unlamented captain thought mallory admitted its not all that important i regret we have to do all this i trust we do not meet again not at least until the war is over who knows some day we might even go climbing together he signed to louki to fix turzigs gag and walked quickly out of the room two minutes later they had cleared the barracks and were safely lost in the darkness and the olive groves that stretched to the south of margaritha when they cleared the groves a long time later it was almost dawn already the black silhouette of kostos was softening in the first feathery greyness of the coming day the wind was from the south and warm and the snow was beginning to melt on the hills chapter wednesday all day long they lay hidden in the carob grove a thick clump of stunted gnarled trees that clung grimly to the treacherous screestrewn slope abutting what louki called the devils playground a poor shelter and an uncomfortable one but in every other way all they could wish for it offered concealment a firstclass defensive position immediately behind a gentle breeze drawn up from the sea by the sunbaked rocks to the south shade from the sun that rode from dawn to dusk in a cloudless sky and an incomparable view of a sundrenched shimmering aegean away to their left fading through diminishing shades of blue and indigo and violet into faraway nothingness stretched the islands of the lerades the nearest of them maidos so close that they could see isolated fisher cottages sparkling whitely in the sun through that narrow intervening gap of water would pass the ships of the royal navy in just over a days time to the right and even farther away remote featureless backdropped by the towering anatolian mountains the coast of turkey hooked north and west in a great curving scimitar to the north itself the thrusting spear of cape demirci rockrimmed but dimpled with sand coves of white reached far out into the placid blue of the aegean and north again beyond the cape hazeblurred in the purple distance the island of kheros lay dreaming on the surface of the sea it was a breathtaking panorama a heartcatching beauty sweeping majestically through a great semicircle over the sunlit sea but mallory had no eyes for it had spared it only a passing glance when he had come on guard less than half an hour previously just after two oclock he had dismissed it with one quick glance settled by the bole of a tree gazed for endless minutes gazed until his eyes ached with strain atwhat he had so long waited to see had waited to see and come to destroy the guns of the fortress of navarone the town of navarone a town of from four to five thousand people mallory judged lay sprawled round the deep volcanic crescent of the harbour a crescent so deep so embracing that it was almost a complete circle with only a narrow bottleneck of an entrance to the northwest a gateway dominated by searchlights and mortar and machinegun batteries on either side less than three miles distant to the northeast from the carob grove every detail every street every building every caique and launch in the harbour were clearly visible to mallory and ho studied them over and over again until he knew them by heart the way the land to the west of the harbour sloped up gently to the olive groves the dusty streets running down to the waters edge the way the ground rose more sharply to the south the streets now running parallel to the water down to the old town the way the cliffs to the east cliffs pockmarked by the bombs of torrances liberator squadron stretched a hundred and fifty sheer feet above the water then curved dizzily out over and above the harbour and the great mound of volcanic rock towering above that again a mound barricaded off from the town below by the high wall that ended flush with the cliff itself and finally the way the twin rows of aa guns the great radar scanners and the barracks of the fortress squat narrowembrasured built of big blocks of masonry dominated everything in sight including that great black gash in the rock below the fantastic overhang of the cliff unconsciously almost mallory nodded to himself in slow understanding this was the fortress that had defied the allies for eighteen long months that had dominated the entire naval strategy in the sporades since the germans had reached out from the mainland into the isles that had blocked all naval activity in that square mile triangle between the lerades and the turkish coast and now when he saw it it all made sense impregnable to land attack the commanding fortress saw to that impregnable to air attack mallory realised just how suicidal it had been to send out torrances squadron against the great guns protected by that jutting cliff against those bristling rows of antiaircraft guns and impregnable to sea attack the waiting squadrons of the luftwaffe on samos saw to that jensen had been right only a guerrilla sabotage mission stood any chance at all a remote chance an all but suicidal chance but still a chance and mallory knew he couldnt ask for more thoughtfully he lowered the binoculars and rubbed the back of his hand across aching eyes at last he felt he knew exactly what he was up against was grateful for the knowledge for the opportunity hed been given of this longrange reconnaissance this familiarising of himself with the terrain the geography of the town this was probably the one vantage point in the whole island that offered such an opportunity together with concealment and near immunity no credit to himself the leader of the mission he reflected wryly that they had found such a place it had been loukis idea entirely and he owed a great deal more than that to the sadeyed little greek it had been loukis idea that they first move upvalley from margaritha to give andrea time to recover the explosives from old leris hut and to make certain there was no immediate hue and cry and pursuit they could have fought a rearguard action up through the olive groves until they had lost themselves in the foothills of kostos it was he who had guided them back past margaritha when they had doubled on their tracks had halted them opposite the village while he and panayis had slipped wraithlike through the lifting twilight picked up outdoor clothes for themselves and on the return journey slipped into the abteilung garage torn away the coil ignitions of the german command car and truck the only transport in margaritha and smashed their distributors for good measure it was louki who bad led them by a sunken ditch right up to the roadblock guard post at the mouth of the valley ft had been almost ludicrously simple to disarm the sentries only one of whom bad been awake and finally it was louki who bad insisted that they walk down the muddy centre of the valley track till they came to the metalled road less than two miles from the town itself a hundred yards down this they had branched off to the left across a long sloping field of lava that left no trace behind arrived in the carob copse just on sunrise and it had worked all these carefully engineered pointers pointers that not even the most sceptical could have ignored and denied had worked magnificently miller and andrea who had shared the forenoon watch had seen the navarone garrison spending long hours making the most intensive housetohouse search of the town that should make it doubly trebly safe for them the following day mallory reckoned it was unlikely that the search would be repeated still more unlikely that if it were it would be carried out with a fraction of the same enthusiasm louki had done his work well mallory turned his head to look at him the little man was still asleep wedged on the slope behind a couple of treetrunks he hadnt stirred for five hours still dead tired himself his legs aching and eyes smarting with sleeplessness mallory could not find ft in him to grudge louki a moment of his rest hed earned it all and hed been awake all through the previous night so had panayis but panayis was already awakening mallory saw pushing the long black hair out of his eyes awake rather for his transition from sleep to full awareness was immediate as fleeting and as complete as a cats a dangerous man mallory knew a desperate man almost and a bitter enemy but he knew nothing of panayis nothing at all he doubted if he ever would farther up the slope almost in the centre of the grove andrea had built a high platform of broken branches and twigs against a couple of carob poles maybe five feet apart gradually filling up the space between slope and trees until he had a platform four feet in width as nearly level as he could make it andy stevens lay on this still on his stretcher still conscious as far as mallory could tell stevens hadnt closed his eyes since they had been marched away by turzig from their cave in the mountains he seemed to have passed beyond the need for sleep or had crushed all desire for it the stench from the gangrenous leg was nauseating appalling poisoned all the air around mallory and miller had had a look at the leg shortly after their arrival in the copse uncovered it examined it smiled at one another tied it up again and assured stevens that the wound was closing below the knee the leg bad turned almost completely black mallory lifted his binoculars to have another look at the town but lowered them almost at once as someone came sliding down the slope touched him on the arm it was panayis upset anxious almost angry looking he gesticulated towards the westering sun the time captain mallory he spoke in greek his voice low sibilant urgent an inevitable voice mallory thought for the lean dark mysteriousness of the man what is the time he repeated halfpast two or thereabouts mallory lifted an interrogatory eyebrow you are concerned panayis why you should have wakened me you should have wakened me hours ago he was angry mallory decided it is my turn to keep watch but you had no sleep last night mallory pointed out reasonably it just didnt seem fair it is my turn to keep watch i tell you panayis insisted stubbornly very well then if you insist mallory knew the high fierce pride of the islanders too well to attempt to argue heaven only knows what we would have done without louki and yourself ili stay and keep you company for a while ah so that is why you let me sleep on there was no disguising the hurt in the eyes the voice you do not trust panayis oh for heavens sake mallory began in exasperation checked himself and smiled of course we trust you maybe i should go and get some more sleep anyway you are kind to give me the chance you will shake me in two hours time certainly certainly panayis was almost beaming i shall not fail mallory scrambled up to the centre of the grove and stretched out lazily along the ledge he had levelled out for himself for a few idle moments he watched panayis pacing restlessly to and fro just inside the perimeter of the grove lost interest when he saw him climbing swiftly up among the branches of a tree seeking a high lookout vantage point and decided he might as well follow his own advice and get some sleep while he could captain mallory captain mallory an urgent heavy hand was shaking his shoulder wake up wake up mallory stirred rolled over on his back sat up quickly opening his eyes as he did so panayis was stooped over him the dark saturnine face alive with anxiety mallory shook his head to clear away the mists of sleep and was on his feet in one swift easy movement whats the matter panayis planes he said quickly there is a squadron of planes coming our way planes what planes whose planes i do not know captain they are yet far away but what direction mallory snapped they come from the north together they ran down to the edge of the grove panayis gestured to the north and mallory caught sight of them at once the afternoon sun glinting off the sharp dihedral of the wings stukas all right he thought grimly seven no eight of them less than three miles away flying in two echelons of four two thousand certainly not more than twentyfive hundred feet he became aware that panayis was tugging urgently at his arm come captain mallory he said excitedly we have no time to lose he pulled mallory round pointed with outstretched arm at the gaunt shattered cliffs that rose steeply behind them cliffs crazily riven by rockjumbled ravines that wound their aimless way back into the interior or stopped as abruptly as they had begun the devils playground we must get in there at once at once captain mallory why on earth should we mallory looked at him in astonishment theres no reason to suppose that theyre after us how can they be no one knows were here i do not care panayis was stubborn in his conviction i know do not ask me how i know for i do not know that myself louki will tell you panayis knows these things i know captain mallory i know just for a second mallory stared at him uncomprehending there was no questioning the earnestness the utter sincerity but it was the machinegun staccato of the words that tipped the balance of instinct against reason almost without realising it certainly without realislug why mallory found himself running uphill slipping and stumbling in the scree he found the others already on their feet tense expectant shrugging on their packs the guns already in their hands get to the edge of the trees up there mallory shouted quickly stay there and stay under coverwere going to have to break for that gap in the rocks he gestured through the trees at a jagged fissure in the cliffside barely forty yards from where he stood blessed louki for his foresight in choosing a hideout with so convenient a bolthole wait till i give the word andrea he turned round then broke off the words unneeded andrea had already scooped up the dying boy in his arms just as he lay in stretcher and blankets and was weaving his way uphill in and out among the trees whats up boss miller was by mallorys side as he plunged up the slope i dont see nothin you can hear something if youd just stop talking for a moment mallory said grimly or just take a look up there miller flat on his stomach now and less than a dozen feet from the edge of the grove twisted round and craned his neck upwards he picked up the planes immediately stukas he said incredulously a squadron of gawddamned stukas it cant be boss it can and it is mallory said grimly jensen told me that jerry has stripped the italian front of them over two hundred pulled out in the last few weeks mallory squinted up at the squadron less than half a mile away now and hes brought the whole damn issue down to the aegean but theyre not lookin for us miller protested im afraid they are mallory said grimly the two bomber echelons had just dovetailed into line ahead formation im afraid panayis was right but but theyre passin us by they arent mallory said flatly theyre here to stay just keep your eyes on that leading plane even as he spoke the flightcommander tilted his gullwinged junkers sharply over to port halfturned fell straight out of the sky in a screaming powerdive plummeting straight for the carob grove leave him alone mallory shouted dont fire the stuka airbrakes at maximum depression had steadied on the centre of the grove nothing could stop him now but a chance shot might bring him down directly on top of them the chances were poor enough as it was keep your hands over your heads and your heads down he ignored his own advice his gaze following the bomber every foot of the way down five hundred four hundred three the rising crescendo of the heavy engine was beginning to hurt his ears and the stuka was pulling sharply out of its plunging fall its bomb gone bomb mallory sat up sharply screwing up his eyes against the blue of the sky not one bomb but dozens of them clustered so thickly that they appeared to be jostling each other as they arrowed into the centre of the grove striking the gnarled and stunted trees breaking off branches and burying themselves to their fins in the soft and shingled slope incendiaries mallory had barely time to realise that they had been spared the horror of a kilo he bomb when the incendiaries erupted into hissing guttering life into an incandescent magnesium whiteness that reached out and completely destroyed the shadowed gloom of the carob grove within a matter of seconds the dazzling coruscation had given way to thick evilsmelling clouds of acrid black smoke smoke laced with flickering tongues of red small at first then licking and twisting resinously upwards until entire trees were enveloped in a cocoon of flame the stuka was still pulling upwards out of its dive had not yet levelled off when the heart of the grove old and dry and tindery was fiercely ablaze miller twisted up and round nudging mallory to catch his attention through the cracking roar of the flames incendiaries boss he announced what did you think they were using mallory asked shortly matches theyre trying to smoke us out to burn us out get us in the open high explosives not so good among trees ninetynine times out of a hundred this would have worked he coughed as the acrid smoke bit into his lungs peered up with watering eyes through the treetops but not this time not if were lucky not if they hold off another halfminute or so just look at that smoke miller looked thick convoluted shot through with fiery sparks the rolling cloud was already a third of the way across the gap between grove and cliff borne uphill by the wandering catspaws from the sea it was the complete the perfect smokescreen miller nodded gonna make a break for it huh boss theres no choice we either go or we stay and get fried or blown into very little bits probably both he raised his voice anybody see whats happening up top queuing up for another go at us sir brown said lugubriously the first blokes still circling around waiting to see how we break cover they wont wait long this is where we take off he peered uphill through the rolling smoke but it was too thick laced his watering eyes until everything was blurred through a misted sheen of tears there was no saying how far uphill the smokebank had reached and they couldnt afford to wait until they were sure stuka pilots had never been renowned for their patience right everybody he shouted fifteen yards along the treeline to that wash then straight up into the gorge dont stop till youre at least a hundred yards inside andrea you lead the way off you go he peered through the blinding smoke wheres panayis there was no reply panayis mallory called panayis perhaps he went back for somethin miller had stopped halfturned shall i go get on your way mallory said savagely and if anything happens to young stevens ill hold you but miller wisely was already gone andrea stumbling and coughing by his side for a couple of seconds mallory stood irresolute then plunged back downhill towards the centre of the grove maybe panayis had gone back for something and he couldnt understand english mallory had hardly gone five yards when he was forced to halt and fling his arm up before his face the heat was searing panayis couldnt be down there no one could have been down there could have lived for seconds in that furnace gasping for air hair singeing and clothes smouldering with fire mallory clawed his way back up the slope colliding with trees slipping falling then stumbling desperately to his feet again he ran along to the east end of the wood no one there back to the other end again towards the wash almost completely blind now the superheated air searing viciously through throat and lungs till he was suffocating till his breath was coming in great whooping agonised breaths no sense in waiting longer nothing he could do nothing anyone could do except save himself there was a noise in his ears the roaring of the flames the roaring of his own blood and the screaming heartstopping roar of a stuka in a powerdive desperately he flung himself forward over the sliding scree tumbled and pitched headlong down to the floor of the wash hurt or not he did not know and her did not care sobbing aloud for breath he rose to his feet forced his aching legs to drive him somehow up the bill the air was full of the thunder of engines he knew the entire squadron was coming in to the attack and then he had flung himself uncaringly to the ground as the first of the high explosive bombs erupted in its concussive blast of smoke and flame erupted not forty yards away to his left and ahead of him ahead of him even as he struggled upright again lurched forward and upward once more mallory cursed himself again and again and again you madman he thought bitterly confusedly you damned crazy madman sending the others out to be killed he should have thought of it oh god he should have thought of it a fiveyearold could have thought of it of course jerry wasnt going to bomb the grove they had seen the obvious the inevitable as quickly as he had were divebombing the pall of smoke between the grove and the cliff a fiveyearoldthe earth exploded beneath his feet a giant hand plucked him up and smashed him to the ground and the darkness closed over him chapter wednesday once twice half a dozen times mallory struggled up from the depths of a black trancelike stupor and momentarily touched the surface of consciousness only to slide back into the darkness again desperately each time he tried to hang on to these fleeting moments of awareness but his mind was like the void dark and sinewless and even as he knew that his mind was slipping backwards again loosing its grip on reality the knowledge was gone and there was only the void once more nightmare he thought vaguely during one of the longer glimmerings of comprehension im having a nightmare like when you know you are having a nightmare and that if you could open your eyes it would be gone but you cant open your eyes he tried it now tried to open his eyes but it was no good it was still as dark as ever and he was still sunk in this evil dream for the sun had been shining brightly in the sky he shook his head in slow despair aha observe signs of life at last there was no mistaking the slow nasal drawl or medicine man miller triumphs again there was a moments silence a moment in which mallory was increasingly aware of the diminishing thunder of aero engines the acrid resinous smoke that stung his nostrils and eyes and then an arm had passed under his shoulders and millers persuasive voice was in his ear just try a little of this boss ye olde vintage brandy nothin like it anywhere mallory felt the cold neck of the bottle tilted his head back took a long pull almost immediately he had jerked himself upright and forward to a sitting position gagging spluttering and fighting for breath as the raw fiery ouzo bit into the mucous membrane of cheeks and throat he tried to speak but could do no more than croak gasp for fresh air and stare indignantly at the shadowy figure that knelt by his side miller for his part looked at him with unconcealed admiration see boss just like i said nothin like it he shook his head admiringly wide awake in an instant as the literary boys would say never saw a shock and concussion victim recover so fast what the hell are you trying to do mallory demanded the fire had died down in his throat and he could breathe again poison me angrily he shook his head fighting off the pounding ache the fog that still swirled round the fringes of his mind bloody fine physician you are shock you say yet the first thing you do is administer a dose o spirits take your pick miller interrupted grimly either that or a damned sight bigger shock in about fifteen minutes or so when brother jerry gets here but theyve gone away i cant hear the stukas anymore this lots comin up from the town miller said morosely loukis just reported them half a dozen armoured cars and a couple of trucks with field guns the length of a telegraph pole i see mallory twisted round saw a gleam of light at a bend in the wall a cave a tunnel almost little cyprus louki had said some of the older people had called it the devils playground was riddled with a honeycomb of caves he grinned wryly at the memory of his momentary panic when he thought his eyes had gone and turned again to miller trouble again dusty nothing but trouble thanks for bringing me round had to miller said briefly i guess we couldnt have carried you very far boss mallory nodded not just the flattest of country hereabouts theres that too miller agreed what i really meant is that theres hardly anyone left to carry you casey brown and panayis have both been hurt boss what both of them mallory screwed his eyes shut shook his head in slow anger my god dusty fd forgotten all about the bomb the bombs he reached out his hand caught miller by the arm how how bad are they there was so little time left so much to do how bad miller shook out a pack of cigarettes and offered one to mallory not bad at all if we could get them into hospital but hellish painful and cripplin if they gotta start hikin up and down those gawddamned ravines hereabouts first time fve seen canyon floors more nearly vertical than the walls themselves you still havent told me sorry boss sorry shrapnel wounds both of them in exactly the same place left thigh just above the knee no bones gone no tendons cut ive just finished tying up caseys leg its a pretty wicked lookin gash hes gonna know all about it when he starts walkin and panayis fixed his own leg miller said briefly a queer character wouldnt even let me look at it far less bandage it i reckon hed have knifed me if id tried better to leave him alone anyway mallory advised some of these islanders have strange taboos and superstitions just as long as hes alive though i still dont see how the hell he managed to get here he was the first to leave miller explained along with casey you must have missed him in the smoke they were climbin together when they got hit and how did i get here no prizes for the first correct answer miller jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the huge form that blocked half the width of the cave junior here did his st bernard act once again i wanted to go with him but he wasnt keen said he reckoned it would be difficult to carry both of us the bill my feelins were hurt considerable miller sighed i guess i just wasnt born to be a hero thats all mallory smiled thanks again andrea thanks miller was indignant a guy saves your life and all you can say is thanks after the first dozen times or so you run out of suitable speeches mallory said dryly hows stevens breathin mallory nodded forward towards the source of light wrinkled his nose just round the corner isnt he yeah its pretty grim miller admitted the gangrenes spread up beyond the knee mallory rose groggily to his feet picked up his gun how is he really dusty hes dead but he just wont die hell be gone by sundown gawd only knows whats kept him goin so far it may sound presumptuous mallory murmured but i think i know too the firstclass medical attention miller said hopefully looks that way doesnt it mallory smiled down at the still kneeling miller but that wasnt what i meant at all come gentlemen we have some business to attend to me all im good for is blowin up bridges and droppin a handful of sand in engine bearins miller announced strategy and tactics are far beyond my simple mind but i still think those characters down there are pickin a very stupid way of comnñttin suicide it would be a damned sight easier for all concerned if they just shot themselves im inclined to agree with you mallory settled himself more firmly behind the jumbled rocks in the mouth of the ravine that opened on the charred and smoking remains of the carob grove directly below and took another look at the alpenkorps troops advancing in extended order up the steep shelterless slope theyre no children at this game i bet they dont like it one little bit either then why the hell are they doin it boss no option probably first off this place can only be attacked frontally mallory smiled down at the little greek lying between himself and andrea louki here chose the place well it would require a long detour to attack from the rear and it would take them a week to advance through that devils scrapheap behind us secondly itll be sunset in a couple of hours and they know they havent a hope of getting us after its dark and finally and i think this is more important than the other two reasons put together its a hundred to one that the commandant in the town is being pretty severely prodded by his high command theres too much at stake even in the one in a thousand chance of us getting at the guns they cant afford to have kheros evacuated under their noses to lose why not miller interrupted he gestured largely with his hands just a lot of useless rocks they cant afford to lose face with the turks mallory went on patiently the strategic importance of these islands in the sporades is negligible but their political importance is tremendous adolf badly needs another ally in these parts so be flies in alpenkorps troops by the thousand and stukas by the hundred the best he has and he needs them desperately on the italian front but youve got to convince your potential ally that youre a pretty safe bet before you can persuade him to give up his nice safe seat on the fence and jump down on your side very interestin miller observed so so the germans are going to have no compunction about thirty or forty of their best troops being cut into little pieces its no trouble at all when youre sitting behind a desk a thousand miles away let em come another hundred yards or so closer louki and i will start from the middle and work out you and andrea start from the outside i dont like it boss miller complained dont think that i do either mallory said quietly slaughtering men forced to do a suicidal job like this is not my idea of fun or even of war but if we dont get them they get us he broke off and pointed across the burnished sea to where kheros lay peacefully on the hazed horizon striking golden glints off the westering sun what do you think they would have us do dusty i know i know boss miller stirred uncomfortably dont rub it in he pulled his woollen cap low over his forehead and stared bleakly down the slope how soon do the mass executions begin another hundred yards i said mallory looked down the slope again towards the coast road and grinned suddenly glad to change the topic never saw telegraph poles shrink so suddenly before dusty miller studied the guns drawn up on the road behind the two trucks and cleared his throat i was only sayin what louki told me he said defensively what loiiki told you the little greek was indignant before god major the americano is full of lies ah well mebbe i was mistaken miller said magnanimously he squinted again at the guns forehead lined in puzzlement that first ones a mortar i reckon but what in the universe that other weird looking contraption can be also a mortar mallory explained a fivebarrelled job and very nasty the nebelwerfer or moanin minnie howls like all the lost souls in hell guaranteed to turn the knees to jelly especially after nightfall but its stifi the other one you have to watch a sixinch mortar almost certainly using fragmentation bombs you use a brush and shovel for clearing up afterwards thats right miller gowled cheer us all up but he was grateful to the new zealander for trying to take their minds off what they had to do why dont they use them they will mallory assured him just as soon as we fire and they find out where we are gawd help us miller muttered fragmentation bombs you said he lapsed into gloomy silence any second now mallory said softly i only hope that our friend turzig isnt among this lot he reached out for his fieldglasses but stopped in surprise as andrea leaned across louki and caught him by the wrist before he could lift the binoculars whats the matter andrea i would not be using these my captain they have betrayed us once already i have been thinking and it can be nothing else the sunlight reflecting from the lenses mallory stared at him slowly released his grip on the glasses nodded several times in succession of course of course i had been wondering someone has been careless there was no other way there could have been no other way it would only require a single flash to tip them off he paused remembering then grinned wryly it could have been myself all this started just after i had been on watch and panayis didnt have the glasses he shook his head in mortification it must have been me andrea i do not believe it andrea said flatly you couldnt make a mistake like that my captain not only could but did im afraid but well worry about that afterwards the middle of the ragged line of advancing soldiers slipping and stumbling on the treacherous scree had almost reached the lower limits of the blackened stunted remains of the copse theyve come far enough ill take the white helmet in the middle louki even as he spoke he could hear the soft scrape as the three others slid their automatic barrels across and between the protective rocks in front of them could feel the wave of revulsion that washed through his mind but his voice was steady enough as he spoke relaxed and almost casual right let them have it now his last words were caught up and drowned in the tearing rapidfire crash of the automatic carbines with four machineguns in their hands two brens and two mm schmeissers it was no war as he had said but sheer pitiful massacre with the defenceless figures on the slope below figures still stunned and uncomprehending jerking spinning round and collapsing like marionettes in the hands of a mad puppeteer some to lie where they fell others to roll down the steep slope legs and arms flailing in the grotesque disjointedness of death only a couple stood still where they had been hit vacant surprise mirrored in their lifeless faces then slipped down tiredly to the stony ground at their feet almost three seconds had passed before the handful of those who still lived about a quarter of the way in from either end of the line where converging streams of fire had not yet met realised what was happening and flung themselves desperately to the ground in search of the cover that didnt exist the frenetic stammering of the machineguns stopped abruptly and in unison the sound sheared off as by a guillotine the sudden silence was curiously oppressive louder more obtrusive than the clamour that had gone before the gravelly earth beneath his elbows grated harshly as mallory shifted his weight slightly looked at the two men to his right andrea with his impassive face empty of all expression louki with the sheen of tears in his eyes then he became aware of the low murmuring to his left shifted round again bittermouthed savage the american was swearing softly and continuously oblivious to the pain as he pounded his fist time and again into the sharpedged gravel before him just one more gawd the quiet voice was almost a prayer thats all i ask just one more mallory touched his arm what is it dusty miller looked round at him eyes cold and still and empty of all recognition then he blinked several times and grinned a cut and bruised hand automatically reaching for his cigarettes jus daydreamin boss he said easily jus daydreamin he shook out his pack of cigarettes have one that inhuman bastard that sent these poor devils up that hill mallory said quietly make a wonderful pietare seen over the sights of your rifle wouldnt he abruptly millers smile vanished and he nodded it would be all of that he risked a quick peep round one of the boulders eased himself back again eight mebbe ten of them still down there boss he reported the poor bastards are like ostriches trying to take cover behind stones the size of an orange we leave them be we leave them be mallory echoed emphaticaliy the thought of any more slaughter made him feel almost physically sick they wont try again he broke off suddenly flattened himself in reflex instinct as a burst of machinegun bullets struck the steepwalled rock above their beads and whined up the gorge in vicious ricochet wont try again huh miller was already sliding his gun around the rock in front of him when mallory caught his arm and pulled him back not them listen another burst of fire then another and now they could hear the savage chatter of the machinegun a chatter rhythmically interrupted by a weird halfhuman sighing as its belt passed through the breech mallory could feel the prickling of the hairs on the nape of his neck a spandau once youve heard a spandau you can never forget it leave it alone its probably fixed on the back of one of the trucks and cant do us any harm im more worried about these damned mortars down there im not miller said promptly theyre not firing at us thats why im worried what do you think andrea the same as you my captain they are waiting this devils playground as louki calls it is a madmans maze and they can only fire as blind men they wont be waiting much longer mallory interrupted grimly he pointed to the north here come their eyes at first only specks above the promontory of cape demirci the planes were soon recognisable for what they were droning in slowly over the aegean at about fifteen hundred feet mallory looked at them in astonishment then turned to andrea am i seeing things andrea he gestured at the first of the two planes a highwinged little monoplane fighter that cant be a pzl it can be and it is andrea zuuuunred an old polish plane we had before the war he explained to miller and the other is an old belginn plane breguets we called them andrea shaded his eyes to look again at the two planes now almost directly overhead i thought they had all been lost during the invasion me too mallory said must have patched up some bits and pieces ah theyve seen us beginning to circle but why on earth they use these obsolete death trap i dont know and i dont care miller said rapidly he had just taken a quick look round the boulder in front of him these damned guns down there are just linin up on us and muzzleon they look a considerable sight bigger than telegraph poles fragmentation bombs you said come on boss lets get the hell outa here thus the pattern was set for the remainder of that brief november afternoon for the grim game of tipandrun hideandseek among the ravines and shattered rocks of the devils playground the planes held the key to the game cruised high overhead observing every move of the hunted group below relaying the information to the guns on the coast road and the company of alpenkorps that had moved up through the ravine above the carob grove soon after the planes reported that the positions there had been abandoned the two ancient planes were soon replaced by a couple of modern henschels andrea said that the pzl couldnt remain airborne for more than an hour anyway mallory was between the devil and the deep sea inaccurate though the mortars were some of the deadly fragmentation bombs found their way into the deep ravines where they took temporary shelter the blast of metal lethal in the confined space between the sheering walls occasionally they came so close that mallory was forced to take refuge in some of the deep caves that honeycombed the walls of the canyons in these they weró safe enough but the safety was an illusion that could lead only to ultimate defeat and capture in the lulls the alpenkorps whom they had fought off in a series of brief skirmishing rearguard actions during the afternoon could approach closely enough to trap them inside time and time again mallory and his men were forced to move to widen the gap between themselves and their pursuers following the indomitable louki wherever he chose to lead them and taking their chance often a very slender and desperate chance with the mortar bombs one bomb arced into a ravine that led into the interior burying itself in the gravelly ground not twenty yards ahead of them by far the nearest anything had come during the afternoon by one chance in a thousand it didnt explode they gave it as wide a berth as possible almost holding their breaths until they were safely beyond about half an hour before sunset they struggled up the last few boulderstrewn yards of a steeplyshelving ravine floor halted just beyond the shelter of the projecting wall where the ravine dipped again and turned sharply to the right and the north there had been no more mortar bombs since the one that had failed to explode the sixinch and the weirdlyhowling nebeiwerfer bad only a limited range mallory knew and though the planes still cruised overhead they cruised uselessly the sun was dipping towards the horizon and the floors of the ravines were already deepsunk in shadowed gloom invisible from above but the alpenkorps tough dogged skilful soldiers soldiers living only for the revenge of their massacred comrades were very close behind and they were highlytrained mountain troops fresh resilient the reservoir of their energies barely tapped whereas his own tiny band worn out from continuous days and sleepless nights of labour and action mallory sank to the ground near the angled turn of the ravine where he could keep look out glanced at the others with a deceptive casualness that marked his cheerless assessment of what he saw as a fighting unit they were in a pretty bad way both panayis and brown were badly crippled the latters face grey with pain for the first time since leaving alexandria casey brown was apathetic listless and quite indifferent to everything this mallory took as a very bad sign nor was brown helped by the heavy transmitter still strapped to his back with pointblank truculence he had ignored mallorys categorical order to abandon it louki was tired and looked it his physique mallory realised now was no match for his spirit for the infectious smile that never left his face for the panache of that magnificently upswept moustache that contrasted so oddly with the sad tired eyes above miller like himself was tired but like himself could keep on being tired for a long time yet and stevens was still conscious but even in the twilit gloom of the canyon floor his face looked curiously transparent while the nails lips and eyelids were drained of blood and andrea who had carried him up and down all these killing canyon tracks where there had been tracks for almost two interminable hours looked as he always did immutable indestructible mallory shook his head fished out a cigarette made to strike a light remembered the planes still cruising overhead and threw the match away idly his gaze travelled north along the canyon and he slowly stiffened the unlit cigarette crumpling and shredding between his fingers this ravine bore no resemblance to any of the others through which they had so far passed it was broader dead straight at least three times as long and as far as he could see in the twilight the far end was blocked off by an almost vertical wall louki mallory was on his feet now all weariness forgotten do you know where you are do you know this place but certainly major louki was hurt have i not told you that panayis and i in the days of our youth but this is a culdesac a deadend mallory protested were boxed in man were trapped so the major does not trust louki is that it he grinned again relented patted the wall by his side panayis and i we have been working this way all afternoon along this wall there are many caves one of them leads through to another valley that leads down to the coast road i see i see relief washing through his mind mallory sank down on the ground again and where does this other valley come out just across the strait from maidos how far from the town about five miles major maybe six not more fine fine and youre sure you can find this cave a hundred years from now and my head in a goatskin bag louki boasted fair enough even as he spoke mallory catapulted himself violently to one side twisted in midair to avoid falling across stevens and crashed heavily into the wall between andrea and miller in a moment of unthinking carelessness he had exposed himself to view from the ravine they had just combed the burst of machinegun fire from its lower end a hundred and fifty yards away at the most had almost blown his head off even as it was the left shoulder of his jacket had been torn away the shell just grazing his shoulder miller was already kneeling by his side fingering the gash running a gently exploratory band across his back careless damn careless mallory murmured but i didnt think they were so close he didnt feel as calm as he sounded if the mouth of that schineisser had been another sixteenth of an inch to the right hed have had no head left now are you all right boss miller was puzzled did they terrible shots mallory assured him cheerfully couldnt hit a barn he twisted round to look at his shoulder i hate to sound heroic but this really is just a scratch he rose easily to his feet and picked up his gun sorry and all that gentlemen but its time we were on our way again how far along is this cave louki louki rubbed his bristly chin the smile suddenly gone he looked quickly at mallory then away again louki yes yes major the cave louki rubbed his chin again well it is a good way along in fact it is at the end he finished uncomfortably the very end asked mallory quietly louki nodded miserably stared down at the ground at his feet even the ends of his moustache seemed to droop thats handy mallory said heavily oh thats very handy he sank down to the ground again helps us no end that does he bowed his head in thought and didnt even lift it as andrea poked a bren round the angle of the rock and fired a short downhill burst more in token of discouragement than in any hope of hitting anything another ten seconds passed then louki spoke again his voice barely audible i am very very sorry this is a terrible thing before god major i would not have done it but that i thought they were still far behind its not your fault louki mallory was touched by the little mans obvious distress he touched his ripped shoulder jacket i thought the same thing please stevens put his hand on mallorys arm whats wrong i dont understand everybody else does im afraid andy its very very simple we have half a mile to go along this valley here and not a shred of cover the alpenkorps have less than two hundred yards to come up that ravine weve just left he paused while andrea fired another retaliatory short burst then continued theyll do what theyre doing now keep probing to see if were still here the minute they judge were gone theyll be up here in a flash theyll nail us before were halfway quarter way to the cave you know we cant travel fast and theyre carrying a couple of spandaus theyll cut us to ribbons i see stevens murmured you put it all so nicely sir sorry andy but thats how it is but could you not leave two men as a rearguard while the rest and what happens to the rearguard mallory interrupted dryly i see what you mean he said in a low voice i hadnt thought of that no but the rearguard would quite a problem isnt it there is no problem at all louki announced the major is kind but this is all my fault i will youll do damn all of the kind miller said savagely he tore loukis bren from his hand and laid it on the ground you heard what the boss said it wasnt your fault for a moment louki stared at him in anger then turned dejectedly away he looked as if he were going to cry mallory too stared at the american astonished at the sudden vehemence so completely out of character now that he came to think of it dusty had been strangely taciturn and thoughtful during the past hour or so mallory couldnt recall his saying a word during all that time but time enough to worry about that later on casey brown eased his injured leg looking hopefully at mallory couldnt we stay here till its dark real dark then make our way no good the moons almost full tonight and not a cloud in the sky theyd get us even more important we have to get into the town between sunset and curfew tonight our last chance sorry casey but its no go fifteen seconds half a minute passed and passed in silence then they all started abruptly as andy stevens spoke louki was right you know he said pleasantly the voice was weak but filled with a calm certainty that jerked every eye towards him he was propped up on one elbow loukis bren cradled in his hands it was a measure of their concentration on the problem on hand that no one had heard or seen him reach out for the machinegun its all very simple stevens went on quietly just lets use our heads thats all the gangrenes right up past the knee isnt it sir mallory said nothing he didnt know what to say the complete unexpectedness had knocked him off balance he was vaguely aware that miller was looking at him his eyes begging him to say no is it or isnt it there was patience a curious understanding in the voice and all of a sudden mallory knew what to say yes he nodded it is miller was looking at him in horror thank you sir stevens was smiling in satisfaction thank you very much indeed theres no need to point out all the advantages of my staying here there was an assurance in his voice no one had ever heard before the unthinking authority of a man completely in charge of a situation tune i did something for my living anyway no fond farewells please just leave me a couple of boxes of ammo two or three thirtysix grenades and away you go ill be damned if we will miller was on his feet making for the boy then brought up abruptly as the bren centered on his chest one step nearer and ill shoot you stevens said calmly miller looked at him in long silence sank slowly back to the ground i would you know stevens assured him well goodbye gentlemen thank you for all youvó done for me twenty seconds thirty a whole minute passed in a queer trancelike silence then miller heaved himself to his feet again a tall rangy figure with tattered clothes and a face curiously haggard in the gathering gloom so long kid i guess waal mebbe im not so smart after all he took stevenss hand looked down at the wasted face for a long moment made to say something else then changed his mind be seein you he said abruptly turned and walked off heavily down the valley one by one the others followed him wordlessly except for andrea who stopped and whispered in the boys ear a whisper that brought a smile and a nod of complete understanding and then there was only mallory left stevens grinned up at him thank you sir thanks for not letting me down you and andrea you understand you always did understand youll youll be all right andy god mallory thought what a stupid what an inane thing to say honest sir im ok stevens smiled contentedly no pain left i cant feel a thing its wonderful andy i dont its time you were gone sir the others will be waiting now if youll just light me a gasper and fire a few random shots down that ravine within five minutes mallory had overtaken the othera and inside fifteen they had all reached the cave that led to the coast for a moment they stood in the entrance listening to the intermittent firing from the other end of the valley then turned wordlessly and plunged into the cave back where they had left him andy stevens was lying on his stomach peering down into the now almost dark ravine there was no pain left in his body none at all he drew deeply on a cupped cigarette smiled as he pushed another clip home into the magazine of the bren for the first time in his life andy stevens was happy and content beyond his understanding a man at last at peace with himself he was no longer afraid chapter wednesday evening exactly forty minutes later they were safely in the heart of the town of navarone within fifty yards of the great gates of the fortress itself mallory gazing out at the gates and the still more massive arch of stone that encased them shook his head for the tenth time and tried to fight off the feeling of disbelief and wonder that they should have reached their goal at last or as nearly as made no difference they had been due a break some time he thought the law of averages had been overwhelmingly against the continuation of the evil fortune that had dogged them so incessantly since they had arrived on the island it was only right he kept telling himself it was only just that this should be so but even so the transition from that dark valley where they had left andy stevens to die to this tumbledown old house on the east side of the town square of navarone had been so quick so easy that it still lay beyond immediate understanding or unthinking acceptance not that it had been too easy in the first fifteen minutes or so he remembered panayiss wounded leg had given out on him immediately after they had entered the cave and he had collapsed he must have been in agony mallory had thought with his torn roughlybandaged leg but the faffing light and the dark bitter impassive face had masked the pain he had begged mallory to be allowed to remain where he was to hold off the alpenkorps when they had overcome stevens and reached the end of the valley but mallory had roughly refused him permission brutally he had told panayis that he was far too valuable to be left there and that the chances of the alpenkorps picking that cave out of a score of others were pretty remote ma lory had hated having to talk to him like that but there had been no time for gentle blandishments and panayis must have seen his point for he had made neither protest nor stuggie when miller and andrea picked him up and helped him to limp through the cave the limp mallory had noticed had been much less noticeable then perhaps because of the assistance perhaps because now that he had been baulked of the chance of killing a few more germans it had been pointless to exaggerate his hurt they had barely cleared the mouth of the cave on the other side and were making their way down the treetufted sloping valley side towards the sea the dark sheen of the aegean clearly visible in the gloom when louki hearing something had gestured them all to silence almost immediately mallory too heard it a soft guttural voice occasionally lost in the crunch of approaching feet on gravel had seen that they were providentially screened by some stunted trees given the order to stop and sworn in quick anger as he had heard the soft thud and barely muffled cry behind them he had gone back to investigate and found panayis stretched on the ground unconscious miller who had been helping him along had explained that mallory had halted them so suddenly that hed bumped into panayis that the greeks bad leg had given beneath him throwing him heavily his head striking a stone as he had fallen mallory had stooped down in instantly renewed suspicion panayis was a throwback a naturalborn killer and he was quite capable of faking an accident if he thought he could turn it to his advantage line a few more of the enemy up on the sights of his rifle but there had been no fake about that the bruised and bloodied gash above the temple was all too real the german patrol having had no inkling of their presence moved noisily up the valley till they had finally gone out of earshot louki had thought that the commandant in navarone was becoming desperate trying to seal off every available exit from the devils playground mallory had thought it unlikely but had not stayed to argue the point five minutes later they had cleared the mouth of the valley and in another five had not only reached the coast road but silenced and bound two sentries the drivers probably who had been guarding a truck and command car parked by the roadside stripped them of denims and helmets and bundled them out of sight behind some bushes the trip into navarone had been ridiculously simple but the entire lack of opposition was easily understandable because of the complete unexpectedness of it all seated beside mallory on the front seat clad like mallory in captured clothes louki had driven the big car and driven it magnificently an accomplishment so unusual to find in a remote aegean island that mallory had been completely mystified until louki had reminded him that he had been eugene viachoss consulate chauffeur for many years the drive into town had taken less than twelve minutes not only did the little man handle the car superbly but he knew the road so well that he got the utmost possible out of the big machine most of the time without benefit of any lights at all not only a simple journey but quite uneventful they had passed several parked trucks at intervals along the road and less than two miles from the town itself had met a group of about twenty soldiers marching in the opposite direction in column of twos louki had slowed down it would have been highly suspicious had he accelerated endangering the lives of the marching men but had switched on the powerful headlights blinding them and blown raucously on the horn while mallory had leaned out of the righthand window sworn at them in perfect german and told them to get out of his damned way this they had done while the junior officer in charge had come smartly to attention throwing up his hand in punctilious salute immediately afterwards they had run through an area of highwalled terraced market gardens passed between a decaying byzantine church and a whitewashed orthodox monastery that faced each other incongruously across the same dusty road then almost at once were running through the lower part of the old town mallory had had a vague impression of narrow winding dimlit streets only inches wider than the car itself hugely cobbled and with almost kneehigh pavements then louki was making his way up an arched lane the car climbing steeply all the time he bad stopped abruptly and mallory had followed his quick survey of the darkened lane completely deserted though over an hour yet to curfew beside them had been a flight of white stone steps innocent of any handrail running up parallel to the wall of a house with a highly ornamented latticework grill protecting the outside landing at the top a still groggy panayis had led them up these stairs through a house he had known exactly where he was across a shallow roof down some more steps through a dark courtyard and into this ancient house where they were now louki had driven the car away even before they had reached the top of the stairs it was only now that mallory remembered that louki hadnt thought it worth while to say what he intended to do with the car still gazing out the windowless hole in the wall at the fortress gate mallory found himself hoping intensely that nothing would happen to the sadeyed little greek and not only because in his infinite resource and local knowledge he had been invaluable to them and was likely to prove so again all these considerations apart mallory had formed the deepest affection for him for his unvarying cheerfulness his enthusiasm his eagerness to help and to please above all for his complete disregard of self a thoroughly lovable little man and mallorys heart warmed to him more than he could say for panayis he thought sourly and then immediately regretted the thought it was no fault of panayiss that he was what he was and in his own dark and bitter way he had done as much for them as louki but the fact remained that he was sadly lacking in loukis warm humanity he lacked also loukis quick intelligence the calculated opportunism that amounted almost to genius it had been a brilliant idea on loukis part mallory mused that they should take over this abandoned house not that there had been any difficulty in finding an empty house since the germans had taken over the old castle the inhabitants of the town had left in their scores for margaritha and other outlying villages none more quickly than those who had lived in the town square itself the nearness of the fortress gates the sentries marching to and fro the neverceasing reminders that their freedom was a vanished thing so many had gone that more than half the houses on the west side of the square those nearest the fortress were now occupied by german officers but this same enforced close observation of the fortresss activities had been exactly what mallory had wanted when the time came to strike they had only yards to go and although any competent garrison commander would always be prepared against the unexpected mallory considered it unlikely indeed that any reasonable man could conceive of a sabotage group so suicidally minded as to spend an entire day within a literal stones throw of the fortress wall not that the house as such had much to recommend it as a home a dwelling place it was just about as uncomfortable as possible as dilapidated as it could be without actually falling down the west side of the square the side perched precariously on the clifftop and the south side were made up of fairly modern buildings of whitewashed stone and parian granite huddled together in the invariable fashion of houses in these island towns fiatroofed to catch as much as possible of the winter rains but the east side of the square where they were was made up of antiquated timber and turf houses of the kind much more often found in remote mountain vifiages the beaten earth floor beneath his feet was hummocky uneven and the previous occupants had used one corner of it obviously for a variety of purposes not least as a refuse dump the ceiling was of roughhewn blackened beams more or less covered with planks these in turn being covered with a thick layer of trodden earth from previous experience of such houses in the white mountains mallory knew that the roof would leak like a sieve whenever the rain came on across one end of the room was a solid ledge some thirty inches high a ledge that served after the fashion of similar structures in eskimo igloos as bed table or settee as the occasion demanded the room was completely bare of furniture mallory started as someone touched him on the shoulder and turned round miller was behind him munching away steadily the remains of a bottle of wine in his hand better get some chow boss he advised ill take a gander through this hole from time to time right you are dusty thanks mallory moved gingerly towards the back of the room it was almost pitch dark inside and they dared not risk a light and felt his way till he brought up against the ledge the tireless andrea had gone through their provisions and prepared a meal of sorts dried figs honey cheese garlic sausages and pounded roast chestnuts a horrible mixture mallory thought but the best andrea could do besides he was too hungry ravenously so to worry about such niceties as the pleasing of his palate and by the time he had washed it down with some of the local wine that louki and panayis bad provided the previous day the sweetlyresinous rawness of the drink had obliterated every other taste carefully shielding the match with his hand mallory lit a cigarette and began to explain for the first time his plan for entering the fortress he did not have to bother lowering his voice a couple of looms in the next house one of the few occupied ones left on that side of the square clacked incessantly throughout the evening mallory had a shrewd suspicion that this was more of loukis doing although it was difficult to see how he could have got word through to any of his friends but mallory was content to accept the situation as it was to concentrate on making sure that the others understood his insttuctions apparently they did for there were no questions for a few minutes the talk became general the usually taciturn casey brown having the most to say complaining bitterly about the food the drink his injured leg and the hardness of the bench where he wouldnt be able to sleep a wink all night long mallory grinned to himself but said nothing casey brown was definitely on the mend i reckon weve talked enough gentlemen mallory slid off the bench and stretched himself god he was tired our first and last chance to get a decent nights sleep two hour watches ill take the first by yourself it was miller caffing softly from the other end of the room dont you think we should share watches boss one for the front one for the back besides you know were all pretty well done up one man by himself might fall asleep he sounded so anxious that mallory laughed not a chance dusty each man will keep watch by the window there and if he falls asleep hell damn soon wake up when he hits the floor and its because were so darned bushed that we cant afford to have anyone lose sleep unnecessarily myself first then you then panayis then casey then andrea yeah i suppose thatll be ok miller conceded grudgingly he put something hard and cold into his hand mallory recognised it at once it was millers most cherished possession his silenced automatic just sos you can fill any nosy customers full of little holes without wakin the whole town he ambled off to the back of the room lit a cigarette smoked it quietly for a few moments then swung his legs up on the bench within five minutes everyone except the silently watchful man at the window was sound asleep two or three minutes later mallory jerked to unmoving attention as he heard a stealthy sound outsidefrom the back of the house he thought the clacking of the looms next door had stopped and the house was very still again there came the noise unmistakable this time a gentle tapping at the door at the end of the passage that led from the back of the room remain there my captain it was andreas soft murmur and mallory marveled for the hundredth time at andreas ability to rouse himself from the deepest of sleeps at the slightest alien sound the violence of a thunderstorm would have left him undisturbed i will see to it it must be louki it was louki the little man was panting near exhaustion but extraordinarily pleased with himself gratefully he drank the cup of wine that andrea poured for him damned glad to see you back again mallory said sincerely how did it go someone after you mallory could almost see him drawing himself up to his full height in the darkness as if any of these clumsy fools could see louki even on a moonlit night far less catch him he said indignantly he paused to draw some deep breaths no no major i knew you would be worried about me so i ran back all the way well nearly all the way he amended i am not so young as i was major mallory all the way from where mallory asked he was glad of the darkness that hid his smile from vygos it is an old castle that the franks built there many generations ago about two miles from here along the coast road to the east he paused to drink another mouthful of wine more than two miles i would say and i only walked twice a minute at a time on the way back mallory had the impression that louki already regretted his momentary weakness in admitting that he was no longer a young man and what did you do there mallory asked i was thinking after i left you louki answered indirectly me i am always thinking he explained it is a habit of mine i was thinking that when the soldiers who are looking for us out in the devils playground find out that the car is gone they will know that we are no longer in that accursed place yes mallory agreed carefully yes they will know that then they will say to themselves ha those verdammt englanders have little time left they will know that we will know that they have little hope of catching us in the island panayis and i we know every rock and tree and path and cave so all they can do is to make sure that we do not get into the town they will block every road leading in and tonight is our last chance to get in you follow me he asked anxiously im trying very hard but first but first they will make sure we are not in the town they would be fools to block the roads if we were already in the town they must make sure we are not in the town and so the search the very great search with how do you say the teethcomb mallory nodded his head in slow understanding im afraid hes right andrea i too fear so andrea said unhappily we should have thought of this but perhaps we could hide the rooftops or with a teethcomb i said louki interrupted impatiently but all is well i louki have thought it all out i can smell rain there will be clouds over the moon before long and it will be safe to move you do not want to know what i have donà with the car major mallory louki was enjoying himself immensely forgotten all about it mallory confessed what did you do with the car i left it in the courtyard of vygos castle then i emptied all the petrol from the tank and poured it over the car then i struck a match you did what mallory was incredulous i struck a match i think i was standing too near the car for i do not seem to have any eyebrows left louki sighed a pity it was such a splendid machine then he brightened but before god major it burned magnificently mallory stared at him why on earth it is simple louki explained patiently by this time the men out in the devils playground must know that their car has been stolen they see the fire they hurry back to how do you say investigate so investigate they wait till the fire dies down they investigate again no bodies no bones in the car so they search the castle and what do they find there was silence in the room nothing louki said impatiently they find nothing and then they search the countryside for half a mile around and what do they find again nothing so then they know that they have been fooled and that we are in the town and will come to search the town with the teethcomb mallory murmured with the teethcomb and what do they find louki paused then hurried on before anyone could steal his thunder once again they will find nothing he said triumphantly and why for by then the rain will have come the moon will have vanished the explosives will be hidden and we will be gone gone where mallory felt dazed where but to vygos castle major mallory never while night follows day will they think to look for us there mallory looked at him in silence for long seconds without speaking then turned to andrea captain jensens only made one mistake so far he murmured he picked the wrong man to lead this expedition not that it matters anyway with louki here on our side how can we lose mallory lowered his rucksack gently to the earthen roof straightened and peered up into the darkness both hands shielding his eyes from the first drizzle of rain even from where they stood on the crumbling roof of the house nearest the fortress on the east side of the square the wall stretched fifteen perhaps twenty feet above their heads the wickedly out and downcurving spikes that topped the wall were all but lost in the darkness there she is dusty mallory murmured nothing to it nothin to it miller was horrified ive ive gotta get over that youd have a ruddy hard time going through it mallory answered briefly he grinned clapped miller on the back and prodded the rucksack at his feet we chuck this rope up the hook catches you shin smartly up and bleed to death on those six strands of barbed wire miller interrupted lould says theyre the biggest barbs hes ever seen well use the tent for padding mallory said soothingly i have a very delicate skin boss miller complained nothin short of a spring mattress well youve only an hour to find one mallory said indifferently louki had estimated that it would be at least an hour before the search party would clear the northern part of the town give himself and andrea a chance to begin a diversion come on lets cache this stuff and get out of here well shove the rucksacks in this corner and cover em with earth take the rope out first though well have no time to start undoing packs when we get back here miller dropped to his knees hands fumbling with straps then exclaimed in sudden annoyance this cant be the pack he muttered in disgust abruptly his voice changed here wait a minute though whats up dusty miller didnt answer immediately for a few seconds his hands explored the contents of the pack then he straightened the slowburnin fuse boss his voice was blurred with anger with a vicious anger that astonished mallory its gone what mallory stooped began to search through the pack it cant be dusty it just cant dammit to hell man you packed the stuff yourself sure i did boss miller grated and then some crawlin bastard comes along behind my back and unpacks it again impossible mallory protested its just downright impossible dusty you closed that rucksack i saw you do it in the grove this morning and louki has had it all the time since then and id trust louki with my life so would i boss maybe were both wrong mallory went on quietly maybe you did miss it out were both helluva tired dusty miller looked at him queerly said nothing for a moment then began to swear again its my own fault boss my own gawddamned fault what do you mean your own fault heavens above man i was there when mallory broke off rose quickly to his feet and stared through the darkness at the south side of the square a single shot had rung out there the whiplash crack of a carbine followed the thin high whine of a ricochet and then silence mallory stood quite still hands clenched by his sides over ten minutes had passed since he and miller had left panayis to guide andrea and brown to the castle vygos they should have been well away from the square by this time and almost certainly louki wouldnt be down there mallorys instructions to him had been explicit to hide the remainder of the tnt blocks in the roof and then wait there to lead himself and miller to the keep but something could have gone wrong something could always go wrong or a trap maybe a ruse but what kind of trap the sudden offbeat stammering of a heavy machinegun stilled his thoughts and for a moment or two he was all eyes and straining ears and then another and lighter machinegun cut in just for a few seconds as abruptly as they had started both guns died away together mallory waited no longer get the stuff together again he whispered urgently were taking it with us somethings gone wrong within thirty seconds they had ropes and explosives back in their knapsacks had strapped them on their backs and were on their way bent almost double careful to make no noise whatsoever they ran across the rooftops towards the old house where they had hidden earlier in the evening where they were now to rendezvous with louki still running they were only feet away from the house when they saw his shadowy figure rise up only it wasnt louki mallory realised at once it was far too tall for louki and without breaking step he catapulted the horizontal driving weight of his pounds at the unknown figure in a homicidal tackle his shoulder catching the man just below the breastbone emptying every last particle of air from the mans lungs with an explosive agonised whoosh a second later both of millers sinewy hands were clamped round the mans neck slowly choking him to death and he would have choked to death neither of the two men were in any mind for halfmeasures had not mallory prompted by some fugitive intuition stooped low over the contorted face the staring protruding eyes choked back a cry of sudden horror dusty he whispered hoarsely for gods sake stop let him go its panayis miller didnt hear him in the gloom his face was like stone his head sunk farther and farther between hunching shoulders as he tightened his grip strangling the greek in a weird and savage silence its panayis you bloody fool panayis mallorys mouth was at the americans ear his hands clamped round the others wrists as he tried to drag him off panayiss throat he could hear the muffled drumming of panayiss heels on the turf of the roof tore at millers wrists with all his strength twice before he had heard that sound as a man had died under andreas great hands and he knew with sudden certainty that panayis would go the same way and soon if he didnt make miller understand but all at once miller understood relaxed heavily straightened up still kneeling hands hanging limply by his sides breathing deeply he stared down in silence at the man at his feet what the hells the matter with you mallory demanded softly deaf or blind or both just one of these things i guess miller rubbed the back of a hand across his forehead his face empty of expression sorry boss sorry why the hell apologise to me mallory looked away from him looked down at panayis the greek was sitting up now hands massaging his bruised throat sucking in long draughts of air in great whooping gasps but maybe panayis here might appreciate apologies can wait miller interrupted brusquely ask him whats happened to louki mallory looked at him for a moment made to reply changed his mind translated the question he listened to panayiss halting answer it obviously hurt him even to try to speak and his mouth tightened in a hard bitter line miller watched the fractional slump of the new zealanders shoulders felt he could wait no longer well what is it boss somethins happened to louki is that it yes mallory said tonelessly theyd only got as far as the lane at the back when they found a small german patrol blocking their way louki tried to draw them off and the machinegunner got him through the chest andrea got the machinegunner and took louki away panayis says hell die for sure chapter wednesday night the three men cleared the town without any difficulty striking out directly across country for the castle vygos and avoiding the main road it was beginning to rain now heavily persistently and the ground was mired and sodden the few ploughed fields they crossed almost impassable they had just struggled their way through one of these and could just see the dim outline of the keep less than a crosscountry mile from the town instead of loukis exaggerated estimate when they passed by an abandoned earthen house and miller spoke for the first time since they had left the town square of navarone im bushed boss his head was sunk on his chest and his breathing was laboured man millers on the downward path i reckon and the legs are gone couldnt we squat inside here for a couple of minutes boss and have a smoke mallory looked at him in surprise thought how desperately weary his own legs felt and nodded in reluctant agreement miller wasnt the man to complain unless he was near exhaustion okay dusty i dont suppose a minute or two will harm he translated quickly into greek and led the way inside miller at his heels complaining at length about his advancing age once inside mallory felt his way across to the inevitable wooden bunk sat down gratefully lit a cigarette then looked up in puzzlement miller was still on his feet walking slowly round the hut tapping the walls as he went why dont you sit down mallory asked irritably that was why you came in here in the first place wasnt it no boss not really the drawl was very pronounced just a lowdown trick to get us inside twothree very special things i want to show you very special what the devil are you trying to tell me bear with me captain mallory miller requested formally bear with me just a few minutes im not wastin your time you have my word captain mallory very well mallory was mystified but his confidence in miller remained unshaken as you wish only dont be too long about it thanks boss the strain of formality was too much for miller it wont take long therell be a lamp or candles in here you said the islanders never leave an abandoned house without em and a very useful superstition its been to us too mallory reached under the bunk with his torch straightened his back two or three candles here i want a light boss no windows i checked ok light one and ill go outside to see if theres anything showing mallory was completely in the dark about the americans intentions he felt miller didnt want him to say anything and there was a calm surety about him that precluded questioning mallory was back in less than a minute not a chink to be seen from the outside he reported fair enough thanks boss miller lit a second candle then slipped the rucksack straps from his shoulders laid the pack on the bunk and stood in silence for a moment mallory looked at his watch looked back at miller you were going to show me something he prompted yeah thats right three things i said he dug into the pack brought out a little black box hardly bigger than a matchbox exhibit a boss mallory looked at it curiously whats that clockwork fuse miller began to unscrew the back panel hate the damned things always make me feel like one of those bolshevik characters with a dark cloak a moustache like loukis and carryin one of those black cannonball things with a sputterin fuse stickin outa it but it works he had the back off the box now examining the mechanism in the light of his torch but this one doesnt not any more he added softly clocks ok but the contact arms been bent right back this thing could tick till kingdom come and it couldnt even set off a firework but how on earth exhibit b miller didnt seem to hear him he opened the detonator box gingerly lifted a fuse from its felt and cottonwool bed and examined it closely under his torch then he looked at mallory again fulminate of mercury boss only seventyseven grains but enough to blow your fingers off unstable as hell too the little tap will set it off he let it fall to the ground and mallory winced and drew back involuntarily as the american smashed a heavy heel down on top of it but there was no explosion nothing at all aint workin so good either is it boss a hundred to one the rest are all empty too he fished out a pack of cigarettes lit one and watched the smoke eddy and swirl above the heat of the candles he slid the cigarettes into his pocket there was a third thing you were going to show me mallory said quietly yeah i was goin to show you somethin else the voice was very gentle and mallory felt suddenly cold i was goin to show you a spy a traitor the most vicious twistin murderin doublecrossin bastard ive ever known the american had his hand out of his pocket now the silenced automatic sitting snugly against his palm the muzzle trained over panayiss heart he went on more gently than ever judas iscariot had nothin on the boyfriend here boss take your coat off panayis what the devil are you doing are you crazy mallory started forward halfangry halfamazed but brought up sharply against millers extended arm rigid as a bar of iron what bloody nonsense is this he doesnt understand english dont he though then why was he out of the cave like a flash when casey reported hearin sounds outside and why was he the first to leave the carob grove this afternoon if he didnt understand your order take your coat off judas or ill shoot you through the arm ill give you two seconds mallory made to throw his arms round miller and bring him to the ground but halted in midstep as he caught the look on panayiss face teeth bared murder glaring out from the coalblack eyes never before had mallory seen such malignity in a human face a malignity that yielded abruptly to shocked pain and disbelief as the bullet smashed into his upper arm just below the shoulder two seconds and then the other arm miller said woodenly but panayis was already tearing off his jacket the dark bestial eyes never leaving millers face mallory looked at him shivered involuntarily looked at miller indifference he thought that was the only word to describe the look on the americans face indifference unaccountably mallory felt colder than ever turn round the automatic never wavered slowly panayis turned round miller stepped forward caught the black shirt by the collar ripped it off his back with one convulsive jerk waal waal now whoever woulda thought it miller drawled surprise surprise surprise remember boss this was the character that was publicly flogged by the germans in crete flogged until the white of his ribs showed through his backs in a heliuva state isnt it mallory looked but said nothing completely off balance his mind was in a kaleidoscopic whirl his thoughts struggling to adjust themselves to a new set of circumstances a complete reversal of all his previous thinking not a scar not a single blemish marked the dark smoothness of that skin just a natural quick healer miller murmured only a nasty twisted mind like mine would think that he had been a german agent in crete became known to the allies as a fifth columnist lost his usefulness to the germans and was shipped back to navarone by fast motorlaunch under cover of night floggin islandhoppin his way back here in a rowboat just a lot of bloody eyewash miller paused and his mouth twisted i wonder how many pieces of silver he made in crete before they got wise to him but heavens above man youre not going to condemn someone just for shooting a line mallory protested strangely he didnt feel nearly as vehement as he sounded how many survivors would there be among the allies if not convinced yet huh miller waved his automatic negligently at panayis roll up the left trouser leg iscariot two seconds again panayis did as he was told the black venomous eyes never looked away from millers he rolled the dark cloth up to the knee farther yet thats my little boy miller encouraged him and now take that bandage off right off a few seconds passed then miller shook his head sadly a ghastly wound boss a ghastly wound im beginning to see your point mallory said thoughtfully the dark sinewy leg wasnt even scratched but why on earth simple four reasons at least junior here is a treacherous slimy bastard no self respectin rattlesnake would come within a mile of him but hes a clever bastard he faked his leg so he could stay in the cave in the devils playground when the four of us went back to stop the alpenkorps from comin up the slope below the carob grove why frightened hed stop something miller shook his head impatiently junior heres scared o nothin he stayed behind to write a note later on he used his leg to drop behind us some place and leave the note where it could be seen early on this must have been note probably said that we would come out at such and such a place and would they kindly send a welcomin committee to meet us there they sent it remember it was their car we swiped to get to town that was the first time i got real suspicious of the boyfriend after hed dropped behind he made up on us again real quick too damn quick for a man with a game leg but it wasnt till i opened the rucksack in the square this evenin that i really knew you only mentioned two reasons mallory prompted comin to the others number three he could fall behind when the welcomin committee opened up in front iscariot here wasnt goin to get himself knocked off before he collected his salary and number four remember that real touchin scene when he begged you to let him stay at the far end of the cave that led into the valley we came out goin to do his horatioonthebridge act going to show them the right cave to pick you mean check after that he was gettin pretty desperate i still wasnt sure but i was awful suspicious boss didnt know what he might try next so i clouted him good and hard when that last patrol came up the valley i see mallory said quietly i see indeed he looked sharply at miller you should have told me you had no right i was goin to boss but i hadnt a chance junior here was around all the time i was just startin to tell you half an hour back when the guns started up mallory nodded in understanding how did you happen on all this in the first place dusty juniper miller said succinctly remember thats how turzig said he came to find us he smelt the juniper thats right we were burning juniper sure we were but he said he smelt it on kostos and the wind was blowin off kostos all day long my god mallory whispered of course of course and i missed it completely but jerry knew we were there how waal he aint got second sight no more than i have so he was tipped off he was tipped off by the boyfriend here remember i said hed talked to some of his pals in margaritha when we went down there for the supplies miller spat in disgust fooled me all along the line pals i didnt know how right i was sure they were his pals his german pals and that food he said he got from the commandants kitchen he got it from the kitchen all right almost certainly he goes in and asks for it and old skoda hands him his own suitcase to stow it in but the german he killed on the way back to the village surely to god panayis killed him there was a tired certainty in millers voice whats another corpse to sunshine here probably stumbled on the poor bastard in the dark and had to kill him local colour louki was there remember and he couldnt have louki gettin suspicious he would have blamed it on louki anyway the guy aint human and remember when he was flung into skodas room in margaritha along with louki blood pourin from a wound in his head mallory nodded highgrade ketchup probably also from the commandants kitchen miller said bitterly if skoda had failed by every other means there would still have been the boyfriend here as a stoolpigeon why he never asked louki where the explosives were i dont know obviously he didnt know louki knew mebbe but one thing the bastard did know how to use a mirror musta heliographed the garrison from the carob grove and given our position no other way boss then sometime this morning he must have got hold of my rucksack whipped out all the slow fuse and fixed the clock fuse and detonators he should have had his hands blown off tamperin with them fulminates lord only knows where he learnt to handle the damn things crete mallory said positively the germans would see to that a spy who cant also double as a saboteur is no good to them and he was very good to them miller said softly very very good theyre gonna miss their little pal iscariot here was a very smart baby indeed he was except tonight he should have been smart enough to know that at least one of us would be suspicious he probably was miller interrupted but he was misinformed i think loukis unhurt i think junior here talked louki into letting him stay in his place louki was always a bit scared of him then he strolled across to his pals at the gate told em to send a strongarm squad out to vygos to pick up the others asked them to fire a few shots he was very strong on local colour was our loyal little pal then strolls back across the square hoists himself up on the roof and waits to tip off his pals as soon as we came in the back door but louki forgot to tell him just one thing that we were goin to rendezvous on the roof of the house not inside so the boyfriend here lurks away for all hes worth up top waiting to signal his mends ten to one that hes got a torch in his pocket mallory picked up panayiss coat and examined it briefly he has thats it then miller lit another cigarette watched the match burn down slowly to his fingers then looked up at panayis how does it feel to know that youre goin to die panayis to feel like all them poor bastards whove felt just as youre feeling now just before they died all the men in crete all the guys in the seaborne and air landings on navarone who died because they thought you were on their side how does it feel panayis panayis said nothing his left hand clutching his torn right arm trying to stem the blood he stood there motionless the dark evil face masked in hate the lips still drawn back in that less than human snarl there was no fear in him none at all and mallory tensed himself for the last despairing attempt for life that panayis must surely make and then he had looked at miller and knew there would be no attempt because there was a strange sureness and inevitabifity about the american an utter immobility of hand and eye that somehow precluded even the thought far less the possibility of escape the prisoner has nothin to say miller sounded very tired i suppose i should say somethin i suppose i should give out with a long spiel about me bein the judge the jury and the executioner but i dont think ill bother myself dead men make poor witnesses mebbe its not your fault panayis mebbe theres an awful good reason why you came to be what you are gawd only knows i dont and i dont much care there are too many dead men im goin to kill you panayis and im goin to kill you now miller dropped his cigarette ground it into the floor of the hut nothin at all to say and he had nothing at all to say the hate the malignity of the black eyes said it all for him and miller nodded just once as if in secret understanding carefully accurately he shot panayis through the heart twice blew out the candles turned his back and was halfway towards the door before the man had crashed to the ground i am afraid i cannot do it andrea louki sat back wearily shook his head in despair i am very sorry andrea the knots are too tight no matter andrea rolled over from his side to a sitting position tried to ease his tightlybound legs and wrists they are cunning these germans and wet cords can only be cut characteristically he made no mention of the fact that only a couple of minutes previously he had twisted round to reach the cords on loukis wrist and undone them with half a dozen tugs of his steeltrap fingers we will think of something else he looked away from louki glanced across the room in the faint light of the smoking oillamp that stood by the grille door a light so yellow so dim that casey brown trussed like a barnyard fowl and loosely secured like himself by a length of rope to the iron hooks suspended from the roof was no more than a shapeless blur in the opposite corner of the stoneflagged room andrea smiled to himself without mirth taken prisoner again and for the second time that day and with the same ease and surprise that gave no chance at all of resistance completely unsuspecting they had been captured in an upper room seconds after casey had finished talking to cairo the patrol had known exactly where to find them and with their leaders assurance that it was all over with his gloating explanation of the part panayis had played the unexpectedness the success of the coup was all too easy to understand and it was difficult not to believe his assurance that neither mallory nor miller had a chance but the thought of ultimate defeat never occurred to andrea his gaze left casey brown wandered round the room took in what he could see of the stone walls and floor the hooks the ventilation ducts the heavy grille door a dungeon a torture dungeon one would have thought but andrea had seen such places before a castle they called this place but it was really only an old keep no more than a manor house built round the crenelated towers and the longdead franldsh nobles who had built these keeps had lived well no dungeon this andrea knew but simply the larder where they had hung their meat and game and done without windows and light for the sake of the light andrea twisted round looked at the smoking oil lamp his eyes narrowing louki he called softly the little greek turned round to look at him can you reach the lamp i think so yes i can take the glass off andrea whispered use a cloth it will be hot then wrap it in the cloth hit it on the floor gently the glass is thick you can cut me loose in a minute or two louki stared at him for an uncomprehending moment then nodded in understanding he shuffled across the floor his legs were still bound reached out then halted his hand abruptly only inches from the glass the peremptory metallic clang had been only feet away and he raised his head slowly to see what had caused it he could have stretched out his hand touched the barrel of the mauser that protruded threateningly through the bars of the grille door again the guard rattled the rifle angrily between the bars shouted something he didnt understand leave it alone louki andrea said quietly his voice was tranquil unshadowed by disappointment come back here our mend outside is not too pleased obediently louki moved back heard the guttural voice again rapid and alarmed this time the rattle as the guard withdrew his rifle quickly from the bars of the door the urgent pounding of his feet on the flagstones outside as he raced up the passage whats the matter with our little friend casey brown was as lugubrious as weary as ever he seems upset he is upset andrea smiled hes just realised that loukis hands are untied well why doesnt he tie them up again slow in the head he may be but he is no fool andrea explained this could be a trap and hes gone for his friends almost at once they heard a thud like the closing of a distant door the sound of more than one pair of feet running down the passage the tinny rattling of keys on a ring the rasp of a key against the lock a sharp click the squeal of rusty hinges and then two soldiers were in the room dark and menacing with their jackboots and ready guns two or three seconds elapsed while they looked round them accustoming their eyes to the gloom then the man nearest the door spoke a terrible thing boss nothin short of deplorable leave em alone for a couple of minutes and see what happens the whole damn bunch tied up like houdini on an off night there was a brief incredulous silence then all three were sitting upright staring at them brown recovered first high time too he complained thought you were never going to get here what he means is that he thought we were never going to see you again andrea said quietly neither did i but here you are safe and sound yes mallory nodded thanks to dusty and his nasty suspicious mind that cottoned on to panayis while all the rest of us were asleep where is he louki asked panayis miller waved a negligent hand we left him behind he met with a sorta accident he was across at the other side of the room now carefully cutting the cords that pinioned browns injured leg whistling tunelessly as he sawed away with his sheath knife mallory too was busy slicing through andreas bonds explaining rapidly what had happened listening to the big greeks equally concise account of what had befallen the others in the keep and then andrea was on his feet massaging his numbed hands looking across at miller that whistling my captain it sounds terrible and what is worse it is very loud the guards no worry there mallory said grimly they never expected to see dusty and myself again they kept a poor watch he turned round to look at brown now hobbling across the floor hows the leg casey fine sir brown brushed it aside as of no importance i got through to cairo tonight sir the report itll have to wait casey we must get out as fast as we can you all right louki i am heartbroken major mallory that a countryman of mine a trusted friend that too will have to wait come on you are in a great hurry andrea protested mildly they were already out in the passage stepping over the cell guard lying in a crumpled heap on the floor surely if theyre all like our friend here no danger from this quarter mallory interrupted impatiently the soldiers in the town theyre bound to know by now that weve either missed panayis or disposed of him in either case theyll know that were certain to come hotfooting out here work it out for yourself theyre probably halfway here already and if they do come he broke off stared at the smashed generator and the ruins of casey browns transmitter set lying in one corner of the entrance hail done a pretty good job on these havent they he said bitterly thank the lord miller said piously all the less to tote around is what i say if you could only see the state of my back with that damned generator sir brown had caught mallorys arm an action so foreign to the usually punctilious petty officer that mallory halted in surprise sir its terribly important the report i mean you must listen sir the action the deadly earnestness caught and held mallorys fully attention he turned to face brown with a smile ok casey lets have it he said quietly things cant possibly be any worse than they are now they can sir there was something tired defeated about casey brown and the great stone hail seemed strangely chill im afraid they can sir i got through tonight firstclass reception captain jensen himself and he was hopping mad been waiting all day fbr us to come on the air asked how things were and i told him that you were outside the fortress just then and hoped to be inside the magazine in an hour or so go on he said that was the best news hed ever had he said his information had been wrong hed been fooled that the invasion fleet didnt hold up overnight in the cyclades that they had come straight through under the heaviest air and eboat escort ever seen in the med and are due to hit the beaches on kheros some time before dawn tomorrow he said our destroyers had been waiting to the south all day moved up at dusk and were waiting word from him to see whether they would attempt the passage of the maidos straits i told him maybe something could go wrong but he said not with captain mallory and miller inside and besides he wasnt he couldnt risk the lives of twelve hundred men on kheros just on the off chance that he might be wrong brown broke off suddenly and looked down miserably at his feet no one else in the hail moved or made any sound at all go on mallory repeated in a whisper his face was very pale thats all sir thats all there is the destroyers are coming through the straits at midnight brown looked down at his luminous watch midnight four hours to go oh god midnight mallory was stricken his eyes for the moment unseeing ivoryknuckled hands clenched in futility and despair theyre coming through at midnight god help them god help them all now chapter wednesday night eightthirty his watch said eightthirty exactly half an hour to curfew mallory flattened himself on the roof pressed himself as closely as possible against the low retaining wall that almost touched the great sheering sides of the fortress swore softly to himself it only required one man with a torch in his hand to look over the top of the fortress wall a catwalk ran the whole length of the inside of the wall four feet from the top and it would be the end of them all the wandering beam of a torch and they were bound to be seen it was impossible not to be seen he and dusty miller the american was stretched out behind him and clutching the big truck battery in his arms were wide open to the view of anyone who happened to glance down that way perhaps they should have stayed with the others a couple of roofs away with casey and louki the one busy tying spaced knots in a rope the other busy splicing a bent wire hook on to a long bamboo they had torn from a bamboo hedge just outside the town where they had hurriedly taken shelter as a convoy of three trucks had roared past them heading for the castle vygos eight thirtytwo what the devil was andrea doing down there mallory wondered irritably and at once regretted his irritation andrea wouldnt waste an unnecessary second speed was vital haste fatal it seemed unlikely that there would be any officers inside from what they had seen practically half the garrison were combing either the town or the countryside out in the direction of vygos but if there were and even one gave a cry it would be the end mallory stared down at the burn on the back of his hand thought of the truck they had set on fire and grinned wryly to himself setting the truck on fire had been his only contribution to the nights performance so far all the other credit went to either andrea or miller it was andrea who had seen in this house on the west side of the square one of several adjoining houses used as officers billets the only possible answer to their problem it was miller now lacking all timefuses clockwork generator and every other source of electric power who had suddenly stated that he must have a battery and again it was andrea hearing the distant approach of a truck who had blocked the entrance to the long driveway to the keep with heavy stones from the flanking pillars forcing the soldiers to abandon their truck at the gates and run up the drive towards their house to overcome the driver and his mate and bundle them senseless into a ditch had taken seconds only scarcely more time than it had taken miller to unscrew the terminals of the heavy battery find the inevitable jerrican below the tailboard and pour the contents over engine cab and body the truck had gone up in a roar and whoosh of flames as louki had said earlier in the night setting petrolsoaked vehicles on fire was not without its dangers the charred patch on his hand stung painfully but again as louki had said it had burned magnificently a pity in a way it had attracted attention to their escape sooner than was necessary but it had been vital to destroy the evidence the fact that a battery was missing mallory had too much experience of and respect for the germans ever to underrate them they could put two and two together better than most he felt miller tug at his ankle started twisted round quickly the american was pointing beyond him and he turned again and saw andrea signalling to him from the raised trap in the far corner he had been so engrossed in his thinking the giant greek so catlike in his silence that he had completely failed to notice his arrival mallory shook his head momentarily angered at his own abstraction took the battery from miller whispered to him to get the others then edged slowly across the roof as noiselessly as possible the sheer deadweight of the battery was astonishing it felt as if it weighed a ton but andrea plucked it from his hands lifted it over the trap coaming tucked it under one arm and nimbly descended the stairs to the tiny hailway as if it weighed nothing at all andrea moved out through the open doorway to the covered balcony that ovetlooked the darkened harbour almost a hundred vertical feet beneath mallory following close behind touched him on the shoulder as he lowered the battery gently to the ground any trouble he asked softly none at all my keith andrea straightened the house is empty i was so surprised that i went over it all twice just to make sure fine wonderful i suppose the whole bunch of them are out scouring the country for us interesting to know what they would say if they were told we were sitting in their front parlour they would never believe it andrea said without hesitation this is the last place they would ever think to look for us ive never hoped so much that youre right mallory murmured fervently he moved across to the latticed railing that enclosed the balcony gazed down into the blackness beneath his feet and shivered a long long drop and it was very cold that sluicing vertical rain chilled one to the bone he stepped back shook the railing this thing strong enough do you think he whispered i dont know my keith i dont know at all andrea shrugged i hope so i hope so mallory echoed it doesnt really matter this is how it has to be again he leaned far out over the railing twisted his head to the right and upwards in the rainfilled gloom of the night he could just faintly make out the still darker gloom of the mouth of the cave housing the two great guns perhaps forty feet away from where he stood at least thirty feet higher and all vertical cliffface between as far as accessibility went the cave mouth could have been on the moon he drew back turned round as he heard brown limping on to the balcony go to the front of the house and stay there casey will you stay by the window leave the frontt door unlocked if we have any visitors let them in club em knife em no guns brown murmured is that it sir thats it casey just leave this little thing to me brown said grimly he hobbled away through the doorway mallory turned to andrea i make it twentythree minutes i too twentythree minutes to nine good luck mallory murmured he grinned at miller come on dusty opening time five minutes later mallory and miller were seated in a taverna just off the south side of the town square despite the garish blue paint with which the tavernaris had covered everything in sight walls tables chairs shelves all in the same execrably vivid colour it was a gloomy illlit place as gloomy almost as the stern righteous magnificentlymoustached heroes of the wars of independence whose dark burning eyes glared down at them from a dozen faded prints scattered at eyelevel along the walls between each pair of portraits was a brightlycoloured wail advertisement for fixs beer the effect of the decor taken as a whole was indescribable and mallory shuddered to think what it would have been like had the tavernaris had at his disposal any illumination more powerful than the two smoking oil lamps placed on the counter before him as it was the gloom suited him well their dark clothes braided jackets tsantas and jackboots looked genuine enough mallory knew and the blackfringed turbans louki had mysteriously obtained for them looked as they ought to look in a tavern where every islander there about eight of them wore nothing else on their heads their clothes had been good enough to pass muster with the tavernaris but then even the keeper of a wine shop could hardly be expected to know every man in a town of five thousand and a patriotic greek as louki had declared this man to be wasnt going to lift even a faintly suspicious eyebrow as long as there were german soldiers present and there were germans present four of them sitting round a table near the counter which was why mallory had been glad of the semidarkness not he was certain that he and dusty miller had any reason to be physically afraid of these men louki had dismissed them contemptuously as a bunch of old women headquarters clerks mallory guessed who came to this tavern every night of the week but there was no point in sticking out their necks unnecessarily miller lit one of the pungent evilsmelling local cigarettes wrinkling his nose in distaste damn funny smell in this joint boss put your cigarette out mallory suggested you wouldnt believe it but the smell im smelling is a damn sight worse than that hashish mallory said briefly the curse of these island ports he nodded over towards a dark corner the lads of the village over there will be at it every night in life its all they live for do they have to make that gawddamned awful racket when theyre at it miller asked peevishly toscanini should see this lot mallory looked at the small group in the corner clustered round the young man playing a bouzouko a longnecked mandolin and singing the haunting nostalgic rembetika songs of the hashish smokers of the piraeus he supposed the music did have a certain melancholy lotusland attraction but right then it jarred on him one had to be in a certain twilit untroubled mood to appreciate that sort of thing and he had never felt less untroubled in his life i suppose it is a bit grim he admitted but at least it lets us talk together which we couldnt do if they all packed up and went home i wish to hell they would miller said morosely id gladly keep my mouth shut he picked distastefully at the meze a mixture of chopped olives liver cheese and apples on the plate before him as a good american and a bourbon drinker of long standing he disapproved strongly of the invariable greek custom of eating when drinking suddenly he looked up and crushed his cigarette against the table top for gawds sake boss how much longer mallory looked at him then looked away he knew exactly how dusty miller felt for he felt that way himself tense keyedup every nerve strung to the tautest pitch of efficiency so much depended on the next few minutes whether all their labour and their suffering had been necessary whether the men on kheros would live or die whether andy stevens had lived and died in vain mallory looked at miller again saw the nervous hands the deepened wrinkles round the eyes the tightly compressed mouth white at the outer corners saw all these signs of strain noted them and discounted them excepting andrea alone of all the men he had ever known he would have picked the lean morose american to be his companion that night or maybe even including andrea the finest saboteur in southern europe captain jensen had called him back in alexandria miller had come a long way from alexandria and he had come for this alone tonight was millers night mallory looked at his watch curfew in fifteen minutes he said quietly the balloon goes up in twelve minutes for us another four minutes to go miller nodded but said nothing he filled his glass again from the beaker in the middle of the table lit a cigarette mallory could see a nerve twitching high up in his temple and wondered dryly how many twitching nerves miller could see in his own face he wondered too how the crippled casey brown was getting on in the house they had just left in many ways he had the most responsible job of all and at the critical moment he would have to leave the door unguarded move back to the balcony one slip up there he saw miller look strangely at him and grinned crookedly this had to come off it just had to he thought of what must surely happen if he failed then shied away from the thought it wasnt good to think of these things not now not at this time he wondered if the other two were at their posts unmolested they should be the search party had long passed through the upper part of the town but you never knew what could go wrong there was so much that could go wrong and so easily mallory looked at his watch again he had never seen a second hand move so slowly he lit a last cigarette poured a final glass of wine listened without really hearing to the weird keening threnody of the rembetika song in the corner and then the song of the hashish singers died plaintively away the glasses were empty and mallory was on his feet time bringeth all things he murmured here we go again he sauntered easily towards the door calling good night to the tavernaris just at the doorway he paused began to search impatiently through his pockets as if he had lost something it was a windless night and it was raining he saw raining heavily the lances of rain bouncing inches off the cobbled street and the street itself was deserted as far as he could see in either direction satisfied mallory swung round with a curse forehead furrowed in exasperation started to walk back towards the table he had just left right hand now delving into the capacious inner pocket of his jacket he saw without seeming to that dusty miller was pushing his chair back rising to his feet and then mallory bad halted his face clearing and his hands no longer searching he was exactly three feet from the table where the four germans were sitting keep quite still he spoke in german his voice low but as steady as menacing as the navy colt balanced in his right hand we are desperate men if you move we will kill you for a full three seconds the soldiers sat immobile expressionless except for the shocked widening of their eyes and then there was a quick flicker of the eyelids from the man sitting nearest the counter a twitching of the shoulder and then a grunt of agonyas the bullet smashed into his upper arm the soft thud of millers silenced automatic couldnt have been heard beyond the doorway sorry boss miller apologised mebbe bes only sufferin from st vitus dance he looked with interest at the paintwisted face the blood welling darkly be tween the fingers clasped tightly over the wound but he looks kinda cured to me he is cured mallory said grimly he turned to the innkeeper a tall melancholy man with a thin face and mandarin moustache that drooped forlornly over either corner of his mouth spoke to him in the quick colloquial speech of the islands do these men speak greek the tavernaris shook his head completely unruffled and unimpressed he seemed to regard armed holdups in his tavern as the rule rather than the exception not them he said contemptuously english a little i think i am sure but not our language that i do know good i am a british intelligence officer have you a place where i can hide these men you shouldnt have done this the tavernaris protested mildly i will surely die for this oh no you wont mallory had slid across the counter his pistol boring into the mans midriff no one could doubt that the man was being threatened and violently threatened no one that is who couldnt see the broad wink that mallory had given the innkeeper im going to tie you up with them all right all right there is a trapdoor at the end of the counter here steps lead down to the cellar good enough ill find it by accident mallory gave him a vicious and all too convincing shove that sent the man staggering vaulted back across the counter walked over to the rembetika singers at the far corner of the room go home he said quickly it is almost curfew time anyway go out the back way and remember you have seen nothing no one you understand we understand it was the young bouzouko player who spoke he jerked his thumb at his companions and grinned bad men but good greeks can we help you no mallory was emphatic think of your families these soldiers have recognised you they must know you weli you and they are here most nights is that not so the young man nodded off you go then thank you all the same a minute later in the dim candlelit cellar miller prodded the soldier nearest him the one most like himself in height and build take your clothes off he ordered english pig the german snarled not english miller protested ill give you thirty seconds to get your coat and pants off the man swore at him viciously but made no move to obey miller sighed the german had guts but time was running out he took a careful bead on the soldiers hand and pulled the trigger again the soft plop and the man was staring down stupidly at the hole torn in the heel of his left hand mustnt spoil the nice uniforms must we miller asked conversationally he lifted the automatic until the soldier was staring down the barrel of the gun the next goes between the eyes the casual drawl carried complete conviction it wont take me long to undress you i guess but the man had already started to tear his uniform off sobbing with anger and the pain of his wounded hand less than another five minutes had passed when mallory clad like miller in german uniform unlocked the front door of the tavern and peered cautiously out the rain if anything was heavier than ever and there wasnt a soul in sight mallory beckoned miller to follow and locked the door behind him together the two men walked up the middle of the street making no attempt to seek either shelter or shadows fifty yards took them into the town square then left along the east side not breaking step as they passed the old house where they had hidden earlier in the evening not even as loukis hand appeared mysteriously behind the partly opened door a hand weighted down with two german army rucksacks rucksacks packed with rope fuses wire and high explosive a few yards farther on they stopped suddenly crouched down behind a couple of huge wine barrels outside a barbers shop gazed at the two armed guards in the arched gateway less than a hundred feet away as they shrugged into their packs and waited for their cue they had only moments to wait the timing had been splitsecond throughout mallory was just tightening the waistbelt of his rucksack when a series of explosions shook the centre of the town not three hundred yards away explosions followed by the vicious rattle of a machinegun then by further explosions andrea was doing his stuff magnificently with his grenades and homemade bombs both men suddenly shrank back as a broad white beam of light stabbed out from a platform high above the gateway a beam that paralleled the top of the wall to the east showed up every hooked spike and strand of barbed wire as clearly as sunlight mallory and miller looked at each other for a fleeting moment their faces grim panayis hadnt missed a thing they would have been pinned on these strands like flies on flypaper and cut to ribbons by machineguns mallory waited another halfminute touched millers arm rose to his feet and started running madly across the square the long hooked bamboo pressed close to his side the american pounding behind him in a few seeonds they had reached the gates of the fortress the startled guards running the last few feet to meet them every man to the street of steps mallory shouted those damned english saboteurs are trapped in a house dawn there weve got to have some mortars hurry man hurry in the name of god but the gate one of the two guards protested we cannot leave the gate the man had no suspidons none at all in the circumstances the near darkness the pouring rain the germanclad soldier speaking perfect german the obvious truth that there was a gunbattle being fought nearhand it would have been remarkable had he shown any signs of doubt idiot mallory screamed at him dummkopf what is there to guard against here the english swine are in the street of steps they must be destroyed for gods sake hurry he shouted desperately if they escape again itll be the russian front for all of us mallory had his hand on the mans shoulder now ready to push him on his way but his hand fell to his side unneeded the two men were already gone running pellmell across the square had vanished into the rain and the darkness already seconds later mallory and miller were deep inside the fortress of navarone everywhere there was complete confusion a bustling purposeful confusion as one would expect with the seasoned troops of the alpenkorps but confusion nevertheless with much shouting of orders blowing of whistles starting of truck engines sergeants running to and fro chivvying their men into marching order or into the waiting transports mallory and miller ran too once or twice through groups of men milling round the tailboard of a truck not that they were in any desperate hurry for themselves but nothing could have been more conspicuous and suspicious than the sight of a couple of men walking calmly along in the middle of all that urgent activity and so they ran heads down or averted whenever they passed through a pool of light miller cursing feelingly and often at the unaccustomed exercise they skirted two barrack blocks on their right then the powerhouse on their left then an ordnance depot on their right and then the abteilung garage on their left they were climbing now almost in darkness but mallory knew where he was to the inch he had so thoroughly memorised the closely tallying descriptions given him by vlachos and panayis that he would have been confident of finding his way with complete accuracy even if the darkness had been absolute whats that boss miller had caught mallory by the arm was pointing to a large uncompromisingly rectangular building that loomed gauntly against the horizon the local hoosegow water storage tank mallory said briefly panayis estimates theres half a million gallons in there magazine flooding in an emergency the magazines are directly below he pointed to a squat boxlike concrete structure a little farther on the only entrance to the magazine locked and guarded they were approaching the senior officers quarters now the commandant had his own flat on the second story directly overlooking the massive reinforced ferroconcrete control tower that controlled the two great guns below mallory suddenly stopped picked up a handful of dirt rubbed it on his face and told miller to do the same disguise he explained the experts would consider it a bit on the elementary side but itll have to do the lightings apt to be a bit brighter inside this place he went up the steps to the officers quarters at a dead run crashed through the swing doors with a force that almost took them off their hinges the sentry at the keyboard looked at him in astonishment the barrel of his submachinegun lining up on the new zealanders chest put that thing down you damned idiot mallory snapped furiously wheres the commandant quickly you oaf its life or death herr herr kominandant the sentry stuttered hes left they are all gone just a minute ago what all gone mallory was staring at him with narrowed dangerous eyes did you say all gone he asked softly yes i im sure theyre he broke off abruptly as mallorys eyes shifted to a point behind his shoulder then who the hell is that mallory demanded savagely the sentry would have been less than human not to fall for it even as he was swinging round to look the vicious judo cut took him just below the ear mallory had smashed open the glass of the keyboard before the unfortunate guard bad bit the floor swept all the keys about a dozen in all off their rings and into his pocket it took them another twenty seconds to tape the mans mouth and hands and lock him in a convenient cupboard then they were on their way again still running one more obstacle to overcome mallory thought as they pounded along in the darkness the last of the triple defences he did not know how many men would be guarding the locked door to the magazine and in that moment of fierce exaltation he didnt particularly care neither he felt sure did miller there were no worries now no tautnerved tensions or nameless anxieties mallory would have been the last man in the world to admit it or even believe it but this was what men like miller and himself had been born for they had their handtorches out now the powerful beams swinging in the wild arcs as they plunged along skirting the massed batteries of aa guns to anyone observing their approach from the front there could have been nothing more calculated to disarm suspicion than the sight and sound of the two men running towards them without any attempt at concealment one of them shouting to the other in german both with lit torches whose beams lifted and fell lifted and fell as the mens arms windmilled by their sides but these same torches were deeply hooded and only a very alert observer indeed would have noticed that the downward arc of the lights never passed backwards beyond the runners feet suddenly mallory saw two shadows detaching themselves from the darker shadow of the magazine entrance steadied his torch for a brief second to check he slackened speed right he said softly here they come only two of them one each get as close as possible first quick and quiet a shout a shot and were finished and for gods sake dont start clubbing em with your torch therell be no lights on in that magazine and im not going to start crawling around there with a box of bloody matches in my hand he transferred his torch to his left hand pulled out his navy colt reversed it caught it by the barrel brought up sharply only inches away from the guards now running to meet them are you all right mallory gasped anyone been here quickly man quickly yes yes were all right the man was off guard apprehensive what in the name of god is all that noise those damned english saboteurs mallory swore viciously theyve killed the guards and theyre inside are you sure no ones been here come let me see he pushed his way past the guard probed his torch at the massive padlock then straightened his back thank heaven for that anyway he turned round let the dazzling beam of his torch catch the man square in the eyes muttered an apology and switched off the light the sound of the sharp click lost in the hollow soggy thud of the heel of his colt catching the man behind the ear just below the helmet the sentry was still on his feet just beginning to crumple when mallory staggered as the second guard reeled into him staggered recovered clouted him with the colt for good measure then stiffened in sudden dismay as he heard the vicious hissing plop of millers automatic twice in rapid succession what the hell wily birds boss miller murmured very wily indeed there was a third character in the shadows at the side only way to stop him automatic cocked in his ready hand he stooped over the man for a moment then straightened afraid hes been stopped kinda permanent boss there was no expression in his voice tie up the others mallory had only halfheard him he was already busy at the magazine door trying a succession of keys in the lock the third key fitted the lock opened and the heavy steel door gave easily to his touch he took a last swift look round but there was no one in sight no sound but the revving engine of the last of the trucks clearing the fortress gates the distant rattle of machinegun fire andrea was doing a magnificent job if only he didnt overdo it leave his withdrawal till it was too late mallory turned quickly switched on his torch stepped inside the door miller would follow when he was ready a vertical steel ladder fixed to the rock led down to the floor of the cave on either side of the ladder were hollow liftshafts unprotected even by a cage oiled wire ropes glistening in the middle a polished metal runner at each side of the square to guide and steady the springloaded sidewheels of the lift itself spartan in their simplicity but wholly adequate there was no mistaking these for anything but what they were the shell hoist shafts going down to the magazine mallory reached the solid floor of the cave and swept his torch round through a degree arc this was the very end of that great cave that opened out beneath the towering overhang of rock that dominated the entire harbour not the natural end he saw after a moments inspection but a manmade addition the volcanic rock round him had been drilled and blasted out there was nothing here but the two shafts descending into the pitchy darkness and another steel ladder also leading to the magazine but the magazine could wait to check that there were no more guards down here and to ensure an emergency escape route there were the two vital needs of the moment quickly mallory ran along the tunnel flipping his torch on and off the germans were pastmasters of booby traps explosive booby traps for the protection of important installations but the chances were that they had none in that tunnel not with several hundred tons of high explosive stored only feet away the tunnel itself drippingdamp and duckboard floored was about seven feet high and even wider but the central passage was very narrow most of the space was taken up by the roller conveyors one on either side for the great cartridges and shells suddenly the conveyors curved away sharply to left and right the sharplysheering tunnel roof climbed steeply up into the neardarkness of the vaulted dome above and almost at his feet their burnished steel caught in the beam from his torch twin sets of parallel rails imbedded in the solid stone and twenty feet apart stretched forward into the lightened gloom ahead the great gaping mouth of the cave and just before he switched off the torch searchers returning from the devils playground might easily catch the pinpoint of light in the darkness mallory had a brief glimpse of the turntables that crowned the far end of these shining rails and crouched massively above like some nightmare monsters from an ancient and other world the evil the sinister silhouettes of the two great guns of navarone torch and revolver dangling loosely in his hands only dimly aware of the curious tingling in the tips of his fingers mallory walked slowly forward slowly but not with the stealthy slowness the razordrawn expeotancy of a man momentarily anticipating trouble there was no guard in the cave mallory was quite sure of that now but with that strange dreamlike slowness the halfbelief of a man who has accomplished something he had known all along he could never accomplish with the slowness of a man at last face to face with a feared but longsought enemy im here at last mallory said to himself over and over again im here at last ive made it and these are the guns of navarone these are the guns i came to destroy the guns of navarone and i have come at last but somehow he couldnt quite believe it slowly still mallory approached the guns walked halfway round the perimeter of the turntable of the gun on the left examined it as well as he could in the gloom he was staggered by the sheer size of it the tremendous girth and reach of the barrel that stretched far out into the night he told himself that the experts thought it was only a nineinch crunch gun that the crowding confines of the cave were bound to exaggerate its size he told himself these things discounted them twelveinch bore if an inch that gun was the biggest thing he had ever seen big heavens above it was gigantic the fools the blind crazy fools who had sent the sybaris out against these the train of thought was lost abruptly mallory stood quite still one hand resting against the massive gun carriage and tried to recall the sound that had jerked him back to the present immobile he listened for it again eyes closed the better to hear but the sound did not come again and suddenly he knew that it was no sound at all but the absence of sound that had cut through his thoughts triggered off some unconscious warning bell the night was suddenly very silent very stifi down in the heart of the town the guns had stopped firing mallory swore softly to himself he had already spent far too much time daydreaming and time was running short it must be running short andrea had withdrawn it was only a matter of time until the germans discovered that they had been duped and then they would come running and there was no doubt where they would come swiftly mallory shrugged out of his rucksack pulled out the hundredfoot wirecored rope coiled inside their emergency escape route whatever else he did he must make sure of that the rope looped round his arm he moved forward cautiously seeking a belay but had only taken three steps when his right kneecap struck something hard and unyielding he checked the exclamation of pain investigated the obstacle with his free hand realised immediately what it was an iron railing stretched waisthigh across the mouth of the cave of course there had been bound to be something like this some barrier to prevent people from falling over the edge especially in the darkness of the night he hadnt been able to pick it up with the binoculars from the carob grove that afternoon close though it was to the entrance it had been concealed in the gloom of the cave but he should have thought of it quickly mallory felt his way along to the left to the very end of the railing crossed it tied the rope securely to the base of the vertical stanchion next to the wall paid out the rope as he moved gingerly to the lip of the cave mouth and then almost at once he was there and there was nothing below his probing foot but a hundred and twenty feet of sheer drop to the landlocked harbour of navarone away to his right was a dark formless blur lying on the water a blur that might have been cape demirci straight ahead across the darkly velvet sheen of the maidos straits he could see the twinkle of faraway lights it was a measure of the enemys confidence that they permitted these lights at all or more likely these fisher cottages were useful as a bearing marker for the guns at night and to the left surprisingly near barely thirty feet away in a horizontal plane but far below the level where he was standing he could see the jutting end of the outside wall of the fortress where it abutted on the cliff the roofs of the houses on the west side of the square beyond that and beyond that again the town itself curving sharply downwards and outwards to the south first then to the west closegirdling and matching the curve of the crescent harbour abovebut there was nothing to be seen above that fantastic overhang above blotted out more than half the sky and below the darkness was equally impenetrable the surface of the harbour inky and black as night there were vessels down there he knew grecian caiques and german launches but they might have been a thousand miles away for any sign he could see of them the brief all encompassing glance had taken barely ten seconds but mallory waited no longer swiftly he bent down tied a double bowline in the end of the rope and left it lying on the edge in an emergency they could kick it out into the darkness it would be thirty feet short of the water he estimated enough to clear any launch or masted caique that might be moving about the harbour they could drop the rest of the way maybe a bonebreaking fall on to the deck of a ship but they would have to risk it mallory took one last look down into the stygian blackness and shivered he hoped to god that he and miller wouldnt have to take that way out dusty miller was kneeling on the duckboards by the top of the ladder leading down to the magazine as mallory came running back up the tunnel his hands busy with wires fuses detonators and explosives he straightened up as mallory approached i reckon this stuff should keep em happy boss he set the hands of the clockwork fuse listened appreciatively to the barely audible hum then eased himself down the ladder in here among the top two rows of cartridges i thought wherever you say mallory acquiesced only dont make it too obvious or too difficult to find sure theres no chance of them suspecting that we knew the clock and fuses were dud none in the world miller said confidently when they find this here contraption theyll knock holes in each others backs congratulatin themselvesand theyll never look any further fair enough mallory was satisfied lock the door up top certainly i locked the door miller looked at him reproachfully boss sometimes i think but mallory never heard what he thought a metallic reverberating clangour echoed cavernously through the cave and magazine blotting out millers words then died away over the harbour again the sound came while the two men stared bleakly at one another then again and again then escaped for a moment of time company mallory murmured complete with sledgehammers dear god i only hope that door holds he was already running along the passage towards the guns miller close behind him company miller was shaking his head as he ran how in the hell did they get here so soon our late lamented little pal mallory said savagely he vaulted over the railing edged back to the mouth of the cave and we were suckers enough to believe he told the whole truth but he never told us that opening that door up top triggered off an alarm bell in the guardroom chapter wednesday night smoothly skillfully miller paid out the wirecored rope doubleturned round the top rail as mallory sank out of sight into the darkness fifty feet had gone he estimated fiftyfive sixty then there came the awaited sharp double tug on the signal cord looped round his wrist and he at once checked the rope stooped and tied it securely to the foot of the stanchion and then he had straightened again belayed himself to the rail with the ropes end leaned far out over the edge caught hold of the rope with both bands as far down as he could reach and began slowly almost imperceptibly at first then with gradually increasing momentum to swing man and rope from side to side pendulumwise as the wings of the pendulum grew wider the rope started to twist and jump in his hands and miller knew that mallory must be striking outcrops of rock spinning uncontrollably as he bounced off them but miller knew that he couldnt stop now the clanging of the sledges behind him was almost continuous he only stooped the lower over the rope flung all the strength of his sinewy arms and shoulders into the effort of bringing mallory nearer and still nearer to the rope that brown would by now have thrown down from the balcony of the house where they had left him far below halfway between the cave mouth and the invisible waters of the harbour mallory swung in a great arc through the rainfilled darkness of the sky forty rushing bonebruising feet between the extremities of the swings earlier he had struck his head heavily on an outcrop of rock all but losing consciousness and his grip on the rope but he knew where to expect that projection now and pushed himself clear each time as he approached it even although this made him spin in a complete circle every time it was as well he thought that it was dark that he was independent of sight anyway the blow had reopened an old wound turzig had given him his whole upper face was masked with blood both eyes completely gummed but he wasnt worried about the wound about the blood in his eyes the rope that was all that mattered was the rope there had anything happened to casey brown had he been jumped before he could get the rope over the side if he had then all hope was gone and there was nothing they could do no other way they could span the forty sheer feet between house and cave it just had to be there but if it were there why couldnt he find it three times now at the right extremity of a swing he had reached out with his bamboo pole heard the hook scrape emptily frustratingly against the bare rock and then the fourth time stretched out to the straining limit of both arms he felt the hook catch on immediately he jerked the pole in caught the rope before he dropped back on the downward swing jerked the signal card urgently checked himself gradually as he fell back two minutes later near exhaustion from the sixtyfoot climb up the wet slippery rope be crawled blindly over the lip of the cave and flung himself to the ground sobbing for breath swiftly without speaking miller bent down slipped the twin loops of the double bowline from mallorys legs undid the knot tied it to browns rope gave the latter a tug and watched the joined ropes disappear into the darkness within two minutes the heavy battery was across underslung from the two ropes lowered so far by casey brown then hauled up by mallory and miller within another two minutes but with infinitely more caution this time the canvas bag with the nitro primers and detonators had been pulled across lay on the stone floor beside the battery all noise had ceased the hammering of the sledges against the steel door had stopped completely there was something threatening foreboding about the stillness the silence was more menacing than all the clamour that had gone before was the door down the lock smashed the germans waiting for them in the gloom of the tunnel waiting with cradled machinecarbines that would tear the life out of them but there was no time to wonder no time to wait no time now to stop to weigh the chances the time for caution was past and whether they lived or died was of no account any more the heavy colt balanced at his waist mallory climbed over the safety barrier padded silently past the great guns and through the passage his torch clicking on halfway down its length the place was deserted the door above still intact he climbed swiftly up the ladder listened at the top a subdued murmur of voices he thought he heard and a faint hissing sound on the other side of the heavy steel door but he couldnt be sure he leaned forward to hear better the palm of his hand against the door drew back with a muffled exclamation of pain just above the lock the door was almost redhot mallory dropped down to the floor of the tunnel just as miller came staggering up with the battery that doors hot as blazes they must be burning did you hear anything miller interrupted there was a kind of hissing oxyacetylene torch miller said briefly theyll be burnin out the lock itll take time that doors made of armoured steel why dont they blow it in geignite or whatever you use for that job perish the thought miller said hastily dont even talk about it boss sympathetic detonations a funny thing theres an even chance that the whole damned lot would go up give me a hand with this thing boss will you within seconds dusty miller was again a man absorbed in his own element the danger outside the return trip he had yet to make across the face of the cliff completely forgotten for the moment the task took him four minutes from beginning to end while mallory was sliding the battery below the floored well of the lift miller squeezed in between the shining steel runners of the lift shaft itself stooped to examine the rear one with his torch and establish by the abrupt transition from polished to dull metal exactly where the springloaded wheel of the shellhoist came to rest satisfied he pulled out a roll of sticky black tape wound it a dozen times round the shaft stepped back to look at it it was quite invisible quickly he taped the ends of two rubbercovered wires on the insulated strip one at either side taped these down also until nothing was visible but the bared steel cores at the tips joined these to two fourinch strips of bared wire taped these also top and bottom to the insulated shaft vertically and less than half an inch apart from the canvas bag he removed the tnt the primer and detonator a bridge mercury detonator lugged and screwed to his own specification fitted them together and connected one of the wires from the steel shaft to a lug on the detonator screwing it firmly home the other wire from the shaft he led to the positive terminal on the battery and a third wire from the negative terminal to the detonator it only required the anununition hoist to sink down into the magazine as it would do as soon as they began firing and the springloaded wheel would short out the bare wires completing the circuit and triggering off the detonator a last check on the position of the bared vertical wires and he sat back satisfied mallory had just descended the ladder from the tunnel miller tapped him on the leg to draw his attention negligently waving the steel blade of his knife within an inch of the exposed wires are you aware boss he said conversationally that if i touched this here blade across those terminals the whole gawddamned place would go up in smithereens he shook his head musingly just one little slip of the hand just one teeny little touch and mallory and miller are among the angels for gods sake put that thing away mallory snapped nervously and lets get the heli out of here theyve got a complete halfcircle cut through that door already five minutes later miller was safe it had been a simple matter of sliding down a degree tautened rope to where brown waited mallory took a last look back into the cave and his mouth twisted he wondered how many soldiers manned the guns and magazine during action stations one thing he thought theyll never know anything about it the poor bastards and then he thought for the hundredth time of all the men on kheros and the destroyers and his lips tightened and he looked away without another backward glance he slipped over the edge dropped down into the night he was halfway there at the very lowest point of the curve and about to start climbing again when he heard the vicious staccato rattle of machinegun fire directly overhead it was miller who helped him over the balcony rail an apprehensivelooking miller who glanced often over his shoulder in the direction of the gunfire and the heaviest concentration of fire mallory realised with sudden dismay was coming from their own the west side of the square only three or four houses away their escape route was cut off come on boss miller said urgently lets get away from this joint gettin downright unhealthy round these parts mallory jerked his head in the direction of the fire whos down there he asked quickly a german patrol then how in the hell can we get away mallory demanded and wheres andrea across the other side of the square boss thats who those birds along there are firing at the other side of the square he glanced at his watch heavens above man whats he doing there he was moving through the house now speaking over his shoulder why did you let him go i didnt let him go boss miller said carefully he was gone when i came seems that brown here saw a big patrol start a house to house search of the square started on the other side and were doin two or three houses at a time andrea hed come back by this time thought it a sure bet that theyd work right round the square and get here in two or three minutes so he took off like a bat across the roofs going to draw them off mallory was at loukis side staring out of the window the crazy fool hell get himself killed this time get himself killed for sure there are soldiers everywhere besides they wont fall for it again he tricked them once up in the hills and the germans im not so sure sir brown interrupted excitedly andreas just shot out the searchlight on his side theyll think for certain that were going to break out over the wall and look sir look there they go brown was almost dancing with excitement the pain of his injured leg forgotten hes done it sir hes done it sure enough mallory saw the patrol had broken away from their shelter in the house to their right and were running across the square in extended formation their heavy boots clattering on the cobbles stumbling falling recovering again as they lost footing on the slippery wetness of the uneven stones at the same time mallory could see torches flickering on the roofs of the houses opposite the vague forms of men crouching low to escape observation and making swiftly for the spot where andrea had been when he had shot out the great cyclops eye of the searchlight theyll be on him from every side mallory spoke quietly enough but his fists clenched until the nails cut into the palms of his hands he stood stockstill for some seconds stooped quickly and gathered a schmeisser up from the floor he hasnt a chance im going after him he turned abruptly brought up with equal suddenness miller was blocking his way to the door andrea left word that we were to leave him be that hed find his own way out miller was very calm very respectful said that no one was to help him not on any account dont try to stop me dusty mallory spoke evenly mechanically almost he was hardly aware that dusty miller was there he only knew that he must get out at once get to andreas side give him what help he could they had been together too long he owed too much to the smiling giant to let him go so easily he couldnt remember how often andrea had come after him more than once when he had thought hope was gone he put his hand against millers chest youll only be in his way boss miller said urgently thats what you said mallory pushed him aside strode for the door brought up his fist to strike as hands closed round his upper arm he stopped just in time looked down into loukis worried face the american is right louki said insistently you must not go andrea said you were to take us down to the harbour go down yourselves mallory said brusquely you know the way you know the plans you would let us all go let us all id let the whole damn world go if i could help him there was an utter sincerity in the new zealanders voice andrea would never let me down but you would let him down louki said quietly is that it major mallory what the devil do you mean by not doing as he wishes he may be hurt killed even and if you go after him and are killed too that makes it all useless he would die for nothing is it thus you would repay your friend all right all right you win mallory said irritably that is how andrea would want it louki murmured any other way you would be stop preaching at me right gentlemen lets be on our way he was back on balance again easy relaxed the primeval urge to go out and kill well under control well take the high road over the roofs dig into that kitchen stove there rub the ashes all over your hands and faces see that theres nothing white on you anywhere and no talking the fiveminute journey down to the harbour wall a journey made in softfooted silence with mallory hushing even the beginnings of a whisper was quite uneventful not only did they see no soldiers they saw no one at all the inhabitants of navarone were wisely observing the curfew and the streets were completely deserted andrea had drawn off pursuit with a vengeance mallory began to fear that the germans had taken him but just as they reached the waters edge he heard the gunfire again a good deal farther away this time in the very northeast corner of the town round the back of the fortress mallory stood on the low wail above the harbour looked at his companions gazed out over the dark oiliness of the water through the heavy rain he could just distinguish to his right and left the vague blurs of caiques moored stern on to the wall beyond that he could see nothing well i dont suppose we can get much wetter than we are right now he observed he turned to louki checked something the little man was trying to say about andrea you sure you can find it all right in the darkness it was the commandants personal launch a thirtysixfoot tentonner always kept moored to a buoy a hundred feet offshore the engineer who doubled as guard slept aboard louki had said i am already there louki boasted blindfold me as you will and i all right all right mallory said hastily ill take your word for it lend me your hat will you casey he jammed the automatic into the crown of the hat pulled it firmly on to his head slid gently into the water and struck out by loukis side the engineer louki said softly i think he will be awake major i think so too mallory said grimly again there came the chatter of machinecarbines the deeper whiplash of a mauser so will everyone else in navarone unless theyre deaf or dead drop behind as soon as we see the boat come when i call ten seconds fifteen passed then louki touched mallory on the arm i see it mallory whispered the blurred silhouette was less than fifteen yards away he approached silently neither legs nor arms breaking water until he saw the vague shape of a man standing on the poop just aft of the engineroom hatchway he was immobile staring out in the direction of the fortress and the upper town mallory slowly circled round the stern of the boat and came up behind him on the other side carefully he removed his hat took out the gun caught the low gunwale with his left hand at the range of seven feet he knew he couldnt possibly miss but he couldnt shoot the man not then the guardrails were token affairs only eighteen inches high at the most and the splash of the man falling into the water would almost certainly alert the guards at the harbour mouth emplacements if you move i will kill you mallory said softly in german the man stiffened he had a carbine in his hand mallory saw put the gun down dont turn round again the man obeyed and mallory was out of the water and on to the deck in seconds neither eye nor automatic straying from the mans back he stepped softly forward reversed the automatic struck caught the man before he could fall overboard and lowered him quietly to the deck three minutes later all the others were safely aboard mallory followed the limping brown down to the engineroom watched him as he switched on his hooded torch looked around with a professional eye looked at the big gleaming sixcylinder in line diesel engine this said brown reverently is an engine what a beauty operates on any number of cylinders you like i know the type sir i never doubted but you would can you start her up casey just a minute till i have a look round sir brown had all the unhurried patience of the born engineer slowly methodically he played the spotlight round the immaculate interior of the engineroom switched on the fuel and turned to mallory a dual control job sir we can take her from up top he carried out the same painstaking inspection in the wheelhouse while mallory waited impatiently the rain was easing off now not much but sufficiently to let him see the vague outlines of the harbour entrance he wondered for the tenth time if the guards there had been alerted against the possibility of an attempted escape by boat it seemed unlikely from the racket andrea was making the germans would think that escape was the last thing in their minds he leaned forward touched brown on the shoulder twenty past eleven casey he murmured if these destroyers come through early were apt to have a thousand tons of rock falling on our heads ready now sir brown announced he gestured at the crowded dashboard beneath the screen nothing to it really im glad you think so mallory murmured fervently start her moving will you just keep it slow and easy brown coughed apologetically were still moored to the buoy and it might be a good thing sir if we checked on the fixed guns searchlights signalling lamps lifejackets and buoys its useful to know where these things are he finished deprecatorily mallory laughed softly clapped him on the shoulder youd make a great diplomat chief well do that a landsman first and last mallory was none the less aware of the gulf that stretched between him and a man like brown made no bones about acknowledging it to himself will you take her out casey right sir would you ask louki to come here i think its steep to both sides but there may be snags or reefs you never know three minutes later the launch was halfway to the harbour mouth purring along softly on two cylinders mallory and miller still clad in german uniform standing on the deck forard of the wheelhouse louki crouched low inside the wheelhouse itself suddenly about sixty yards away a signal lamp began to flash at them its urgent clacking quite audible in the stillness of the night danl boone miller will now show how its done miller muttered he edged closer to the machinegun on the starboard bow with my little gun i shall he broke off sharply his voice lost in the sudden clacking from the wheelhouse behind him the staccato offbeat chattering of a signal shutter triggered by professional fingers brown had handed the wheel over to louki was morsing back to the harbour entrance the cold rain lancing palely through the ifickering beams of the lamp the enemy lamp had stopped but now began flashing again my they got a lot to say to each other miller said admiringly how long do the exchange of courtesies last boss i should say they are just about finished mallory moved back quickly to the wheelhouse they were less than a hundred feet from the harbour entrance brown had confused the enemy gained precious seconds more time than mallory had ever thought they could gain but it couldnt last he touched brown on the arm give her everything youve got when the balloon goes up two seconds later he was back in position in the bows schmeisser ready in his hands your big chance danl boone dont give the searchlights a chance to line up theyll blind you even as he spoke the light from the signal lamp at the harbour mouth cut off abruptly and two dazzling white beams one from either side of the harbour entrance stabbed blindingly through the darkness bathing the whole harbour in their savage glare a glare that lasted for only a fleeting second of time yielded to a contrastingly stygian darkness as two brief bursts of machinegun fire smashed them into uselessness from such short range it had been almost impossible to miss get down everyone mallory shouted flat on the deck the echoes of the gunfire were dying away the reverberations fading along the great sea wall of the fortress when casey brown cut in all six cylinders of the engine and opened the throttle wide the surging roar of the big diesel blotting out all other sounds in the night five seconds ten seconds they were passing through the entrance fifteen twenty still not a shot fired half a minute and they were well clear bows lifting high out of the water the deepdipped stern trailing its long seething ribbon of phosphorescent white as the engine crescendoed to its clamorous maximum power and brown pulled the heeling craft sharply round to starboard seeking the protection of the steepwalled cliffs a desperate battle boss but the better men won miller was on his feet now clinging to a mounted gun for support as the deck canted away beneath his feet my grandchildren shall hear of this guards probably all up searching the town or maybe there were some poor blokes behind these searchlights or maybe we just took em all by surprise mallory shook his head anyway you take it were just plain damn lucky he moved aft into the wheelhouse brown was at the wheel louki almost crowing with delight that was magnificent casey mallory said sincerely a firstclass job of work cut the engine when we come to the end of the cliffs our jobs done im going ashore you dont have to major mallory turned whats that you dont have to i tried to tell you on the way down but you kept telling me to be quiet louki sounded injured turned to casey slow down please the last thing andrea told me major was that we were to come this way why do you think he let himself be trapped against the cliffs to the north instead of going out into the country where he could have hidden easily is this true casey mallory asked dont ask me sir those two they always talk in greek of course of course mallory looked at the low cliffs close off the starboard beam barely moving now with the engine shut right down looked back at louki are you quite sure he stopped in midsentence jumped out through the wheelhouse door the splash there had been no mistaking the noisehad come from almost directly ahead mallory miller by his side peered into the darkness saw a dark head surfacing above the water less than twenty feet away leaned far over with outstretched arm as the launch slid slowly by five seconds later andrea stood on the deck dripping mightily and beaming all over his great moon face mallory led him straight into the wheelhouse switched on the soft light of the shaded chartlamp by all thats wonderful andrea i never thought to see you again how did it go i will soon tell you andrea laughed just after youve been wounded miller interrupted your shoulders kinda perforated he pointed to the red stain spreading down the seasoaked jacket well now i believe i have andrea affected vast surprise just a scratch my friend oh sure sure just a scratch it would be the same if your arm had been blown off come on down to the cabin this is just a kindergarten exercise for a man of my medical skill but the captain will have to wait and your story ol medicine man miller permits no interference with his patients come on very well very well andrea said docilely he shook his head in mock resignation foliowed miller out of the cabin brown opened up to full throttle again took the launch north almost to cape demirci to avoid any hundred to one chance the harbour batteries might make turned due east for a few miles then headed south into the maidos straits mallory stood by his side in the wheelhouse gazing out over the dark still waters suddenly he caught a gleam of white in the distance touched browns arm and pointed forard breakers ahead casey i think reefs perhaps casey looked in long silence finally shook his head bowwave he said unemotionally its the destroyers coming through chapter wednesday night midnight commander vincent ryan rn captain and commanding officer of his majestys latest sclass destroyer sirdar looked round the cramped chart room and tugged thoughtfully at his magnificent captain kettle beard a scruffier a more villainous a more cut and batteredlooking bunch of hard cases he had never seen he reflected with the possible exception of a bias bay pirate crew he had helped round up when a very junior officer on the china station he looked at them more closely tugged his beard again thought there was more to it than mere scruffiness he wouldnt care to be given the task of rounding this lot up dangerous highly dangerous he mused but impossible to say why there was only this quietness this relaxed watchfulness that made him feel vaguely uncomfortable his hatchetmen jensen had called them captain jensen picked his killers well any of you gentlemen care to go below he suggested plenty of hot water dry clothes and warm bunks we wont be using them tonight thank you very much sir mallory hesitated but wed like to see this through right then the bridge it is ryan said cheerfully the sirdar was beginning to pick up speed again the deck throbbing beneath their feet it is at your own risk of course we lead charmed lives miller drawled nothin ever happens to us the rain had stopped and they could see the cold twinkling of stars through broadening rifts in the clouds mallory looked around him could see maidos broad off the port bow and the great bulk of navarone slipping by to starboard aft about a cable length away he could just distinguish two other ships highcurving bowwaves piled whitely against tenebrious silhouettes mallory turned to the captain no transports sir no transports ryan felt a vague mixture of pleasure and embarrassment that this man should call him sir destroyers only this is going to be a smashandgrab job no time for dawdlers tonight and were behind schedule already how long to clear the beaches half an hour what twelve hundred men mallory was incredulous more ryan sighed half the ruddy inhabitants want to come with us too we could still do it in half an hour but well probably take a bit longer well embark all the mobile equipment we can mallory nodded let his eye travel along the slender outlines of the sirdar where are you going to put em all sir a fair question ryan admitted pm on the london underground will be nothing compared to this little lot but well pack them in somehow mallory nodded again and looked across the dark waters at navarone two minutes now three at the most and the fortress would open behind that headland he felt a hand touch his arm halfturned and smiled down at the sadeyed little greek by his side not long now louki he said quietly the people major he murmured the people in the town will they be all right theyll be all right dusty says the roof of the cave will go straight up most of the stuff will fall into the harbour yes but the boats will you stop worrying theres nobody aboard them you know they have to leave at curfew time he looked round as someone touched his arm captain mallory this is lieutenant beeston my gunnery officer there was a slight coolness in ryans voice that made mallory think that he wasnt overfond of his gunnery officer lieutenant beeston is worried i am worried the tone was cold aloof with an indefinable hint of condescension i understand that you have advised the captain not to offer any resistance you sound like a bbc communiqu mallory said shortly but youre right i did say that you couldnt locate the guns except by searchlight and that would be fatal similarly with gunfire im afraid i dont understand one could almost see the lift of the eyebrows in the darkness youd give away your position mallory said patiently theyd nail you first time give em two minutes and theyd nail you anyway i have good reason to believe that the accuracy of their gunners is quite fantastic so has the navy ryan interjected quietly their third shell got the sybariss b magazine have you got any idea why this should be captain mallory beeston was quite unconvinced radarcontrolled guns mallory said briefly they have two huge scanners atop the fortress the sirdar had radar installed last month beeston said stiffly i imagine we could register some hits ourselves if you could hardly miss miller drawled out the words the tone dry and provocative its a helluva big island mac who who are you beeston was rattled what the devil do you mean corporal miller the american was unperturbed must be a very selective instrument lootenant that can pick out a cave in a hundred square miles of rock there was a moments silence then beeston muttered something and turned away youve hurt the gunss feelings corporal ryan murmured hes very keen to have a go but well hold our fire how long till we clear that point captain im not sure he turned what do you say casey a minute sir no more ryan nodded said nothing there was a silence on the bridge a silence only intensified by the sibilant rushing of the waters the weird lonesome pinging of the asdic above the sky was steadily clearing and the moon palely luminous was struggling to appear through a patch of thinning cloud nobody spoke nobody moved mallory was conscious of the great bulk of andrea beside him of miller brown and louki behind born in the heart of the country brought up on the foothills of the southern alps mallory knew himself as a landsman first and last an alien to the sea and ships but he had never felt so much at home in his life never really known till now what it was to belong he was more than happy mallory thought vaguely to himself he was content andrea and his new friends and the impossible well done how could a man but be content they werent all going home andy stevens wasnt coming with them but strangely he could feel no sorrow only a gentle melancholy almost as if he had divined what mallory was thinking andrea leaned towards him towering over him in the darkness he should be here he murmured andy stevens should be here that is what you are thinking is it not mallory nodded and smiled and said nothing it doesnt really matter does it my keith no anxiety no questioning just a statement of fact it doesnt really matter it doesnt matter at all even as he spoke he looked up quickly a light a bright orange flame had lanced out from the sheering wall of the fortress they had rounded the headland and be hadnt even noticed it there was a whistling roar mallory thought incongruously of an express train emerging from a tunnel directly overhead and the great shell had crashed into the sea just beyond them mallory compressed his lips unconsciously tightened his clenched fists it was easy now to see how the sybaris had died he could hear the gunnery officer saying something to the captain but the words failed to register they were looking at him and he at them and he did not see them his mind was strangely detached another shell would that be next or would the roar of the gunfire of that first shell come echoing across the sea or perhaps once again he was back in that dark magazine entombed in the rocks only now he could see men down there doomed unknowing men could see the overhead pulleys swinging the great shells and cartridges towards the well of the lift could see the shell hoist descending slowly the bared waiting wires less than half an inch apart the shining springloaded wheel running smoothly down the gleaming rail the gentle bump as the hoist a white pillar of flame streaked up hundreds of feet into the night sky as the tremendous detonation tore the heart out of the great fortress of navarone no afterfire of any kind no dark billowing clouds of smoke only that one blinding white column that lit up the entire town for a single instant of time reached up incredibly till it touched the clouds vanished as if it had never been and then by and by came the shock waves the solitary thunderclap of the explosion staggering even at that distance and finally the deepthroated rumbling as thousands of tons of rock toppled majestically into the harbour thousands of tons of rock and then the two great guns of navarone the rumbling was still in their ears the echoes fading away far out across the aegean when the clouds parted and the moon broke through a full moon silvering the darklyrippling waters to starboard shining iridescently through the spun phosphorescence of the sirdars boiling wake and dead ahead bathed in the white moonlight mysterious remote the island of kheros lay sleeping on the surface of the sea
