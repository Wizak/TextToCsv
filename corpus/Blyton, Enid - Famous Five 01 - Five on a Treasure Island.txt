disappointment they did so love the house at polseath the beach was so lovely there too and the bathing was fine cheer up said daddy i dare say well find somewhere else just as good for you and anyway mother and i wont be able to go with you this year has mother told you no said anne oh motheris it true cant you really come with us on our holidays you always do well this time daddy wants me to go to scotland with him said mother all by ourselves and as you are really getting big enough to look after yourselves now we thought it would be rather fun for you to have a holiday on your own too but now that you cant go to polseath i dont really quite know where to send you what about quentins suddenly said daddy quentin was his brother the childrens uncle they had only seen him once and had been rather frightened of him he was a very tall frowning man a clever scientist who spent all his time studying he lived by the sea but that was about all that the children knew of him quentin said mother pursing up her lips whatever made you think of him i shouldnt think hed want the children messing about in his little house well said daddy i had to see quentins wife in town the other day about a business matter and i dont think things are going too well for them fanny said that she would be quite glad if she could hear of one or two people to live with her for a while to bring a little money in their house is by the sea you know it might be just the thing for the children fanny is very nice she would look after them well yes and she has a child of her own too hasnt she said the childrens mother let me see whats her name something funny yes georgina how old would she be about eleven i should think same age as me said dick fancy having a cousin weve never seen she must be jolly lonely all by herself ive got julian and anne to play with but georgina is just one on her own i should think shed be glad to see us well your aunt fanny said that her georgina would love a bit of company said daddy you know i really think that would solve our difficulty if we telephone to fanny and arrange for the children to go there it would help fanny im sure and georgina would love to have someone to play with in the holidays and we should know that our three were safe the children began to feel rather excited it would be fun to go to a place they had never been to before and stay with an unknown cousin are there cliffs and rocks and sands there asked anne is it a nice place i dont remember it very well said daddy but i feel sure its an exciting kind of place anyway youll love it its called kirrin bay your aunt fanny has lived there all her life and wouldnt leave it for anything oh daddy do telephone to aunt fanny and ask her if we can go there cried dick i just feel as if its the right place somehow it sounds sort of adventurous oh you always say that wherever you go said daddy with a laugh all right ill ring up now and see if theres any chance they had all finished their breakfast and they got up to wait for daddy to telephone he went out into the hall and they heard him putting the call through i hope its all right for us said julian i wonder what georginas like funny name isnt it more like a boys than a girls so shes eleven a year younger than i am same age as you dick and a year older than you anne she ought to fit in with us all right the four of us ought to have a fine time together daddy came back in about ten minutes time and the children knew at once that he had fixed up everything he smiled round at them well thats settled he said your aunt fanny is delighted about it she says it will be awfully good for georgina to have company because shes such a lonely little girl always going off by herself and she will love looking after you all only youll have to be careful not to disturb your uncle quentin he is working very hard and he isnt very goodtempered when he is disturbed well be as quiet as mice in the house said dick honestly we will oh goody goody when are we going daddy next week if mother can manage it said daddy mother nodded her head yes she said theres nothing much to get ready for them just bathing suits and jerseys and shorts they all wear the same how lovely it will be to wear shorts again said anne dancing round im tired of wearing school tunics i want to wear shorts or a bathing suit and go bathing and climbing with the boys well youll soon be doing it said mother with a laugh remember to put ready any toys or books you want wont you not many please because there wont be a great deal of room anne wanted to take all her fifteen dolls with her last year said dick do you remember anne werent you funny no i wasnt said anne going red i love my dolls and i just couldnt choose which to take so i thought id take them all theres nothing funny about that and do you remember the year before anne wanted to take the rockinghorse said dick with a giggle mother chimed in you know i remember a little boy called dick who put aside two golliwogs one teddy bear three toy dogs two toy cats and his old monkey to take down to polseath one year she said then it was dicks turn to go red he changed the subject at once daddy are we going by train or by car he asked by car said daddy we can pile everything into the boot well what about tuesday that would suit me well said mother then we could take the children down come back and do our own packing at leisure and start off for scotland on the friday yes well arrange for tuesday so tuesday it was the children counted the days eagerly and anne marked one off the calendar each night the week seemed a very long time in going but at last tuesday did come dick and julian who shared a room woke up at about the same moment and stared out of the nearby window its a lovely day hurrah cried julian leaping out of bed i dont know why but it always seems very important that it should be sunny on the first day of a holiday lets wake anne anne slept in the next room julian ran in and shook her wake up its tuesday and the suns shining anne woke up with a jump and stared at julian joyfully its come at last she said i thought it never would oh isnt it an exciting feeling to go away for a holiday they started soon after breakfast their car was a big one so it held them all very comfortably mother sat in front with daddy and the three children sat behind their feet on two suitcases in the luggageplace at the back of the car were all kinds of odds and ends and one small trunk mother really thought they had remembered everything along the crowded london roads they went slowly at first and then as they left the town behind more quickly soon they were right into the open country and the car sped along fast the children sang songs to themselves as they always did when they were happy are we picnicking soon asked anne feeling hungry all of a sudden yes said mother but not yet its only eleven oclock we shant have lunch till at least halfpast twelve anne oh gracious said anne i know i cant last out till then so her mother handed her some chocolate and she and the boys munched happily watching the hills woods and fields as the car sped by the picnic was lovely they had it on the top of a hill in a sloping field that looked down into a sunny valley anne didnt very much like a big brown cow who came up close and stared at her but it went away when daddy told it to the children ate enormously and mother said that instead of having a teapicnic at halfpast four they would have to go to a teahouse somewhere because they had eaten all the tea sandwiches as well as the lunch ones what time shall we be at aunt fannys asked julian finishing up the very last sandwich and wishing there were more about six oclock with luck said daddy now who wants to stretch their legs a bit weve another long spell in the car you know the car seemed to eat up the miles as it purred along teatime came and then the three children began to feel excited all over again we must watch out for the sea said dick i can smell it somewhere near he was right the car suddenly topped a hill and there was the shining blue sea calm and smooth in the evening sun the three children gave a yell there it is isnt it marvellous oh i want to bathe this very minute we shant be more than twenty minutes now before were at kirrin bay said daddy weve made good time youll see the bay soon its quite a big one with a funny sort of island at the entrance of the bay the children looked out for it as they drove along the coast then julian gave a shout there it is that must be kirrin bay look dick isnt it lovely and blue and look at the rocky little island guarding the entrance of the bay said dick id like to visit that well ive no doubt you will said mother now lets look out for aunt fannys house its called kirrin cottage they soon came to it it stood on the low cliff overlooking the bay and was a very old house indeed it wasnt really a cottage but quite a big house built of old white stone roses climbed over the front of it and the garden was gay with flowers heres kirrin cottage said daddy and he stopped the car in front of it its supposed to be about three hundred years old now wheres quentin hallo theres fanny chapter two the strange cousin contents prevnext the childrens aunt had been watching for the car she came running out of the old wooden door as soon as she saw it draw up outside the children liked the look of her at once welcome to kirrin she cried hallo all of you its lovely to see you and what big children there were kisses all round and then the children went into the house they liked it it felt old and rather mysterious somehow and the furniture was old and very beautiful wheres georgina asked anne looking round for her unknown cousin oh the naughty girl i told her to wait in the garden for you said her aunt now shes gone off somewhere i must tell you children you may find george a bit difficult at first shes always been one on her own you know and at first may not like you being here but you mustnt take any notice of that shell be all right in a short time i was very glad for georges sake that you were able to come she badly needs other children to play with do you call her george asked anne in surprise i thought her name was georgina so it is said her aunt but george hates being a girl and we have to call her george as if she was a boy the naughty girl wont answer if we call her georgina the children thought that georgina sounded rather exciting they wished she would come but she didnt their uncle quentin suddenly appeared instead he was a most extraordinary looking man very tall very dark and with a rather fierce frown on his wide forehead hallo quentin said daddy its a long time since ive seen you i hope these three wont disturb you very much in your work quentin is working on a very difficult book said aunt fanny but ive given him a room all to himself on the other side of the house so i dont expect he will be disturbed their uncle looked at the three children and nodded to them the frown didnt come off his face and they all felt a little scared and were glad that he was to work in another part of the house wheres george he said in a deep voice gone off somewhere again said aunt fanny vexed i told her she was to stay here and meet her cousins she wants spanking said uncle quentin the children couldnt quite make out whether he was joking or not well children i hope you have a good time here and maybe you will knock a little commonsense into george there was no room at kirrin cottage for mother and daddy to stay the night so after a hurried supper they left to stay at a hotel in the nearest town they would drive back to london immediately after breakfast the next day so they said goodbye to the children that night georgina still hadnt appeared im sorry we havent seen georgina said mother just give her our love and tell her we hope shell enjoy playing with dick julian and anne then mother and daddy went the children felt a little bit lonely as they saw the big car disappear round the corner of the road but aunt fanny took them upstairs to show them their bedrooms and they soon forgot to be sad the two boys were to sleep together in a room with slanting ceilings at the top of the house it had a marvellous view of the bay the boys were really delighted with it anne was to sleep with georgina in a smaller room whose windows looked over the moors at the back of the house but one sidewindow looked over the sea which pleased anne very much it was a nice room and red roses nodded their heads in at the window i do wish georgina would come anne said to her aunt i want to see what shes like well shes a funny little girl said her aunt she can be very rude and haughtybut shes kind at heart very loyal and absolutely truthful once she makes friends with you she will always be your friend but she finds it very difficult indeed to make friends which is a great pity anne suddenly yawned the boys frowned at her because they knew what would happen next and it did poor anne how tired you are you must all go to bed straight away and have a good long night then you will wake up quite fresh tomorrow said aunt fanny anne you are an idiot said dick crossly when his aunt had gone out of the room you know quite well what grownups think as soon as we yawn i did want to go down on the beach for a while im so sorry said anne somehow i couldnt help it and anyway youre yawning now dick and julian too so they were they were as sleepy as could be with their long drive secretly all of them longed to cuddle down into bed and shut their eyes i wonder where georgina is said anne when she said goodnight to the boys and went to her own room isnt she queer not waiting to welcome us and not coming in to supper and not even in yet after all shes sleeping in my room goodness knows what time shell be in all the three children were fast asleep before georgina came up to bed they didnt hear her open annes door they didnt hear her get undressed and clean her teeth they didnt hear the creak of her bed as she got into it they were so tired that they heard nothing at all until the sun awoke them in the morning when anne awoke she couldnt at first think where she was she lay in her little bed and looked up at the slanting ceiling and at the red roses that nodded at the open window and suddenly remembered all in a rush where she was im at kirrin bay and its the holidays she said to herself and screwed up her legs with joy then she looked across at the other bed in it lay the figure of another child curled up under the bedclothes anne could just see the top of a curly head and that was all when the figure stirred a little anne spoke i say are you georgina the child in the opposite bed sat up and looked across at anne she had very short curly hair almost as short as a boys her face was burnt a darkbrown with the sun and her very blue eyes looked as bright as forgetmenots in her face but her mouth was rather sulky and she had a frown like her fathers no she said im not georgina oh said anne in surprise then who are you im george said the girl i shall only answer if you call me george i hate being a girl i wont be i dont like doing the things that girls do i like doing the things that boys do i can climb better than any boy and swim faster too i can sail a boat as well as any fisherboy on this coast youre to call me george then ill speak to you but i shant if you dont oh said anne thinking that her new cousin was most extraordinary all right i dont care what i call you george is a nice name i think i dont much like georgina anyway you look like a boy do i really said george the frown leaving her face for a moment mother was awfully cross with me when i cut my hair short i had hair all round my neck it was awful the two girls stared at one another for a moment dont you simply hate being a girl asked george no of course not said anne you see i do like pretty frocks and i love my dolls and you cant do that if youre a boy pooh fancy bothering about pretty frocks said george in a scornful voice and dolls well you are a baby thats all i can say anne felt offended youre not very polite she said you wont find that my brothers take much notice of you if you act as if you knew everything theyre real boys not pretend boys like you well if theyre going to be nasty to me i shant take any notice of them said george jumping out of bed i didnt want any of you to come anyway interfering with my life here im quite happy on my own now ive got to put up with a silly girl who likes frocks and dolls and two stupid boycousins anne felt that they had made a very bad beginning she said no more but got dressed herself too she put on her grey jeans and a red jersey george put on jeans too and a boys jersey just as they were ready the boys hammered on their door arent you ready is georgina there cousin georgina come out and see us george flung open the door and marched out with her head high she took no notice of the two surprised boys at all she stalked downstairs the other three children looked at one another she wont answer if you call her georgina explained anne shes awfully queer i think she says she didnt want us to come because well interfere with her she laughed at me and was rather rude julian put his arm round anne who looked a bit doleful cheer up he said youve got us to stick up for you come on down to breakfast they were all hungry the smell of bacon and eggs was very good they ran down the stairs and said goodmorning to their aunt she was just bringing the breakfast to the table their uncle was sitting at the head reading his paper he nodded at the children they sat down without a word wondering if they were allowed to speak at meals they always were at home but their uncle quentin looked rather fierce george was there buttering a piece of toast she scowled at the three children dont look like that george said her mother i hope youve made friends already it will be fun for you to play together you must take your cousins to see the bay this morning and show them the best places to bathe im going fishing said george her father looked up at once you are not he said you are going to show a few good manners for a change and take your cousins to the bay do you hear me yes said george with a scowl exactly like her fathers oh we can go to the bay by ourselves all right if george is going fishing said anne at once thinking that it would be nice not to have george if she was in a bad temper george will do exactly as shes told said her father if she doesnt i shall deal with her so after breakfast four children got ready to go down to the beach an easy path led down to the bay and they ran down happily even george lost her frown as she felt the warmth of the sun and saw the dancing sparkles on the blue sea you go fishing if you want to said anne when they were down on the beach we wont tell tales of you we dont want to interfere with you you know weve got ourselves for company and if you dont want to be with us you neednt but wed like you all the same if youd like to be with us said julian generously he thought george was rude and illmannered but he couldnt help rather liking the look of the straightbacked shorthaired little girl with her brilliant blue eyes and sulky mouth george stared at him ill see she said i dont make friends with people just because theyre my cousins or something silly like that i only make friends with people if i like them so do we said julian we may not like you of course oh said george as if that thought hadnt occurred to her well you may not of course lots of people dont like me now i come to think of it anne was staring out over the blue bay at the entrance to it lay a curious rocky island with what looked like an old ruined castle on the top of it isnt that a funny place she said i wonder what its called its called kirrin island said george her eyes as blue as the sea as she turned to look at it its a lovely place to go to if i like you i may take you there some day but i dont promise the only way to get there is by boat who does the funny island belong to asked julian george made a most surprising answer it belongs to me she said at least it will belong to me some day it will be my very own island and my very own castle chapter three a queer story and a new friend contents prevnext the three children stared at george in the greatest surprise george stared back at them what do you mean said dick at last kirrin island cant belong to you youre just boasting no im not said george you ask mother if youre not going to believe what i say i wont tell you another word more but i dont tell untruths i think its being a coward if you dont tell the truth and im not a coward julian remembered that aunt fanny had said that george was absolutely truthful and he scratched his head and looked at george again how could she be possibly telling the truth well of course well believe you if you tell us the truth he said but it does sound a bit extraordinary you know really it does children dont usually own islands even funny little ones like that it isnt a funny little island said george fiercely its lovely there are rabbits there as tame as can be and the big cormorants sit on the other side and all kinds of gulls go there the castle is wonderful too even if it is all in ruins it sounds fine said dick how does it belong to you georgina george glared at him and didnt answer sorry said dick hastily i didnt mean to call you georgina i meant to call you george go on george tell us how the island belongs to you said julian slipping his arm through his sulky little cousins she pulled away from him at once dont do that she said im not sure that i want to make friends with you yet all right all right said julian losing patience be enemies or anything you like we dont care but we like your mother awfully and we dont want her to think we wont make friends with you do you like my mother said george her bright blue eyes softening a little yes shes a dear isnt she well all right ill tell you how kirrin castle belongs to me come and sit down here in this corner where nobody can hear us they all sat down in a sandy corner of the beach george looked across at the little island in the bay its like this she said years ago my mothers people owned nearly all the land around here then they got poor and had to sell most of it but they could never sell that little island because nobody thought it worth anything especially as the castle has been ruined for years fancy nobody wanting to buy a dear little island like that said dick id buy it at once if i had the money all thats left of what mothers family owned is our own house kirrin cottage and a farm a little way off and kirrin island said george mother says when im grownup it will be mine she says she doesnt want it now either so shes sort of given it to me it belongs to me its my own private island and i dont let anyone go there unless they get my permission the three children stared at her they believed every word george said for it was quite plain that the girl was speaking the truth fancy having an island of your very own they thought she was very lucky indeed oh georgina i mean george said dick i do think youre lucky it looks such a nice island i hope youll be friends with us and take us there one day soon you simply cant imagine how wed love it well i might said george pleased at the interest she had caused ill see i never have taken anyone there yet though some of the boys and girls round here have begged me to but i dont like them so i havent there was a little silence as the four children looked out over the bay to where the island lay in the distance the tide was going out it almost looked as if they could wade over to the island dick asked if it was possible no said george i told you its only possible to get to it by boat its farther out than it looksand the water is very very deep there are rocks all about too you have to know exactly where to row a boat or you bump into them its a dangerous bit of coast here there are a lot of wrecks about wrecks cried julian his eyes shining i say ive never seen an old wreck are there any to see not now said george theyve all been cleared up except one and thats the other side of the island its deep down in the water you can just see the broken mast if you row over it on a calm day and look down into the water that wreck really belongs to me too this time the children really could hardly believe george but she nodded her head firmly yes she said it was a ship belonging to one of my greatgreatgreatgrandfathers or someone like that he was bringing gold big bars of gold back in his shipand it got wrecked off kirrin island oooh what happened to the gold asked anne her eyes round and big nobody knows said george i expect it was stolen out of the ship divers have been down to see of course but they couldnt find any gold golly this does sound exciting said julian i wish i could see the wreck well we might perhaps go this afternoon when the tide is right down said george the water is so calm and clear today we could see a bit of it oh how wonderful said anne i do so want to see a real live wreck the others laughed well it wont be very alive said dick i say george what about a bathe i must go and get timothy first said george she got up whos timothy said dick can you keep a secret asked george nobody must know at home well go on whats the secret asked julian you can tell us were not sneaks timothy is my very greatest friend said george i couldnt do without him but mother and father dont like him so i have to keep him in secret ill go and fetch him she ran off up the cliff path the others watched her go they thought she was the queerest girl they had ever known who in the world can timothy be wondered julian some fisherboy i suppose that georges parents dont approve of the children lay back in the soft sand and waited soon they heard georges clear voice coming down from the cliff behind them come on timothy come on they sat up and looked to see what timothy was like they saw no fisherboy but instead a big brown mongrel dog with an absurdly long tail and a big wide mouth that really seemed to grin he was bounding all round george mad with delight she came running down to them this is timothy she said dont you think he is simply perfect as a dog timothy was far from perfect he was the wrong shape his head was too big his ears were too pricked his tail was too long and it was quite impossible to say what kind of a dog he was supposed to be but he was such a mad friendly clumsy laughable creature that every one of the children adored him at once oh you darling said anne and got a lick on the nose i say isnt he grand said dick and gave timothy a friendly smack that made the dog bound madly all round him i wish i had a dog like this said julian who really loved dogs and had always wanted one of his own oh george hes fine arent you proud of him the little girl smiled and her face altered at once and became sunny and pretty she sat down on the sand and her dog cuddled up to her licking her wherever he could find a bare piece of skin i love him awfully she said i found him out on the moors when he was just a pup a year ago and i took him home at first mother liked him but when he grew bigger he got terribly naughty what did he do asked anne well hes an awfully chewy kind of dog said george he chewed up everything he could a new rug mother had bought her nicest hat fathers slippers some of his papers and things like that and he barked too i liked his bark but father didnt he said it nearly drove him mad he hit timothy and that made me angry so i was awfully rude to him did you get spanked said anne i wouldnt like to be rude to your father he looks fierce george looked out over the bay her face had gone sulky again well it doesnt matter what punishment i got she said but the worst part of all was when father said i couldnt keep timothy any more and mother backed father up and said tim must go i cried for days and i never do cry you know because boys dont and i like to be like a boy boys do cry sometimes began anne looking at dick who had been a bit of a crybaby three or four years back dick gave her a sharp nudge and she said no more george looked at anne boys dont cry she said obstinately anyway ive never seen one and i always try not to cry myself its so babyish but i just couldnt help it when timothy had to go he cried too the children looked with great respect at timothy they had not known that a dog could cry before do you mean he cried real tears asked anne no not quite said george hes too brave for that he cried with his voice howled and howled and looked so miserable that he nearly broke my heart and then i knew i couldnt possibly part with him what happened then asked julian i went to alf a fisherboy i know said george and i asked him if hed keep tim for me if i paid him all the pocketmoney i get he said he would and so he does thats why i never have any money to spend it all has to go on tim he seems to eat an awful lot dont you tim woof said tim and rolled over on his back all his shaggy legs in the air julian tickled him how do you manage when you want any sweets or icecreams said anne who spent most of her pocketmoney on things of that sort i dont manage said george i go without of course this sounded awful to the other children who loved icecreams chocolates and sweets and had a good many of them they stared at george well i suppose the other children who play on the beach share their sweets and ices with you sometimes dont they asked julian i dont let them said george if i can never give them any myself its not fair to take them so i say no the tinkle of an icecream mans bell was heard in the distance julian felt in his pocket he jumped up and rushed off jingling his money in a few moments he was back again carrying four fat chocolate icecream bars he gave one to dick and one to anne and then held out one to george she looked at it longingly but shook her head no thanks she said you know what i just said i havent any money to buy them so i cant share mine with you and i cant take any from you its mean to take from people if you cant give even a little back you can take from us said julian trying to put the ice into georges brown hand were your cousins no thanks said george again though i do think its nice of you she looked at julian out of her blue eyes and the boy frowned as he tried to think of a way to make the obstinate little girl take the ice then he smiled listen he said youve got something we badly want to share in fact youve got a lot of things wed like to share if only youd let us you share those with us and let us share things like ices with you see what things have i got that you want to share asked george in surprise youve got a dog said julian patting the big brown mongrel wed love to share him with you hes such a darling and youve got a lovely island wed be simply thrilled if youd share it sometimes and youve got a wreck wed like to look at it and share it too ices and sweets arent so good as those things but it would be nice to make a bargain and share with each other george looked at the brown eyes that gazed steadily into hers she couldnt help liking julian it wasnt her nature to share anything she had always been an only child a lonely rather misunderstood little girl fierce and hottempered she had never had any friends of her own timothy looked up at julian and saw that he was offering something nice and chocolately to george he jumped up and licked the boy with his friendly tongue there you are you see tim wants to be shared said julian with a laugh it would be nice for him to have three new friends yes it would said george giving in suddenly and taking the chocolate bar thank you julian i will share with you but promise youll never tell anyone at home that im still keeping timothy of course well promise said julian but i cant imagine that your father or mother would mind so long as tim doesnt live in their house hows the ice is it nice ooooh the loveliest one ive ever tasted said george nibbling at it its so cold i havent had one this year its simply delicious timothy tried to nibble it too george gave him a few crumbs at the end then she turned and smiled at the three children youre nice she said im glad youve come after all lets take a boat out this afternoon and row round the island to have a look at the wreck shall we rather said all three at once and even timothy wagged his tail as if he understood chapter four an exciting afternoon contents prevnext they all had a bathe that morning and the boys found that george was a much better swimmer than they were she was very strong and very fast and she could swim under water too holding her breath for ages youre jolly good said julian admiringly its a pity anne isnt a bit better anne youll have to practise your swimming strokes hard or youll never be able to swim out as far as we do they were all very hungry at lunch time they went back up the cliffpath hoping there would be lots to eat and there was cold meat and salad plumpie and custard and cheese afterwards how the children tucked in what are you going to do this afternoon asked georges mother george is going to take us out in a boat to see the wreck on the other side of the island said anne her aunt looked most surprised george is going to take you she said why george whats come over you youve never taken a single person before though ive asked you to dozens of times george said nothing but went on eating her plumpie she hadnt said a word all through the meal her father had not appeared at the table much to the childrens relief well george i must say im pleased that you want to try and do what your father said began her mother again but george shook her head im not doing it because ive got to she said im doing it because i want to i wouldnt have taken anyone to see my wreck not even the queen of england if i didnt like them her mother laughed well its good news that you like your cousins she said i hope they like you oh yes said anne eagerly anxious to stick up for her strange cousin we do like george and we like ti she was just about to say that they liked timothy too when she got such a kick on her ankle that she cried out in pain and the tears came into her eyes george glared at her george why did you kick anne like that when she was saying nice things about you cried her mother leave the table at once i wont have such behaviour george left the table without a word she went out into the garden she had just taken a piece of bread and cut herself some cheese it was all left on her plate the other three stared at it in distress anne was upset how could she have been so silly as to forget she mustnt mention tim oh please call george back she said she didnt mean to kick me it was an accident but her aunt was very angry with george finish your meal she said to the others i expect george will go into the sulks now dear dear she is such a difficult child the others didnt mind about george going into the sulks what they did mind was that george might refuse to take them to see the wreck now they finished the meal in silence their aunt went to see if uncle quentin wanted any more pie he was having his meal in the study by himself as soon as she had gone out of the room anne picked up the bread and cheese from georges plate and went out into the garden the boys didnt scold her they knew that annes tongue very often ran away with her but she always tried to make up for it afterwards they thought it was very brave of her to go and find george george was lying on her back under a big tree in the garden anne went up to her im sorry i nearly made a mistake george she said heres your bread and cheese ive brought it for you i promise ill never forget not to mention tim again george sat up ive a good mind not to take you to see the wreck she said stupid baby annes heart sank this was what she had feared well she said you neednt take me of course but you might take the boys george after all they didnt do anything silly and anyway you gave me an awful kick look at the bruise george looked at it then she looked at anne but wouldnt you be miserable if i took julian and dick without you she asked of course said anne but i dont want to make them miss a treat even if i have to then george did a surprising thing for her she gave anne a hug then she immediately looked most ashamed of herself for she felt sure that no boy would have done that and she always tried to act like a boy its all right she said gruffly taking the bread and cheese you were nearly very silly and i gave you a kick so its all square of course you can come this afternoon anne sped back to tell the boys that everything was all right and in fifteen minutes time four children ran down to the beach by a boat was a brownfaced fisherboy about fourteen years old he had timothy with him boats all ready master george he said with a grin and tims ready too thanks said george and told the others to get in timothy jumped in too his big tail wagging nineteen to the dozen george pushed the boat off into the surf and then jumped in herself she took the oars she rowed splendidly and the boat shot along over the blue bay it was a wonderful afternoon and the children loved the movement of the boat over the water timothy stood at the prow and barked whenever a wave reared its head hes funny on a wild day said george pulling hard he barks madly at the big waves and gets so angry if they splash him hes an awfully good swimmer isnt it nice to have a dog with us said anne anxious to make up for her mistake i do so like him woof said timothy in his deep voice and turned round to lick annes ear im sure he knew what i said said anne in delight of course he did said george he understands every single word i say were getting near to your island now said julian in excitement its bigger than i thought and isnt the castle exciting they drew near to the island and the children saw that there were sharp rocks all round about it unless anyone knew exactly the way to take no boat or ship could possibly land on the shore of the rocky little island in the very middle of it on a low hill rose the ruined castle it had been built of big white stones broken archways tumbledown towers ruined walls that was all that was left of a once beautiful castle proud and strong now the jackdaws nested in it and the gulls sat on the topmost stones it looks awfully mysterious said julian how id love to land there and have a look at the castle wouldnt it be fun to spend a night or two here george stopped rowing her face lighted up i say she said in delight do you know i never thought how lovely that would be to spend a night on my island to be there all alone the four of us to get our own meals and pretend we really lived there wouldnt it be grand yes rather said dick looking longingly at the island do you think do you suppose your mother would let us i dont know said george she might you could ask her cant we land there this afternoon asked julian no not if you want to see the wreck said george weve got to get back for tea today and it will take all the time to row round to the other side of kirrin island and back well id like to see the wreck said julian torn between the island and the wreck here let me take the oars for a bit george you cant do all the rowing i can said george but id quite enjoy lying back in the boat for a change look ill just take you by this rocky bit and then you can take the oars till we come to another awkward piece honestly the rocks around this bay are simply dreadful george and julian changed places in the boat julian rowed well but not so strongly as george the boat sped along rocking smoothly they went right round the island and saw the castle from the other side it looked more ruined on the side that faced the sea the strong winds come from the open sea explained george theres not really much left of it this side except piles of stones but theres a good little harbour in a little cove for those who know how to find it george took the oars after a while and rowed steadily out a little beyond the island then she stopped and looked back towards the shore how do you know when you are over the wreck asked julian puzzled i should never know well do you see that church tower on the mainland asked george and do you see the tip of that hill over there well when you get them exactly in line with one another between the two towers of the castle on the island you are pretty well over the wreck i found that out ages ago the children saw that the tip of the faroff hill and the church tower were practically in line when they looked at them between the two old towers of the island castle they looked eagerly down into the sea to see if they could spy the wreck the water was perfectly clear and smooth there was hardly a wrinkle timothy looked down into it too his head on one side his ears cocked just as if he knew what he was looking for the children laughed at him were not exactly over it said george looking down too the waters so clear today that we should be able to see quite a long way down wait ill row a bit to the left woof said timothy suddenly and wagged his tail and at the same moment the three children saw something deep down in the water its the wreck said julian almost falling out of the boat in his excitement i can see a bit of broken mast look dick look all four children and the dog too gazed down earnestly into the clear water after a little while they could make out the outlines of a dark hulk out of which the broken mast stood its a bit on one side said julian poor old ship how it must hate lying there gradually falling to pieces george i wish i could dive down and get a closer look at it well why dont you said george youve got your swimming trunks on ive often dived down ill come with you if you like if dick can keep the boat round about here theres a current that is trying to take it out to sea dick youll have to keep working a bit with this oar to keep the boat in one spot the girl stripped off her jeans and jersey and julian did the same they both had on bathing costumes underneath george took a beautiful header off the end of the boat deep down into the water the others watched her swimming strongly downwards holding her breath after a bit she came up almost bursting for breath well i went almost down to the wreck she said its just the same as it always is seaweedy and covered with limpets and things i wish i could get right into the ship itself but i never have enough breath for that you go down now julian so down julian went but he was not so good at swimming deep under water as george was and he couldnt go down so far he knew how to open his eyes under water so he was able to take a good look at the deck of the wreck it looked very forlorn and strange julian didnt really like it very much it gave him rather a sad sort of feeling he was glad to go to the top of the water again and take deep breaths of air and feel the warm sunshine on his shoulders he climbed into the boat most exciting he said golly wouldnt i just love to see that wreck properly you know go down under the deck into the cabins and look around and oh suppose we could really find the boxes of gold thats impossible said george i told you proper divers have already gone down and found nothing whats the time i say well be late if we dont hurry back now they did hurry back and managed to be only about five minutes late for tea afterwards they went for a walk over the moors with timothy at their heels and by the time that bedtime came they were all so sleepy that they could hardly keep their eyes open well goodnight george said anne snuggling down into her bed weve had a lovely day thanks to you and ive had a lovely day too said george rather gruffly thanks to you im glad you all came were going to have fun and wont you love my castle and my little island ooh yes said anne and fell asleep to dream of wrecks and castles and islands by the hundred oh when would george take them to her little island chapter five a visit to the island contents prevnext the childrens aunt arranged a picnic for them the next day and they all went off to a little cove not far off where they could bathe and paddle to their hearts content they had a wonderful day but secretly julian dick and anne wished they could have visited georges island they would rather have done that than anything george didnt want to go for the picnic not because she disliked picnics but because she couldnt take her dog her mother went with the children and george had to pass a whole day without her beloved timothy bad luck said julian who guessed what she was brooding about i cant think why you dont tell your mother about old tim im sure she wouldnt mind you letting someone else keep him for you i know my mother wouldnt mind im not going to tell anybody but you said george i get into awful trouble at home always i dare say its my fault but i get a bit tired of it you see daddy doesnt make much money with the learned books he writes and hes always wanting to give mother and me things he cant afford so that makes him badtempered he wants to send me away to a good school but he hasnt got the money im glad i dont want to go away to school i like being here i couldnt bear to part with timothy youd like boarding school said anne we all go its fun no it isnt said george obstinately it must be awful to be one of a crowd and to have other girls all laughing and yelling round you i should hate it no you wouldnt said anne all that is great fun it would be good for you george i should think if you start telling me what is good for me i shall hate you said george suddenly looking very fierce mother and father are always saying that things are good for me and they are always the things i dont like all right all right said julian beginning to laugh my goodness how you do go up in smoke honestly i believe anyone could light a cigarette from the sparks that fly from your eyes that made george laugh though she didnt want to it was really impossible to sulk with goodtempered julian they went off to bathe in the sea for the fifth time that day soon they were all splashing about happily and george found time to help anne to swim the little girl hadnt got the right stroke and george felt really proud when she had taught her oh thanks said anne struggling along ill never be as good as you but id like to be as good as the boys as they were going home george spoke to julian could you say that you want to go and buy a stamp or something she said then i could go with you and just have a peep at old tim hell be wondering why i havent taken him out today right said julian i dont want stamps but i could do with an ice dick and anne can go home with your mother and carry the things ill just go and tell aunt fanny he ran up to his aunt do you mind if i go and buy some icecreams he asked we havent had one today i wont be long can george go with me i dont expect she will want to said his aunt but you can ask her george come with me yelled julian setting off to the little village at a great pace george gave a sudden grin and ran after him she soon caught him up and smiled gratefully at him thanks she said you go and get the icecreams and ill have a look at tim they parted julian bought four icecreams and turned to go home he waited about for george who came running up after a few minutes her face was glowing hes all right she said and you cant imagine how pleased he was to see me he nearly jumped over my head i say another icecream for me you really are a sport julian ill have to share something with you quickly what about going to my island tomorrow golly said julian his eyes shining that would be marvellous will you really take us tomorrow come on lets tell the others the four children sat in the garden eating their ices julian told them what george had said they all felt excited george was pleased she had always felt quite important before when she had haughtily refused to take any of the other children to see kirrin island but it felt much nicer somehow to have consented to row her cousins there i used to think it was much much nicer always to do things on my own she thought as she sucked the last bits of her ice but its going to be fun doing things with julian and the others the children were sent to wash themselves and to get tidy before supper they talked eagerly about the visit to the island next day their aunt heard them and smiled well i really must say im pleased that george is going to share something with you she said would you like to take your dinner there and spend the day its hardly worth while rowing all the way there and landing unless you are going to spend some hours there oh aunt fanny it would be marvellous to take our dinner cried anne george looked up are you coming too mother she asked you dont sound at all as if you want me to said her mother in a hurt tone you looked cross yesterday too when you found i was coming no i shant come tomorrow but im sure your cousins must think you are a queer girl never to want your mother to go with you george said nothing she hardly ever did say a word when she was scolded the other children said nothing too they knew perfectly well that it wasnt that george didnt want her mother to go it was just that she wanted timothy with her anyway i couldnt come went on aunt fanny ive some gardening to do youll be quite safe with george she can handle a boat like a man the three children looked eagerly at the weather the next day when they got up the sun was shining and everything seemed splendid isnt it a marvellous daysaid anne to georgeas they dressed im so looking forward to going to the island well honestly i think really we oughtnt to go said george unexpectedly oh but why cried anne in dismay i think theres going to be a storm or something said george looking out to the southwest but george why do you say that said anne impatiently look at the sun and theres hardly a cloud in the sky the wind is wrong said george and cant you see the little white tops to the waves out there by my island thats always a bad sign oh george it will be the biggest disappointment of our lives if we dont go today said anne who couldnt bear any disappointment big or small and besides she added artfully if we hang about the house afraid of a storm we shant be able to have dear old tim with us yes thats true said george all right well go but mind if a storm does come youre not to be a baby youre to try and enjoy it and not be frightened well i dont much like storms began anne but stopped when she saw georges scornful look they went down to breakfast and george asked her mother if they could take their dinner as they had planned yes said her mother you and anne can help to make the sandwiches you boys can go into the garden and pick some ripe plumsto take with you julian you can go down to the village when youve done that and buy some bottles of lemonade or gingerbeer whichever you like gingerpop for me thanks said julian and everyone else said the same they all felt very happy it would be marvellous to visit the queer little island george felt happy because she would be with tim all day they set off at last the food in two kitbags the first thing they did was to fetch tim he was tied up in the fisherboys back yard the boy himself was there and grinned at george morning master george he said it seemed so queer to the other children to hear georgina called master george tims been barking his head off for you i guess he knew you were coming for him today of course he did said george untying him he at once went completely mad and tore round and round the children his tail down and his ears flat hed win any race if only he was a greyhound said julian admiringly you can hardly see him for dust tim hie tim come and say goodmorning tim leapt up and licked julians left ear as he passed on his whirlwind way then he sobered down and ran lovingly by george as they all made their way to the beach he licked georges bare legs every now and again and she pulled at his ears gently they got into the boat and george pushed off the fisherboy waved to them you wont be very long will you he called theres a storm blowing up bad one itll be too i know shouted back george but maybe well get back before it begins its pretty far off yet george rowed all the way to the island tim stood at each end of the boat in turn barking when the waves reared up at him the children watched the island coming closer and closer it looked even more exciting than it had the other day george where are you going to land asked julian i simply cant imagine how you know your way in and out of these awful rocks im afraid every moment well bump into them im going to land at the little cove i told you about the other day said george theres only one way to it but i know it very well its hidden away on the east side of the island the girl cleverly worked her boat in and out of the rocks and suddenly as it rounded a low wall of sharp rocks the children saw the cove she had spoken of it was like a natural little harbour and was a smooth inlet of water running up to a stretch of sand sheltered between high rocks the boat slid into the inlet and at once stopped rocking for here the water was like glass and had hardly a wrinkle i say this is fine said julian his eyes shining with delight george looked at him and her eyes shone too as bright as the sea itself it was the first time she had ever taken anyone to her precious island and she was enjoying it they landed on the smooth yellow sand were really on the island said anne and she capered about tim joining her and looking as mad as she did the others laughed george pulled the boat high up on the sand why so far up said julian helping her the tides almost in isnt it surely it wont come as high as this i told you i thought a storm was coming said george if one does the waves simply tear up this inlet and we dont want to lose our boat do we lets explore the island lets explore the island yelled anne who was now at the top of the little natural harbour climbing up the rocks there oh do come on they all followed her it really was a most exciting place rabbits were everywhere they scuttled about as the children appeared but did not go into their holes arent they awfully tame said julian in surprise well nobody ever comes here but me said george and i dont frighten them tim tim if you go after the rabbits ill spank you tim turned big sorrowful eyes on to george he and george agreed about every single thing except rabbits to tim rabbits were made for one thingto chase he never could understand why george wouldnt let him do this but he held himself in and walked solemnly by the children his eyes watching the lolloping rabbits longingly i believe they would almost eat out of my hand said julian but george shook her head no ive tried that with them she said they wont look at those baby ones arent they lovely woof said tim agreeing and he took a few steps towards them george made a warning noise in her throat and tim walked back his tail down theres the castle said julian shall we explore that now i do want to yes we will said george look that is where the entrance used to be through that big broken archway the children gazed at the enormous old archway now halfbroken down behind it were ruined stone steps leading towards the centre of the castle it had strong walls all round it with two towers said george one tower is almost gone as you can see but the other is not so bad the jackdaws build in that every year theyve almost filled it up with their sticks as they came near to the better tower of the two the jackdaws circled round them with loud cries of chack chack chack tim leapt into the air as if he thought he could get them but they only called mockingly to him this is the centre of the castle said george as they entered through a ruined doorway into what looked like a great yard whose stone floor was now overgrown with grass and other weeds here is where the people used to live you can see where the rooms were look theres one almost whole there go through that little door and youll see it they trooped through a doorway and found themselves in a dark stonewalled stoneroofed room with a space at one end where a fireplace must have been two slitlike windows lighted the room it felt very queer and mysterious what a pity its all broken down said julian wandering out again that room seems to be the only one quite whole there are some others here but all of them seem to have either no roof or one or other of the walls gone that room is the only liveable one was there an upstairs to the castle george of course said george but the steps that led up are gone look you can see part of an upstairs room there by the jackdaw tower you cant get up to it though because ive tried i nearly broke my neck trying to get up the stones crumble away so were there any dungeons asked dick i dont know said george i expect so but nobody could find them now everywhere is so overgrown it was indeed overgrown big blackberry bushes grew here and there and a few gorse bushes forced their way into gaps and corners the coarse green grass sprang everywhere and pink thrift grew its cushions in holes and crannies well i think its a perfectly lovely place said anne perfectly and absolutely lovely do you really said george pleased im so glad look were right on the other side of the island now facing the sea do you see those rocks with those queer big birds sitting there the children looked they saw some rocks sticking up with great black shining birds sitting on them in queer positions they are cormorants said george theyve caught plenty of fish for their dinner and theyre sitting there digesting it hallo theyre all flying away i wonder why she soon knew for from the southwest there suddenly came an ominous rumble thunder said george thats the storm its coming sooner than i thought chapter six what the storm did contents prevnext the four children stared out to sea they had all been so interested in exploring the exciting old castle that not one of them had noticed the sudden change in the weather another rumble came it sounded like a big dog growling in the sky tim heard it and growled back sounding like a small roll of thunder himself my goodness were in for it now said george halfalarmed we cant get back in time thats certain its blowing up at top speed did ever you see such a change in the sky the sky had been blue when they started now it was overcast and the clouds seemed to hang very low indeed they scudded along as if someone was chasing them and the wind howled round in such a mournful way that anne felt quite frightened its beginning to rain said julian feeling an enormous drop spatter on his outstretched hand we had better shelter hadnt we george we shall get wet through yes we will in a minute said george i say just look at these big waves coming my word it really is going to be a storm golly what a flash of lightning the waves were certainly beginning to run very high indeed it was queer to see what a change had come over them they swelled up turned over as soon as they came to rocks and then rushed up the beach of the island with a great roar i think wed better pull our boat up higher still said george suddenly its going to be a very bad storm indeed sometimes these sudden summer storms are worse than a winter one she and julian ran to the other side of the island where they had left the boat it was a good thing they went for great waves were already racing right up to it the two children pulled the boat up almost to the top of the low cliff and george tied it to a stout gorse bush growing there by now the rain was simply pelting down and george and julian were soaked i hope the others have been sensible enough to shelter in that room that has a roof and walls said george they were there all right looking rather cold and scared it was very dark there for the only light came through the two slits of windows and the small doorway could we light a fire to make things a bit more cheerful said julian looking round i wonder where we can find some nice dry sticks almost as if they were answering the question a small crowd of jackdaws cried out wildly as they circled in the storm chack chack chack of course there are plenty of sticks on the ground below the tower cried julian you know where the jackdaws nest theyve dropped lots of sticks there he dashed out into the rain and ran to the tower he picked up an armful of sticks and ran back good said george well be able to make a nice fire with those anyone got any paper to start it or matches ive got some matches said julian but nobodys got paper yes said anne suddenly the sandwiches are wrapped in paper lets undo them and then we can use the paper for the fire good idea said george so they undid the sandwiches and put them neatly on a broken stone rubbing it clean first then they built up a fire with the paper underneath and the sticks arranged crisscross on top it was fun when they lighted the paper it flared up and the sticks at once caught fire for they were very old and dry soon there was a fine cracking fire going and the little ruined room was lighted by dancing flames it was very dark outside now for the clouds hung almost low enough to touch the top of the castle tower and how they raced by the wind sent them off to the northeast roaring behind them with a noise like the sea itself ive never never heard the sea making such an awful noise said anne never it really sounds as if its shouting at the top of its voice what with the howling of the wind and the crashing of the great waves all round the little island the children could hardly hear themselves speak they had to shout at one another lets have our dinner yelled dick who was feeling terribly hungry as usual we cant do anything much while this storm lasts yes lets said anne looking longingly at the ham sandwiches it will be fun to have a picnic round the fire in this dark old room i wonder how long ago other people had a meal here i wish i could see them well i dont said dick looking round halfscared as if he expected to see the oldtime people walk in to share their picnic its quite a queer enough day without wanting things like that to happen they all felt better when they were eating the sandwiches and drinking the gingerbeer the fire flared up as more and more sticks caught and gave out quite a pleasant warmth for now that the wind had got up so strongly the day had become cold well take it in turn to fetch sticks said george but anne didnt want to go alone she was trying her best not to show that she was afraid of the storm but it was more than she could do to go out of the cosy room into the rain and thunder by herself tim didnt seem to like the storm either he sat close by george his ears cocked and growled whenever the thunder rumbled the children fed him with titbits and he ate them eagerly for he was hungry too all the children had four biscuits each i think i shall give all mine to tim said george i didnt bring him any of his own biscuits and he does seem so hungry no dont do that said julian well each give him a biscuit that will be four for him and well still have three left each that will be plenty for us you are really nice said george tim dont you think they are nice tim did he licked everyone and made them laugh then he rolled over on his back and let julian tickle him underneath the children fed the fire and finished their picnic when it came to julians turn to get more sticks he disappeared out of the room into the storm he stood and looked around the rain wetting his bare head the storm seemed to be right overhead now the lightning flashed and the thunder crashed at the same moment julian was not a bit afraid of storms but he couldnt help feeling rather overawed at this one it was so magnificent the lightning tore the sky in half almost every minute and the thunder crashed so loudly that it sounded almost as if mountains were falling down all around the seas voice could be heard as soon as the thunder stopped and that was magnificent to hear too the spray flew so high into the air that it wetted julian as he stood in the centre of the ruined castle i really must see what the waves are like thought the boy if the spray flies right over me here they must be simply enormous he made his way out of the castle and climbed up on to part of the ruined wall that had once run all round the castle he stood up there looking out to the open sea and what a sight met his eyes the waves were like great walls of greygreen they dashed over the rocks that lay all around the island and spray flew from them gleaming white in the stormy sky they rolled up to the island and dashed themselves against it with such terrific force that julian could feel the wall beneath his feet tremble with the shock the boy looked out to sea marvelling at the really great sight he saw for half a moment he wondered if the sea might come right over the island itself then he knew that couldnt happen for it would have happened before he stared at the great waves coming in and then he saw something rather queer there was something else out on the sea by the rocks besides the waves something dark something big something that seemed to lurch out of the waves and settle down again what could it be it cant be a ship said julian to himself his heart beginning to beat fast as he strained his eyes to see through the rain and the spray and yet it looks more like a ship than anything else i hope it isnt a ship there wouldnt be anyone saved from it on this dreadful day he stood and watched for a while the dark shape heaved into sight again and then sank away once more julian decided to go and tell the others he ran back to the firelit room george dick theres something queer out on the rocks beyond the island he shouted at the top of his voice it looks like a ship and yet it cant possibly be come and see the others stared at him in surprise and jumped to their feet george hurriedly flung some more sticks on the fire to keep it going and then she and the others quickly followed julian out into the rain the storm seemed to be passing over a little now the rain was not pelting down quite so hard the thunder was rolling a little farther off and the lightning did not flash so often julian led the way to the wall on which he had climbed to watch the sea everyone climbed up to gaze out to sea they saw a great tumbled heaving mass of greygreen water with waves rearing up everywhere their tops broke over the rocks and they rushed up to the island as if they would gobble it whole anne slipped her arm through julians she felt rather small and scared youre all right anne said julian loudly now just watch youll see something queer in a minute they all watched at first they saw nothing for the waves reared up so high that they hid everything a little way out then suddenly george saw what julian meant gracious she shouted it is a ship yes it is is it being wrecked its a big ship not a sailingboat or fishingsmack oh is anyone in it wailed anne the four children watched and tim began to bark as he saw the queer dark shape lurching here and there in the enormous waves the sea was bringing the ship nearer to shore it will be dashed on to those rocks said julian suddenly look there it goes as he spoke there came a tremendous crashing splintering sound and the dark shape of the ship settled down on to the sharp teeth of the dangerous rocks on the southwest side of the island it stayed there shifting only slightly as the big waves ran under it and lifted it a little shes stuck there said julian she wont move now the sea will soon be going down a bit and then the ship will find herself held by those rocks as he spoke a ray of pale sunshine came wavering out between a gap in the thinning clouds it was gone almost at once good said dick looking upwards the sun will be out again soon we can warm ourselves then and get dry and maybe we can find out what that poor ship is oh julian i do so hope there was nobody in it i hope theyve all taken to boats and got safely to land the clouds thinned out a little more the wind stopped roaring and dropped to a steady breeze the sun shone out again for a longer time and the children felt its welcome warmth they all stared at the ship on the rocks the sun shone on it and lighted it up theres something queer about it somehow said julian slowly something awfully queer ive never seen a ship quite like it george was staring at it with a strange look in her eyes she turned to face the three children and they were astonished to see the bright gleam in her blue eyes the girl looked almost too excited to speak what is it asked julian catching hold of her hand julian oh julian its my wreck she cried in a high excited voice dont you see whats happened the storm has lifted the ship up from the bottom of the sea and has lodged it on those rocks its my wreck the others saw at once that she was right it was the old wrecked ship no wonder it looked queer no wonder it looked so old and dark and such a strange shape it was the wreck lifted high out of its sleepingplace and put on the rocks near by george we shall be able to row out and get into the wreck now shouted julian we shall be able to explore it from end to end we may find the boxes of gold oh george chapter seven back to kirrin cottage contents prevnext the four children were so tremendously surprised and excited that for a minute or two they didnt say a word they just stared at the dark hulk of the old wreck imagining what they might find then julian clutched georges arm and pressed it tightly isnt this wonderful he said oh george isnt it an extraordinary thing to happen still george said nothing but stared at the wreck all kinds of thoughts racing through her mind then she turned to julian if only the wreck is still mine now its thrown up like this she said i dont know if wrecks belong to the queen or anyone like lost treasure does but after all the ship did belong to our family nobody bothered much about it when it was down under the sea but do you suppose people will still let me have it for my own now its thrown up well dont lets tell anyone said dick dont be silly said george one of the fishermen is sure to see it when his ship goes slipping out of the bay the news will soon be out well then wed better explore it thoroughly ourselves before anyone else does said dick eagerly no one knows about it yet only us cant we explore it as soon as the waves go down a bit we cant wade out to the rocks if thats what you mean said george we might get there by boat but we couldnt possibly risk it now while the waves are so big they wont go down today thats certain the wind is still too strong well what about tomorrow morning early said julian before anyone has got to know about it i bet if only we can get into the ship first we can find anything there is to find yes i expect we could said george i told you divers had been down and explored the ship as thoroughly as they could but of course it is difficult to do that properly under water we might find something theyve missed oh this is like a dream i cant believe its true that my old wreck has come up from the bottom of the sea like that the sun was now properly out and the childrens wet clothes dried in its hot rays they steamed in the sun and even tims coat sent up a mist too he didnt seem to like the wreck at all but growled deeply at it you are funny tim said george patting him it wont hurt you what do you think it is he probably thinks its a whale said anne with a laugh oh george this is the most exciting day of my life oh cant we possibly take the boat and see if we can get to the wreck no we cant said george i only wish we could but its quite impossible anne for one thing i dont think the wreck has quite settled down on the rocks yet and maybe it wont till the tide has gone down i can see it lifting a little still when an extra big wave comes it would be dangerous to go into it yet and for another thing i dont want my boat smashed to bits on the rocks and us thrown into that wild water thats what would happen we must wait till tomorrow its a good idea to come early i expect lots of grownups will think its their business to explore it the children watched the old wreck for a little time longer and then went all round the island again it was certainly not very large but it really was exciting with its rocky little coast its quiet inlet where their boat was the ruined castle the circling jackdaws and the scampering rabbits everywhere i do love it said anne i really do its just small enough to feel like an island most islands are too big to feel like islands i mean britain is an island but nobody living on it could possibly know it unless they were told now this island really feels like one because wherever you are you can see to the other side of it i love it george felt very happy she had often been on her island before but always alone except for tim she had always vowed that she never never would take anyone there because it would spoil her island for her but it hadnt been spoilt it had made it much nicer for the first time george began to understand that sharing pleasures doubles their joy well wait till the waves go down a bit then well go back home she said i rather think theres some more rain coming and well only get soaked through we shant be back till teatime as it is because well have a long pull against the outgoing tide all the children felt a little tired after the excitements of the morning they said very little as they rowed home everyone took turns at rowing except anne who was not strong enough with the oars to row against the tide they looked back at the island as they left it they couldnt see the wreck because that was on the opposite side facing the open sea its just as well its there said julian no one can see it yet only when a boat goes out to fish will it be seen and we shall be there as early as any boat goes out i vote we get up at dawn well thats pretty early said george can you wake up im often out at dawn but youre not used to it of course we can wake up said julian well here we are back at the beach again and im jolly glad my arms are awfully tired and im so hungry i could eat a whole larderful of things woof said tim quite agreeing ill have to take tim to alf said george jumping out of the boat you get the boat in julian ill join you in a few minutes it wasnt long before all four were sitting down to a good tea aunt fanny had baked new scones for them and had made a ginger cake with black treacle it was dark brown and sticky to eat the children finished it all up and said it was the nicest they had ever tasted did you have an exciting day asked their aunt oh yes said anne eagerly the storm was grand it threw up julian and dick both kicked her under the table george couldnt reach her or she would most certainly have kicked her too anne stared at the boys angrily with tears in her eyes now whats the matter asked aunt fanny did somebody kick you anne well really this kicking under the table has got to stop poor anne will be covered with bruises what did the sea throw up dear it threw up the most enormous waves said anne looking defiantly at the others she knew they had thought she was going to say that the sea had thrown up the wreck but they were wrong they had kicked her for nothing sorry for kicking you anne said julian my foot sort of slipped so did mine said dick yes aunt fanny it was a magnificent sight on the island the waves raced up that little inlet and we had to take our boat almost up to the top of the low cliff there i wasnt really afraid of the storm said anne in fact i wasnt really as afraid of it as ti everyone knew perfectly well that anne was going to mention timothy and they all interrupted her at once speaking very loudly julian managed to get a kick in again oooh said anne the rabbits were so tame said julian loudly we watched the cormorants said dick and george joined in too talking at the same time the jackdaws made such a noise they said chack chack chack all the time well really you sound like jackdaws yourselves talking all at once like this said aunt fanny with a laugh now have you all finished very well then go and wash your sticky hands yes george i know theyre sticky because i made that gingerbread and youve had three slices then you had better go and play quietly in the other room because its raining and you cant go out but dont disturb your father george hes very busy the children went to wash idiot said julian to anne nearly gave us away twice i didnt mean what you thought i meant the first time began anne indignantly george interrupted her id rather you gave the secret of the wreck away than my secret about tim she said i do think youve got a careless tongue yes i have said anne sorrowfully i think id better not talk at mealtimes any more i love tim so much i just cant seem to help wanting to talk about him they all went to play in the other room julian turned a table upside down with a crash well play at wrecks he said this is the wreck now were going to explore it the door flew open and an angry frowning face looked in it was georges father what was that noise he said george did you overturn that table i did said julian im sorry sir i quite forgot you were working any more noise like that and i shall keep you all in bed tomorrow said his uncle quentin georgina keep your cousins quiet the door shut and uncle quentin went out the children looked at one another your fathers awfully fierce isnt he said julian im sorry i made that row i didnt think wed better do something really quiet said george or hell keep his word and well find ourselves in bed tomorrow just when we want to explore the wreck this was a terrible thought anne went to get one of her dolls to play with she had managed to bring quite a number after all julian fetched a book george took up a beautiful little boat she was carving out of a piece of wood dick lay back on a chair and thought of the exciting wreck the rain poured down steadily and everyone hoped it would have stopped by the morning well have to be up most awfully early said dick yawning what about going to bed in good time tonight im tired with all that rowing in the ordinary way none of the children liked going to bed early but with such an exciting thing to look forward to earlybed seemed different that night it will make the time go quickly said anne putting down her doll shall we go now whatever do you suppose mother would say if we went just after tea said george shed think we were all ill no lets go after supper well just say were tired with rowing which is perfectly true and well get a good nights sleep and be ready for our adventure tomorrow morning and it is an adventure you know it isnt many people that have the chance of exploring an old old wreck like that which has always been at the bottom of the sea so by eight oclock all the children were in bed rather to aunt fannys surprise anne fell asleep at once julian and dick were not long but george lay awake for some time thinking of her island her wreck and of course her beloved dog i must take tim too she thought as she fell asleep we cant leave old tim out of this he shall share in the adventure too chapter eight exploring the wreck contents prevnext julian woke first the next morning he awoke just as the sun was slipping over the horizon in the east and filling the sky with gold julian stared at the ceiling for a moment and then in a rush he remembered all that had happened the day before he sat up straight in bed and whispered as loudly as he could dick wake up were going to see the wreck do wake up dick woke and grinned at julian a feeling of happiness crept over him they were going on an adventure he leapt out of bed and ran quietly to the girls room he opened the door both the girls were fast asleep anne curled up like a dormouse under the sheet dick shook george and then dug anne in the back they awoke and sat up buck up whispered dick the sun is just rising well have to hurry georges blue eyes shone as she dressed anne skipped about quietly finding her few clothes just a bathing suit jeans and jersey and rubber shoes for her feet it wasnt many minutes before they were all ready now not a creak on the stairs not a cough or a giggle warned julian as they stood together on the landing anne was a dreadful giggler and had often given secret plans away by her sudden explosive choke but this time the little girl was as solemn as the others and as careful they crept down the stairs and undid the little front door not a sound was made they shut the door quietly and made their way down the garden path to the gate the gate always creaked so they climbed over it instead of opening it the sun was now shining brightly though it was still low in the eastern sky it felt warm already the sky was so beautifully blue that anne couldnt help feeling it had been freshly washed it looks just as if it had come back from the laundry she told the others they squealed with laughter at her she did say odd things at times but they knew what she meant the day had a lovely new feeling about itthe clouds were so pink in the bright blue sky and the sea looked so smooth and fresh it was impossible to imagine that it had been so rough the day before george got her boat then she went to get tim while the boys hauled the boat down to the sea alf the fisherboy was surprised to see george so early he was about to go with his father fishing he grinned at george you going fishing too he said to her my wasnt that a storm yesterday i thought youd be caught in it we were said george come on tim come on tim was very pleased to see george so early he capered round her as she ran back to the others almost tripping her up as she went he leapt into the boat as soon as he saw it and stood at the stern his red tongue out his tail wagging violently i wonder his tail keeps on said anne looking at it one day timothy youll wag it right off they set off to the island it was easy to row now because the sea was so calm they came to the island and rowed around it to the other side and there was the wreck piled high on some sharp rocks it had settled down now and did not stir as waves slid under it it lay a little to one side and the broken mast now shorter than before stuck out at an angle there she is said julian in excitement poor old wreck i guess shes a bit more battered now what a noise she made when she went crashing on to those rocks yesterday how do we get to her asked anne looking at the mass of ugly sharp rocks all around but george was not at all dismayed she knew almost every inch of the coast around her little island she pulled steadily at the oars and soon came near to the rocks in which the great wreck rested the children looked at the wreck from their boat it was big much bigger than they had imagined when they had peered at it from the top of the water it was encrusted with shellfish of some kind and strands of brown and green seaweed hung down it smelt queer it had great holes in its sides showing where it had battered against rocks there were holes in the deck too altogether it looked a sad and forlorn old ship but to the four children it was the most exciting thing in the whole world they rowed to the rocks on which the wreck lay the tide washed over them george took a look round well tie our boat up to the wreck itself she said and well get on to the deck quite easily by climbing up the side look julian throw this loop of rope over that broken bit of wood there sticking out from the side julian did as he was told the rope tightened and the boat was held in position then george clambered up the side of the wreck like a monkey she was a marvel at climbing julian and dick followed her but anne had to be helped up soon all four were standing on the slanting deck it was slippery with seaweed and the smell was very strong indeed anne didnt like it well this was the deck said george and thats where the men got up and down she pointed to a large hole they went to it and looked down the remains of an iron ladder were still there george looked at it i think its still strong enough to hold us she said ill go first anyone got a torch it looks pretty dark down there julian had a torch he handed it to george the children became rather quiet it was mysterious somehow to look down into the dark inside of the big ship what would they find george switched on the torch and then swung herself down the ladder the others followed the light from the torch showed a very queer sight the underparts of the ship were lowceilinged made of thick oak the children had to bend their heads to get about it seemed as if there were places that might have been cabins though it was difficult to tell now for everything was so battered seadrenched and seaweedy the smell was really horrid though it was mostly of drying seaweed the children slipped about on the seaweed as they went round the inside of the ship it didnt seem so big inside after all there was a big hold under the cabins which the children saw by the light of their torch thats where the boxes of gold would have been kept i expect said julian but there was nothing in the hold except water and fish the children couldnt go down because the water was too deep one or two barrels floated in the water but they had burst open and were quite empty i expect they were waterbarrels or barrels of pork or biscuit said george lets go round the other part of the ship again where the cabins are isnt it strange to see bunks there that sailors have slept in and look at that old wooden chair fancy it still being here after all these years look at the things on those hooks too they are all rusty now and covered with seaweedy stuff but they must have been the cooks pans and dishes it was a very queer trip round the old wreck the children were all on the lookout for boxes which might contain bars of gold but there didnt seem to be one single box of any kind anywhere they came to a rather bigger cabin than the others it had a bunk in one corner in which a large crab rested an old bit of furniture looking rather like a tablet with two legs all encrusted with greyish shells lay against the bunk wooden shelves festooned with greygreen seaweed hung crookedly on the walls of the cabin this must have been the captains own cabin said julian its the biggest one look whats that in the corner an old cup said anne picking it up and heres half of a saucer i expect the captain was sitting here having a cup of tea when the ship went down this made the children feel rather queer it was dark and smelly in the little cabin and the floor was wet and slippery to their feet george began to feel that her wreck was really more pleasant sunk under the water than raised above it lets go she said with a shiver i dont like it much it is exciting i know but its a bit frightening too they turned to go julian flashed his torch round the little cabin for the last time he was about to switch it off and follow the others up to the deck above when he caught sight of something that made him stop he flashed his torch on to it and then called to the others i say wait a bit theres a cupboard here in the wall lets see if theres anything in it the others turned back and looked they saw what looked like a small cupboard let in level with the wall of the cabin what had caught julians eye was the keyhole there was no key there though there just might be something inside said julian he tried to prise open the wooden door with his fingers but it wouldnt move its locked he said of course it would be i expect the lock is rotten by now said george and she tried too then she took out her big strong pocketknife and inserted it between the cupboard door and the cabinwall she forced back the blade and the lock of the cupboard suddenly snapped as she had said it was quite rotten the door swung open and the children saw a shelf inside with a few curious things on it there was a wooden box swollen with the wet seawater in which it had lain for years there were two or three things that looked like old pulpy books there was some sort of glass drinkingvessel cracked in half and two or three funny objects so spoilt by seawater that no one could possibly say what they were nothing very interesting except the box said julian and he picked it up anyway i expect that whatever is inside is ruined but we may as well try and open it he and george tried their best to force the lock of the old wooden box on the top of it were stamped initialshj k i expect those were the captains initials said dick no they were the initials of my greatgreatgreatgrandfather said george her eyes shining suddenly ive heard all about him his name was henry john kirrin this was his ship you know this must have been his veryprivate box in which he kept his old papers or diaries ohwe simply must open it but it was quite impossible to force the lid up with the tools they had there they soon gave it up and julian picked up the box to carry it to the boat well open it at home he said his voice sounding rather excited well get a hammer or something and get it open somehow oh george this really is a find they all of them felt that they really had something mysterious in their possession was there anything inside the box and if so what would it be they longed to get home and open it they went up on deck climbing the old iron ladder as soon as they got there they saw that others besides themselves had discovered that the wreck had been thrown up from the bottom of the sea golly half the fishingsmacks of the bay have discovered it cried julian looking round at the fishingboats that had come as near as they dared to the wreck the fishermen were looking at the wreck in wonder when they saw the children on board they hallooed loudly ahoy there whats that ship its the old wreck yelled back julian she was thrown up yesterday in the storm dont say any more said george frowning its my wreck i dont want sightseers on it so no more was said and the four children got into their boat and rowed home as fast as they could it was past their breakfasttime they might get a good scolding they might even be sent to bed by georges fierce father but what did they care they had explored the wreckand had come away with a box which might containwell if not bars of gold one small bar perhaps they did get a scolding they had to go without half their breakfast too because uncle quentin said that children who came in so late didnt deserve hot bacon and eggs only toast and marmalade it was very sad they hid the box under the bed in the boys room tim had been left with the fisherboy or rather had been tied up in his back yard for alf had gone out fishing and was even now gazing from his fathers boat at the strange wreck we can make a bit of money taking sightseers out to this wreck said alf and before the day was out scores of interested people had seen the old wreck from the decks of motorboats and fishingsmacks george was furious about it but she couldnt do anything after all as julian said anybody could have a look chapter nine the box from the wreck contents prevnext the first thing that the children did after breakfast was to fetch the precious box and take it out to the toolshed in the garden they were simply longing to force it open all of them secretly felt certain that it would hold treasure of some sort julian looked round for a tool he found a chisel and decided that would be just the thing to force the box open he tried but the tool slipped and jabbed his fingers then he tried other things but the box obstinately refused to open the children stared at it crossly i know what to do said anne at last lets take it to the top of the house and throw it down to the ground it would burst open then i expect the others thought over the idea it might be worth trying said julian the only thing is it might break or spoil anything inside the box but there didnt seem any other way to open the box so julian carried it up to the top of the house he went to the attic and opened the window there the others were down below waiting julian hurled the box out of the window as violently as he could it flew through the air and landed with a terrific crash on the crazy paving below at once the french window there opened and their uncle quentin came out like a bullet from a gun whatever are you doing he cried surely you arent throwing things at each other out of the window whats this on the ground the children looked at the box it had burst open and lay on the ground showing a tin lining that was waterproof whatever was in the box would not be spoilt it would be quite dry dick ran to pick it up i said whats this on the ground shouted his uncle and moved towards him its its something that belongs to us said dick going red well i shall take it away from you said his uncle disturbing me like this give it to me where did you get it nobody answered uncle quentin frowned till his glasses nearly fell off where did you get it he barked glaring at poor anne who was nearest out of the wreck stammered the little girl scared out of the wreck said her uncle in surprise the old wreck that was thrown up yesterday i heard about that do you mean to say youve been in it yes said dick julian joined them at that moment looking worried it would be too awful if his uncle took the box just as they got it open but that was exactly what he did do well this box may contain something important he said and he took it from dicks hands youve no right to go prying about in that old wreck you might take something that mattered well its my wreck said george in a defiant tone please father let us have the box wed just got it opened we thought it might hold a gold bar or something like that a gold bar said her father with a snort what a baby you are this small box would never hold a thing like that its much more likely to contain particulars of what happened to the bars i have always thought that the gold was safely delivered somewhere and that the ship empty of its valuable cargo got wrecked as it left the bay oh father please please let us have our box begged george almost in tears she suddenly felt certain that it did contain papers that might tell them what had happened to the gold but without another word her father turned and went into the house carrying the box burst open and cracked its tin lining showing through under his arm anne burst into tears dont blame me for telling him we got it from the wreck she sobbed please dont he glared at me so i just had to tell him all right baby said julian putting his arm round anne he looked furious he thought it was very unfair of his uncle to take the box like that listen im not going to stand this well get hold of that box somehow and look into it im sure your father wont bother himself with it george hell start writing his book again and forget all about it ill wait my chance and slip into his study and get it even if it means a spanking if im discovered good said george well all keep a watch and see if father goes out so they took it in turns to keep watch but most annoyingly their uncle quentin remained in his study all the morning aunt fanny was surprised to see one or two children always about the garden that day instead of down on the beach why dont you all keep together and bathe or do something she said have you quarrelled with one another no said dick of course not but he didnt say why they were in the garden doesnt your father ever go out he said to george when it was her turn to keep watch i dont think he leads a very healthy life scientists never do said george as if she knew all about them but i tell you what he may go to sleep this afternoon he sometimes does julian was left behind in the garden that afternoon he sat down under a tree and opened a book soon he heard a curious noise that made him look up he knew at once what it was thats uncle quentin snoring he said in excitement it is oh i wonder if i could possibly creep in at the french windows and get our box he stole to the windows and looked in one was a little way open and julian opened it a little more he saw his uncle lying back in a comfortable armchair his mouth a little open his eyes closed fast asleep every time he took a breath he snored well he really does look sound asleep thought the boy and theres the box just behind him on that table ill risk it i bet ill get an awful spanking if im caught but i cant help that he stole in his uncle still snored he tiptoed by him to the table behind his uncles chair he took hold of the box and then a bit of the broken wood of the box fell to the floor with a thud his uncle stirred in his chair and opened his eyes quick as lightning the boy crouched down behind his uncles chair hardly breathing whats that he heard his uncle say julian didnt move then his uncle settled down again and shut his eyes soon there was the sound of his rhythmic snoring hurrah thought julian hes off again quietly he stood up holding the box on tiptoe he crept to the french window he slipped out and ran softly down the garden path he didnt think of hiding the box all he wanted to do was to get to the other children and show them what he had done he ran to the beach where the others were lying in the sun hi he yelled hi ive got it ive got it they all sat up with a jerk thrilled to see the box in julians arms they forgot all about the other people on the beach julian dropped down on the sand and grinned your father went to sleep he said to george tim dont lick me like that and george i went in and a bit of the box dropped on the floor and it woke him up golly said george what happened i crouched down behind his chair till he went to sleep again said julian then i fled now lets see whats in here i dont believe your fathers even tried to see he hadnt the tin lining was intact it had rusted with the years of lying in the wet and the lid was so tightly fitted down that it was almost impossible to move it but once george began to work at it with her pocketknife scraping away the rust it began to loosen and in about a quarterofanhour it came off the children bent eagerly over it inside lay some old papers and a book of some kind with a black cover nothing else at all no bar of gold no treasure everyone felt a little bit disappointed its all quite dry said julian surprised not a bit damp the tin lining kept everything perfect he picked up the book and opened it its a diary your greatgreatgreatgrandfather kept of the ships voyages he said i can hardly read the writing its so small and funny george picked up one of the papers it was made of thick parchment quite yellow with age she spread it out on the sand and looked at it the others glanced at it too but they couldnt make out what it was at all it seemed to be a kind of map perhaps its a map of some place he had to go to said julian but suddenly georges hands began to shake as she held the map and her eyes gleamed brilliantly as she looked up at the others she opened her mouth but didnt speak whats the matter said julian curiously whats up have you lost your tongue george shook her head and then began to speak with a rush julian do you know what this is its a map of my old castle of kirrin castle when it wasnt a ruin and it shows the dungeons and look just look whats written in this corner of the dungeons she put a trembling finger on one part of the map the others leaned over to see what it was and printed in oldfashioned letters was a curious word ingots ingots said anne puzzled what does that mean ive never heard that word before but the two boys had ingots cried dick why that must be the bars of gold they were called ingots most bars of metal are called ingots said julian going red with excitement but as we know there is gold missing from that ship then it really looks as if ingots here meant bars of gold oh golly to think they may still be hidden somewhere under kirrin castle george george isnt it terribly awfully exciting george nodded she was trembling all over with excitement if only we could find it she whispered if only we could well have a jolly good hunt for it said julian it will be awfully difficult because the castle is in ruins now and so overgrown but somehow or other well find those ingots what a lovely word ingots ingots ingots it sounded somehow more exciting than the word gold nobody spoke about gold any more they talked about the ingots tim couldnt make out what the excitement was at all he wagged his tail and tried hard to lick first one and then another of the children but for once in a way not one of them paid any attention to him he simply couldnt understand it and after a while he went and sat down by himself with his back to the children and his ears down oh do look at poor timothy said george he cant understand our excitement tim tim darling its all right youre not in disgrace or anything oh tim weve got the most wonderful secret in the whole world tim bounded up his tail wagging pleased to be taken notice of once more he put his big paw on the precious map and the four children shouted at him at once golly we cant have that torn said julian then he looked at the others and frowned what are we going to do about the box he said i mean georges father will be sure to miss it wont he well have to give it back well cant we take out the map and keep it said dick he wont know it was there if he hasnt looked in the box and its pretty certain he hasnt the other things dont matter much they are only that old diary and a few letters to be on the safe side lets take a copy of the map said dick then we can put the real map back and replace the box they all voted that a very good idea they went back to kirrin cottage and traced out the map carefully they did it in the toolshed because they didnt want anyone to see them it was a queer map it was in three parts this part shows the dungeons under the castle said julian and this shows a plan of the ground floor of the castle and this shows the top part my word it was a fine place in those days the dungeons run all under the castle i bet they were pretty awful places i wonder how people got down to them well have to study the map a bit more and see said george it all looks rather muddled to us at present but once we take the map over to the castle and study it there we may be able to make out how to get down to the hidden dungeons ooooh i dont expect any children ever had such an adventure as this julian put the traced map carefully into his jeans pocket he didnt mean it to leave him it was very precious then he put the real map back into the box and looked towards the house what about putting it back now he said maybe your father is still asleep george but he wasnt he was awake luckily he hadnt missed the box he came into the diningroom to have tea with the family and julian took his chance he muttered an excuse slipped away from the table and replaced the box on the table behind his uncles chair he winked at the others when he came back they felt relieved they were all scared of uncle quentin and were not at all anxious to be in his bad books anne didnt say one word during the whole of the meal she was so terribly afraid she might give something away either about tim or the box the others spoke very little too while they were at tea the telephone rang and aunt fanny went to answer it she soon came back its for you quentin she said apparently the old wreck has caused quite a lot of excitement and there are men from a london paper who want to ask you questions about it tell them ill see them at six said uncle quentin the children looked at one another in alarm they hoped that their uncle wouldnt show the box to the newspapermen then the secret of the hidden gold might come out what a mercy we took a tracing of the map said julian after tea but im jolly sorry now we left the real map in the box someone else may guess our secret chapter ten an astonishing offer contents prevnext the next morning the papers were full of the extraordinary way in which the old wreck had been thrown up out of the sea the newspaper men had got out of the childrens uncle the tale of the wreck and the lost gold and some of them even managed to land on kirrin island and take pictures of the old ruined castle george was furious its my castle she stormed to her mother its my island you said it could be mine you did you did i know george dear said her mother but you really must be sensible it cant hurt the island to be landed on and it cant hurt the castle to be photographed but i dont want it to be said george her face dark and sulky its mine and the wreck is mine you said so well i didnt know it was going to be thrown up like that said her mother do be sensible george what can it possibly matter if people go to look at the wreck you cant stop them george couldnt stop them but that didnt make her any the less angry about it the children were astonished at the interest that the castup wreck caused and because of that kirrin island became an object of great interest too sightseers from the places all around came to see it and the fishermen managed to find the little inlet and land the people there george sobbed with rage and julian tried to comfort her listen george no one knows our secret yet well wait till this excitement has died down and then well go to kirrin castle and find the ingots if someone doesnt find them first said george drying her eyes she was furious with herself for crying but she really couldnt help it how could they said julian no one has seen inside the box yet im going to wait my chance and get that map out before anyone sees it but he didnt have a chance because something dreadful happened uncle quentin sold the old box to a man who bought antique things he came out from his study beaming a day or two after the excitement began and told aunt fanny and the children ive struck a very good bargain with that man he said to his wife you know that old tinlined box from the wreck well this fellow collects curious things like that and he gave me a very good price for it very good indeed more even than i could expect for the writing of my book as soon as he saw the old map there and the old diary he said at once that he would buy the whole collection the children stared at him in horror the box was sold now someone would study that map and perhaps jump to what ingots meant the story of the lost gold had been put into all the newspapers now nobody could fail to know what the map showed if they studied it carefully the children did not dare to tell uncle quentin what they knew it was true he was all smiles now and was promising to buy them new shrimpingnets and a raft for themselves but he was such a changeable person he might fly into a furious temper if he heard that julian had taken the box and opened it himself while his uncle was sleeping when they were alone the children discussed the whole matter it seemed very serious indeed to them they halfwondered if they should let aunt fanny into the secretbut it was such a precious secret and so marvellous that they felt they didnt want to give it away to anyone at all now listen said julian at last well ask aunt fanny if we can go to kirrin island and spend a day or two there sleep there at night too i mean that will give us a little time to poke round and see what we can find the sightseers wont come after a day or two im sure maybe well get in before anyone tumbles to our secret after all the man who brought the box may not even guess that the map shows kirrin castle they felt more cheerful it was so awful to do nothing as soon as they had planned to act they felt better they decided to ask their aunt the next day if they might go and spend the weekend at the castle the weather was gloriously fine and it would be great fun they could take plenty of food with them when they went to ask aunt fanny uncle quentin was with her he was all smiles again and even clapped julian on the back well he said whats this deputation for we just wanted to ask aunt fanny something said julian politely aunt fanny as the weather is so fine do you think you would let us go for the weekend to kirrin castle please and spend a day or two there on the island you cant think how we would love to well what do you think quentin asked their aunt turning to her husband if they want to they can said uncle quentin they wont have a chance to soon my dears we have had a marvellous offer for kirrin island a man wants to buy it rebuild the castle as a hotel and make it into a proper holiday place what do you think of that all four children stared at the smiling man shocked and horrified somebody was going to buy the island had their secret been discovered did the man want to buy the castle because he had read the map and knew there was plenty of gold hidden there george gave a curious choke her eyes burned as if they were on fire mother you cant sell my island you cant sell my castle i wont let them be sold her father frowned dont be silly georgina he said it isnt really yours you know that it belongs to your mother and naturally she would like to sell it if she could we need the money very badly you will be able to have a great many nice things once we sell the island i dont want nice things cried poor george my castle and my island are the nicest things i could ever have mother mother you know you said i could have them you know you did i believed you george dear i did mean you to have them to play on when i thought they couldnt possibly be worth anything said her mother looking distressed but now things are different your father has been offered quite a good sum far more than we ever thought of getting and we really cant afford to turn it down so you only gave me the island when you thought it wasnt worth anything said george her face white and angry as soon as it is worth money you take it away again i think thats horrid it it isnt honourable thats enough georgina said her father angrily your mother is guided by me youre only a child your mother didnt really mean what she said it was only to please you but you know well enough you will share in the money we get and have anything you want i wont touch a penny said george in a low choking voice youll be sorry you sold it the girl turned and stumbled out of the room the others felt very sorry for her they knew what she was feeling she took things so very seriously julian thought she didnt understand grownups very well it wasnt a bit of good fighting grownups they could do exactly as they liked if they wanted to take away georges island and castle they could if they wanted to sell it they could but what uncle quentin didnt know was the fact that there might be a store of goldingots there julian stared at his uncle and wondered whether to warn him then he decided not to there was just a chance that the four children could find the gold first when are you selling the island uncle he asked quietly the deeds will be signed in about a weeks time was the answer so if you really want to spend a day or two there youd better do so quickly for after that you may not get permission from the new owners was it the man who bought the old box who wants to buy the island asked julian yes said his uncle i was a little surprised myself for i thought he was just a buyer of old things it was astonishing to me that he should get the idea of buying the island to rebuild the castle as a hotel still i dare say there will be big money in running an hotel there very romantic staying on a little island like that people will like it im no businessman myself and i certainly shouldnt care to invest my money in a place like kirrin island but i should think he knows what he is doing all right yes he certainly does thought julian to himself as he went out of the room with dick and anne hes read that map and has jumped to the same idea that we didthe store of hidden ingots is somewhere on that islandand hes going to get it he doesnt want to build an hotel hes after the treasure i expect hes offered uncle quentin some silly low price that poor old uncle thinks is marvellous oh dear this is a horrible thing to happen he went to find george she was in the toolshed looking quite green she said she felt sick its only because youre so upset said julian he slipped his arm round her for once in a way george didnt push it away she felt comforted tears came into her eyes and she angrily tried to blink them away listen george said julian we mustnt give up hope well go to kirrin island tomorrow and well do our very very best to get down into the dungeons somehow and find the ingots well jolly well stay there till we do see now cheer up because well want your help in planning everything thank goodness we took a tracing of the map george cheered up a little she still felt angry with her father and mother but the thought of going to kirrin island for a day or two and taking timothy too certainly seemed rather good i do think my father and mother are unkind she said well theyre not really said julian wisely after all if they need money badly they would be silly not to part with something they think is quite useless and you know your father did say you could have anything you want i know what i would ask for if i were you what asked george timothy of course said julian and that made george smile and cheer up tremendously chapter eleven off to kirrin island contents prevnext julian and george went to find dick and anne they were waiting for them in the garden looking rather upset they were glad to see julian and george and ran to meet them anne took georges hands im awfully sorry about your island george she said so am i said dick bad luck old girli mean old boy george managed to smile ive been behaving like a girl she said halfashamed but i did get an awful shock julian told the others what they had planned well go tomorrow morning he said well make out a list of all the things we shall need lets begin now he took out a pencil and notebook the others looked at him things to eat said dick at once plenty because well be hungry something to drink said george theres no water on the island though i believe there was a well or something years ago that went right down below the level of the sea and was fresh water anyway ive never found it food wrote down julian and drink he looked at the others spades he said solemnly and scribbled the word down anne stared in surprise what for she asked well well want to dig about when were hunting for a way down to the dungeons said julian ropes said dick we may want those too and torches said george itll be dark in the dungeons oooh said anne feeling a pleasant shiver go down her back at the thought she had no idea what dungeons were like but they sounded thrilling rugs said dick well be cold at night if we sleep in that little old room julian wrote them down mugs to drink from he said and well take a few tools too we may perhaps need them you never know at the end of half an hour they had quite a nice long list and everyone felt pleased and excited george was beginning to recover from her rage and disappointment if she had been alone and had brooded over everything she would have been in an even worse sulk and temperbut somehow the others were so calm and sensible and cheerful it was impossible to sulk for long if she was with them i think id have been much nicer if i hadnt been on my own so much thought george to herself as she looked at julians bent head talking about things to other people does help a lot they dont seem so dreadful then they seem more bearable and ordinary i like my three cousins awfully i like them because they talk and laugh and are always cheerful and kind i wish i was like them im sulky and badtempered and fierce and no wonder father doesnt like me and scolds me so often mothers a dear but i understand now why she says i am difficult im different from my cousins theyre easy to understand and everyone likes them im glad they came they are making me more like i ought to be this was a long thought to think and george looked very serious while she was thinking it julian looked up and caught her blue eyes fixed on him he smiled penny for your thoughts he said theyre not worth a penny said george going red i was just thinking how nice you all are and how i wished i could be like you youre an awfully nice person said julian surprisingly you cant help being an only child theyre always a bit queer you know unless theyre mighty careful youre a most interesting person i think george flushed red again and felt pleased lets go and take timothy for a walk she said hell be wondering whats happened to us today they all went off together and timothy greeted them at the top of his voice they told him all about their plans for the next day and he wagged his tail and looked up at them out of his soft brown eyes as if he understood every single word they said he must feel pleased to think hes going to be with us for two or three days said anne it was very exciting the next morning setting off in the boat with all their things packed neatly at one end julian checked them all by reading out aloud from his list it didnt seem as if they had forgotten anything got the map said dick suddenly julian nodded i put on clean jeans this morning he said but you may be sure i remembered to pop the map into my pocket here it is he took it out and the wind at once blew it right out of his hands it fell into the sea and bobbed there in the wind all four children gave a cry of utter dismay their precious map quick row after it cried george and swung the boat round but someone was quicker than she was tim had seen the paper fly from julians hand and had heard and understood the cries of dismay with an enormous splash he leapt into the water and swam valiantly after the map he could swim well for a dog for he was strong and powerful he soon had the map in his mouth and was swimming back to the boat the children thought he was simply marvellous george hauled him into the boat and took the map from his mouth there was hardly the mark of his teeth on it he had carried it so carefully it was wet and the children looked anxiously at it to see if the tracing had been spoilt but julian had traced it very strongly and it was quite all right he placed it on a seat to dry and told dick to hold it there in the sun that was a narrow squeak he said and the others agreed george took the oars again and they set off once more to the island getting a perfect showerbath from timothy when he stood up and shook his wet coat he was given a big biscuit as a reward and crunched it up with great enjoyment george made her way through the reefs of rocks with a sure hand it was marvellous to the others how she could slide the boat in between the dangerous rocks and never get a scratch they thought she was really wonderful she brought them safely to the little inlet and they jumped out on to the sand they pulled the boat high up in case the tide came far up the tiny cove and then began to unload their goods well carry all the things to that little stone room said julian they will be safe there and wont get wet if it rains i hope nobody comes to the island while we are here george i shouldnt think they would said george father said it would be about a week before the deeds were signed making over the island to that man it wont be his till then weve got a week anyhow well we dont need to keep a watch in case anyone else arrives then said julian who had half thought that it would be a good idea to make someone stay on guard at the inlet to give a warning to the others in case anyone else arrived come on you take the spades dick ill take the food and drink with george and anne can take the little things the food and drink were in a big box for the children did not mean to starve while they were on the island they had brought loaves of bread butter biscuits jam tins of fruit ripe plums bottles of gingerbeer a kettle to make tea and anything else they could think of george and julian staggered up the cliff with the heavy box they had to put it down once or twice to give themselves a rest they put everything into the little room then they went back to get the collection of blankets and rugs from the boat they arranged them in the corners of the little room and thought that it would be most exciting to spend the night there the two girls can sleep together on this pile of rugs said julian and we two boys will have this pile george looked as if she didnt want to be put with anne and classed as a girl but anne didnt wish to sleep alone in her corner and she looked so beseechingly at george that the bigger girl smiled at her and made no objection anne thought that george was getting nicer and nicer well now well get down to business said julian and he pulled out his map we must study this really carefully and find out exactly under what spot the entrances to the dungeons are now come around and lets do our best to find out its up to us to use our brains and beat that man whos bought the island they all bent over the traced map it was quite dry now and the children looked at it earnestly it was plain that in the old days the castle had been a very fine place now look said julian putting his finger on the plan of the dungeons these seem to run all along under the castle and here and here are the marks that seem to be meant to represent steps or stairs yes said george i should think they are well if so there appear to be two ways of getting down into the dungeons one lot of steps seems to begin somewhere near this little room and the other seems to start under the tower there and what do you suppose this thing is here julian she put her finger on a round hole that was shown not only in the plan of the dungeons but also in the plan of the ground floor of the castle i cant imagine what that is said julian puzzled oh yes i know what it might be you said there was an old well somewhere do you remember well that may be it i should think it would have to be very deep to get fresh water right under the sea so it probably goes down through the dungeons too isnt this thrilling everyone thought it was they felt happy and excited there was something to discover something they could and must discover within the next day or two they looked at one another well said dick what are we going to start on shall we try to find the entrance to the dungeons the one that seems to start round about this little room for all we know there may be a big stone we can lift that opens above the dungeon steps this was a thrilling thought and the children jumped up at once julian folded up the precious map and put it into his pocket he looked round the stone floor of the little room was overgrown with creeping weeds they must be cleared away before it was possible to see if there were any stones that looked as if they might be moved wed better set to work said julian and he picked up a spade lets clear away these weeds with our spades scrape them off look like this and then examine every single stone they all picked up spades and soon the little stone room was full of a scraping sound as the four of them chiselled away at the closegrowing weeds with their spades it wasnt very difficult to get the stones clear of them and the children worked with a will tim got most excited about everything he hadnt any idea at all what they were doing but he joined in valiantly he scraped away at the floor with his four paws sending earth and plants flying high into the air hi tim said julian shaking a clod of earth out of his hair youre being a bit too vigorous my word youll send the stones flying into the air too in a minute george isnt tim marvellous the way he joins in everything how they all worked how they all longed to find the entrance to the underground dungeons what a thrill that would be chapter twelve exciting discoveries contents prevnext soon the stones of the little room were clear of earth sand and weeds the children saw that they were all the same size big and square fitted well together they went over them carefully with their torches trying to find one that might move or lift we should probably find one with an iron ring handle sunk into it said julian but they didnt all the stones looked exactly the same it was most disappointing julian tried inserting his spade into the cracks between the various stones to see if by any chance he could move one but they couldnt be moved it seemed as if they were all set in the solid ground after about three hours hard work the children sat down to eat a meal they were very hungry indeed and felt glad to think there were so many things to eat as they ate they discussed the problem they were trying to solve it looks as if the entrance to the dungeons was not under this little room after all said julian its disappointing but somehow i dont think now that the steps down to the dungeon started from here lets measure the map and see if we can make out exactly where the steps do start it may be of course that the measurements arent correct and wont be any help to us at all but we can try so they measured as best they could to try and find out in exactly what place the dungeon steps seemed to begin it was impossible to tell for the plans of the three floors seemed to be done to different scales julian stared at the map puzzled it seemed rather hopeless surely they wouldnt have to hunt all over the ground floor of the castle it would take ages look said george suddenly putting her finger on the hole that they all thought must be meant to represent the well the entrance to the dungeons seems to be not very far off the well if only we could find the well we could hunt around a bit for the beginning of the dungeon steps the well is shown in both maps it seems to be somewhere about the middle of the castle thats a good idea of yours said julian pleased lets go out into the middle of the castle we can more or less guess where the old well ought to be because it definitely seems to be about the middle of the old yard out there out they all went into the sunshine they felt very important and serious it was marvellous to be looking for lost ingots of gold they all felt perfectly certain that they really were somewhere beneath their feet it didnt occur to any of the children that the treasure might not be there they stood in the ruined courtyard that had once been the centre of the castle they paced out the middle of the yard and then stood there looking around in vain for anything that might perhaps have been the opening of an old well it was all so overgrown sand had blown in from the shore and weeds and bushes of all kinds grew there the stones that had once formed the floor of the big courtyard were now cracked and were no longer lying flat most of them were covered with sand or weeds look theres a rabbit cried dick as a big sandy rabbit lollopped slowly across the yard it disappeared into a hole on the other side then another rabbit appeared sat up and looked at the children and then vanished too the children were thrilled they had never seen such tame rabbits before a third rabbit appeared it was a small one with absurdly big ears and the tiniest white bob of a tail it didnt even look at the children it bounded about in a playful way and then to the childrens enormous delight it sat up on its hind legs and began to wash its big ears pulling down first one and then another but this was too much for timothy he had watched the other two bound across the yard and then disappear without so much as barking at them but to see this youngster actually sitting there washing its ears under his very nose was really too much for any dog he gave an excited yelp and rushed fulltilt at the surprised rabbit for a moment the little thing didnt move it had never been frightened or chased before and it stared with big eyes at the rushing dog then it turned itself about and tore off at top speed its white bobtail going up and down as it bounded away it disappeared under a gorse bush near the children timothy went after it vanishing under the big bush too then a shower of sand and earth was thrown up as tim tried to go down the hole after the rabbit and scraped and scrabbled with his strong front paws as fast as he could he yelped and whined in excitement not seeming to hear georges voice calling to him he meant to get that rabbit he went almost mad as he scraped at the hole making it bigger and bigger tim do you hear me come out of there shouted george youre not to chase the rabbits here you know you mustnt youre very naughty come out but tim didnt come out he just went on and on scraping away madly george went to fetch him just as she got up to the gorse bush the scraping suddenly stopped there came a scared yelp and no more noise was heard george peered under the prickly bush in astonishment tim had disappeared he just simply wasnt there any more there was the big rabbithole made enormous by tim but there was no tim i say julian tims gone said george in a scared voice he surely cant have gone down that rabbits hole can he i mean hes such a big dog the children crowded round the big gorse bush there came the sound of a muffled whine from somewhere below it julian looked astonished he is down the hole he said how queer i never heard of a dog really going down a rabbithole before however are we going to get him out well have to dig up the gorse bush to begin with said george in a determined voice she would have dug up the whole of kirrin castle to get tim back that was certain i cant have poor old tim whining for help down there and not do what we can to help him the bush was far too big and prickly to creep underneath julian was glad they had brought tools of all kinds he went to fetch an axe they had brought a small one with them and it would do to chop away the prickly branches and trunk of the gorse bush the children slashed at it and soon the poor bush began to look a sorry sight it took a long time to destroy it for it was prickly sturdy and stout every childs hands were scratched by the time the bush had been reduced to a mere stump then they could see the hole quite well julian shone his torch down it he gave a shout of surprise i know whats happened the old well is here the rabbits had a hole at the side of it and tim scraped away to make it bigger and uncovered a bit of the wellhole and hes fallen down the well oh no oh no cried george in panic oh tim tim are you all right a distant whine came to their ears evidently tim was there somewhere the children looked at one another well theres only one thing to do said julian we must get our spades now and dig out the hole of the well then maybe we can let a rope down or something and get tim they set to work with their spades it was not really difficult to uncover the hole which had been blocked only by the spreading roots of the big gorse bush some fallen masonry earth sand and small stones apparently a big slab had fallen from part of the tower across the wellhole and partly closed it the weather and the growing gorse bush had done the rest it took all the children together to move the slab underneath was a very rotten wooden cover which had plainly been used in the old days to protect the well it had rotted so much that when tims weight had been pressed on it it had given just there and made a hole for tim to fall through julian removed the old wooden cover and then the children could see down the wellhole it was very deep and very dark they could not possibly see the bottom julian took a stone and dropped it down they all listened for the splash but there was no splash either there was no longer any water there or the well was too deep even to hear the splash i think its too deep for us to hear anything said julian now wheres tim he shone his torch down and there was tim many years before a big slab had fallen down the well itself and had stuck a little way down across the wellhole and on this old cracked slab sat tim his big eyes staring up in fright he simply could not imagine what had happened to him there was an old iron ladder fastened to the side of the well george was on it before anyone else could get there down she went not caring if the ladder held or not and reached tim somehow she got him on to her shoulder and holding him there with one hand she climbed slowly up again the other three hauled her out and tim jumped round her barking and licking for all he was worth well tim said dick you shouldnt chase rabbitsbut youve certainly done us a good turn because youve found the well for us now weve only got to look around a little to find the dungeon entrance they set to work again to hunt for the dungeon entrance they dug about with their spades under all the bushes they pulled up crooked stones and dug their spades into the earth below hoping that they might suddenly find them going through into space it was really very thrilling and then anne found the entrance it was quite by accident she was tired and sat down to rest she lay on her front and scrabbled about in the sand suddenly her fingers touched something hard and cold in the sand she uncovered it and lo and behold it was an iron ring she gave a shout and the others looked up theres a stone with an iron ring in it here yelled anne excitedly they all rushed over to her julian dug about with his spade and uncovered the whole stone sure enough it did have a ring in it and rings are only let into stones that need to be moved surely this stone must be the one that covered the dungeon entrance all the children took turns at pulling on the iron ring but the stone did not move then julian tied two or three turns of rope through it and the four children put out their full strength and pulled for all they were worth the stone moved the children distinctly felt it stir all together again cried julian and all together they pulled the stone stirred again and then suddenly gave way it moved upwards and the children fell over on top of one another like a row of dominoes suddenly pushed down tim darted to the hole and barked madly down it as if all the rabbits of the world lived there julian and george shot to their feet and rushed to the opening that the moved stone had disclosed they stood there looking downwards their faces shining with delight they had found the entrance to the dungeons a steep flight of steps cut out of the rock itself led downwards into deep darkness come on cried julian snapping on his torch weve found what we wanted now for the dungeons the steps down were slippery tim darted down first lost his foothold and rolled down five or six steps yelping with fright julian went after him then george then dick and then anne they were all tremendously thrilled indeed they quite expected to see piles of gold and all kinds of treasure everywhere around them it was dark down the steep flight of steps and smelt very musty anne choked a little i hope the air down here is all right said julian sometimes it isnt good in these underground places if anyone feels a bit funny theyd better say so and well go up into the open air again but however funny they might feel nobody would have said so it was all far too exciting to worry about feeling queer the steps went down a long way then they came to an end julian stepped down from the last rockstair and flashed his torch around it was a weird sight that met his eyes the dungeons of kirrin castle were made out of the rock itself whether there were natural caves there or whether they had been hollowed out by man the children could not tell but certainly they were very mysterious dark and full of echoing sounds when julian gave a sigh of excitement it fled into the rocky hollows and swelled out and echoed around as if it were a live thing it gave all the children a very queer feeling isnt it strange said george in a low voice at once the echoes took up her words and multiplied them and made them louder and all the dungeon caves gave back the girls words over and over again isnt it strange isnt it strange isnt it strange anne slipped her hand into dicks she felt scared she didnt like the echoes at all she knew they were only echoes but they did sound exactly like the voices of scores of people hidden in the caves where do you suppose the ingots are said dick and at once the caves threw him back his words ingots ingots are ingots are are are julian laughed and his laugh was split up into dozens of different laughs that came out of the dungeons and spun round the listening children it really was the queerest thing come on said julian maybe the echoes wont be so bad a little farther in farther in said the echoes at once farther in they moved away from the end of the rocky steps and explored the nearby dungeons they were really only rocky cellars stretching under the castle maybe wretched prisoners had been kept there many many years before but mostly they had been used for storing things i wonder which dungeon was used for storing the ingots said julian he stopped and took the map out of his pocket he flashed his torch on to it but although it showed him quite plainly the dungeon where ingots were marked he had no idea at all of the right direction i say look theres a door here shutting off the next dungeon suddenly cried dick i bet this is the dungeon were looking for i bet there are ingots in here chapter thirteen down in the dungeons contents prevnext four torches were flashed on to the wooden door it was big and stout studded with great iron nails julian gave a whoop of delight and rushed to it he felt certain that behind it was the dungeon used for storing things but the door was fast shut no amount of pushing or pulling would open it it had a great keyhole but no key there the four children stared in exasperation at the door bother it just as they really thought they were near the ingots this door wouldnt open well fetch the axe said julian suddenly we may be able to chop round the keyhole and smash the lock thats a good idea said george delighted come on back they left the big door and tried to get back the way they had come but the dungeons were so big and so rambling that they lost their way they stumbled over old broken barrels rotting wood empty bottles and many other things as they tried to find their way back to the big flight of rocksteps this is sickening said julian at last i simply havent any idea at all where the entrance is we keep on going into one dungeon after another and one passage after another and they all seem to be exactly the samedark and smelly and mysterious suppose we have to stay here all the rest of our lives said anne gloomily idiot said dick taking her hand we shall soon find the way out hallo whats this they all stopped they had come to what looked like a chimney shaft of brick stretching down from the roof of the dungeon to the floor julian flashed his torch on to it he was puzzled i know what it is said george suddenly its the well of course you remember it was shown in the plan of the dungeons as well as in the plan of the ground floor well thats the shaft of the well going down and down i wonder if theres any opening in it just hereso that water could be taken into the dungeons as well as up to the ground floor they went to see on the other side of the wellshaft was a small opening big enough for one child at a time to put his head and shoulders through and look down they shone their torches down and up the well was so deep that it was still impossible to see the bottom of it julian dropped a stone down again but there was no sound of either a thud or a splash he looked upwards and could see the faint gleam of daylight that slid round the broken slab of stone lying a little way down the shaft the slab on which tim had sat waiting to be rescued yes he said this is the well all right isnt it queer well now weve found the well we know that the entrance to the dungeons isnt very far off that cheered them all up tremendously they took hands and hunted around in the dark their torches making bright beams of light here and there anne gave a screech of excitement heres the entrance it must be because i can see faint daylight coming down the children rounded a corner and sure enough there was the steep rocky flight of steps leading upwards julian took a quick look round so that he might know the way to go when they came down again he didnt feel at all certain that he would find the wooden door they all went up into the sunshine it was delicious to feel the warmth on their heads and shoulders after the cold air down in the dungeons julian looked at his watch and gave a loud exclamation its halfpast six halfpast six no wonder i feel hungry we havent had any tea weve been working and wandering about those dungeons for hours well lets have a kind of teasupper before we do anything else said dick i dont feel as if ive had anything to eat for about twelve months well considering you ate about twice as much as anyone else at dinnertime began julian indignantly then he grinned i feel the same as you he said come onlets get a really good meal george what about boiling a kettle and making some cocoa or something i feel cold after all that time underground it was fun boiling the kettle on a fire of dry sticks it was lovely to lie about in the warmth of the evening sun and munch bread and cheese and enjoy cake and biscuits they all enjoyed themselves thoroughly tim had a good meal too he hadnt very much liked being underground and had followed the others very closely indeed his tail well down he had been very frightened too of the curious echoes here and there once he had barked and it had seemed to tim as if the whole of the dungeons were full of other dogs all barking far more loudly than he could he hadnt even dared to whine after that but now he was happy again eating the titbits that the children gave him and licking george whenever he was near her it was past eight oclock by the time that the children had finished their meal and tidied up julian looked at the others the sun was sinking and the day was no longer so warm well he said i dont know what you feel but i dont somehow want to go down into those dungeons again today not even for the sake of smashing in that door with the axe and opening it im tired and i dont like the thought of losing my way in those dungeons at night the others heartily agreed with him especially anne who had secretly been dreading going down again with the night coming on the little girl was almost asleep she was so tired out with hard work and excitement come on anne said george pulling her to her feet bed for you well cuddle up together in the rugs on the floor of that little room and in the morning when we wake well be simply thrilled to think of opening that big wooden door all four children with tim close behind went off to the little stone room they curled up on their piles of rugs and tim crept in with george and anne he lay down on them and felt so heavy that anne had to push him off her legs he sat himself down on her again and she groaned halfasleep tim wagged his tail and thumped it hard against her ankles then george pulled him on to her own legs and lay there feeling him breathe she was very happy she was spending the night on her island they had almost found the ingots she was sure she had tim with her actually sleeping on her rugs perhaps everything would come right after all somehow she fell asleep the children felt perfectly safe with tim on guard they slept peacefully until the morning when tim saw a rabbit through the broken archway leading to the little room and sped away to chase it he awoke george as he got up from the rugs and she sat up and rubbed her eyes wake up she cried to the others wake up all of you its morning and were on the island they all awoke it was really thrilling to sit up and remember everything julian thought of the big wooden door at once he would soon smash it in with his axe he felt sure and then what would they find they had breakfast and ate just as much as ever then julian picked up the axe they had brought and took everyone to the flight of steps tim went too wagging his tail but not really feeling very pleased at the thought of going down into the queer places where other dogs seemed to bark and yet were not to be found poor tim would never understand echoes they all went down underground again and then of course they couldnt find the way to the wooden door it was most tiresome we shall lose our way all over again said george desperately these dungeons are about the most rambling spreadout maze of underground caves ive ever known we shall lose the entrance again too julian had a bright idea he had a piece of white chalk in his pocket and he took it out he went back to the steps and marked the wall there then he began to put chalkmarks along the passages as they walked in the musty darkness they came to the well and julian was pleased now he said whenever we come to the well we shall at least be able to find the way back to the steps because we can follow my chalkmarks now the thing is which is the way next well try and find it and ill put chalkmarks along the walls here and there but if we go the wrong way and have to come back well rub out the marks and start again from the well another way this was really a very good idea they did go the wrong way and had to come back rubbing out julians marks they reached the well and set off in the opposite direction and this time they did find the wooden door there it was stout and sturdy its old iron nails rusty and red the children stared at it in delight julian lifted his axe crash he drove it into the wood and round about the keyhole but the wood was still strong and the axe only went in an inch or two julian drove it in once more the axe hit one of the big nails and slipped a little to one side a big splinter of wood flew out and struck poor dick on the cheek he gave a yell of pain julian jumped in alarm and turned to look at him dicks cheek was pouring with blood something flew out of the door and hit me said poor dick its a splinter or something golly said julian and he shone his torch on to dick can you bear it a moment if i pull the splinter out its a big one and its still sticking into your poor cheek but dick pulled it out himself he made a face with the pain and then turned very white youd better get up into the open air for a bit said julian and well have to bathe your cheek and stop it bleeding somehow annes got a clean hanky well bathe it and dab it with that we brought some water with us luckily ill go with dick said anne you stay here with george theres no need for us all to go but julian thought he would like to see dick safely up into the open air first and then he could leave him with anne while he went back to george and went on with the smashing down of the door he handed the axe to george you can do a bit of chopping while im gone he said it will take some time to smash that big door in you get on with it and ill be down in a few minutes again we can easily find the way to the entrance because weve only got to follow my chalkmarks right said george and she took the axe poor old dick you do look a sight leaving george behind with tim valiantly attacking the big door julian took dick and anne up to the open air anne dipped her hanky into the kettle of water and dabbed dicks cheek gently it was bleeding very much as cheeks do but the wound was not really very bad dicks colour soon came back and he wanted to go down into the dungeons again no youd better lie down on your back for a little said julian i know thats good for nosebleeding and maybe its good for cheekbleeding too what about anne and you going out on the rocks over there where you can see the wreck and staying there for half an hour or so come on ill take you both there and leave you for a bit youd better not get up till your cheeks stopped bleeding old boy julian took the two out of the castle yard and out on to the rocks on the side of the island that faced the open sea the dark hulk of the old wreck was still there on the rocks dick lay down on his back and stared up into the sky hoping that his cheek would soon stop bleeding he didnt want to miss any of the fun anne took his hand she was very upset at the little accident and although she didnt want to miss the fun either she meant to stay with dick till he felt better julian sat down beside them for a minute or two then he went back to the rocky steps and disappeared down them he followed his chalkmarks and soon came to where george was attacking the door she had smashed it well round the lock but it simply would not give way julian took the axe from her and drove it hard into the wood after a blow or two something seemed to happen to the lock it became loose and hung a little sideways julian put down his axe i think somehow that we can open the door now he said in an exited voice get out of the way tim old fellow now then push george they both pushed and the lock gave way with a grating noise the big door opened creakingly and the two children went inside flashing their torches in excitement the room was not much more than a cave hollowed out of the rock but in it was something quite different from the old barrels and boxes the children had found before at the back in untidy piles were curious brickshaped things of dull yellowbrown metal julian picked one up george he cried the ingots these are real gold oh i know they dont look like it but they are all the same george oh george theres a small fortune here in this cellar and its yours weve found it at last chapter fourteen prisoners contents prevnext george couldnt say a word she just stood there staring at the pile of ingots holding one in her hand she could hardly believe that these strange brickshaped things were really gold her heart thumped fast what a wonderful marvellous find suddenly tim began to bark loudly he stood with his back to the children his nose towards the door and how he barked shut up tim said julian what can you hear is it the others coming back he went to the door and yelled down the passage outside dick anne is it you come quickly because weve found the ingots weve found them hurry hurry tim stopped barking and began to growl george looked puzzled whatever can be the matter with tim she said he surely cant be growling at dick and anne then both children got a most tremendous shock for a mans voice came booming down the dark passage making queer echoes all around who is here who is down here george clutched julian in fright tim went on growling all the hairs on his neck standing up straight do be quiet tim whispered george snapping off her torch but tim simply would not be quiet he went on growling as if he were a small thunderstorm the children saw the beam of a powerful torchlight coming round the corner of the dungeon passage then the light picked them out and the holder of the torch came to a surprised stop well well well said a voice look whos here two children in the dungeons of my castle what do you mean your castle cried george well my dear little girl it is my castle because im in the process of buying it said the voice then another voice spoke more gruffly what are you doing down here what did you mean when you shouted out dick and anne and said you had found the ingots what ingots dont answer whispered julian to george but the echoes took his words and made them very loud in the passagedont answer dont answer oh so you wont answer said the second man and he stepped towards the children tim bared his teeth but the man didnt seem at all frightened of him the man went to the door and flashed his torch inside the dungeon he gave a long whistle of surprise jake look here he said you were right the golds here all right and how easy to take away all in ingots my word this is the most amazing thing weve ever struck this gold is mine said george in a fury the island and the castle belong to my mother and so does anything found here this gold was brought here and stored by my greatgreatgreatgrandfather before his ship got wrecked its not yours and never will be as soon as i get back home i shall tell my father and mother what weve found and then you may be sure you wont be able to buy the castle or the island you were very clever finding out from the map in the old box about the gold but just not clever enough for us we found it first the men listened in silence to georges clear and angry voice one of them laughed youre only a child he said you surely dont think you can keep us from getting our way were going to buy this island and everything in it and we shall take the gold when the deeds are signed and if by any chance we couldnt buy the island wed take the gold just the same it would be easy enough to bring a ship here and transfer the ingots from here by boat to the ship dont worry we shall get what we want all right you will not said george and she stepped out of the door im going straight home now and ill tell my father all youve said my dear little girl you are not going home said the first man putting his hands on george and forcing her back into the dungeon and by the way unless you want me to shoot this unpleasant dog of yours call him off will you george saw to her dismay that the man had a shining revolver in his hand in fright she caught hold of tims collar and pulled him to her be quiet tim she said its all right but tim knew quite well that it wasnt all right something was very wrong he went on growling fiercely now listen to me said the man after he had had a hurried talk with his companion if you are going to be sensible nothing unpleasant will happen to you but if you want to be obstinate youll be very sorry what we are going to do is this were going off in our motorboat leaving you nicely locked up here and were going to get a ship and come back for the gold we dont think its worth while buying the island now we know where the ingots are and you are going to write a note to your companions above telling them youve found the gold and they are to come down and look for it said the other man then we shall lock up all of you in this dungeon with the ingots to play with leaving you food and drink till we come back now then here is a pencil write a note to dick and anne whoever they are and send your dog up with it come on i wont said george her face furious i wont you cant make me do a thing like that i wont get poor dick and anne down here to be made prisoners and i wont let you have my gold just when ive discovered it we shall shoot your dog if you dont do as youre told said the first man suddenly georges heart sank down and she felt cold and terrified no no she said in a low desperate voice well write the note then said the man offering her a pencil and paper go on ill tell you what to say i cant sobbed george i dont want to get dick and anne down here to be made prisoners all right ill shoot the dog then said the man in a cold voice and he levelled his revolver at poor tim george threw her arms round her dog and gave a scream no no ill write the note dont shoot tim dont shoot him the girl took the paper and pencil in a shaking hand and looked at the man write this he ordered dear dick and anne weve found the gold come on down at once and see it then sign your name whatever it is george wrote what the man had said then she signed her name but instead of writing george she put georgina she knew that the others would feel certain she would never sign herself that and she hoped it would warn them that something queer was up the man took the note and fastened it to tims collar the dog growled all the time but george kept telling him not to bite now tell him to go and find your friends said the man find dick and anne commanded george go on tim find dick and anne give them the note tim did not want to leave george but there was something very urgent in her voice he took one last look at his mistress gave her hand a lick and sped off down the passage he knew the way now up the rocky steps he bounded and into the open air he stopped in the old yard sniffing where were dick and anne he smelt their footsteps and ran off his nose to the ground he soon found the two children out on the rocks dick was feeling better now and was sitting up his cheek had almost stopped bleeding hallo he said in surprise when he saw tim heres timothy why tim old chap why have you come to see us did you get tired of being underground in the dark look dick hes got something twisted into his collar said anne her sharp eyes seeing the paper there its a note i expect its from the others telling us to go down isnt tim clever to bring it dick took the paper from tims collar he undid it and read it dear dick and anne he read out aloud weve found the gold come on down at once and see it georgina oooh said anne her eyes shining theyve found it oh dick are you well enough to come now lets hurry but dick did not get up from the rocks he sat and stared at the note puzzled whats the matter said anne impatiently well dont you think its funny that george should suddenly sign herself georgina said dick slowly you know how she hates being a girl and having a girls name you know how she will never answer if anyone calls her georgina and yet in this note she signs herself by the name she hates it does seem a bit funny to me almost as if its a kind of warning that theres something wrong oh dont be so silly dick said anne what could be wrong do come on anne id like to pop over to that inlet of ours to make sure theres no one else come to the island said dick you stay here but anne didnt want to stay there alone she ran round the coast with dick telling him all the time that she thought he was very silly but when they came to the little harbour they saw that there was another boat there as well as their own it was a motorboat someone else was on the island look said dick in a whisper there is someone else here and i bet its the men who want to buy the island i bet theyve read that old map and know theres gold here and theyve found george and julian and want to get us all together down in the dungeons so that they can keep us safe till theyve stolen the gold thats why they made george send us that note but she signed it with a name she never uses to warn us now we must think hard what are we going to do chapter fifteen dick to the rescue contents prevnext dick caught hold of annes hand and pulled her quickly away from the cove he was afraid that whoever had come to the island might be somewhere about and see them the boy took anne to the little stone room where their things were and they sat down in a corner whoever has come has discovered julian and george smashing in that door i should think said dick in a whisper i simply cant think what to do we mustnt go down into the dungeons or well most certainly be caught hallo wheres tim off to the dog had kept with them for a while but now he ran off to the entrance of the dungeons he disappeared down the steps he meant to get back to george for he knew she was in danger dick and anne stared after him they had felt comforted while he was there and now they were sorry he had gone they really didnt know what to do then anne had an idea i know she said well row back to the land in our boat and get help id thought of that said dick gloomily but you know perfectly well wed never know the way in and out of those awful rocks wed wreck the boat im sure were not strong enough either to row all the way back oh dear i do wish we could think what to do they didnt need to puzzle their brains long the men came up out of the dungeons and began to hunt for the two children they had seen tim when he came back and had found the note gone so they knew the two children had taken it and they couldnt imagine why they had not obeyed what george had said in the note and come down to the dungeons dick heard their voices he clutched hold of anne to make her keep quiet he saw through the broken archway that the men were going in the opposite direction anne i know where we can hide said the boy excitedly down the old well we can climb down the ladder a little way and hide there im sure no one would ever look there anne didnt at all want to climb down the well even a little way but dick pulled her to her feet and hurried her off to the middle of the old courtyard the men were hunting around the other side of the castle there was just time to climb in dick slipped aside the old wooden cover of the well and helped anne down the ladder she was very scared then the boy climbed down himself and slipped the wooden cover back again over his head as best he could the old stone slab that tim had sat on when he fell down the well was still there dick climbed down to it and tested it it was immovable its safe for you to sit on anne if you dont want to keep clinging to the ladder he whispered so anne sat shivering on the stone slab across the wellshaft waiting to see if they were discovered or not they kept hearing the voices of the men now near at hand and now faroff then the men began to shout for them dick anne the others want you where are you weve exciting news for you well why dont they let julian and george come up and tell us then whispered dick theres something wrong i know there is i do wish we could get to julian and george and find out what has happened the two men came into the courtyard they were angry where have those kids got to said jake their boat is still in the cove so they havent got away they must be hiding somewhere we cant wait all day for them well lets take some food and drink down to the two weve locked up said the other man theres plenty in that little stone room i suppose its a store the children brought over well leave half in the room so that the other two kids can have it and well take their boat with us so that they cant escape right said jake the thing to do is to get the gold away as quickly as possible and make sure the children are prisoners here until weve made a safe getaway we wont bother any more about trying to buy the island after all it was only the idea of getting the ingots that put us up to the idea of getting kirrin castle and the island wellcome on said his companion we will take the food down now and not bother about the other kids you stay here and see if you can spot them while i go down dick and anne hardly dared to breathe when they heard all this how they hoped that the men wouldnt think of looking down the well they heard one man walk to the little stone room it was plain that he was getting food and drink to take down to the two prisoners in the dungeons below the other man stayed in the courtyard whistling softly after what seemed a very long time to the hidden children the first man came back then the two talked together and at last went off to the cove dick heard the motorboat being started up its safe to get out now anne he said isnt it cold down here ill be glad to get out into the sunshine they climbed out and stood warming themselves in the hot summer sunshine they could see the motorboat streaking towards the mainland well theyre gone for the moment said dick and theyve not taken our boat as they said if only we could rescue julian and george we could get help because george could row us back why cant we rescue them cried anne her eyes shining we can go down the steps and unbolt the door cant we no we cant said dick look anne looked to where he pointed she saw that the two men had piled big heavy slabs of broken stone over the dungeon entrance it had taken all their strength to put the big stones there neither dick nor anne could hope to move them its quite impossible to get down the steps said dick theyve made sure we shant do that and you know we havent any idea where the second entrance is we only know it was somewhere near the tower lets see if we can find it said anne eagerly they set off to the tower on the right of the castle but it was quite clear that whatever entrance there might have been once it was gone now the castle had fallen in very much just there and there were piles of old broken stones everywhere quite impossible to move the children soon gave up the search blow said dick how i do hate to think of poor old julian and george prisoners down below and we cant even help them oh anne cant you think of something to do anne sat down on a stone and thought hard she was very worried then she brightened up a little and turned to dick dick i suppose i suppose we couldnt possibly climb down the well could we she asked you know it goes past the dungeons and theres an opening on the dungeon floor from the wellshaft because dont you remember we were able to put in our heads and shoulders and look right up the well to the top could we get past that slab do you think the one that i sat on just now that has fallen across the well dick thought it all over he went to the well and peered down it you know i believe you are right anne he said at last we might be able to squeeze past that slab theres just about room i dont know how far the iron ladder goes down though oh dick do lets try said anne its our only chance of rescuing the others well said dick ill try it but not you anne im not going to have you falling down that well the ladder might be broken halfway down anything might happen you must stay up here and ill see what i can do you will be careful wont you said anne anxiously take a rope with you dick so that if you need one you wont have to climb all the way up again good idea said dick he went to the little stone room and got one of the ropes they had put there he wound it round and round his waist then he went back to anne well here goes he said in a cheerful voice dont worry about me ill be all right anne was rather white she was terribly afraid that dick might fall right down to the bottom of the well she watched him climb down the iron ladder to the slab of stone he tried his best to squeeze by it but it was very difficult at last he managed it and after that anne could see him no more but she could hear him for he kept calling up to her ladders still going strong anne im all right can you hear me yes shouted anne down the well hearing her voice echo in a funny hollow manner take care dick i do hope the ladder goes all the way down i think it does yelled back dick then he gave a loud exclamation blow its broken just here broken right off or else it ends ill have to use my rope there was a silence as dick unwound the rope from his waist he tied it firmly to the last but one rung of the ladder which seemed quite strong im going down the rope now he shouted to anne dont worry im all right here i go anne couldnt hear what dick said after that for the wellshaft made his words go crooked and she couldnt make out what they were but she was glad to hear him shouting even though she didnt know what he said she yelled down to him too hoping he could hear her dick slid down the rope holding on to it with hands knees and feet glad that he was so good at gym at school he wondered if he was anywhere near the dungeons he seemed to have gone down a long way he managed to get out his torch he put it between his teeth after he had switched it on so that he might have both hands free for the rope the light from the torch showed him the walls of the well around him he couldnt make out if he was above or below the dungeons he didnt want to go right down to the bottom of the well he decided that he must have just passed the opening into the dungeoncaves he climbed back up the rope a little way and to his delight saw that he was right the opening on to the dungeons was just by his head he climbed up till he was level with it and then swung himself to the side of the well where the small opening was he managed to get hold of the bricked edge and then tried to scramble through the opening into the dungeon it was difficult but luckily dick was not very big he managed it at last and stood up straight with a sigh of relief he was in the dungeons he could now follow the chalkmarks to the room or cave where the ingots were and where he felt sure that george and julian were imprisoned he shone his torch on the wall yes there were the chalkmarks good he put his head into the wellopening and yelled at the top of his voice anne im in the dungeons watch out that the men dont come back then he began to follow the white chalkmarks his heart beating fast after a while he came to the door of the storeroom as he had expected it was fastened so that george and julian couldnt get out big bolts had been driven home at the top and bottom and the children inside could not possibly get out they had tried their hardest to batter down the door but it was no good at all they were sitting inside the storecave feeling angry and exhausted the man had brought them food and drink but they had not touched it tim was with them lying down with his head on his paws halfangry with george because she hadnt let him fly at the men as he had so badly wanted to but george felt certain that tim would be shot if he tried biting or snapping anyway the other two had sense enough not to come down and be made prisoners too said george they must have known there was something funny about that note when they saw i had signed myself georgina instead of george i wonder what they are doing they must be hiding tim suddenly gave a growl he leapt to his feet and went to the closed door his head on one side he had heard something that was certain i hope its not those men back again already said george then she looked at tim in surprise flashing her torch on to him he was wagging his tail a great bang at the door made them all jump out of their skins then came dicks cheerful voice hi julian hi george are you here wuffffff barked tim joyfully and scratched at the door dick open the door yelled julian in delight quick open the door chapter sixteen a plan and a narrow escape contents prevnext dick unbolted the door at the top and bottom and flung it open he rushed in and thumped george and julian happily on the back hallo he said how does it feel to be rescued fine cried julian and tim barked madly round them george grinned at dick good work she said what happened dick told them in a few words all that had happened when he related how he had climbed down the old well george and julian could hardly believe their ears julian slipped his arm through his younger brothers youre a brick he said a real brick now quickwhat are we going to do well if theyve left us our boat im going to take us all back to the mainland as quickly as possible said george im not playing about with men who brandish revolvers all the time come on up the well we go and find the boat they ran to the wellshaft and squeezed through the small opening one by one up the rope they went and soon found the iron ladder julian made them go up one by one in case the ladder wouldnt bear the weight of all three at once it really wasnt very long before they were all up in the open air once more giving anne hugs and hearing her exclaim gladly with tears in her eyes how pleased she was to see them all again now come on said george after a minute off to the boat quick those men may be back at any time they rushed to the cove there was their boat lying where they had pulled it out of reach of the waves but what a shock for them theyve taken the oars said george in dismay the beasts they know we cant row the boat away without oars they were afraid you and anne might row off dick so instead of bothering to tow the boat behind them they just grabbed the oars now were stuck we cant possibly get away it was a great disappointment the children were almost ready to cry after dicks marvellous rescue of george and julian it had seemed as if everything was going right and now suddenly things were going wrong again we must think this out said julian sitting down where he could see at once if any boat came in sight the men have gone off probably to get a ship from somewhere in which they can put the ingots and sail away they wont be back for some time i should think because you cant charter a ship all in a hurry unless of course theyve got one of their own and in the meantime we cant get off the island to get help because theyve got our oars said george we cant even signal to any passing fishingboat because they wont be out just now the tides wrong it seems as if all weve got to do is wait here patiently till the men come back and take my gold and we cant stop them you know ive got a sort of plan coming into my head said julian slowly wait a bit dont interrupt me im thinking the others waited in silence while julian sat and frowned thinking of his plan then he looked at the others with a smile i believe it will work he said listen well wait here in patience till the men come back what will they do theyll drag away those stones at the top of the dungeon entrance and go down the steps theyll go to the storeroom where they left us thinking we are still there and they will go into the room well what about one of us being hidden down there ready to bolt them into the room then we can either go off in their motorboat or our own boat if they bring back our oars and get help anne thought it was a marvellous idea but dick and george did not look so certain wed have to go down and bolt that door again to make it seem as if we are still prisoners there said george and suppose the one who hides down there doesnt manage to bolt the men in it might be very difficult to do that quickly enough they will simply catch whoever we plan to leave down there and come up to look for the rest of us thats true said julian thoughtfully well well suppose that dick or whoever goes down doesnt manage to bolt them in and make them prisoners and the men come up here again all right while they are down below well pile big stones over the entrance just as they did then they wont be able to get out what about dick down below said anne at once i could climb up the well again said dick eagerly ill be the one to go down and hide ill do my best to bolt the men into the room and if i have to escape ill climb up the wellshaft again the men dont know about that so even if they are not prisoners in the dungeon room theyll be prisoners underground the children talked over this plan and decided that it was the best they could think of then george said she thought it would be a good thing to have a meal they were all halfstarved and now that the worry and excitement of being rescued was over they were feeling very hungry they fetched some food from the little room and ate it in the cove keeping a sharp lookout for the return of the men after about two hours they saw a big fishingsmack appear in the distance and heard the chugchugchug of a motorboat too there they are said julian in excitement and he jumped to his feet thats the ship they mean to load with the ingots and sail away in safety and theres the motorboat bringing the men back quick dick down the well you go and hide until you hear them in the dungeons dick shot off julian turned to the others well have to hide he said now that the tide is out well hide over yonder behind those uncovered rocks i dont somehow think the men will do any hunting for dick and anne but they might come on quick they all hid themselves behind the rocks and heard the motorboat come chugging into the tiny harbour they could hear men calling to one another there sounded to be more than two men this time then the men left the inlet and went up the low cliff towards the ruined castle julian crept behind the rocks and peeped to see what the men were doing he felt certain they were pulling away the slabs of stone that had been piled on top of the entrance to prevent dick and anne going down to rescue the others george come on called julian in a low tone i think the men have gone down the steps into the dungeons now we must go and try to put those big stones back quick george julian and anne ran softly and swiftly to the old courtyard of the castle they saw that the stones had been pulled away from the entrance to the dungeons the men had disappeared they had plainly gone down the steps the three children did their best to tug at the heavy stones to drag them back but their strength was not the same as that of the men and they could not manage to get any very big stones across they put three smaller ones and julian hoped the men would find them too difficult to move from below if only dick has managed to bolt them into that room he said to the others gome on back to the well now dick will have to come up there because he wont be able to get out of the entrance they all went to the well dick had removed the old wooden cover and it was lying on the ground the children leaned over the hole of the well and waited anxiously what was dick doing they could hear nothing from the well and they longed to know what was happening there was plenty happening down below the two men and another had gone down into the dungeons expecting of course to find julian george and the dog still locked up in the storeroom with the ingots they passed the wellshaft not guessing that an excited small boy was hidden there ready to slip out of the opening as soon as they had passed dick heard them pass he slipped out of the wellopening and followed behind quietly his feet making no sound he could see the beams made by the mens powerful torches and with his heart thumping loudly he crept along the smelly old passages between great caves until the men turned into the wide passage where the storecave lay here it is dick heard one of the men say as he flashed his torch on to the great door the golds in there so are the kids the man unbolted the door at top and bottom dick was glad that he had slipped along to bolt the door for if he hadnt done that before the men had come they would have known that julian and george had escaped and would have been on their guard the man opened the door and stepped inside the second man followed him dick crept as close as he dared waiting for the third man to go in too then he meant to slam the door and bolt it the first man swung his torch round and gave a loud exclamation the children are gone how strange where are they two of the men were now in the cave and the third stepped in at that moment dick darted forward and slammed the door it made a crash that went echoing round and round the caves and passages dick fumbled with the bolts his hand trembling they were stiff and rusty the boy found it hard to shoot them home in their sockets and meanwhile the men were not idle as soon as they heard the door slam they spun round the third man put his shoulder to the door at once and heaved hard dick had just got one of the bolts almost into its socket then all three men forced their strength against the door and the bolt gave way dick stared in horror the door was opening he turned and fled down the dark passage the men flashed their torches on and saw him they went after the boy at top speed dick fled to the wellshaft fortunately the opening was on the opposite side and he could clamber into it without being seen in the light of the torches the boy only just had time to squeeze through into the shaft before the three men came running by not one of them guessed that the runaway was squeezed into the wellshaft they passed indeed the men did not even know that there was a well there trembling from head to foot dick began to climb the rope he had left dangling from the rungs of the iron ladder he undid it when he reached the ladder itself for he thought that perhaps the men might discover the old well and try to climb up later they would not be able to do that if there was no rope dangling down the boy climbed up the ladder quickly and squeezed round the stone slab near the top the other children were there waiting for him they knew at once by the look on dicks face that he had failed in what he had tried to do they pulled him out quickly it was no good said dick panting with his climb i couldnt do it they burst the door open just as i was bolting it and chased me i got into the shaft just in time theyre trying to get out of the entrance now cried anne suddenly quick what shall we do theyll catch us all to the boat shouted julian and he took annes hand to help her along come along its our only chance the men will perhaps be able to move those stones the four children fled down the courtyard george darted into the little stone room as they passed it and caught up an axe dick wondered why she bothered to do that tim dashed along with them barking madly they came to the cove their own boat lay there without oars the motorboat was there too george jumped into it and gave a yell of delight here are our oars she shouted take them julian ive got a job to do here get the boat down to the water quick julian and dick took the oars then they dragged their boat down to the water wondering what george was doing all kinds of crashing sounds came from the motorboat george george buck up the men are out suddenly yelled julian he had seen the three men running to the cliff that led down to the cove george leapt out of the motorboat and joined the others they pushed their boat out on to the water and george took the oars at once pulling for all she was worth the three men ran to their motorboat then they paused in the greatest dismay for george had completely ruined it she had chopped wildly with her axe at all the machinery she could see and now the boat could not possibly be started it was damaged beyond any repair the men could make with the few tools they had you wicked girl yelled jake shaking his fist at george wait till i get you ill wait shouted back george her blue eyes shining dangerously and you can wait too you wont be able to leave my island now chapter seventeen the end of the great adventure contents prev the three men stood at the edge of the sea watching george pull away strongly from the shore they could do nothing their boat was quite useless the fishingsmack theyve got waiting out there is too big to use that little inlet said george as she pulled hard at her oars theyll have to stay there till someone goes in with a boat i guess theyre as wild as can be their boat had to pass fairly near to the big fishingboat a man hailed them as they came by ahoy there have you come from kirrin island dont answer said george dont say a word so no one said anything at all but looked the other way as if they hadnt heard ahoy there yelled the man angrily are you deaf have you come from the island still the children said nothing at all but looked away while george rowed steadily the man on the ship gave it up and looked in a worried manner towards the island he felt sure the children had come from thereand he knew enough of his comrades adventures to wonder if everything was right on the island he may put out a boat from the smack and go and see whats happening said george well he cant do much except take the men off with a few ingots i hardly think theyll dare to take any of the gold though now that weve escaped to tell our tale julian looked behind at the ship he saw after a time that the little boat it carried was being lowered into the sea youre right he said to george theyre afraid something is up theyre going to rescue those three men what a pity their little boat reached land the children leapt out into the shallow water and dragged it up to the beach tim pulled at the rope too wagging his tail he loved to join in anything that the children were doing shall you take tim to alf asked dick george shook her head no she said we havent any time to waste we must go and tell everything that has happened ill tie tim up to the fence in the front garden they made their way to kirrin cottage at top speed aunt fanny was gardening there she stared in surprise to see the hurrying children why she said i thought you were not coming back till tomorrow or the next day has anything happened whats the matter with dicks cheek nothing much said dick the others chimed in aunt fanny wheres uncle quentin we have something important to tell him mother weve had such an adventure aunt fanny weve an awful lot to tell you we really have aunt fanny looked at the untidy children in amazement whatever has happened she said then she turned towards the house and called quentin quentin the children have something to tell us uncle quentin came out looking rather cross for he was in the middle of his work whats the matter he asked uncle its about kirrin island said julian eagerly those men havent bought it yet have they well its practically sold said his uncle ive signed my part and they are to sign their part tomorrow why whats that to do with you uncle those men wont sign tomorrow said julian do you know why they wanted to buy the island and the castle not because they really wanted to build an hotel or anything like thatbut because they knew the lost gold was hidden there what nonsense are you talking said his uncle it isnt nonsense father cried george indignantly its all true the map of the old castle was in that box you sold and in the map was shown where the ingots were hidden by my greatgreatgreatgrandfather georges father looked amazed and annoyed he simply didnt believe a word but his wife saw by the solemn and serious faces of the four children that something important really had happened and then anne suddenly burst into loud sobs the excitement had been too much for her and she couldnt bear to think that her uncle wouldnt believe that everything was true aunt fanny aunt fanny its all true she sobbed uncle quentin is horrid not to believe us oh aunt fanny the man had a revolver and oh he made julian and george prisoners in the dungeons and dick had to climb down the well to rescue them and george has smashed up their motorboat to stop them escaping her aunt and uncle couldnt make head or tail of this but uncle quentin suddenly seemed to think that the matter was serious and worth looking into smashed up a motorboat he said whatever for come indoors i shall have to hear the story from beginning to end it seems quite unbelievable to me they all trooped indoors anne sat on her aunts knee and listened to george and julian telling the whole story they told it well and left nothing out aunt fanny grew quite pale as she listened especially when she heard about dick climbing down the well you might have been killed she said oh dick what a brave thing to do uncle quentin listened in the utmost amazement he had never had much liking or admiration for any children he always thought they were noisy tiresome and silly but now as he listened to julians tale he changed his mind about these four children at once youve been very clever he said and very brave too im proud of you yes im very proud of you all no wonder you didnt want me to sell the island george when you knew about the ingots but why didnt you tell me the four children stared at him and didnt answer they couldnt very well say well firstly you wouldnt have believed us secondly you are badtempered and unjust and we are frightened of you thirdly we didnt trust you enough to do the right thing why dont you answer said their uncle his wife answered for them in a gentle voice quentin you scare the children you know and i dont expect they liked to go to you but now that they have you will be able to take matters into your own hands the children cannot do any more you must ring up the police and see what they have to say about all this right said uncle quentin and he got up at once he patted julian on the back you have all done well he said then he ruffled georges short curly hair and im proud of you too george he said youre as good as a boy any day oh father said george going red with surprise and pleasure she smiled at him and he smiled back the children noticed that he had a very nice face when he smiled he and george were really very alike to look at both looked ugly when they sulked and frowned and both were good to look at when they laughed or smiled georges father went off to telephone the police and his lawyer too the children sat and ate biscuits and plums telling their aunt a great many little details they had forgotten when telling the story before as they sat there there came a loud and angry bark from the front garden george looked up thats tim she said with an anxious look at her mother i hadnt time to take him to alf who keeps him for me mother tim was such a comfort to us on the island you know im sorry hes barking now but i expect hes hungry well fetch him in said her mother unexpectedly hes quite a hero too we must give him a good dinner george smiled in delight she sped out of the door and went to tim she set him free and he came bounding indoors wagging his long tail he licked georges mother and cocked his ears at her good dog she said and actually patted him ill get you some dinner tim trotted out to the kitchen with her julian grinned at george well look at that he said your mothers a brick isnt she yes but i dont know what father will say when he sees tim in the house again said george doubtfully her father came back at that minute his face grave the police take a serious view of all this he said and so does my lawyer they all agree in thinking that you children have been remarkably clever and brave and george my lawyer says that the ingots definitely belong to us are there really a lot father there are hundreds cried george simply hundreds all in a big pile in the dungeon oh fathershall we be rich now yes said her father we shall rich enough to give you and your mother all the things ive longed to give you for so many years and couldnt ive worked hard enough for you but its not the kind of work that brings in a lot of money and so ive become irritable and badtempered but now you shall have everything you want i dont really want anything i havent already got said george but father there is one thing id like more than anything else in the world and it wont cost you a penny you shall have it my dear said her father slipping his arm round george much to her surprise just say what it is and even if it costs a hundred pounds you shall have it just then there came the pattering of big feet down the passage to the room they were in a big hairy head pushed itself through the door and looked inquiringly at everyone there it was tim of course uncle quentin stared at him in surprise why isnt that tim he asked hallo tim father tim is the thing i want most in all the world said george squeezing her fathers arm you cant think what a friend he was to us on the island and he wanted to fly at those men and fight them oh father i dont want any other present i only want to keep tim and have him here for my very own we could afford to give him a proper kennel to sleep in now and id see that he didnt disturb you i really would well of course you can have him said her fatherand tim came right into the room at once wagging his tail looking for all the world as if he had understood every word that had been said he actually licked uncle quentins hand anne thought that was very brave of him but uncle quentin was quite different now it seemed as if a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders they were rich now george could go to a good school and his wife could have the things he had so much wanted her to have and he would be able to go on with the work he loved without feeling that he was not earning enough to keep his family in comfort he beamed round at everyone looking as jolly a person as anyone could wish george was overjoyed about tim she flung her arms round her fathers neck and hugged him a thing she had not done for a long time he looked astonished but very pleased well well he said this is all very pleasant hallo is this the police already it was they came up to the door and had a few words with uncle quentin then one stayed behind to take down the childrens story in his notebook and the others went off to get a boat to the island the men had gone from there the boat from the fishingsmack had fetched them away and now both ship and boat had disappeared the motorboat was still there quite unusable the inspector looked at it with a grin fierce young lady isnt she that miss georgina he said done this job pretty well no one could get away in this boat well have to get it towed into harbour the police brought back with them some of the ingots of gold to show uncle quentin they had sealed up the door of the dungeon so that no one else could get in until the childrens uncle was ready to go and fetch the gold everything was being done thoroughly and properly though far too slowly for the children they had hoped that the men would have been caught and taken to prison and that the police would bring back the whole of the gold at once they were all very tired that night and didnt make any fuss at all when their aunt said that they must go to bed early they undressed and then the boys went to eat their supper in the girls bedroom tim was there ready to lick up any fallen crumbs well i must say weve had a wonderful adventure said julian sleepily in a way im sorry its ended though at times i didnt enjoy it very much especially when you and i george were prisoners in that dungeon that was awful george was looking very happy as she nibbled her gingerbread biscuits she grinned at julian and to think i hated the idea of you all coming here to stay she said i was going to be such a beast to you i was going to make you wish you were all home again and now the only thing that makes me sad is the idea of you going away which you will do of course when the holidays end and then after having three friends with me enjoying adventures like this ill be all on my own again ive never been lonely before but i know i shall be now no you wont said anne suddenly you can do something that will stop you being lonely ever again what said george in surprise you can ask to go to the same boardingschool as i go to said anne its such a lovely one and we are allowed to keep our pets so tim could come too gracious could he really said george her eyes shining well ill go then i always said i wouldntbut i will because i see now how much better and happier it is to be with others than all by myself and if i can have tim well thats simply wonderful youd better go back to your own bedroom now boys said aunt fanny appearing at the doorway look at dick almost dropping with sleep well you should all have pleasant dreams tonight for youve had an adventure to be proud of george is that tim under your bed well yes it is mother said george pretending to be surprised dear me tim what are you doing here tim crawled out and went over to georges mother he lay flat on his tummy and looked up at her most appealingly out of his soft brown eyes do you want to sleep in the girls room tonight said georges mother with a laugh all rightjust for once mother yelled george overjoyed oh thank you thank you thank you how did you guess that i just didnt want to be parted from tim tonight oh mother tim you can sleep on the rug over there four happy children snuggled down into their beds their wonderful adventure had come to a happy end they had plenty of holidays still in front of them and now that uncle quentin was no longer poor he would give them the little presents he wanted to george was going to school with anne and she had tim for her own again the island and castle still belonged to george everything was marvellous im so glad kirrin island wasnt sold george said anne sleepily im so glad it still belongs to you it belongs to three other people too said george it belongs to me and to you and julian and dick ive

belong to us all oh george how lovely said anne delighted wont the boys be pleased i do feel so ha but before she could finish the little girl was asleep so was george in the other room the two boys slept too dreaming of ingots and dungeons and all kinds of exciting things only one person was awake and that was tim he had one ear up and was listening to the childrens breathing as soon as he knew they were asleep he got up quietly from his rug he crept softly over to georges bed he put his front paws up and sniffed at the sleeping girl then with a bound he was on the bed and snuggled himself down into the crook of her legs he gave a sigh and shut his eyes the four children might be happy but tim was happiest of all oh tim murmured george half waking up as she felt him against her oh tim
