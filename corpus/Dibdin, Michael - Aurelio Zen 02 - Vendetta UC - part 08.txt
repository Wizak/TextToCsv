 saturday a chill tangy wind laden with salt and darkness whined and blustered about the ship testing for weaknesses by contrast the sea was calm its shiny black surface merged imperceptibly into the darkness all around ridged into folds tucks and creases heaving and tilting in the moon light the short choppy waves slapping the metal plates below seemed to have no perceptible effect on the ship itself which lay as still as if it were already roped to the quay a man stood grasping the metal rail pudgy with innumerable coats of paint staring out into the night as keenly as an officer of the watch the unbuttoned overcoat flapping about him like a cloak gave him an illusory air of corpulence but when the wind failed for a moment he was revealed as quite slender for his height beneath the overcoat he was wearing a rumpled suit a tie of some nondescript hue was plastered to his shirt by the wind in a lazy curve like a question mark his face was lean and smooth with an aquiline nose and slateblue eyes their gaze as disconcertingly direct as a childs his hair its basic undistinguished brown now flecked with silverygrey highlights at the temples was naturally curly and the wind ossed it back and forth like frantic wavelets in a storm scene on a greek vase a few hundred metres astern of the ship the full moon was reflected in the seas unstable surface the shuddering patch of brightness had an eerie illusion of depth as if created by a gigantic searchlight aimed upwards from the ocean bed it was deep here off the eastern coast of the island where the mountains plunged down to meet the sea and then kept going zen stood breathing in the wild air and scanning the horizon for some hint of their land fall but there was nothing to betray the presence of the coast unless it was the fact that the darkness ahead seemed even more unyielding solid and impenetrable the steward had knocked on the cabin door to wake him twenty minutes earlier claiming that their arrival was imminent emerging on deck zen had expected lights bustling activity a first view of his destination but there was nothing the ship might have been becalmed in mid ocean he didnt care he felt weightless anonymous stripped of al superfluous baggage rome was already inconceiv ably distant sardinia lay somewhere ahead unknown a blank as for the reasons why he was there standing on the deck of a tirrenia line ferry at five oclock in the morning they seemed utterly unreal and irrelevant when he looked again it was over the wall of darkness ahead had divided in two a high mountain range below dappled with a suggestion of contours and the sky above hollow with the coming dawn harbour lights emerged from behind the spit of land which had concealed them earlier now differentiated from the open sea and the small bay beyond reading them like constellations zen map ped out quays and jetties cranes and roads in the half light things were beginning to put on shape and form to wake up get dressed and make themselves presentable the moment had passed soon it would be just another day down beiow in the bar the process was already well advanced a predominantly male crowd more or less dishevelled and badtempered clustered around a sleepy cashier to buy a printed receipt which they then took to the gar and traded in for a plastic thimble filled with strong black coffee on the bench seats all around young people were awakening from a rough night rubbing their eyes scratching their backs exchanging little jokes and caresses zen had just succeeded in ordering his coffee when a robotic voice from the tannoy directed all drivers to ake their way to the car deck to disembark he downed the coffee hurriedly scalding his mouth and throat before heading down into the bowels of the ship the vehicles bound for this small port of call on the way to cagliari the ships destination were almost exclusively commercial and military neither category took the slight est notice of the signs asking drivers not to switch on their engines until the bow doors had been opened zen made his way through clouds of diesel fumes to his car sand wiched between a large lorry and a coach filled with mili tary conscripts looking considerably less lively than they had the night before when they had made the harbour at civitavecchia ring with the forced gaiety of desperate men he unlocked the door and climbed in fausto arcuto had done him well there was no question about that return ing to the rally bar the previous afternoon zen had collec ted an envelope containing a set of keys and a piece of paper reading outside via florio g he turned the paper over and wrote many thanks for prompt delivery the parrucci affair has nothing repeat nothing to do with you regards he handed this to the barman and walked round the corner to via florio there was no need to check the house number the car a white mercedes saloon with cream leather upholstery stood out a mile among the battered utility compacts of the testaccio residents it had been fitted with zurich number plates fairly recently to judge by the bright scratches on the rusty nuts no registration or insurance documents were displayed on the windscreen but this would have been a bit much to expect at such short notice zen took out his wallet and inspected the swiss identity card in the name of reto gurtner which he had retained following an undercover job six years earlier it was a fake but extremely high quality a product of the secret services operation at prato where it was rumoured a large number of the top forgers in the country offered their skills to sismi in lieu of a prison sentence the primitive lighting and zens constrained pose made the photograph look like a police mugshot not surprisingly since it had been taken on the same equipment herr gurtner of zurich looked capable of just about anything thought zen even framing an innocent man to order as he sat there muffied by the mercedes luxurious coachwork from the farting lorries and buses all around zen reflected that whatever happened in sardinia he had at least been able to clear up his outstanding problems in rome before leaving the volante patrol summoned by his call from the flat had arrested a man attempting to escape in the red alfa romeo he tumed out to be one giuliano acciari a local hoodlum with a lengthy criminal record for housebreaking and minor thuggery zen recog nized him as the man who had picked his pocket in the bus queue although he did not mention this to the police acciari was unarmed and a search failed to turn up the shotgun which he was assumed to have dumped upon hearing the sirens but the police were holding acciari for the theft of the alfa romeo and had assured zen that they would spare no effort to extract any infor mation he might have as to the whereabouts of vasco spadola a series of shudders and a change in the pitch of the turbines announced that the ship had docked but another ten minutes passed before a crack of daylight finally pene trated the murky reaches of the car deck the coaches and lorries to either side of zen rumbled into motion and then too soon it was his turn zen had learnt to drive back in the late fifties but he had never really developed a taste for it as the roads filled up speeds increased and drivers tempers shortened he had seen no reason to change his views although he was careful to keep them to himself well aware that they would be considered dissident if not heretical but in the present case there had been no alternative he couldnt drag anyone else along to act as his chauffeur and it would not be credible for herr reto gurtner the wealthy burgher of zurich to travel through the wilds of sardinia by public transport zens style behind the wheel was similar to that of an elderly peasant farmer phutphutting along at zo kph in a clappedout fiat truck with bald tyres and no acceleration blithely oblivious to the hooting lightflashing hysteria building up in his wake the drive from rome to the port at civitavecchia had been a twoandahalfhour ordeal but getting off the ferry presented even greater problems of clutch control and touchsteering than had the innumer able traffic lights of the via aurelia at each of which the mercedes had seemed to take fright like a horse at a fence having stalled three times and then nearly rammed the side of the ship by overrevving zen finally managed to negotiate the metal ramp leading to sardinian soil or rather the stone jetty to which the ferry was moored rather to his surprise there were no formalities no passports no customs but bureaucratically of course he was still in italy it was zens first visit to the island in italy all police officials have to do a stint in one of the three problem areas of the country but zen had chosen the alto adige rather than sicily or sardinia because from there he could easily get back to venice to see his mother the port amounted to no more than a couple of wharves where the ferries to and from the mainland touched once a week and russian freighters periodically unloaded cargoes of timber pulp for the local papermill at the end of the quay a narrow badlysurfaced road curved away between outcrops of jagged pink rock zen drove through a straggling collection of makeshift houses that never quite became a village and along the spit of land projecting out to the harbour from the main coastline the sun was still hidden behind the mountains but the sky overhead was clear a delicate pale wintry blue seagulls swept back and forth foraging for food their cries pealing out in the crisp air as he drove through the small town where the road inland crossed the main coastal highway zens instinct was to stop the car drop into a cafe and start picking up the clues sniffing the air getting his bearings but he couldnt for in sardinia he was not aurelio zen but reto gurtner and although he had as yet only a vague idea of gurtners character he was sure that pausing to soak up the atmosphere formed no part of it or rather he was sure that that was what the locals would assume and it was their view of things that mattered a rich swiss stop ping his mercedes outside some rural dive for an early morning cappuccino would instantly become a suspect swiss and that of all things was the one zen could least afford he must not let the clear sky pure air and early morning sense of elation go to his head he knew in those mountains blocking off the sun turning their back on the sea lived men who had survived thousands of years of foreign domination by using their wits and their intimate knowledge of the land generations of policemen occasion ally supplemented by the army had been drafted there in a succession of attempts to break the complex archaic unwritten rules of the codice barbaricine and impose the laws passed in rome they had failed even mussolinis strongarm tactics successful against the largely urban mafia had been ineffectual with these shepherds who could simply vanish into the mountains the mass arrests of their relatives in raids on whole villages merely served to strengthen the hands of the outlaws by making them into local folk heroes any collaboration with the authori ties was considered treachery of the most vile kind and punished accordingly to sardinians mainland italians were either policemen soldiers teachers tax gatherers pureaucrats or more recently tourists they stayed for a while took what they wanted and then left as ignorant as when they had arrived of the local inhabitants the harsh brand of latin they spoke and the complex and often violent code for resolving conflicts among shepherds whose flocks roamed freely across the open mountains this was why zen had decided to go about this unofficial undercover operation in the guise of a foreigner all out siders were suspect in sardinia but a foreigner was much likely to attract suspicion than a lone italian who would automatically be assumed to be a government spy of some type besides herr reto gurtner had a good reason for visiting this outoftheway corner of the island at this unseasonable time of the year he was looking for a property the mercedes hummed purposefully along the road that wound and twisted its way up from the coast through a parched scorched landscape to either side jagged crags of limestone rose like molars out of acres of sterile red soil giant cactuses with enormous prickly ears grew there and small groves of eucalyptus and olive and the odd patch of wildlooking stunted vines there was a gratifying absence of traffic on the road and zen was just getting into his stride when he was brought to a halt at a levelcrossing consisting of a chain with a metal plate dangling from it he had been vaguely aware of a set of narrowgauge railway tracks running alongside the road but they looked so poorly maintained that he had assumed the line was disused on the other side of the chain an elderly woman was chatting to a schoolboy wearing a satchel with the inscrip hon iron maiden in fluorescent orange and green they both turned to stare at the mercedes zen gave them a bland blank look he imagined to be typically swiss they continued to stare zen took the opportunity of consulting the map that too was surely a typically swiss thing to do a train consisting of an ancient diesel locomotive and two decrepit carriages staggered to a stop at the crossing the iron maiden fan climbed in to join a mob of other schoolchildren the locomotive belched a cloud of fumes and a moment later the road was clear again zen put the car in gear stalled let off the handbrake started to roll backwards engaged the clutch restarted the motor stal led engaged the handbrake released the clutch restarted the motor released the handbrake engaged the clutch and drove away none of this he felt was typically swiss the look the crossingkeeper gave him suggested that she felt the same fortified by the information from the map and the occasional faded and rusted road sign zen continued inland for a dozen kilometres before turning left on to a steep road twisting up the mountainside in a series of switchback loops at each corner he caught a glimpse of the village above the nearer he got the less attractive it looked from a distance it resembled some natural disaster a landslip perhaps close up it looked like a gigantic rubbish tip there was nothing distinctively sar dinian about it it could have been any one of thousands of communities in the south kept alive by injections of cash from migrant workers the houses piled together higgledy piggledy many of them unfinished awaiting the next cheque from abroad the dominant colours were white and ochre the basic shape the rectangle strewn across the steep slope the place had a freakish temporary air as though by the next day it might all have been dismantled and moved elsewhere and yet it might well have been there when rome itself was but a village the final curves of the road had already been colonized by the zone of new buildings some were mere skeletons of reinforced concrete others had a shell of outer walling but remained uninhabited a few were being built storey by storey the lower floor already in use while the first floor formed a temporary flat roof from which the rusted reinforcement wires for the next stage protruded like the stalks of some superhardy local plant that had learned to flourish in cement the road gradually narrowed and became the main street of the village proper zen painfully squeezed the mercedes past parked vans and lorries cravenly giving way to any oncoming traffic until he reached a small piazza that was really no more than a broadening of the main street the line of buildings was broken here by a terrace planted with stocky trees over iooking a stunning panorama that stretched all the way down to the distant coastline and the sea beyond some where down there zen knew indistinguishable to the naked eye lay the villa burolo he parked on the other side of the piazza in front of a squat fairly new building with a sign reading bar res taurant hotel it was still early and the few people about were all intent on business of one kind or another but zen was conscious that their eyes were on him as he got out of the car and removed his suitcase from the boot stranger in town they were thinking foreign car tourist at this time of year zen was acutely aware oe their puzzlement their suspicion he wanted to cultivate it briefly to let the questions form and the implications be raised before he supplied an answer which he hoped would come as a satisfying relief he pushed through the plateglass doors into a bar which might have looked glamorously stylish when it had been built some time in the mid sixties but which had aged gracelessly the stippled plaster was laden with dust the tinted metal faqades were dented and scratched the pine trim had been bleached by sunlight and stained by liquids and was warping off the wall in places all these details were mercilessly reflected from every angle by a series of mirrors deso ed to increase the apparent size of the room but which in fact reduced it to a nightmarish maze of illusory perspectives and visual culdesacs with or without the proprietor demanded when zen asked if he had a room available zen had given some thought to the question of how reto gurtner should speak eventually deciding against funny accents or deliberate mistakes it would be typically swiss he decided to speak pedantically correct italian but slowly and heavily as though all the words were equal citizens and it was invidious and undemocratic to emphasize some at the expense of others i beg your pardon a shower yes please with a shower the proprietor plucked a key from a row of hooks and slapped it down on the counter he was plump with a bushy black beard and receding hair his manner was deliberately ungracious as though the shameful calling of taking in guests for money had been forced on him by stern necessity and he loathed it as a form of prostitution he took zens faked papers without a second glance and started copying the relevant details on to a police registra tion form would it be possible to have a cappuccino zen inquired politely at the bar zen duly took the four paces needed to reach this instal lation the proprietor completed the form held it up to the light as though to admire the watermark folded it in two with exaggerated precision and placed it with the papers in a small safe let into the wall he then walked over to the bar where he set about washing up some glasses an elderly man came into the bar he was wearing a brown corduroy suit with leather patches on the seat and behind the knees and a flat cap his face was as hard and smooth and irregular as piece of granite exposed to centur ies of harsh weather oh tommaso the proprietor called setting a glass of wine on the counter the man knocked the wine back in one gulp and started rolling a cigarette meanwhile he and the proprietor conversed animatedly in a language that might have been arabic as far as zen was concerned may i have my cappuccino please he asked plaintively the proprietor glanced at him as though he had never seen him before and was both puzzled and annoyed to find him there cappuccino he demanded in a tone which suggested that this drink was some exotic foreign speciality zens instinct was to match rudeness with rudeness but reto gurtner he felt sure would remain palely polite under any provocation if you please perhaps you would also be good enough to direct me to the offices of dottor confalone he added the elderly man looked up from licking the gummed edge of his cigarette paper he spat out a shred of tobacco which had found its way on to his tongue opposite the post office he said is it far there was a brief roar as the proprietor frothed the milk with steam five minutes he said quickly as though to forestall the old man from making any further unwise disclosures zen stined sugar into his coffee he himself never took sugar but he felt that reto gurtner would have a sweet tooth similarly the cigarettes he produced were not his usual nazionali but cosmopolitan marlboros i have an appointment you see he explained labori ously to no one in particular in half an hour i dont know how it is here in italy but in switzerland it is very important to be punctual especially when its business neither the proprietor nor the old man showed the slightest interest in this observation but from the studious way they avoided glancing at each other zen knew that the point had been taken the disturbing mystery of herr gurtners descent on the village had been reduced to a specific localized puzzle it was just after nine odock when zen spruce and cleanshaven emerged from the hotel the main street of the village was a deep canyon of shadow but the alleys and steps running off to either side were slashed with sunshine revealing panels of brilliant white wall inset with dark rectangular openings behind and above them rose a rugged chaos of rock and tough green shrubs the ancient mountain backbone of the island last vestige of the submerged tyrrhenian continent zen walked purposefully along smiling in a pleasant meaningless way at everyone he passed like a benevolent but rather simpleminded giant the sards were the short est of all mediterranean races while zen was above aver age height for an italian thanks perhaps in part to his fathers quirky theories about food a selfeducated socialist he had been an enthusiast for many useless things of which mussolinis vapid patriotism had briefly been the last another had been a primitive vegetarianism in particular the notion that beans and milk were the foundation of a healthy diet from the moment aurelio was weaned he had eaten a large dish of these two ingredients mashed together every lunchtime his fathers belief in the virtues of this wonderfood had been based on a hotchpotch of halfbaked ideas culled from his wide and eclectic reading but by the purest chance he had hap pened to hit on two cheap and easily obtainable sources of complementary protein with the result that zen had grown up unaffected by the shortages of meat and fish which stunted the development of other children in war time venice the reactions to herr gurtners bland swiss smile varied interestingly the young men hanging about in the piazza as though work were not so much unavailable as beneath their dignity surveyed the tall stranger like an exotic animal on display in a travelling circus odd and slightly absurd but also potentially dangerous to their elders clustered on the stone benches between the trees he was just another piece in the hopeless puzzle which life had come over which they shook their heads loosely and muttered incoherent comments the men old and young massed in groups using the public spaces as an extension of their living rooms but the women zen saw were always alone and on the move they had right of passage only and scurried along as though liable to be challenged at any moment clutching their wicker shopping baskets like official permits the married ones ignored zen totally the nubile shot him glances as keen and challenging as a thrown knife only the old women having nothing more to fear or hope from the enemy gave him cool but not unfriendly looks of appraisal dressed all in black they looked like pyramids of differentsized tyres their bodies narrowing from mas sive hips through bulbous waists to tiny scarfwrapped heads the exception which proved this rule of female purpose and activity was a halfwitted woman who approached zen just as he reached his destination asking for money even by sardinian standards she was exceptionally small almost dwarflike she was wearing a dark brown pullover and a long full skirt of some heavy navyblue material her head and feet were bare and dirty and she limped so aggressively that zen assumed that she was faking or at least exaggerating her disability for professional reasons he offered her goo lire before realizing that herr reto gurtner coming from a nation which prided itself on providing for all its citizens would disapprove of begging on principle fortunately the woman was clearly too crazy to pick up on any such subtleties zen forced the money into her hand while she stared fixedly at him like someone who has mistaken a stranger for an old acquaintance he huned away into the doorway flanked by a large plastic sign reading dott angelo confalone solicitor notary public estate agent chartered accountant insurance broker tax and investment specialist also teeth pulled and horoscopes cast thought zen as he climbed the steps to the second floor angelo confalone was a plush young man who received herr gurtner with an expansive warmth in marked con trast to the cold stares and hostile glances which had been his lot thus far it was a pleasure he intimated to have dealings with someone so distinguished and sophisti cated so different from the usual run of his clients he wasnt sardinian himself it soon emerged from genoa in fact but his sister had married someone from the area who had pointed out that there was an opening in the village it was a long story and one he would not bore herr gurtner with but the long and short of it was that one had to start somewhere zen nodded his agreement we have a saying in my country no matter how high the mountain you have to start climbing at the bottom the lawyer laughed with vivacious insincerity and com plimented herr gurtner on his italian and now to business if you please zen told him you have i believe something for me to look at indeed indeed when reto gurtner had phoned him the day before with regard to finding a suitable holiday property for a client in switzerland angelo confalone could hardly believe his luck ever since oscar burolos son had instruc ted him to put his fathers illfated sardinian retreat on the market confalone had been asking himself who on earth in his right mind would ever want to buy the villa burolo after the lurid publicity given to the horrors that had occurred there mindful of this enzo burolo had offered to double the usual commission in order to get the place off their hands quickly but confalone still couldnt see any way that he would be able to take advantage of this desir able sweetener unless some rich foreigner happens along he had concluded then im just wasting my time and lo and behold just a few weeks later reto gurtner pad telephoned he had inspected several properties in the north of the island he said but his client had speci fically asked him to look on the east coast where he had vacationed several years earlier and of whose spectacular and rugged beauty he retained fond memories if dottor confalone by any chance knew of any suitable properties on the market a man wearing even one of the many hats mentioned on angelo confalones business plate should perhaps have been shrewd enough to frown momentarily at this happy coincidence but the young lawyer was too busy calculating his percentage from the sale of the property which was now of course in a very different price bracket from the subsistencelevel farm whose original purchase by oscar burolo he had also negotiated confalone regarded his visitor complacently as you are no doubt aware herr gurtner properties of a standard high enough to satisfy your clients require ments are few and far between in this area as for one coming on the market you would normally have to wait years it so happens however that i am in a position to offer you a villa which has only just become available and which i can truly and honestly describe without risk of hyperbole as the finest example of its type to be found anywhere in the island the costa smeralda included he went on in this vein for some time expatiating on the imaginative way in which the original farmhouse had been modernized and extended without sacrificing the unique authenticity of its humble origins the original owner was a man of vision and daring who brought his unlimited resources and great expertise in the construction business to bear on the he was realizing a dream zen suggested confalone nodded vigorously exactly precisely i couldnt have put it better myself he was realizing a dream and why is he now selling it his dream the lawyers vivacity vanished for family reasons he murmured there was a death in the family he awaited herr gurtners response with some trepi dation for the kind of money the burolos were offering confalone was quite prepared to try and conceal the truth but money wasnt everything he had his career to con sider and that meant that he couldnt afford to lie but reto gurtner appeared satisfied i should like to see this most interesting property at once he declared rising to his feet confalones relief was apparent in his voice certainly certainly i shall be privileged to accompany you personally and thank you that will not be necessary there is a care taker at the house if you will be good enough to ring and let them know that i am coming i prefer to look around on my own we swiss you know are very methodical i do not wish to try your patience after some polite insistence angelo confalone gave way gracefully double commission and no time wasted doing the honours he could hardly believe his luck zen emerged from the lawyers offices to a chorus of horns the street having been blocked by a lorry delivering cartons of dairy produce to a nearby grocery he slipped through the narrow space between the lorry and the wall and made his way along the cracked concrete slabs with which the street was paved well pleased with the way things were going back in rome the idea of forestalling his official mission with a bit of private enterprise had appeared at best a forlorn attempt to leave no stone un turned at worst a foolhardy scheme which might well end in disaster and humiliation but from his present perspect ive rome itself seemed an irrelevance a city as distant and as foreign as marseilles or madrid it was here and only here that zen could hope to find the solution to his problems not that he expected to crack the burolo case of course there was nothing to crack anyway the evi jence against renato favelloni was overwhelming the only question was whether he had done the job personally or hired it out to a professional the key to the whole affair gad been the video tapes and computer diskettes stored in the underground vault at oscar burolos villa here burolo had kept in electronic form all the information recording in meticulous detail the history of his construction com panys irresistible rise after the murders this material had been impounded by the authorities but when the investigating magistrates staff came to examine them they found that the computer data had been irretrievably corrupted probably by exposure to a powerful magnetic field insistent rumours began to circulate to the effect that the discs had been in perfect condition when they were seized by the carabinieri and these were strengthened about a month later when a leading news magazine published what purported to be a transcription of part of burolos records the material concerned a contract agreed in for the construction of a new prison near latina a creation of the fascist era on the lazio coast popularly known as latrina burolo construction had undercut the estimated minimum tender for the project by almost o per cent their bid was duly accepted despite the fact that the plan which accompanied it was vague in some places and full of inaccuracies in others no sooner had work begun than the site proved to be marshy and totally unsuitable for the type of construction envisaged burolo construction promptly applied to the ministry of public works for the first of a series of revised budgets which eventually pushed the cost of the prison from the ooo million lire specified in the original contract to over ooo million this much was public knowledge what the news magazines article showed was how it had been done although the article did not name the politician referred to in burolos electronic notes as lonorevole it left little doubt in the readers mind that he was a leading figure in one of the smaller parties making up the governing coali tion who had been minister of public works at the time the prison contract was agreed according to his notes oscar burolo had paid renato favelloni ggo million lire to ensure that burolo construction would get the contract a comment which some claimed to find typical of oscars sardonic style noted that this handout exceeded the nor mal rate which apparently varied between and per cent of the contract fee the records also listed the dates and places on which oscar had contacted favelloni and one on which he had met lonorevole himself no sooner has this article appeared than the journal ists responsible were summoned to the law courts in nuoro and directed to disclose where they had obtained the information on refusing they were promptly jailed for culpable reticence but that wasnt the end of the affair for the following issue of the magazine contained an interview with oscars son enzo burolo not only substantiated the claims made in the original article but advanced new and even more damaging allegations in particular he claimed that six months prior to the kill ings his father had paid yo million lire to obtain the con tract for a new generating station for enel the electricity board despite this exorbitant backhander burolo construction did not get the contract according to enzo oscar burolo was so infuriated that he vowed to stop paying kickbacks altogether from that point on his companys fortunes went into a nosedive in a desperate attempt to break the system oscar had leagued together with other construction firms to form a ring that tendered for contracts at realistic prices but in each case the bidding was declared invalid on some technicality and the contract subsequently awarded to a company outside the ring burolo construction soon found itself on the verge of bankruptcy but when oscar applied to the banks for a line of credit he discovered that he was no longer a favoured client his letters were mislaid his calls not turned the people he had plied with gifts and favours vrere permanently unavailable furious and desperate oscar had played his last card contacting renato favel loni to demand the protection of onorevole himself if this was not forthcoming he warned favelloni he would reveal the full extent of their collaboration including detailed accounts of the payoffs over the latina prison job and a video tape showing favelloni himself in an unguarded moment discussing his relationship with various men of power lonorevole included discussions and negotiations had continued throughout the summer but according to enzo this had been a mere delaying tactic which his fathers enemies used to gain time in which to prepare their definitive response which duly came on that fateful day in august just hours after renato favelloni had left the villa burolo from that moment on the case against favelloni developed an irresistible momentum true there were stiii those who raised doubts for example if the destruc tion of burolos records had been as vital to the success of the conspiracy as the murder of oscar himself how was it that the magazine had been able to obtain an uncor rupted copy of one of the most incriminating of the discs even more to the point why did the killer use a weapon as noisy as a shotgun if he needed time to destroy the records and make good his escape but these questions were soon answered the magazines information it was suggested came not from the original disc but from a copy which the wily burolo had deposited elsewhere to be made public in the event of his death as for the noise factor there was nothing to show that the discs and videos had not been erased before the killings indeed the metallic crash reproduced on the video recording seemed to strengthen this hypothesis as for the weapon this had presumably been chosen with a view to making the crime appear a savage act of casual violence in short such details appeared niggling attempts to undermine the case against renato favelloni and his masters at palazzo sisti a case which now appeared overwhelming luckily for zen the case itself was only peripherally his concern there was no way he could realistically hope to get favelloni off the hook his aim was simply to avoid making powerful and dangerous enemies at palazzo sisti and the best way to do this seemed to be to take a leaf out of vincenzo fabris book in other words he had to make it look as if he had done his crooked best to frame padedda but that his best just hadnt been good enough this wasnt as easy as it sounded the thing had to be handled very carefully indeed if he was to avoid sending an innocent man to prison and yet convince palazzo sisti that he was not a disloyal employee to be ruthlessly dis posed of but like fabri a wellmeaning sympathizer who was unfortunately not up to the demands of the job in rome his prospects of achieving this had appeared extremely dubious but he was now beginning to feel that he could bring it off the tide had turned with the arrest of giuliano acciari and yes why not admit it with that lunch with tania and the embrace with which it had concluded a fatalist at heart zen had learnt from bitter experience that when things werent going his way there was no point in trying to force them to do so now that they were it would be equaly foolish not to take advan tage of the situation he strolled along the street glancing into shop win dows and along the dark alleys that opened off to either side scanning the features and gestures of the people he met he felt that he was beginning to get the feel of the place to sense the possibilities it offered then he saw or seemed to see something that brought all his confident reasoning crashing down around him in an alleyway to the left of the main street a culdesac filled with plastic rubbish sacks a few empty oil drums and some building debris stood a figure hold ing what looked like a gun a moment later it was gone and a moment after that zen found himself questioning whether it had ever existed dont be absurd he told himself as he stepped into the ailey determined to dispel this mirage created by his own overheated imagination the man who had broken into his house in rome was safely under arrest and even if spadola had taken up his vendetta in person how could he have tracked his quarry down so quickly zen had had every reason to take the greatest care when collecting the mercedes ard driving it to civitaveccia he wasnt thinking of spadola so much as vincenzo fabri and the people at palazzo sisti but he hadnt been fol lowed he was sure of that the alley narrowed to a crevice between the buildings on each side barely wide enough for one person to pass as his eyes adjusted to the gloom zen saw that it continued for some distance dipping steeply and then turned sharply eft presumably leading to a street below there was no sign that anyone had been there recently when he heard the footsteps behind him closing off his escape he whirled around for a moment everythiny seemed to be repeating itself in mirrorimage once again he was faced with a figure holding a gun but this time the weapon was a stubby submachinegun the man was wearing battledress and there was no doubt about the reality of the experience at the end of the alley in the street stood a blue jeep marked carabinieri papers the man barked zen reached automatically for his wallet then his hand dropped again they took them at the hotel he explained accentu ating his northern intonation slightly the carabiniere looked him up and down this isnt the way to the hotel i know i was just curious im from switzerland you see by us the towns are more rational built without these so interesting and picturesque aspects youre overdoing it he told himself but the carabiniere appeared to relax slightly tourist he nodded zen ran through his wellrehearsed spiel taking care to mention angelo confalone several times the cara binieres expression gradually shifted from suspicion to a slightly patronizing complacency finally he ushered zen back to the street all the same he said as they reached the jeep its maybe better not to go exploring too much there was a case last spring a couple of german tourists in a camper found shot through
