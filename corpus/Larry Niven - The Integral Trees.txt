 sharis davis kendy had not been an impatient man after the change he had thought himself immune to impatience but it was taking too long what were they doing in there his senses were not limited shariss telescopic array was powerful he could sense the full electromagnetic spectrum from microwave up to xray but the smoke ring balked his view it was a storm of wind dust clouds of water vapor huge rippling drops of dirty water or thin mud masses of freefloating rock dots and motes and clumps of green green surfaces on the drops and the rocks green tinges of algae in the clouds trees shaped like integration signs oriented radially to the neutron star and tufted with green at both ends whalesized creatures with vast mouths to skim the greentinged clouds life was everywhere in the smoke ring claire dalton had called it a christmas wreath claire had been a very old woman before the state revived her as a corpsicle the others had never seen a christmas wreath nor had kendy what they had seen half a thousand years ago was a perfect smoke ring several tens of thousands of kilometers across with a tiny hot pinpoint in its center their reports had been enthusiastic life was dnabased the air was not only breathable but tasted fine disc pline presently occupied the point of gravitational neutrality behind goldblatts world the l point this close the sky split equally into starsprinkled black and greentinged cloudscape directly below a vast distorted whirlpool of storm hid the residue of a gas giant planet a rocky nugget two and a half times the mass of earth sharis would not enter that inner region the maelstrom of forces could damage his ship he couldnt guess how long the seeder r mship must survive to accomplish his mission he had waited more than half a thousand years already the l point was still within the gas torus of which the smoke ring was only the densest part disc pline was subject to slow erosive forces he couldnt last forever in this place at least the crew were not extinct that would have hurt him terribly he had done his duty their ancestors had been mutineers a potential threat to the state itself to reeducate their descendants was his goal but if the smoke ring had killed them well it would not have surprised him it took more than breathable air to keep men alive the smoke ring was green with the life that had evolved for that queer environment native life might well have killed of those johnnycomelately rivals the erstwhile crew of the seeder ramship discipline sharls would have grieved but he would have been free to return home theyd call me an obsolete failure he thought gloomily while his instruments sought a particular frequency in the radio range a thousand years out of date by the time im home theyd scrap the computer for certain and the program the sharls davis kendy program might be copied and kept for the use of historians or nol but they hadnt died eight cargo and repair modules had gone with the original mutineers time and the corrosive environment must have ruined the carms but at least one was still operational someone bad been using it as late as six years ago andthere the light hed been searching for for a moment it reached him clearly the frequency of hydrogen burning with oxygen he fired a maser in ultrashort highpowered pulses kendy for the state kendy for the state kendy for the state the response came four seconds later sluggish weak and blurred kendy pinpointed it and finefocused his telescopes while he sent his next demand status tell me three times kendy sorted the garbled respofise through a noiseeliminator program the carm was on manual mostly functional using attitude jets only operating well inside its safety limits once it had been a simplified recording of kendys own personality now the program was deteriorating growing stupid and erratic course record for the past hour it came the carm had been freefalling at low relative velocity up to forty minutes ago then lowacceleration maneuvers a course that looked like a dropped plate of spaghetti a mad waste of stored fuel malfunction or it could have been a dogfightstyle battle war switch to my command four seconds then a signal like a scream of bewildered agony massive malfunction the crew must have disconnected the autopilot system on every one of the carms half a thousand years ago it had still been worth a try as was his next message give me video link with crew denied oh ho the video link hadnt been disconnected a block must have been programmed in half a thousand years ago by the mutineers certainly their descendants wouldnt know how to do that a block might be circumvented eventually the carm was too small to see of course but it must be somewhere near that green blob not far from goldblatts world a cottoncandy forest plants within the smoke ring tended to be fluffy fragile they spread and divided to collect as much sunlight as possible without worrying about gravity for half a thousand years kendy had watched for signs of a developing civilizationfor regular patterns in the floating masses or infrared radiation from manufacturing centers or industrial pollution metal vapor carbon monoxide oxides of nitrogen he hadnt found any of that if the children of disciplines crew were developing beyond savagery it was not in any great numbers but they lived someone was using a carm if only he could see them or talk to themgive me voiceover citizen this is kendy for the state speak and your reward will be beyond the reach of your imagination amplify amplify amplify sent the carm kendy was already sending at full amplification cancel voiceover he sent not for the first time he wondered if the smoke ring could have proved too kindly an environment creatures evolved in freefall would not have human strength huin nc could be the most powerful creatures in the smoke ring happy as clams in there and about as active civilization develops to protect against the environment or against other men war would be a hopeful sign if he could know what was going on kendy could perturb the environment in a dozen different ways cast them out of eden and see what happened but he dared not he didnt know enough kendy waited chapter one quinn tuft gavving could hear the rustling as his compamons tunneled upward they stayed alongside the great flat wall of the trunk fingerthick spine branches sprouted from the trunk divided endlessly into wirethin branchiets and ultimately flowered into foliage like green cotton loosely spun to catch every stray beam of sunlight some light filtered through as green twilight gavving tunneled through a universe of green cotton candy hungry he reached deep into the web of branchlets and pulled out a fistful of foliage it tasted like fibrous spun sugar it cured hunger but what gavvings belly wanted was meat even so its taste was too fibrous and the green of it was too brown even at the edges of the tuft where sunlight fell he ate it anyway and went on the rising howl of the wind told him he was nearly there a minute later his head broke through into wind and sunlight the sunlight stabbed his eyes still red and painful from this mornings allergy attack it always got him in the eyes and sinuses he squinted and turned his head and sniffled and waited while his eyes adjusted then twitchy with anticipation he looked up gavving was fourteen years old as measured by passings of the sun behind voy he had never been above quinn tuft until now the trunk went straight up straight out from voy it seemed to go out forever a vast brown wall that narrowed to a cylinder to a dark line with a gentle westward curve to it to a point at infinityand the point was tipped with green the far tuft a cloud of browntinged green dropped away below him spreading out into the main body of the tuft looking east with the wind whipping his long hair forward gavving could see the branch emerging from its green sheath as a halfklomter of bare wood a slender fin harps head popped out and his face immediately dipped again out of the wind laython next and he did the same gavving waited presently their faces lifted harps face was broad with thick bones its brutal strength halfconcealed by golden beard laythons long dark face was beginning to sprout strands of black hair harp called we can crawl around to lee of the trunk east get out of this wind the wind blew always from the west always at gale velocities laython peered windward between his fingers he bellowed negative how would we catch anything any prey would come right out of the wind harp squirmed through the foliage to join laython gavving shrugged and did the same he would have liked a windbreak and harp ten years older than gavving and laython was nominrily in charge it seldom worked out that way theres nothing to catch harp told them were here to guard the trunk just because theres a drought doesnt mean we cant have a flash flood suppose the tree brushed a pond what pond look around you theres nothing near us voy is too close harp youve said so yourself the trunk blocks half our view harp said mildly the bright spot in the sky the sun was drifting below the western edge of the tuft and in that direction were no ponds no clouds no drifting forests nothing but bluetinged white sky split by the white line of the smoke ring and on that line a roiled knot that must be gold looking up out he saw more of nothing faraway streamers of cloud shaping a whorl of storm a glinting fleck that might indeed have been a pond but it seemed even more distant than the green tip of the integral tree there would be no flood gavving had been six years old when the last flood came he remembered terror panic frantic haste the tribe had bufrowed east along the branch to huddle in the thin foliage where the tuft tapered into bare wood he remembered a roar that drowned the wind and the mass of the branch itself shuddering endlessly gavvings father and two apprentice hunters hadnt been warned in time they had been washed into the sky laython started off around the trunk but in the windward direction he was half out of the foliage his long arms pulling him against the wind harp followed harp had given in as usual gavving snorted and moved to join them it was tiring harp must have hated it he was using claw sandals but he must have suffered even so harp had a good brain and a facile tongue but he was a dwarf his torso was short and burly his muscular arms and legs had no reach and his toes were mere decoration he stood less than two meters tall the grad had once told gavving harp looks like the pictures of the founders in the log we all looked like that once harp grinned back at him though he was puffing well get you some claw sandals when youre older laython grinned too superciliously and sprinted ahead of them both he didnt have to say anything claw sandals would only have hampered his long prehensile toes night had cut the ffluniin tion in hall seeing was easier with the sunglare around on the other side of voy the trunk was a great brown wall three klomters in circumference gavving looked up once and was disheartened at their lack of progress thereafter he kept his head bent to the wind clawing his way across the green cotton until he heard laython yell dinner a quivering black speck a point to port of windward laython said cant tell what it is harp said its trying to miss looks big itll go around the other side come on they crawled fast the quivering dot came closer it was long and narrow and moving tailfirst the great translucent fin blurred with speed as it tried to win clear of the trunk the slender torso was slowly rotating the head came in view two eyes glittered behind the beak one hundred and twenty degrees apart swordbird harp decided he stopped moving laython called harp what are you doing nobody in his right mind goes after a swordbird its still meati and its probably starving too this far in harp snorted who says so the grad the grads full of theory but he doesnt have to hunt the swordbirds slow rotation exposed what should have been its third eye what showed instead was a large irregular fuzzy green patch laython cried fluff its a bead injury that got infected with fluff the things injured harp that isnt an injured turkey boy its an injured swordbinl laython was half again harps size and the chairmans son to boot he was not easy to discipline he wrapped long strong fingers around harps shoulder and said well miss it if we wait here erguing i say we go for gold and he stood up the wind smashed at him he wrapped toes and one fist in branch lets steadied himself and semaphored his free arm hiyo swordbird meat you copsik meat harp made a sound of disgust it would surely see him waving in that vivid scarlet blouse gavving thought hopefully well miss it and then itll bepast but he would not show cowardice on his first hunt he pulled his line loose from his back he burrowed into the foliage to pound a spike into solid wood and moored the line to it the middle was attached to his waist nobody ever risked losing his line a hunter who fell into the sky might still find rest somewhere if he had his line the creature hadnt seen them laython swore he hurried to anchor his own line the business end was a grapnel hardwood from the finned end of the branch laython swung the grapnel round his head yelled and flung it out the swordbird must have seen or heard it whipped around mouth gaping triangular tail fluttering as it tried to gain way to starboard to reach their side of the trunk starving yes gavving hadnt grasped that a creature could see him as meat until that moment harp frowned it could work if were lucky it could smash itself against the trunk the swordbird seemed bigger every second bigger than a man bigger than a hutall mouth and wings and tail the tail was a translucent membrane enclosed in a v of bone spines with serrated edges what was it doing this far in swordbirds fed on creatures that fed in the drifting forests and there were few of these so far in toward voy little enough of anything the creature did look gaunt gavving thought and there was that soft green carpet over one eye fluff was a green plant parasite that grew on an nini until the animal died it attacked humi nc too everybody got it sooner or later some more than once but hnmrns had the sense to stay in shadow until the fluff withered and died laython could be right a head injury sense of direction fouled up and it was meat a mass of meat as big as the bachelors longhut it must be ravenous and now it turned to face them an isolated mouth came toward them an elliptical field of teeth expanding laython coiled line in frantic haste gavving saw harps line fly past him and tearing himself out of his paralysis he threw his own weapon the swordbird whipped around impossibly fast and snapped up gavvings harpoon like a tidbit harp whooped gavving froze for an instant then his toes dug into the foliage while he hauled in line hed hooked il the creature didnt try to escape it was still fluttering toward them harps grapnel grazed its side and passed on harp yanked trying to hook the beast and missed again he reeled in line for another try gavving was armpitdeep in branchlets and cotton toes digging deeper hands maintaining his deathgrip on the line with eyes on him he continued to behave as if he wanted contact with the killer beast he bellowed harp where can i hurt it eye sockets i guess the beast had misjudged its flank smashed bark from the trunk above their heads dreadfully close the trunk shuddered gavving howled in terror laython howled in rage and threw his grapnel ahead of it it grazed the swordbirds flank laython pulled hard on the line and sank the hardwood tines deep in flesh the swordbirds tail froze perhaps it was thinking things over watching them with two good eyes while the wind pulled it west laythons line went taut then gavving s spine branches ripped through gavvings inadequate toes then the immense mass of the beast had pulled him into the sky his own throat closed tight but he heard laython shriek laython too had been pulled loose torn branchlets were still clenched in gavving s toes he looked down into the cushiony expanse of the tuft wondering whether to let go and drop but his line was still anchored and wind was stronger than tide it could blow him past the tuft past the entire branch out and away instead he crawled along the line away from their predatorprey laython wasnt retreating he had readied his harpoon and was waiting the swordbird decided its body snapped into a curve the serrated tail slashed effortlessly through gavvings line the swordbird flapped hard making west now laythons line went taut then branchlets ripped and his line pulled free gavving snatched for it and missed he might have pulled himself back to safety then but he continued to watch laython poised with spear ready his other arm waving in circles to hold his body from turning as the predator flapped toward him almost alone among the creatures of the smoke ring men have no wings the swordbirds body snapped into a u its tail slashed laython in half almost before he could move his spear the beasts mouth snapped shut four times and laython was gone its mouth continued to work trying to deal with gavvings harpoon in its throat as the wind carried it east the scientists hut was like all of quinn tribes huts live spine branches fashioned into a wickerwork cage it was bigger than some but there was no sense of luxury the roof and walls were a clutter of paraphernalia stuck into the wickerwork boards and turkey quills and red tuftberry dye for ink tools for teaching tools for science and relics from the time before men left the stars the scientist entered the hut with the air of a blind man his hands were bloody to the elbows he scraped at them with handfuls of foliage talking under his breath damn damn drillbits they just burrow in no way to stop them he looked up grad day who were you talking to yourself yes he scrubbed at his arms ferociously then hurled the wads of bloody foliage away from him martals dead a drillbit burrowed into her i probably killed her myself digging it out but shed have died anyway you cant leave drillbit eggs have you heard about the expedition yes barely i cant get anyone to tell me anything the scientist pulled a handful of foliage from the wall and tried to scrub the scalpel clean he hadnt looked at the grad what do you think the grad had come in a fury and grown yet angrier while waiting in an empty hut he tried to keep that out of his voice i think the chairmans trying to get rid of some citizens he doesnt like what i want to know is why me the chairmans a fool he thinks science could have stopped the drought then youre in trouble too the grad got it then you blamed it on me the scientist looked at him at last the grad thought he saw guilt there but the eyes were steady i let him think you were to blame yes now there are some things i want you to have incredulous laughter was his answer what more gear to carry up a hundred klomters of trunk grad jeffer what have i told you about the tree weve studied the universe together but the most important thing in it is the tree didnt i teach you that everything that lives has a way of staying near the smoke ring median where theres air and water and soil everything but trees and men integral trees have a way i taught you i had the idea you were only guessing oh i see youre willing to bet my life the scientists eyes dropped i suppose i am but if im right there wont be anything left but you and the people who go with you jeffer this could be nothing you could all come back with whatever we need breeding turkeys some kind of meat animal living on the trunk i dont know but you dont think so no thats why im giving you these he pulled treasures from the spinebranch walls a glassy rectangle a quarter meter by half a meter flat enough to fit into a pack four boxes each the size of a childs hand the grads response was a musical oooh youll decide for yourself whether to tell any of the others what youre carrying now lets do one last drill session the scientist plugged a cassette into the reader screen you wont have much chance to study on the trunk plants life pervades the smoke ring but is neither dense nor massive in the freefall environment plants can spread their greenery widely to catch maximum sunlight and passing water and soil without bothering about structural strength we find at least one exception these integral trees grow to tremendous size the plant forms a long trunk under terrific tension tufted with green at both ends stabilized by the tide they form thousands of radial spokes circling levoys star they grow up to a hundred kilometers in length with up to a fifth of a gee in tidal gravity at the tufs and perpetual hurricane winds the winds derive from simple orbital mechanics they blow from the west at the inner tuft and from the east at the outer tuft the structure bows to the winds curving into a nearly horizontal branch at each end the foliage sifts fertilizer from the wind the medical dangers of life in freefall are well known if discipline has indeed abandoned us if we are indeed marooned within this weird environment we could do worse than to sfitle the tufts of the integral trees if the trees prove more dangerous than we anticipate escape is easy we need only jump and wait to be picked up the grad looked up they really didnt know very much about the trees did they no but jefier they had seen trees from outside that was an awesome thought while he chewed it the scientist said im afraid you may have to start training your own grad and soon jayan sat crosslegged coiling lines sometimes she looked up to watch the children they had come like a wind through the commons and the wind had died and left them scattered around clave he wasnt getting much work done though it seemed he wa trying the girls loved clave the boys imitated him some just watched others buzzed around him trying to help him assemble the harpoons and the spikes or asking an endless stream of questions what are you doing why do you need so many harpoons and all this rope is it a hunting trip i cant tell you clave said with just the proper level of regret king where have you been youre all sticky king was a happy eightyearold painted in brown dust we went underside the foliage is greener there tastes better did you take lines those branches arent as strong as they used to be you could fall through and did you take a grownup with you jill nine had the wit to distract him whens dinner were still hungry arent we all clave turned to jayan weve got enough packs we wont be carrying food well find water on the trunk claw sandals jet pods im glad we got those hope weve got enough spikes what else do we need is jinny back no what did you send her for anyway rocks i gave her a net for them but shell have to go all the way to the treemouth i hope she finds us a good grindstone jayan didnt blame the children she loved clave too she would have kept him for herself if she could if not for jinny sometimes she wondered if jinny ever felt that way mmm well pick some foliage before we leave the tuft jayan stopped working clave i never thought of that theres no foliage on the trunk we wont have anything to eat well find something thats why were going clave said briskly thinking of changing your mind too late jayan said she didnt add that she had never wanted to go at all there was no point now i could bust you loose jinny too the citizens like you they wouldnt let i wont stay not with mayrin and the chairman here and clave gone she looked up and said mayrin claves wife stood in the halfshadows on the far side of the cornmona she might have been there for some time she was seven years older than dave a stocky woman with the square jaw of her father the chairman she called clave mighty hunter what game are you play ing with this young woman when you might be finding meat for the citizens orders she approached smiling the expedition my father and i arranged it together if youd like to believe that feel free the smile slipped copsik youve mocked me too long dave you and them i hope you fall into the sky i hope i dont clave said mildly would you like to assist our departure we need blankets better have an extra nine fetch them yourself mayrin said and stalked away here in the main depths of quinn tuft there were tunnels through the foliage huts nestled against the vertical flank of the branch and the tunnels ran past now harp and gavving had room to walk or something like it in the low tidal pull they bounced on the foliage as if it and they were made of air the branchiets around the tunnels were dry and nude their foliage stripped for food changes the days had been longer before the passing of gold it used to be two days between sleeps now it was eight the grad had tried to explain why once but the scientist had caught them at it and whacked the grad for spilling secrets and gavving for listening harp thought that the tree was dying well harp was a teller and worldsized disasters make rich tales but the grad thought so too and gavving felt like the world had ended he almost wanted it to end before he had to tell the chairman about his son he stopped to look into his own dwelling a long halfcylinder the bachelors longhut it was empty quinn tribe must be gathered for the evening meal were in trouble gavving said and sniffled sure we are but theres no point in acting like it if we hide we dont eat besides weve got this harp hefted the dead musrum gavving shook his head it wouldnt help you should have stopped him i couldnt when gavving didnt answer harp said four days ago the whole tribe was throwing lines into a pond remember a pond no bigger than a big hut as if we could pull it to us we didnt think that was stupid till it was gone past and nobody but clave thought to go for the cookpot and by the time he got back i wouldnt send even clave to catch a swordbird twentytwenty harp jeered the taunt was archaic but its meaning was common any fool can foresee the past an opening in the cotton the turkey pen with one gloomy turkey still alive there would be no more unless a wild one could be captured from the wind drought and famine water still ran down the trunk sometimes but never enough flying things still passed meat to be drawn from the howling wind but rarely the tribe could not survive on the sugary foliage forever did i ever tell you harp asked about glory and the turkeys no gavving relaxed a little he needed a distraction this was twelve or thirteen years back before gold passed by things didnt fall as fast then ask the grad to tell you why cause i cant but its true so if shed just fallen on the turkey pen it wouldnt have busted but glory was trying to move the cookpot she had it clutched in her arms and it masses three times what she does and she lost her balance and started running to keep it from hitting the ground then she smashed into the turkey pen it was as if shed thought it out in detail the turkeys were all through the clump and into the sky we got maybe a third of them back that was when we took glory off cooking duties another hollow a big one three rooms shaped from spine branches empty gavving said the chairman must be almost over the fluff its night harp answered night was only a dimming while the far arc of the smoke ring filtered the sunlight but a cubic klomter of foliage blocked light too a victim of fluff could come out at night long enough to share a meal hell see us come in gavving said i wish he were still in confinement there was firelight ahead of them now they pressed on gavving sni ing harp trailing the musrum on his line when they emerged into the commons their faces were dignified and their eyes avoided nobody the commons was a large open area bounded by a wickerwork of branchiets most of the tribe formed a scarlet circle with the cookpot in the center men and women wore blouses and pants dyed with the scarlet the scientist made from tuftberries and sometimes decorated with black that red would show vividly anywhere within the tuft children wore blouses only all were uncommonly silent the cookflre had nearly burned out and the cookpotan ancient thing a tall transparent cylinder with a lid of the same material retained no more than a double handful of stew the chairmans chest was still halfcovered in flufl but the patch had contracted and turned mostly brown he was a squarejawed brawny man in middle age and he looked unhappy irritable hungry harp and gavving went to him handed him their catch food for the tribe harp said their catch looked like a fleshy mushroom with a stalk half a meter long and sense organs and a coiled tentacle under the edge of the cap a lung ran down the center of the stalk body to give the thing jet propulsion part of the cap had been ripped away perhaps by some predator the scar was halfhealed it looked far from appetizing but societys law bound the chairman too he took it tomorrows breakfast he said courteously wheres laython lost harp said before gavving could say dead the chairman looked stricken how then wait eat first that was common courtesy for returning hunters but for gavving the waiting was torture they were given scoopedout seedpods containing a few mouthfuls of greens and turkey meat in broth they ate with hungry eyes on them and they handed the gourds back as soon as possible now talk the chairman said gavving was glad when harp took up the tale we left with the other hunters and climbed along the trunk presently we could raise our heads into the sky and see the bare trunk stretching out to infinity my son is lost and you give me poetry harp jumped your pardon there was nothing on our side of the trunk neither of danger nor salvation we started around the trunk then laython saw a swordbird far west and borne toward us on the wind the chairmans voice was only halfcontrolled you went after a swordbird there is famine in quinn tuft weve fallen too far in too far toward voy the scientist says so himself no beasts fly near no water trickles down the trunk am i not hungry enough to know this myself every baby knows better than to hunt a swordbird well go on harp told it all keeping his language lean passing lightly over laythons disobedience letting him show as the doomed hero we saw laython and the swordbird pulled east by the wind along a klomter of naked branch then beyond there was nothing we could do but he has his line he does he may find rest somewhere the chairman said a forest somewhere another tree he could anchor at the median and go down well hes lost to quinn tribe at least harp said we waited in the hope that laython might find a way to return to win out and moor himself along the trunk perhaps four days passed we saw nothing but a musrum borne on the wind we cast our grapnels and i hooked the thing the chairman looked ill with disgust gavving heard in his mind have you traded my son for musrum meat but the chairman said you are the last of the hunters to return you must know of todays events first martal has been killed by a drillbit martal was an older woman gavvings fathers aunt a wrinkled woman who was always busy too busy to talk to children she had been quinn tribes premier cook gavving tried not to picture a drillbit boring into her guts and while he shuddered the chairman said alter five days sleep we will assemble for martals last rites second the council has decided to send a full hunting expedition up the trunk they must not return without a means for our survival gavving you will join the expedition youll be informed of your mission in detail after the funeral chapter two leavetaking the treemouth was a funnelshaped pit thickly lined with deadlooking naked spine branches the citizens of quinn tuft nested in an arc above the nearly vertical rim fifty or more were gathered to say goodbye to martal almost half were children west of the treemouth was nothing but sky the sky was all about them and there was no protection from the wind here at the westernmost point of the branch mothers folded their babes within their tunics quinn tribe showed like scarlet tuftberries in the thick foliage around the treemouth martal was among them at the lower rim of the funnel flanked by four of her family gavving studied the dead womans face almost calm he thought but with a last lingering trace of horror the wound was above her hip a gash made not by the drillbit but by the scientists knife as he dug for it a drillbit was a tiny creature no bigger than a mans big toe it would fly out of the wind too fast to see strike and burrow into flesh leaving its gut as an expanding bag that trailed behind it if left alone it would eventually burrow through and depart tripled in size leaving a clutch of eggs in the abandoned gut looking at martal made gavving queasy he bad lain too long awake slept too little his belly was already churning as it tried to digest a breakfast of musrum stew harp edged up beside him shoulderhigh to gavving im sorry he said for what though gavving knew what he meant you wouldnt be going if laython wasnt dead you think this is the chairmans punishment all right i thought so too but wouldnt you be going harp spread his hands uncharacteristically at a loss for words youve got too many friends sure i talk good that could be it you could volunteer have you thought of the stories you could bring back harp opened his mouth closed it shrugged gavving dropped it he had wondered and now he knew harp was afraid i cant get anyone to tell me anything he said what have you heard good news and bad nine of you supposed to be eight you were an afterthought the good news is just a rumor claves your leader clove himself maybe now it could still be true that the chairmans getting rid of anyone he doesnt like he daves the top hunter in the tuft hes the chairmans soninlaw but hes not living with mayrin aside from that id be guessing what its too complicated i could even be wrong and harp drifted off the smoke ring was a line of white emerging from the pale blue sky narrowing as it curved around in the west far down the arc gold was a clot of streaming embattled storms his gaze followed the arm around and down and in until it faded out near voy voy was directly below a blazing pinpoint like a diamond set in a ring it was all sharper and clearer than it had been when gavving was a child voy had been dimmer then and blurred at the passing of gold gavving had been ten years old he remembered hating the scientist for his predictions of disaster for the fear those predictions raised the shrieking winds had been terrible enough but gold had passed and the storms had diminished the allergy attack had come days later this present drought had taken years to reach its peak but gavving had felt the disaster at once blinding agony like knives in his eyes runny nose tightness in his chest thin dry air the scientist said some could tolerate it some could not gold had dropped the trees orbit he was told the tree had moved closer to voy too far below the smoke ring median gavving was told to sleep above the treemouth where the rivulets ran that was before the rivulets had dwindled so drastically the wind too had become stronger it always blew directly into the treemouth quinn thit spread wide green sails into the wind to catch anything that the wind might bear water dust or mud insects or larger creatures all were filtered by the finely divided foliage or entangled in the branchiets the spine branches migrated slowly forward west along the branch until gradually all was swallowed into the great conical pit even old huts migrated into the treemouth to be crushed and swallowed and new ones had to be built every few years everything came to the treemouth the streams that ran down the trunk found an artificial catchbasin above but the water reached the treemouth as cookwater or washwater or when citizens came to rid themselves of body wastes to feed the tree martals cushion of spine branches had already carried her several meters downslope her entourage had retreated to the rim to join alfin the treemouth custodian children were taught how to care for the tree when gavving was younger his tasks had included carrying collected earth and manure and garbage to pack into the treemouth removing rocks to use elsewhere finding and killing pests he hadnt liked it muchalfin was a terror to work underbut some of the pests had been edible he remembered earthlife crops were grown here too tobacco and maize and tomatoes they had to be harvested before the tree swallowed them but in these dark days passing prey were all too rare even the insects were dying out there wasnt food for the tribe let alone garbage to feed the insects and the tree the crops were nearly dead the branch was nude for half its length it wasnt growing new foliage alfin had had care of the treemouth for longer than gavving had been alive that sour old man hated half the tribe for one reason or another gavving had feared him once he attended all funerals but today he truly looked bereaved as if he were barely holding his grief in check day was dimming the bright spot the sun was dropping blurring soon enough it would brighten and coalesce in the east meanwhile yes here came the chairman carefully robed and hooded against the light attended by the scientist and the grad the grad a blond boy four years older than gavving looked unwontedly serious gavving wondered if it was for martal or for himself the scientist wore the ancient falling jumper that signified his rank a twopiece garment in pale blue illfitting with pictures on one shoulder the pants came to just below the knees the tunic left a quarter meter of grayfurred belly after untold generations the strange glossy cloth was beginning to show signs of wear and the scientist wore it only for official functions the grad was right gavving thought suddenly the old uniform would fit harp perfectly the scientist spoke praising martals last contribution to the health of the tree reminding those present that one day they must all fulfill that obligation he kept it short then stepped aside for the chairman the chairman spoke of martals bad temper he said nothing of her skill with the cookpot he said a good deal he spoke of another loss of the son who was lost to quinn tuft wherever he might be he spoke long and gavvings mind wandered four young boys were all studious attention but their toes were nipping at a copter patch the ripe plants responded by launching their seedpods tiny blades whirring at each end the boys stood solemnly in a buzzing cloud of copters treemouth humor others were having trouble suppressing laughter but somehow gavving couldnt laugh hed had four brothers and a sister and all had died before the age of six like too many children in quinn tuft in this time of famine they died more easily yet he was the last of his family everything he saw today squeezed memories out of him as if he were seeing it all for the last time its only a hunting party his jumpy belly knew better hero of a single failed hunt how would gavving be chosen for a lastditch foraging expedition vengeance for laython were the others being punished too who were the others how would they be equipped when would this endless funeral be over the chairman spoke of the drought and the need for sacrifice and now his eye did fall on selected individuals gavving among them when the long speech ended martal was another two meters downslope the chairman departed hurriedly ahead of the brightening day gavving made for the commons with all haste equipment was piled on the web of dry spine branches that quinn tribe called the ground harpoons coils of line spikes grapnels nets brown sacks of coarse cloth half a dozen jet pods claw sandals a reassuring stack of what it would take to keep them alive except food he saw no food others had arrived before him even at a glance they seemed an odd selection he saw a familiar face and called gradi are you coming too the grad loped to join them right i had a hand in plsiinning it he confided a bouncy happy type in a traditionally studious profession the grad had come armed with his own line and harpoon he seemed eager full of nervous energy he looked about him and said oh treefodder now what is that supposed to mean nothing he toed a pile of blankets and added at least we wont go naked hungry though maybe there s something to eat on the trunk thered better be the grad had long been gavvings friend but he wasnt much of a hunter and merril merril would have been a big woman if her tiny twisted legs had matched her torso her long fingers were callused her arms were long and strong and why not she used them for everything even walking she clung to the wicker wall of the commons impassive waiting onelegged jiovan stood beside her with a hand in the brauchiets to hold him balanced gavving could remember jiovan as an agile reckless hunter then something had attacked him something he would never describe jiovan had returned barely alive with ribs broken and his left leg torn away the stump tourrnquetted with his line four years later the old wounds still hurt him constantly and he never let anyone forget it glory was a bigboned homely woman middleaged with no children her clumsiness had given her an unwanted fame she blamed harp the teller for that and not without justice there was the tale of the turkey cage and he told another regarding the pink scar that ran down her right leg gained when she was still involved in cooking duties the hate in alfins eyes recalled the time shed clouted him across the ear with a branchwood beam but it spoke more of alfins tendency to hold grudges gardener garbage man funeral director he was no hunter let alone an explorer but he was here no wonder hed looked bereaved glory waited crosslegged eyes downcast alfin watched her with smoldering hate merril seemed impassive relaxed but jiovan was muttering steadily under his breath these his companions gavving s belly clenched agonizingly on the musrum then clave entered the commons briskly with a young woman on each arm he looked about him as if liking what he saw it was true clave was coming they watched him prodding the piled equipment with his feet nodding nodding good he said briskly and looked about him at his waiting companions were going to have to carry all this treefodder start dividing it up youll probably want it on your back moored with your line but take your choice lose your pack and ill send you home the musruin loosed its grip on gavvings belly clave was the ideal hunter built long and narrow two and a half meters of bone and muscle he could pick a man up by wrapping the fingers of one hand around the mans head and his long toes could throw a rock as well as gavvings hands his companions were jayan and jinny twins the dark and pretty daughters of martal and a longdead hunter without orders they began loading equipment into the sacks others moved forward to help alfin spoke i take it youre our leader right just what are we supposed to be doing with all this we go up along the trunk we renew the quinn markings as we go we keep going until we find whatever it takes to save the tribe it could be food on the bare trunk clave looked him over weve spent all our lives along two klomters of branch the scientist tells me that the trunk is a hundred klomters long maybe more we dont know whats up there whatever we need it isnt here you know why were going were being thrown out alfln said nine fewer mouths to feed and look at who dave rode him down he could outshout thunder when he wanted to would you like to stay alfin he waited but alfin didnt answer stay then you explain why you didnt come im coming alflns voice was almost inaudible dave had made no threats and didnt have to they had been assigned anyone who stayed would be subject to charges of mutiny and that didnt matter either if clave was going then alfin was wrong and gavvings stomach had been wrong too they would find what the tribe needed and they would return gavving set to assembling his pack clave said weve got six pairs of claw sandals jayan jinny grad gavving ill take the extras well find out who else needs them everyone take four mooring spikes take a few rocks i mean it you need at least one to hammer spikes into wood and you may want some for throwing has everybody got his dagger it was night when they pulled themselves out of the foliage and they still emerged blinking the trunk seemed infinitely tall the far tuft was almost invisible blurred and blued almost to the color of the sky clave called take a few minutes to eat then stuff your packs with foliage we wont see foliage again for a long time gavving tore off a spine branch laden with green cotton candy he stuck it between his back and the pack and started up the trunk dave was already ahead of him the bark of the trunk was different from the traveling bark of the branch there were no spine branches but the bark must have been meters thick with cracks big enough to partly shield a climber smaller cracks made easy grip for fingers gavving wasnt used to claw sandals he had to kick a little to seat them right or they slipped his pack tended top him over backward maybe he wanted it lower the tide helped it pulled him not just downward but against the trunk too as if the trunk sloped the grad was moving well but puffing maybe he spent too much time studying but gavving noted that his pack was larger than the others was he carrying something besides provisions merril had no pack just her line she managed to keep up using her arms alone jiovan with two arms and a leg was overtaking clave himself though his jaw was clenched in pain jayan and jinny above gavving on the thick bark stopped as by mutual accord they looked down they looked at each other they seemed about to weep a sudden futile surge of homesickness blocked gavvings own throat he lusted to be back in the bachelors hut clinging to his bunk face buried in the foliage wall the twins resumed their climb gavving followed they were moving well dave thought he was still worried about merril shed slow them down but at least she was trying shed find it easier moving with just two arms when they got near the middle of the trunk there would be no tide at all there things would drift without falling if the scientists smoke dreams were to be believed alfin alone was still down there in the last fringes of tuft clave had expected trouble from alfin but not this alfin was the oldest of his team pushing forty but he was muscular healthy appeal to his pride he called down do you need claw sandals aifin alfin may have considered any number of retorts what he called back was maybe ill wait jiovan take the lead clave worked his pack open while alfin moved up to join him alfin was climbing with his eyes halfshut something odd there something wrong i was hoping you could at least keep up with merril clave said handing alfin the sandals alfin said nothing while he strapped one on then whats the difference were all dead anyway but it wont do that copsik any good hes only got rid of the lames who the chairman our precious chairman when people are starving theyll kick out whoevers in charge hes kicked out the lames the ones who couldnt hurt him anyway let him see what he can snag when they kick him into the sky if you think im a lame see if you can outclimb me clave said lightly everyone knows why youre here you and your women too oh i suppose they do clave said but if you think youd like living with mayrin you can try it when we get back i couldnt and she didnt like that and her father didnt like it either but you know she was really built to make babies when i was just old enough to notice that alfin snorted i meant what i said clave told him if theres anything left that can save the tribe its somewhere over our heads and if we find it i think i could be chairman myself what do you think startled aim peered into claves face maybe power hungry are you i havent quite decided lets say im just mad enough to go for gold this whole crazy well jayan and jinny they can take care of themselves and if they cant i can but i had to take merril before the chairman would give me jet pods and then at the last minute he wished gavving on me and that was the last straw gavving wasnt much worse than the other kids ive had to train constantly asking questions i dont know any two people with that boys curiosity not the point hes just starting to show beard he never did anything wrong except be there when that damn fool laython got swallowed skip it alfin some of our party is dangerous to the rest you know it how would you handle that it was rare to see alfin smiling he took his time answering merril will kill herself sooner or later but glory will kill someone else slip at the wrong time easy enough to do something about it wait till were higher till the tide is weaker knock against her when shes off balance send her home the fast way well thats what i was thinking too you are a danger to us alfin you hold grudges weve got problems enough without watching our backs because of you if you slow me down if you give any of us trouble ill send you home the fast way alfin ive got enough trouble here allin paled but he answered you do get rid of glory before she knocks someone off the trunk ask jiovan i dont take your orders clave said one more thing you spend too much energy being angry save it youre likely to need your anger now lead off and when alfin resumed climbing clave followed chapter three the trunk day brightened and faded and brightened again while they climbed the men doffed their tunics and tucked them into their pack straps somewhat later so did the women dave leered at jayan and jinny impartially gavving didnt leer but in fact the sight distracted him from his climbing jayan and jinny were twentyyearold twins identical with pale skin and dark hair and lovely heartshaped faces and nicely conical breasts some citizens called them stupid for they had no fund of conversation but gavving wondered in other matters they showed good sense as now jinny was climbing with cave but merril had dropped far behind and jayan stayed just beneath her pacing her jiovan had lost ground after clave resumed the lead he cursed as he climbed steadily monotonously the wind the bark handholds his missing leg alfin should have been one of the leaders gavving thought but he kept pausing to look down gavvings own shoulders and legs burned with fatigue worse he was mpking mistakes setting his claw sandals wrong so that they slipped too often tired people make mistakes gavving saw glory slip thrash and fall two or three meters before she caught an edge of bark while she hugged herself ferociously against the tree gavving moved crosswise until he was behind and to the side of her fear held her rigid keep going gavving said ill stay behind you ill catch you she looked down nodded jerkily began climbing again she seemed to move in convulsions putting too much effort into it gavving kept pace she slipped gavving gripped the bark when she dropped into range he planted the palm of his hand under her buttocks and pushed her hard against the tree she gasped and clung and resumed climbing clave called down is anybody thirsty they needed their breath and the answer was too obvious of course they were thirsty clave said swing around east well get a drink falling water had carved a channel along the eastern side of the trunk the channel was fifty meters across and nearly dry over most of its watersmoothed surface but the tree still passed through the occasional cloud mist still clung to the bark wind and coriolis force set it streaming around to the east as it fell and water ran in a few pitiful streams toward quinn tuft below watch yourselves clave told them use your spikes if you have to this is slippery stuff here the grad called from over their heads they worked their way toward him a hill of rock must have smacked into the tree long ago half embedding itself the trunk had grown to enclose it it made a fine platform particularly since a stream had split to run round it on both sides by the time merril and jayan had worked their way up clave had hammered spikes into the wood above the rock and attached lines merril and jayan worked their way onto the rock mcml lay gasping while jayan brought her water glory lay flat on the rock with her eyes closed presently she crawled to the portside stream she called to clave any limit what on how much we drink the water goes clave laughed loudly like the chairman hosting a midyear celebration he bellowed drink bathe have water fights whos to stop us if quinn tribe didnt want their water secondhand we wouldnt be here he worked their single cookpot from his pack and threw streams of water at selected targets merril who whooped in delight jiovan who sputtered in surprise jayan and jinny who advanced toward him with menace in their eyes i dare not struggle on this precarious perch he cried and went limp they rolled him in the stream hanging onto his hands and feet so that he wouldnt go over they climbed in a spiral path they werent here just to climb clave said but to explore gavving could hear jiovans monotonous cursing as they climbed into the wind until the wind drowned him out gavving reached up for a fistful of green cotton and stuffed it in his mouth the branch that waved above his pack was nearly bare now the sky was empty out to some distant streamers of cloud and a dozen dots that might be ponds all hundreds of klomters out theyd be hurting for food when sleeptinie came he was crossing a scar in the bark a puckering that ran down into the wood itself an old wound that the bark was trying to heal big enough to climb in but it ran the wrong way abruptly the grad shouted stop hold it up whats the matter clave demanded the quinn tribe markings without the grad to point it out gavving would never have realized that this was writing he had seen writing only rarely and these letters were three to four meters across they couldnt be read they had to be inferred dq with a curlicue mark across the d well have to gouge this out the grad said its nearly grown out someone should come here more often dave ran a critical eye over his crew gavving alfin jinny start digging grad you supervise just dig out the q leave the d alone the rest of you rest merril said i can work for that matter i could carry more tell me that tomorrow clave told her he made his way across the bark to clap her on the shoulder if you can take some of the load youll get it lets see how you do tomorrow with your muscles all cramped up they carved away bark and dug deeper into the wood with the points of their harpoons the grad moved among them the q took shape when the grad approached him gavving asked why are the letters so big you can hardly read them theyre not for us you could see them if you were a klomter away the grad said alfin had overheard where falling are we doing this for swordbirds and triunes to read the grad smiled and passed on without answering alfin scowled at his back then crossed to gavvings position is he crazy maybe but if you cant dig as deep as jinny the mark will look silly to the swordbirds he tells half a secret and leaves you hanging alfin complained he does it all the time they left the tribal insignia carved deep and clear into the tree the wind was beating straight down on them now gavving felt a f mii r pain in his ears he worked his jaw while he sought the old memory and when his ears popped it came pressure pain in his ears a score of days after the passing of gold the night before his first allergy attack these days he rarely wondered if he would wake with his eyes and sinuses streaming in agony he simply lived through it but hed never wakened on the vertical slope of the tree he pictured himself climbing blind that was what distracted him while a thick woodcolored rope lifted from the bark to wrap itself around glorys waist glory yelped gavving saw her clinging to the bark with her face against it refusing to look the rope was pulling her sideways away from him gavving pulled his harpoon from his pack before he moved he crawled around glory toward the living rope glory screamed again as her grip was torn loose now only the live rope itself held her from falling he didnt dare slash it instead he scampered toward its source while the rope coiled itself around glory spinning her reeling her in there was a hole in the tree from the blackness inside gavving saw a thickening of the live rope and a single eye lifting on a stalk to look at him he jabbed at it a lid flicked closed the stalk dodged gavving tracked it he felt the jar through his arm and shoulder as the harpoon punched through a huge mouth opened and screamed the living rope thrashed and tried to fling glory away what saved glory was glory hersell she had plunged her own harpoon through the brown hawser and gripped the point where it emerged she clung to the haft with both hands while the rope bent around to attack gavving the mouth was lined with rows of triangular teeth gavving pulled his harpoon loose from the eye with a twist as if he had practiced all his life he jabbed at the mouth trying to reach tlje throat the mouth snapped shut and he struck only teeth he jabbed at the eye again something convulsed in the dark of the hole the mouth gaped improbably wide then a black mass surged from the hole gavving flung himself aside in time to escape being smashed loose a hutsized beast leapt into the sky on three short thick legs armed with crescent claws short wings spread a claw swiped at him and missed gavving saw with amazement that the rope was its nose he had thought it was trying to escape ten meters from its den it turned with astonishing speed gavving shrank back against the bark with his harpoon poised the beasts wings flapped madly in reverse pulling it back against its stretching nose futilely the foray team had arrived in force lines wrapped glory and trapped the creatures rope of a nose lines spun out to bind its wings clave was screaming orders he and jinny and the grad pulled strongly turning the beast clawsoutward from the tree in that position it was reeled in until harpoons could reach its head gavving picked a spot and jabbed again and again drilling through bone then redgray brain he never noticed when the thing stopped moving he only came to himself when dave shouted gavving glory dinners on you you killed it you clean it you killed it you clean it was an easy honor to dodge you only had to admit that your prey had hurt you jayan and jinny worked at building a fire in the creatures lair they worked swiftly competently almost without words as if they could read each others minds the others were outside chopping bark for fuel gavving and glory moored the corpse with lines and spikes just outside the hole and went to work the grad insisted on helping strictly speaking he didnt have the right but he seemed eager and glory was tired they worked slowly examining the peculiar thing they had killed it had a touch of trilateral symmetry like many creatures of the smoke ring the grad said a smaller third wing was placed far back a steering fin the forward pair were motive power and ears holes below each wing showed as organs of hearing when the grad cut into them the wings could be cupped to gather sound it was a digger those little wings would barely move it everything in the smoke ring could fly in some sense but this one would prefer to dig a hole and ambush its prey even its trunk wasnt all that powerful the grad searched until he found the sting that had been in its tip the size of an index finger it was embedded in glorys pack glory nearly fainted they kept the claws dave would use them to tip his grapnels they cut steaks to be broiled and passed to the rest who by now were moored on spikes outside they set bigger slabs of meat to smoke at the back of the wooden cave gavving realized that his eyes were blurry with exhaustion glory was streaming sweat he put his arm over her shoulders and announced we quit good enough dave called in take our perches alfin lets carve up the rest daves team was well fed overfed they drifted on lines outside the cave meat smoked inside the carcass mostly bones now had been set to block the entrance dave said citizens give me a status report how are we doing is anyone hurt i hurt all over jiovan said and scowled at the chorus of agreement all over is good glory did that thing break any of your ribs i dont think so bruises uhhuh clave sounded surprised nobodys fallen off nobodys hurt have we lost any equipment there was a silence gavving spoke into it clave what are you doing here were exploring the trunk and renewing the quinn markings and stopping a famine maybe todays catch is a good first step gavving was prepared to drop it but alfin wasnt the boy means what are you doing here you the mighty hunter why did you go out to die with the lames there was muttering perhaps but no overt reaction to the word lame clave smiled at aiim turn it around quinn tribes custodian of the treemouth why was the tribe able to spare you the west wind had softened as they climbed but it was still formidable it blew streamers of smoke past the carcass alfin forced words from himself the chairman thought it was a good joke and nobody nobody wanted to speak up for me nobody loves you alfin nodded and sighed as if a burden had been lifted from him nobody loves me your turn gavving grinned clave was stuck and he knew it he said mayrin doesnt love me i traded her in for two prettier more loving women mayrin is the chairmans daughter thats not all of it and you know it if you know better than i do then keep talking dave said reasonably the grad can back me up he knows some tribal history when things go wrong when citizens get unhappy the leaders in trouble the scientist himself almost got drafted the chairman is scared thats what the citizens are hungry and theres an obvious replacement for the chairman dave hes scared of you grad the scientist knows what hes doing he blamed it all on you alfin cried i was there i know he had his reasons the grad noticed the silence and laughed no i didnt cause the drought we rounded gold and gold swung us too far in toward voy down to where the smoke ring thins out its a gravity effect many thanks for explaining it all clave said with cheerful sarcasm gavving was irritated and a bit relieved nobody else understood the grads gibberish either is there anything else we should settle into the silence gavving said how do we cause a flood there was some laughter dave said grad forget it itd solve everybodys problems even the chairmans this is silly well floods come when a pond brushes the tree somewhere on the trunk a lot of water clings to the trunk the tide pulls it down usually we get some warning from a hunting party and we all scurry out along the branch the big flood ten years ago most of us got to safety but the waterfall tore away some of the huts and most of the earthlife crops and the turkey pens it was a year before we caught any more turkeys and i wish wed have another flood the grad said sure i do the scientist thinks the whole treenever mind you cant catch a pond were too far into the gas torus region there gavving said and pointed east and out toward a metalcolored dot backed by rosy streamers of cloud i think its bigger than it was what of it itll come or it wont if it did come floating past what would you do throw lines and grapnels forget it just forget it enough clave said that meats probably done lets get the smoke out and get inside gavving woke in the night and wondered where he was he half remembered the sounds of groans someone in pain it had stopped now sound of wind sound of many people breathing warm bodies all around him rich smells of smoke and perspiration aches everywhere as if hed been beaten a womans voice spoke near his ear are you awake too and another a mans yes let me sleep alfin silence and gavving remembered the cave was just large enough to accommodate nine exhausted climbers after they flung the nosearms bones into the sky by now the offal might have reached quinn tuft to feed the tree they huddled against each other flesh to flesh gavving had no way to avoid eavesdropping when aim spoke again though his voice was a whisper i cant sleep everything hurts glory me too did you hear groaning clave and jayan i think and believe me theyre feeling no pain oh good for them glory why are you talking to me i was hoping we could be friends just dont climb near me all right all right im afraid youll knock me off alfin arent you afraid to be so high i ani pause im afraid of falling off id be crazy not to be there was quiet for a time gavving began to notice his own aching muscles and joints they must be keeping him awake but he was dozing when alfin spoke again the chairman knew it knew what he knows im afraid of falling thats why the copsik bastard kept sending me under the branch on hunts nothing solid under me trying to hang on and throw a harpoon too i got even though how glory asked while gavving thought so did the chairman never mind glory will you lie with me a strained whisper no alfin we cant be alone did you have a lover back in the tuft most of us didnt nobody to protect us when the chairman thought this up a pause as for thought i still cant not here alfins voice rose to a shout clave clave you should have brought a masseuse clave answered from the darkness i brought two treefodder alfin said without heat perhaps with amusement presently there was quiet chapter four flashers and fan fungus in the morning they hurt some showed it more than others alfin tried to move grunted in pain curled up with his face buried in his arms merrils face was blank and stoic as she flexed her arms then rose onto her hands jayan and jinny commiserated with each other massaging each others pains away on jiovans face amazement and agony as he tried to move then a look of betrayal thrown in claves direction from glory wildeyed panic gavving tapped her shoulder blade we all hurt cant you tell what are you worried about you wont be left behind nobodys got the strength her eyes turned sane she whispered i wasnt thinking that i was thinking i hurt thats normal isnt it sure youre not crippled though thank you for taking care of me yesterday im really grateful im going to get better at this i promise the grad spoke without trying to move well all get better the higher we get the less we weigh pretty soon well be floating dave trod carefully among citizens who were awake but not mobile gavvmg felt a stab of envy anger clove didnt hurt from the back of the nosearms burrow he selected a slab of smoked meat ragged with harpoon wounds take your time over breakfast he instructed them eat its the easiest way to carry provisions and we burned a lot of energy yesterday the grad said he moved like a cripple to join dave and began tearing into a meters length of what had been the nosearms rib it made sense to gavving and he joined them the meat had an odd rank flavor you could get used to it he thought if your life depended on it clave moved among them gnawing at his huge slab of meat he sliced a piece off and made merril take it he listened to jiovan describing his symptoms then interrupted with youve got your wind back thats good now eat handing him more of the steak he cut the rest in half for jayan and jinny and spent a minute or two doing massage on their shoulders and hips they winced and groaned presently when all had eaten something clave looked around at his team well circle to the east and get water half a day after we start theres no room in here to do warmup exercises well just have to start moving so saddle up citizens well have to feed the tree in the open and whether you actually feed the tree is up to the tide and the wind alfin take the lead alfin led them on an upward spiral counterclockwise gavving found his aches easing as they climbed he noticed that alfin never looked down not surprising if alfin didnt give a damn for those following himbut he never looked down gavving did and marveled at their progress two extended hands would have covered all of quinn tuft they delayed to repair the q in a x mark the sun had been horizontal in the east when they started it was approaching voy before they reached watersmoothed wood a rivulet flowed down a meandering groove this time there was no natural perch nine thirsty citizens pounded spikes into the wood and hung by their lines to drink wash soak their tunics and wring them out gavving noticed dave speaking to alfin a little way below he didnt hear what was said he only saw what alfin did and suppose i dont then you dont clave gestured upward where the rest of them hung look at them i didnt choose them what do i do if one of my citizens turns out to be a coward i live with it but i have to know alfin looked white with rage not red with fury there isnt any white with rage white means fear as dave had learned long ago a frightened man can kill but alfins hands were clenched on his line and claves harpoon was over his shoulder easily reached i have to know i cant put you in the lead if you cant make yourself look down to see how theyre doing see ill have to put you where you dont hurt anyone else if you funk it tailend chancy and if you freeze i want to be sure nobody all right alfin dug in his pack produced a spike and a rock he pounded the spike in beside the one he was hanging from make sure you can depend on it its your life the second spike was in deeper than the first alfin tied the loose end of his line to both spikes and knotted it again and i leave you next to it you take that chance too or you dont i have to know aim leapt straight outward trailing loops of line he thrashed then threw his arms over his face he fell slowly were all lighter gavving realized its real i thought i was just feeling better but were lifting lessand alfin was still falling but now hed uncovered his face his arms windmilled to turn him on his back gavving noticed claves hand covering the spikes that moored alfins line the line pulled taut and swung alfin in against the tree gavvmg watched him climb up and watched him jump again limbs splayed out as if he were trying to fly it seemed he might make it he fell so slowly but presently the tide was pulling him down against the tree again that actually looks like fun jayan said jinny said ask first alfin didnt jump again when he had climbed back up to claves position and both had climbed to rejoin the team jinny spoke can we try that alfin sent her a look like a harpoon clave said no time to get moving saddle up alfin was in the lead again when they set out he made a point of pausing frequently to look back and gavving wondered yesterday alfin had swarmed all over the nosearm hacking like a berserker maniac like gavving himself it was hard to believe that allin was afraid of clave or of heights or of anything the sun circled the sky behind voy and back to zenith before they came to lee again the watersmoothed wood was soft here soft enough that they could cross with a spike in each hand jab and yank and jab they veered down to avoid scores of birds clustered on the wood scarlettailed the birds were otherwise the grayishbrown of the wood itself when they reached the rivulet it was smaller yet but it was enough they hung in the water and let it cool them and run into their faces and mouths clave shared out smoked meat gavving found himself ravenous the grad watched the birds as he ate presently he burst out laughing look theyve got a mating dance going so youll see presently gavving did see and so did others judging by daves bellowing laugh and the giggles from jayan and jinny a graybrown male would approach a female and abruptly spread his gray wings like a cloak under the gray was brilliant yellow and a tube protruding from a splash of crimson feathers the scientist told me about them once flashers said the grad his smile died as he said i wonder what they eat what difference does it make alfin demanded maybe none the grad made his way upward toward the birds the birds flew off then returned to dive at him shrieking obscenities the grad ignored them presently he returned aliin asked well the woods riddled with holes riddled the holes are full of insects the birds dig in and eat the insects youre in love alfin challenged youre in love with the idea that the trees dying id love to believe it isnt the grad said but alfin only snorted they spiraled around to the western side while the sun dipped beneath voy and began to rise again the wind was less ferocious now but they were getting tired there was almost no chatter they rested frequently in crevasses in the hark they were resting when mcml called jinny im hung up a pincer the size of claves fist gripped the fabric of merrils nearly empty pack merril pulled back against it from a hole in the bark there emerged a creature covered in hard brown segmented plates its face was a single plate with a deeply inset eye the body looked soft behind the last plate jayan slashed where its body met the bark the creature separated it still clung to merrils pack with idiot determination jayan levered the claw open with her harpoon and dropped the creature into her own pack when they had circled round to water again clave set water to boiling in the small lidded pot he made tea refilled the pot and boiled merrils catch it made one bite each for his team they wedged themselves into a wide crack with the shape of a lightningstroke and moored themselves with lines together but separate head to foot within the bark they had no chance to converse and no urge four days of climbing since breakfast left them too tired for anything but sleep at waking they ate more of the smoked meat lets look for more of those hardshelled things clave suggested that was good he didnt have to urge them to get moving he never would gavving realized as long as they couldnt sleep where water flowed this time jiovan was given the lead he took them on a counterclockwise spiral that brought them back to lee within half a day again the wood was soft and riddled with holes and flashers swarmed below them alfin and glory tended to lose ground in the leeward regions jiovan remarked on it and earned a look of dull hatred from alfin the thing was that alfin took more care setting his spikes than the rest did and glory didnt so she lost time slipping and catching herself they moored themselves in the stream and drank and washed alfin spotted something far above them gray nubs reaching out from the bark on both sides of the rivulet he climbed doggedly pounding spikes into the wood and caine back with a fanshaped fungus pale gray with a red frill half the size of his pack it could be edible he said clave asked are you willing to try it no he started to throw it away merril stopped him were here to keep the tribe from starving she said she broke a redandgray chunk from the fringe and ate a meager mouthful not much taste but its nice the scientist would like it you could chew it with no teeth she took another bite alfin broke off a piece of the grayish white inside and ate that looking as if he were taking poison he nodded tastes okay at which point there were more volunteers but dave vetoed that when they departed clave veered upward to pick a bouquet of the fanshaped fungi a metersquare fan rode like a flag above his pack the sun was rising up the east it was below voyyou could look straight down along the trunk past the green fuzzball that was quinn tuft and see voys bright spark at the fringe of the soft sunglowand the west wind was blowing almost soffly across the ridges of the bank when gavving heard merril shout who needs legs she was holding herself an armslength from the bark by a onehanded grip he shouted down merril are you all right i feel wonderful she let go and began to fall and reached out and caught herself the grad was right we can fly gavving crawled toward her jinny was already below her pounding in a spike when gavving reached them jayan was using the spike for support with her line ready in her other hand they pulled merril back against the tree she didnt resist she crowed gavving why do we live in the tuft theres food here and water and who needs legs lets stay we dont need any nosearm cave we can dig out our own weve got nosearm meat and those shelled things and the fan fungus ive eaten enough foliage to last me the rest of my life but if anyone wants it well send down someone with legs well have to be careful of that fan fungus gavving thought he was pounding spikes into bark on the other side of merril jiovan was doing the same where was clave clave was with alfin high above them in furious inaudible argument come on lets get going what are you doing merril demanded while gavving and jiovan bound her to the bark or listen ive got a wonderful idea lets go back weve got what we want well kill another nosearm and we well grow fan fungus in the tuft then set up another tribe here claaave she bellowed as dave and alfin climbed down into earshot how would i do as chairman of a colony youd be terrific citizens well be here for a while moor yourselves dont do any flying i never thought it could be this good merril told them my parentswhen i was little they were just waiting for me to die but they wouldnt feed me to the treemouth i thought about it too but i never did im glad sometimes i thought of me as an example something people need to be happy happy they have legs even one leg she whispered hoarsely to jiovan legs so what jiovan asked clave how long do we have to put up with this you dont take ah take the grad and find us a better place to sleep jiovan looked about him like what a cave a crack or a bulge in the bark anything thats better than hanging ourselves here like smoking meat ill go too alfin said you stay dave you do not have to treat me like a baby i only ate from the middle of the thing i feel fine so does merril what never mind you feel grouchy and thats fine merril feels fine and thats alfin i am so glad you didnt stop me from coming merril smiled radiantly at him in that moment gavving thought her beautiful thank you for trying though feel sleepy merril said and went to sleep alfin saw questioning eyes he spoke reluctantly i i thought i could talk the chairman out of this idiocy sending a a legless woman up the tree clave i do feel fine wideawake hungry id like to try some more dave removed a fan from his pack he tore away some of the scarlet fringe then offered alfin a handsized piece of the white interior if alfin flinched it was for too short a time to measure he ate the whole chunk with a theatrical relish that had clave grinning clave broke off the rest of the red fringe and pouched it separately jiovan and the grad returned they had found a rq mark overgrown with fungus like a field of gray hair infected well have to burn it out the grad said suppose it keeps on burning we dont have any water clave said never mind lets have a look jayan jinny stay with merril one of you come get me if she wakes up they examined the fungus patch dubiously scraping out all that gray hair would be a dull job clave pulled up a wad and set fire to it it burned slowly sullenly lets try it but get some of our packs emptied in case we have to beat it out the fungus patch burned slowly the west wind wasnt strong at this height and the smoke tended to sit within the fungus hairs smothering the fire it kept putting itself out yet it crept around in glowing fringes restarting itself they had to back away as foulsmelling smoke built up in the vicinity the smoke was dissipating gavving moved in and found most of the fungus gone the rest left as black char the q was two meters deep clave made a torch from a chunk of bark and burned out some remaining patches scrape that out and i think we can all sleep in it gavving jinny you go back for merril when they started to move her merril woke instantly happy and active and bubbling with plans they coaxed her across the bark ready for anything and presently moored her in the scrapedout bottom of the q then there was nothing for it but to settle into the q for early sleep merril slept like a baby but others shifted restlessly desultory conversations started and stopped presently dave asked jiovan how are you doing how do you mean i mean the whole trip how are you doing jiovan snorted im hungry i hurt a lot but im used to that i can climb do you mean how are we doing we wont know that till we get home merrils out of her head right now but she could be right too clave was startled you mean live here no thats crazy i mean go back now kill something and smoke it and collect more fan fungus and go home wed be heroes as much as any hunt party that comes home with meat and i dont mind telling you im ready im treefeeding sick of being one of thethe lames i used tobethe one whofedthe tribe and if thefan fungus will grow in the tuft by now the whole troop was listening dave knew he was talking for an audience he said merril could be pretty sick you know she feels great oh lets see how she feels when it wears off i might want to try it myself dave chuckled he was hoping it would drop there no chance not with aifin listening what about going home weve got what we came for i dont think so we sure havent scraped out all the tribemarks have we grad theyre supposed to run all along the trunk then lets go at least as far as the middle we already know we can feed ourselves who knows what else well find the nosearm was good eating but weve only found one and we couldnt feed him in the tuft we can pick up some fan fungus on the way back what else are the flashers good to eat could we transplant those shelled things the grad was catching fire get them growing just above the tuft it might work sure id like to go on i want to see what its like when there isnt any tidal force at all we already know what merril would say anyone else alfin grunted nobody else spoke we go on clave said chapter five memories it was there again there was a special frequency of light that sharis davis kendy had sought for five hundred years he had found it fiftytwo years ago and fortyeight and twenty and six certain sightings and another ten probable the locus moved about this time it was west of his position barely filtering through the soup of dust and gas and dirt and plant life the light of hydrogen burning with oxygen kendy held his attention on a wavering point within the smoke ring rarely did the carm even acknowledge that his signal had penetrated the maelstrom but he never considered not trying kendy for the state kendy for the state the carjvis main motor would run for hours now it would accelerate slowly too slowly pushing something massive what were they doing in there had they entirely forgotten discipline and sharls davis kendy kendy had forgotten much but what remained to him was as vivid as the moment it had happened these futile attempts at contact needed little of his attention kendy took refuge in memory the target star was yellowwhite with a spectrum very like sols circling an unseen companon at solar masses t was minutely brighter and bluer than sol about go or the companion at half a solar mass would be a star not a planet it should at least have been visible the state bad telescopic data from earlier missions to other stars there was at least a third planetsized body in this system there might be a planet resembling the primordial earth in which case discipline would fulfill its primary mission by seeding its atmosphere with oxygenproducing algaes on a distant day the statewould return to find a world ripe for colonization but someone would have come anyway to probe the strangeness of this place discipline was a seeder ramship targeted for a ring of yellow stars that might host worlds like the primordial earth its secondary mission was a secret known only to kendy but exploration was a definite third on the list discipline would not stop here kendy would skim past t take pictures and records and vanish into the void he might slow enough to drop a missile with a warhead of tailored algae if a target world could be found four of the crew were in the control module they had the telescope array going and a watery picture of a yellowwhite star on the big screen with a pinpoint of fierce bluewhite light at its edge sam goldblatt had a spectrum of t displayed on a smaller screen sharon levoy was lecturing for the record nobody else was listening that solves thal levoys star is an old neutron star half a billion to a billion years beyond its pulsar stage its still hotter than hell but its only twenty kilometers across the radiating surface is almost negligible it must have been losing its spin and its residual heat for all of that time we didnt see it because it isnt putting out enough light the yellow dwarf star might have planets but we can expect that their atmospheres were boiled away by the supernova event of which levoys star is the ashes goldblatt snarled were supposed to be the first expedition here prikazyvat kendy the crew were not supposed to be aware that the ships computer and its recorded personality could eavesdrop on them therefore kendy said hello sam whats up sam goldblatt was a large round man with a bushy carefully tended moustache hed been chewing it ever since levoy found and named the neutron star now his frustration had a target kendy do you have records of a previous expedition well check me out those are absorption lines for oxygen and water here arent they which means theres green life somewhere in that system doesnt it and that means the state sent a seeder here i noticed the spectrum after all sam why shouldnt plant life develop somewhere on its own earths did besides those lines cant represent an earthlike world theyre too sharp theres too much oxygen too much water kendy if it isnt a planet what is it well learn that when were closer mph not at this speed kendy i think we should slow down decelerate to the minimum at which the bussard ramjet will work we wont waste onboard fuel well get a better look and we can accelerate again when weve got the solar wind for fuel dangerous said kendy i recommend against it and that should have been that for five hundred and twelve years kendy had been editing clumps of experience from his memory wherever he decided they werent needed he didnt remember deciding to follow goldblatts suggestions goldblatt must have persuaded captain quinn and the rest of the crew and kendy had given in to them or to his own curiosity kendy remembered levoys star and t circled a common point in eccentric orbits at a distance averaging x lo kilometers with an orbital period of earth years the neutron star had been behind the yellow dwarf while discipline backed into the system now it emerged into view of disciplines telescope array he saw a ring of white cloud touched with green with a bright spark at its center the spectral absorption lines of water and oxygen were coming from there it was tiny by astronomical standards the region of greatest density circled the neutron star at kilometersabout four times the radius of the earth like a christmas wreath claire dalton breathed the sociologists body was that of a pretty leggy blonde but her corpsicle memories reached far back and what was she doing on the bridge captain dennis quinn might have invited her the way they were standing to gether it indicated a laxity in discipline that kendy would have to watch the crew of discipline continued to study the archaic christmas wreath until sam goldblatt suddenly crowed goldblatts worldl prikazyvat kendy record that goldblatts world theres a planet in there im not close enough to probe that closely sam it has to be there you know how a gas torus works it was there in kendys memory yes i dont doubt youre right i can bounce some radar off that storm complex when we pass pass hell weve got to stop and investigate this thing goldblatt looked about him for support green means life life and no planet weve got to know all about it claire dennis you see that dont you the crew included twelve citizens and eight corpsicles the corpsicles might argue but they had no civil rights and the citizens had less than they thought for reasons of morale kendy maintained the fiction that they were in charge goldblatts suggestion was not worth considering kendy said think weve got fuel to decelerate once and once only well need it when we reach earth theres water in there dennis quinn said thoughtfully we could refuel i bet the waters rich in deuterium and tritium why not its circling the ashes of a supernova claire dalton was gazing at the screen at a perfect smoke ring with a tiny hot pinpoint in its center the neutron star has cooled off lost most of its rotation and most of its heat and most of that ferocious magnetic field the pulsars have its bright but its too small to be giving off much real heat we could probably live in there ourselves she looked around her isnt this what we came for the strangeness of the universe if we dont stop now we might as well be back on earth the contempt in her voice was unmistakable kendys memory jumped at that point hardly surprising that must have been the true beginning of mutiny he remembered reviewing and updating his files on gas torus mechanics two planets circled wide around the twin stars jupiterstyle gas giants with no moons the old supernova must have blasted away anything smaller a body did circle the neutron star one limb of the smoke ring was curdled a distorted whirlpool of storm hidden within was a core of rock and metals at earth masses there was sme oxygen and some water vapor in its thick hot atmosphere goldblatts world was tidally locked and uninhabitable strip away its atmosphere and it might have harbored earthly lifebut its atmosphere was tremendous dwindling indefinitely into the smoke ring itself the strong oxygenwater lines were coming from the gas torus a gas torus is the result of a light mass in orbit around a heavy mass as titan orbits saturn it may be that the light mass is too weak to hold its atmosphere the faster molecules of air escapebut they go into orbit about the heavy mass thus titan circles saturn within a ring of escaped titanian atmosphere as lo orbits jupiter within a ring of sulfur ionized by jupiters ferocious magnetic field a gas torus is thin the gas must be so rarefied that each molecule can be considered to be in a separate orbit it must reasonably expect to circle halfway round the primary mass without bumping another molecule under such circumstances a gas torus is stable the occasional stray photon will bump a molecule into interstellar space but the molecules are continually reencountering the satellite body titansmaller than mars no larger than ganymedecarries an atmosphere of refined smog at one and a half times earths sea level pressure the atmosphere is continually being lost of course but some of it continually returns from the gas torus levoys star was an extreme case and a slightly different proposition too the smoke ring was the thickest part of the gas torus around levoys star at its median it was as dense as earths atmosphere a mile above sea level too dense for stability it must be continually leaking into the gas torus but the gas torus was stable dense but held within a steep gravitational gradient molecules continually returned from the gas torus to the smoke ring and from the smoke ring to the storm of atmosphere surrounding goldblatts world goldblatts world must have started life as a gas giant planet like say saturn probably it didnt fall into range until the pulsar had lost a good deal of its heat and spin sharon levoys crisp voice spoke within kendys memory then it was captured by strong roche tides it may have dropped close enough to lose water and soil as well as gas for something like a billion years goldblatts world has been leaking gas into the smoke ring and the smoke ring has been leaking to interstel lar space its not stable exactly but hell planets arent stable over the long run it wont be stable that much longer dennis quinn interrupted most of goldblatts world is already gone ten million years or a hundred million and the smoke ring will be getting rarefied kendy remembered these things the records had been made while disciplines instruments probed the smoke ring from close range already some of the crew were exploring the smoke ring via carms their reports were enthusiastic there was life dnabased the air was not only breathable but tasted fine kendy didnt remember bringing discipline into orbit around levoys star he must have expended his onboard fuel postponing by several years his arrival at the target stars along his course why claire daltons voice weve got to get out of this box its running down a little of what we recycle is lost every time around theres more than water in there theres air theres probably even fresh fertilizer for the hydroponics tanks it was sharis davis kendy who ruled discipline disciplines crew of twenty was hardly necessary to run a seeder ramship the state had chosen them as a reservoir of humanity a tiny chunk of the state far removed from any local disaster one planet one solar system were too fragile to ensure the survival of the state or humankind itself every ship in the sky had a crew large enough to begin the human race over again their secondary mission if it ever became necessary the state expected no such disaster ever but the investment was trivial compared to the reward when had he lost control perhaps they had threatened to bypass the computer and go to manual control they couldnt but morale would disintegrate if they ever learned how little control they really had kendy might have surrendered on that basis or he might have been curious he did not remember any part of what must have been a mutiny he must have been played for a fool he might not want to remember that the crew had departed with eight of the ten carms and rifled the hydroponics to boot it should never have been allowed he was reasonably sure that seven of the carms were inoperable some equipment might have been salvaged and the last carm had now ceased its spray of incandescent water vapor kendy ceased beaming his message the smoke ring glowed white and featureless beneath him one day he would know would they remember him at all kendy waited chapter six middle ground the patch of oldmanshair should have been tended long since it was fifty to sixty meters across and had eaten half a meter deep into live wood parasol plants had rooted in the resulting compost and matured and spread their brightly colored blossoms to attract passing insects minya watched the fire spread in intersecting curves within the fungus patch breezes tossed the choking smoke in unpredictable directions the smoke drove clouds of mites out of the fungus and into the open she was wishing thanyas triad would arrive with water there were three triads of the triune squad now on the trunk minya sal and smitta were nearing the median jeels triad traversed up and down the trunk ferrying provisions from the tuft while thanyas brought water from the lee fire was usually no problem but mistakes could happen i love these climbs smitta said she floated with her toes gripping an edge of bark this close to the median it was enough to hold her against the feeble tide i like floating and where else can you see the entire smoke ring minya nodded she didnt want to talk when a problem couldnt be solved and wouldnt go away what could one do but run she had run as far as a human being could go it was working she felt at peace here halfway between infinities the tree seemed to run forever in both directions the dark tuft backlit by voy and the sun was a halo of green fluff with a black core outward daltonquinn tuft was barely larger a few drifting clouds wisps of green forest whorls of storm were all outward eastward was a point of bright light offcenter in a dark rim the same small pond that had been drifting tantalizingly closer for a score of days maybe maybe it would come they didnt talk about it bad luck between the drought and the recent political upsets it had been too long since the triune squad had been free for treetending duty they had been needed as police one could hope that the executions had settled the troubles but now the triads were finding parasites and patches of oldmanshair everywhere on the trunk today they were burning virtually a field of the horrid stuff motion caught minyas eye outward and windward blueagainstblue hard to see something big the sun was nearly at nadir glaring up she held a hand beneath her eyes and squinted and presently said triune smitta snapped alert interested in us sal sal sang out from behind the smoke cloud i see it minya said theyre interested theyre pretty close already smitta had pulled herself against the trunk and was readying her weapons i fought a triune once theyre smarter than swordbirds you can scare them off just remember if we kill one well have to kill all three the torpedoshaped object was closer now it was nearly the blue of the sky slowly rotating six big eyes showed in turn around the circumference and three great gauzy fins one smaller than the other that would be the juvenile minya whispered what do we need bows and arrows ready tether your arrow and scoop up some burning oldmanshair on the point lucky we had a fire going know where your jet pods are you may need them minya could feel her heart pulsing in her throat it was her second trip up the trunk but smitta and sal had been up many times they were tough and experienced sal was a burly redhaired fortyyearold who had joined the triune squad at age twelve smitta had been born a man she was a woman by courtesy stay clear of smftta minya told herself smitta was slow to anger but under pressure something could snap in her mind then smitta fought like a berserker even among her own and the only way to at her was to pile on her minya strung her hardwood bow and used an arrow point to dig a gob of burning fungus ready the torpedo split in three three slender torpedoes flapped laz toward them showing small lateral fins and violentorange bellies male and a female forever mated plus a single juvenile who would on body mass fast then mature more slowly they divided only to ht or fight the triune squad itself was named for the triune famil interdependence the juvenile would be the smallest the one hanging back a little t adults swept forward aim for the male smitta said and loosed the line trailing c behind the arrow which was male minya waited a moment to jud smittas target then loosed her own weapon she judged that u werent in range yet and she was right the males body rippi him free of the arrows paths while the female bored in sal had hi back now she loosed and the veering female caught an arrow in fin she bellowed she flapped once and the arrow snapped free appeared from the smoke yanked into the sky it didnt seem to boti her as she reeled in her ancient metal bow slung safe over her should the smoldering oldmanshair had been left on the females tail a she was flapping madly smitta sent a tethered arrow winging at the juvenile both adults screamed the female tried to block the arrow too sb the juvenile didnt seem to see the arrow coming smitta yanked at i line and stopped it a meter short the female gaped the women were reeling frantically but it wasnt necessary i adults moved in alongside the infant inilnitely graceful small has reached out from their orange bellies to pull them together tb moved away like a single blurred blue ghost against the blue sky see theyre smart you can reason with them smitta said sal pulled a teardropshaped jet pod from one of the cluster of po eta that ran down and across the front of her tunic she twisted the t a cloud of seeds and mist spurted away from her thrusting sal be toward the bark she coiled line and stowed her weapons including the valuable be springy met it was handed down from old to young within the i une squad for at least two hundred years will done troops but i think the fire is getting to the wood i wish thanya would get here she couldnt have missed us could she to minyas eye the fire might have reached wood by now or not hard to tell where oldmanshair shaded over into rotted wood its not bad yet she said i hate to waste jet pods but treefodder i want to look for them sal decided she gathered her legs under her hands gripping the bark to brace herself and jumped she waved her arms to p herself around until she could see the trunk they watched her drift along the trunk out toward daltonquinn tuft she worries too much smitta said seventy days had passed since claves citizens had departed quinn tuft the tree fed a myriad parasites and the parasites fed claves team they had killed another nosearm easily chopping through its nose then jabbing harpoons into its den there were patches of fan fungus everywhere merril had slept a full eight days after eating from the red fringe of a fan fungus the subsequent throbbing headache didnt seem to affect her climbing and presently it went away so the fan fungus served them as food and they had found more of the shelled burrowers and other edibles the grad saw it all as evidence of the trees decline they had found a jet pod bush like a mass of bubbles on the bark clave had packed a dozen ripe pods in a pouch of scraped nosearm hide they had taken to camping just outside the waterwashed wood clave laughed and admitted that they should have been doing that all along theyd slept three times more on the tree last night in a nosearms den twice before in deep wounds in the wood cracks overgrown with fuzz that had to be burned out first the char had turned their clothing black they had learned not to try to boil water the bubbles just foamed it out in a hot expanding mass tidal gravity continued to decrease until they were almost floating up the trunk merril loved it recovering from the fan fungus hadnt changed that you couldnt fall youd just yell for help and someone would presently throw you a line glory loved it and alfin smiled sometimes but there were penalties now water had grown scarce too there was no wind this high and thus no leeward stream of water sometimes you found wet wood wet enough to lick dry there was water in fan fungus flesh here was the i mark jinny had found good it looked nearly clean and half a klomter farther up the trunk a fanshape showed like a white hand against the sky it must be huge the grad pointed dinner clave said well find smaller ones around it but wouldnt it look grand merril asked coming into the commons the grad was pulling himself toward the tribal mark when clave said hold it what this mark isnt overgrown like the others were grad doesnt it look funny to you tended theres some fuzz growing but maybe not enough then the grad was close enough to see the real discrepancy theres no takeout mark citizens this isnt quinn territory gavving and jiovan had been left behind to tend the smokefire hardlearned lessons showed here bark torn from the rim of a patch of fuzz served as fuel healthy bark resisted fire a circle of coals surrounded the meat all open to the fitful breezes a sheltered fire wouldnt burn the smoke wouldnt rise it would stay to smother the fire even here in the open the smoke hovered in a squirming cloud the heat of burning stayed in the smoke so the fire didnt need to be large gavving and jiovan stayed well back a shift in the breeze could smother an incautious citizen the meat should be rotated soon it was gavvings turn but it didnt have to be done instantly jiovan what even gavving wouldnt ask jiovan how he lost his legnobody would but one thing about that tale had bothered him for years and he asked why were you hunting alone that day nobody hunts alone i did okay topic closed gavving drew his harpoon he pulled air into his lungs then lunged into the smoke halfblind he reached over the coals with the harpoon butt to turn the nosearm legsone two three he yanked hard on his line to pull himself into open air smoke came with him and he took an instant to fan it away before he drew breath jiovan was looking in past the small green tuft that had once enclosed his life into the bluish white spark that was voy his head came up and gavving faced a murderous glare this l nt something id want told around gavving waited all right ive got i had a real gift for sarcasm they tell me when i was leading a hunt well the boys were there to learn of course and i was there to teach if someone made a mistake i left him in no doubt gavving nodded pretty soon they were giving me nothing but the fumblers i couldnt stand it so i started hunting alone i shouldnt have asked it used to bother me forget it gavving was trying to forget something else entirely this last sleep period he had wakened to find three citizens missing hed followed a sound and watched clave and jayan and jinny moor lines to the bark and leap outward and make babies while they drifted what lived in his head now was lust and envy balanced by fear of claves wrath or jinnys scorn he might as well dream any serious potential mate was back in quinn tuft and gavving couldnt offer anyway he hadnt the wealth or the years that would change of course he would return as a hero as for the chairmans wrath he hadnt been able to send harp possibly clave could have resisted him too if they could end the famine the chairman could do nothing they would be heroes gavving could have his choice of mates so i was hunting alone jiovan said the day glory busted open the turkey pen for an instant gavving couldnt imagine what jiovan was talking about then he smiled harps told that tale ive heard him i was down under the branch that day with one line to tether me and another loose nibbling a little foliage with my head sticking down into the sky you know just waiting it was full night at the new years occlusion the sun was a wide bright patch shining up at me and voy drifting right across the center here came a turkey flapping against the wind still moving pretty fast and backward i put a net on my free line quick and threw it the turkeys caught here comes another one ive got more nets and in two breaths ive got a turkey on each end but here come two more then four and theyre coming from above and by now i can guess theyre ours i throw the end of the line im moored to and i get a third turkey good throwing gavving said oh sure there wasnt anything wrong with my throwing that day but the sky was full of turkeys and most of them were going to get away and i still thought it was kind of hilarious reali thats why i never told this story before gavving suddenly guessed what wascoming i can live with it if you dont want to finish no thats okay it was funny jiovan said seriously but the sky was full of turkeys and a triune family came to do something about all that meat on the wing they split up and went after the loose turkeys there wasnt a thing i could do but pull in my three jiovan certainly wasnt smiling now the male went after one of my turkeys swallowed it whole and tried to swim away it got the wrong line picture one end of a line spiked deep in the branch and that massive beast pulling on the other and me in a loop in the middle i suddenly saw what was happening and i pulled the loop open and tried to jump out and the loop snicked shut and my leg was ripped almost off and i was falling into the sky treefodder i thought i was treefodder all right remember i still had a line in my hands but with a turkey on each end flapping like crazy and i was falling i tried throwing a turkey i really did i thought it might get caught in the branchlets but it didnt meanwhile the triune males been caught by something and it doesnt know what it pulls back against the line and feels a tug in its belly and throws up i think thats what must have happened all i know is something smacks me in the face and its a dead turkey covered with goo and i grab iti hug it to me with all my heart and climb the line back into the tuft gavving was afraid to laugh then i tie off whats left of my leg whats hanging loose i had to cut off well kid did harp ever tell you a story like that no treefodder hed love it oh hed make me famous i dont want to be fanious that way gavving chewed it over why tell me now i dont know my turn jiovan said suddenly he filled his lungs and disappeared into the smoke gavving felt burdened always he asked too many questions he grinned guiltily picturing jiovan trying to throw a line with a turkey flapping at each end but what if jiovan regretted telling it he saw clave appear from behind the curve of the tnmk jiovan emerged bringing smoke and gavving held his breath while it cleared jiovan coughed a little its been so long he said maybe it doesnt hurt as much maybe i just wanted to tell it maybe i had to theyre coming back gavving said i wonder whats got them so excited clave bellowed i will not go home without learning something about them i know quite a lot about them the grad answered we all lived in the far tuft once the quinns left after some kind of disagreement before that it was daltonquinn tribe then theyre relatives the argument had grown a little less chaotic but only because half the troop was trailing back it was no less vehement alfin shouted youre not listening they kicked us out for all we know they think theyre still at war with us the grad said clave the tribemarks are tended and we arent finding as many fan fungi lately or the shelled things either im thinking they keep this stretch of trunk clean they must be still around our move is to get out of here you want to run from something you havent even seen we saw the tribal insignia the grad said dq no takeout mark across the q maybe they still call themselves daltonquinn what does that make us intruders on their tree weve passed the median anyway were in their space clave lets go home kill another nosearm pick some fan fungus and one of the shells and go home with plenty of food clave was shaking his head the tribe wont have to go thirsty any more either we bring water from the trunk clave waved it away that water would get to the tuft anyway no i want to meet the daltons its been hundreds of years we dont know what theyre like maybe they know better tending methods for the earthlife or ways to get water maybe they grow food we never heard of something day jiovan day whats going on we found a tribemark and it isnt ours the question before the citizenry is do we say hello before going home or do we just run the grad jumped in dont you see we cant fight and we cant negotiate weve got one good fighter and two cripples and a boy and four women and a treemouth tender and all of us thrown out of quinn tuft we cant even make promises clave broke in alfin youre for leaving too jiovan what are we running from maybe nothing that mark wasnt tended for a long time treefodder the drought could have killed them off we could settle the far tuft merril broke in though she was puffing from the climb oh no if everyone died there we wont want to go anywhere near it sickness are you for going back or going on i dont back i guess but lets get that big fan fungus first wouldnt that impress the citizens and smoke another nosearm if we can far as that goes we know theres meat to be hunted on the trunk we should tell the chairman that jayan jinny she makes sense jinny said and jayan nodded gavving no opinion treefodder glory go back glory said i havent tasted foliage in days and days clave sighed ff was sure i was right wed go on aaall right his voice became fuller more resonant well have enough to carry anyway what with the giant fan and whatever meat we find citizens weve done very well for ourselves and quinn tuft we go home as heroes now i dont want to lose anyone on the way down so dont take the tide for granted itll get stronger with every klomter most of the way down well need lines for the meat and the fan fungus their goals had become claves own gavving noticed and remembered the flashers had come back minya watched them at their mating dance two males strutted before the same femhle with their wingcloaks spread wide and the females head snapped back and forth almost too fast to see decisions decisions somethings been worrying you woman decisions was it any of smittas business minya made a swift decision she had to talk to someone or burst ive started wondering ifif im right for the triune squad smitta showed shock really you were eager enough to join eight years ago whats changed i dont know but she did and suddenly smitta did too dont talk to sal about this she wouldnt understand i was only fourteen you looked older more mature and maybe the loveliest recruit we ever got minya grimaced every man in the tuft wanted to make babies with me i must have heard every possible way of saying that i just didnt want to do that with anyone smitta thats what the triune squad is for i know what would i be without the triune squad a woman born as a man a man who wants to be a woman do you ever want what was the right word not make babies not for smitta i used to smitta said with risherhe was a lot prettier once and lately with mik the huntmasters boy minya flinched maybe smitta noticed we give all that up when we join you just have to hold it inside you know that does anyone ever what quit cheat alse jumped into the sky a little after i joined but nobody really knows why thats the only way to quit if you get caught cheating i can name some would tear you apart sals one tight lips and clenched teeth held back minyas secret now smitta did notice dont get caught cheating she repeated maybe you dont know how citizens feel about us they tolerate us we wont give the tribe babies so we do the most dangerous jobs anyone can think of and pay the debt that way but you dont ask any ordinary man to you know help you be in both worlds minya nodded lips pressed together teeth clenched if only she had kept them that way when she was with mik mik had been impossible to get rid of eight years ago how had he changed so much would he tell smitta drop it sals coming minya looked there were four figures down there four women rising on jets of sprayed gas and seeds and they carried no water sal shouted something the wind snatched away theyre wasting jet pods smitta observed they were closer now and in range to snag the bark this time minya heard sals joyful bellow invaderrrsss chapter seven the checkers hand t two triads moved inward staying in cracks in the bark where they could every minute or so denisse a tall dark woman of thanyas triad would pop up look around fast and drop back into the bark we counted six of them around the tribemark thanya said dark clothes maybe theyre from the dark tuft intruders on the tree sals voice was eager joyful weve never fought invaders there were some citizens thrown out for mutiny long ago some of them killed the chairman and the rest went with them maybe they settled in the dark tuft mutineers tbanya what kind of weapons were they carrying we couldnt go ask them could we denisse says she saw things like giant arrows i couldnt even tell their sexes but one had no legs they veered to avoid a crack clogged with oldmanshair smitta said six of them six of us you may have missed a few shall we send someone back for jeels triad sal grinned wolfishly no and no said thanya for her triad minya said nothingher triad leader spoke for herbut she felt a fierce joy right now there was nothing she needed more than a fight denisse dropped back from her next survey her voice was deadly calm intruders we have intruders three hundred meters in and a hundred to port moving outward at least six lets go slow thanya said suddenly id like to question one we dont know what they want here do we care what they want isnt theirs thanya grinned back were not a debating team were the triune squad lets go look they worked their way along the bark presently denisse poked her head up dropped back intruders have reached the checkers hand clearing the trunk of parasites was one of the triune squads duties fan fungi were dangerous to the tree and edible besides but one large and perfect fan had special privileges found twentyodd years ago it had been left to grow even larger minya had only heard of the squads unusual pet she eased her head above the bark they were there men women looking entirely human more than six eight nine dressed like dirty civilians sooty red clothes no pockets theyre chopping at the stalld theyre killing it the checkers hand smitta screamed and launched herself across the bark no help for it now sal cried go for gold and the triune squad leapt toward the intruders the fan fungus reached out from the trunk like a tremendous hand white with red nails its stalk disproportionately narrow and fragilelooking from a distance was still thicker than gavvings torso he set to chopping at it with his dagger jiovan worked the other side well get it down the trunk jiovan puffed but how will we ever get it through the tuft to the commons maybe we dont said clave bring the tribe to the fungus let them carve off pieces to suit themselves tear the fringe off first merril said the grad objected the scientist will want some of the red part and try it on who oh all right save some fringe for the scientist not a lot though the stalk was tough theyd made some progress but gavvings arms were used up he backed away and clave took over gavving watched the cut deepen maybe theyd weakened it enough he pounded a stake into the bark and tethered his line to it then he leapt at the fungus with the full strength of his legs the great hand bent to his weight then sprang back flipping him playfully into the sky floundering gathering in his line he saw what the others had missed through being too close to the trunk fire what where outward half a klomter maybe doesnt look big the sun was behind the out tuft leaving the trunk somewhat shadowed he could see an orange glow within a cloud of smoke a flicker at the corner of his eye he pulled hard at the line before his forebrain had registered anything at all and a miniature harpoon zipped past his hip he yelled treefodder not specific enough harpoons jiovan was stumbling indecisive a sharp point showed behind his shoulder blade clave was slapping shoulders and buttocks to send his citizens to cover something sailed past at a distance a woman a burly redhaired woman garbed in purple with pockets clustered from breasts to hips giving her a look of lumpy pregnancy she flew loose through the sky while she pulled something apart with both hands something that glittered a line of light their eyes met and gavving knew it was a weapon even before she let it snap shut he clutched the bark and rolled something came as a tiny blur thudded into the bark alongside his spine a miniharpoon with gray and yellow flasher feathers at the butt end he rolled again to put the fan fungus between them clave was nowhere in sight purpleclad enemies sailed along the wall of bark yelling gibberish and throwing death the redhaired woman had a harpoon through her leg she tore it loose cast it away and sought a target she picked the easiest jiovan who wasnt even trying to seek cover he took a second miniharpoon through his chest they were using jet pods a lean purpleclad man spotted gavving he pulled his weapon apart and a string snapped he screamed in rage and opened a jet pod to hurl him down at gavving his other hand waved a meterslength of knife gavving leapt out of his way drew his knife yanked at the line to pull himself back the man smacked into the bark gavving was on his back before he could recover he slashed at the mans throat inhumanly strong fingers sank into his arm like a swordbirds teeth gavving shifted his own grip and jabbed his knife into the mans side hurry the grip relaxed the tree shuddered gavving didnt notice at once he was shuddering with reaction he saw the great wall of bark shuddering too decided it was the least of his problems and looked for enemies the redhaired woman was coasting treeward not far out ignoring the blood spreading across her pants her eye was on the shuddering tree out of range gavving tried a harpoon cast and instantly dived behind the great fan not necessary hed skewered her she stared at him horrified and died purpleclad enemies screamed to each other voices drowned by a rising background roar jiovan was dead with two feathered shafts in him jinny held a smaller fan fungus in front of her harpoon in her other hand the grad rolled out of a crevice in the bark saw what jinny was doing and imitated her a miniharpoon thudded into jinnys shield and she bared her teeth and launched herself in that direction followed by jayan and the grad gavving reeled in his harpoon the dead woman came with it her arms and legs jerking a wave of nausea clawed at his throat he worked his harpoon loose and was minded to examine the peculiar gleaming weapon still clutched in the womans hand he wasnt given time the tree shuddered again the bass background roar continued a sound like worlds ripping apart bark slid past gavving the redhaired corpse tumbled fl iing he was scrambling for a foothold when someone came at him from the side dark hair lovely pale heartshaped facepurple clothing gavving thrust a harpoon at her eyes the fire thanya screamed itll block us from the tuft weve got to get past it she blew jet pods and was skimming outward across the bark minya heard but she didnt pause smitta was dead and sal was dead and a single invader boy had killed them both minya stalked him the boy wore scarlet clothing citizens garb his blond hair curled tightly as a skullcap his beard was barely visible his face was set in a rictus of fear or killingrage he thrust at her threw himself back from her swords counterthrust lost his toegrip on the bark for an instant minya was minded to go after him pierce him kill him for the honor of sals triad then go there wasnt time thanya was right the fire could block them all maroon them away from daltonquinn tuft and there was sals bow to be recovered minya whirled and leapt away and fired a jet pod for extra speed sals corpse floated free her dead hand clutching the tribal treasure behind minya the blond youth gripped bark to set himself and hurled his handarrow minya kicked to alter her course and watched the weapon whisper past her she turned back as a shape popped up directly in front of her the shape was wrong not human it froze her for an instant minya hadnt quite grasped what was happening when a fist exploded in her face gavving had ignored the yells from the purpleclad women now two were fleeing firing jet pods to carry them outward along the trunk another leapt in a zigzag pattern along the bark but the darkhaired woman who had tried to kill him was now moving crosswise back to where gavving had left left a burly redhaired corpse clutching a curve of silver metal merril popped out of a crack just in front of her merrils fist smacked into the strangers jaw with a sound gavving heard even above the bass ripping sound hed been ignoring while he fought for his life a sound like the sky tearing apart now he heard the grad shrilling like a cricket a sound of panic the words drowned in the roar but gavving didnt need to hear he knew clave claaave clave popped out of a deep crack and shouted ready what do you need we have to jump the grad screamed all of us what are you talking about the trees coming apart thats how they survive what get everyone to jump clear dave looked around jiovan was dead floating tethered but dead the grad was already loose in the sky with line coiled gavving gavving moved across the shuddering bark ripped something loose from a purpleclad corpse continued in along the trunk jayan and jinny werent visible alfln snarled as he watched his enemies disappear into the outward smoke cloud glory and merril watched too not believing it make a decision now you dont know enough but youve got to decide it has to be you its always you gavving gavving and the grad were old friends did gavving know something hed captured an invader weapon and now he was far in along the trunk headed for the meat theyd left when they went after the mushroom of course theyd need food if they were to cast loose from the tree the grads mind could have snapped but gavving trusted him and everything was happening at once fire blazing on the tree the trunk shuddering and moaning strangers killing and then fleeing there were jet pods in daves pack he could get his citizens back once things settled down he bellowed grad lines to the tree nooo treefodder no ail right he bellowed above the endoftheworld roar jayanl jinnyl glory alfin merril everybody jump jump away from the tree do not moor yourselves reactions were various merril stared at him thought it over pushed herself free glory only stared jayan and jinny emerged from hiding like a pair of birds taking wing alibi clutched the bark in a deathgrip gavving gavving was working to free one thick leg of nosearm meat the bark still shuddered the sound filled tree and sky the purpleclad killers were nowhere to be seen and nobody had gone after the fan fungus dave hurled himself at the stalk the fan bent under his weight then tore loose and was turning end for end daves fingers were sunk into white fungus the tumbling thing seemed to be picking up speed faster the bark raced beneath the tumbling fan fungus faster a fiery wind rushed past him and was gone before he could draw breath it wasnt possible bewildered clave saw tufts of flame receding in both directions no tree citizens floundered in the sky even alfin had jumped at last but the tree where was the tree there wasnt any tree fistfuls of fungus turned to mush in aaves closing fists and he screamed and wrapped his arms around the stalk they were lost in the sky chapter eight quinn tribe wood snapped explosively spatfering gavving with splinters as he leapt across the bucking tearing bark a million insects poured from a sudden black gap that must have reached a klomter into the heartwood gavving cried out and waved his arms through the buzzing cloud trying to clear enough air to breathe the tree was everything that was and the tree was ending if hed stopped to think his fear would have frozen him fast he held to the one thought get the meat and get out the nosearm legs tumbled loose within a cloud of burning coals one haunch was in reach gavving caught a line to pull it free of the coals then jumped to catch it against his shoulder hot grease burned his neck he yelled and thrust himself away now what he couldnt think in this endoftheworld roar he doffed his backpack tied it against the nosearm leg braced against the pack and pushed himself into the sky clouds of insects and pulverized wood half hid the shuddering thundering tree daggersized splinters flew past gavving braced one of his jet pods against the pack and twisted the tip seeds and cold gas blasted past him the pod ripped itself free of his hands spat seeds into the flesh of his face and was gone his hands shook beads of blood were pooling on his cheek and his neck he dug out his remaining jet pod and tried again his tongue between his teeth this time the pod held steady until it had gone quiet the world came apart he watched it all while his terror changed to awe fiery wind swept past him and left him in the open sky two fireballs receded in and out until the home tree had become two bits of fluff linked by an infinite line of smoke awesome nobody could hope to live through a bigger disaster all ofquinnthbemustbedead theideawasreallytoobigtograsp all but daves citizens and theyd lost jiovan too and who was left he looked about him nobody a cluster of specks far out hed used both his jet pods and now he was lost in the sky at least he wouldnt starve thrashing his arms didnt stop the grads spin he wasnt willing to use his jet pods for only that he settled for spreading his arms and legs like a limpet star which slowed him enough to search for survivors the left side of his face was wet his fingertips traced a bloody gash that ran from temple to chin it didnt hurt shock but he had worse to worry him three human shapes tumbled slowly nearby purple marked with scarlet his stomach lurched it was their own doing he hadnt come here to kill the giant fan fungus floated free turning turning to reveal dave clutching the stalk good clave still wore his backpack very good that was their store of fresh jet pods then why wasnt dave doing something about rescue feet outward jayan and jinny rotated slowly around their two pairs of clasped hands it looked almost like a dance spreading out like that greatly reduced their spin good thinking and no sign of panic merril was a fair distance in her arms hadnt pushed her far and the trees windwake had caught her the worldsend roar had dwindled allowing lesser sounds the grad heard a thin wail alfin had leapt free after all he was thrashing and spinning and crying but he was safe the grad couldnt find gavving nor glory nor jiovan jiovans corpse must have gone with the tree but where wer the others and why wasnt clave doing something he and the fan were drifting away the grad sighed he shrugged out of his backpack and searched out his jet pods old jet pods from quinn tuft stores were they still active hed never fired a jet pod he knew nobody who had hunters carried them in case they fell into the sky but no hunter lost in the sky had ever returned in the grads lifetime he did it carefully he donned his pack again then clutched a jet pod in both hands over his navel when clave was approximately behind him he twisted the tip smartly the pod drove into his belly he grunted he maneuvered the point hoping to kill his spin the push died he released the pod and it jumped away on the last of its stored gas looking over his shoulder he found the fan fungus drifting toward him clave still wasnt doing anything constructive and he hadnt noticed the grad the smoke of the disaster split the sky from end to end dense flickering black clouds were pulling free of the paler smoke the same insects that had eaten the tree apart were now casting loose to find other prey other debris floated in the smoke trail the grad made out great fragments of torn wood and bark a cloud of flashers whirling in panic a flapping mote perhaps a nosearm fled from its burrow in that confusion he could still see that the cloud of citizens and corpses was slowly drifting apart far in toward voy gavving maneuvered half his own weight in smoked meat hed be hard to reach hed gone far to save that meat and the windwake must have pulled him further save gavving for last and hope the fan brushed against the grad and he clutched it fungus springy under his hands clave watched as if bemused he asked what happened safe now the tree came apart clave im going to dig in your pack weve got to start rescuing citizens clave neither helped nor resisted as the grad searched through his pack they could use the big fan as a base of operations rescue alfin first because he was nearest he took half a dozen pods he slid to somewhere near the fans center of mass and fired a jet pod then another the tree came apart you saw it how why the grad was judging distances he cast a line in a wide circle it brushed alfins back and alfin convulsed and snatched the line in a deathgrip he didnt try to reel it in the grad had to do that while alfin watched in near mindless terror alfin lunged across the last meter or so and wrapped himself around the stalk and buried his fingers in white fungus to the last knuckle a hand closed around the grads neck long strong fingers overlapped the thumb tightening like a steel collar claves voice was a hot snarl in his ear youll tell me now the grad froze clave had gone crazy tell me what happened the tree came apart why maybe the fire set it off but it was ready clave everything in the smoke ring has some way of getting around some way tos y near the median middle where theres water and air where do you think jet pods come from the hand relaxed a little and the grad kept talking its a plants way of getting around if a plant wanders out of the median too far into the gas torus region the what alfin asked what on earth is going on clave wants to know what happened alfin can you steer this thing and pick up some more of us here he passed across his store of jet pods alfin took them he took his time deciding what to do with them and the grad ignored him while he lectured the smoke ring runs down the median of a much bigger region thats the gas torus where the molecules the bits of air have long meanfreepaths the air is very thin in the gas torus but theres some it gets thicker along the median thats where you find all the water and the soil and the plants thats what the smoke ring is just the thickest part of the gas torus and thats where every living thing wants to stay where it can breathe all right go on everything in the smoke ring can maneuver somehow animals mostly have wings plants well some plants grow jet pods they spit seeds back toward the median where they can grow and breed or they spit sterile seeds farther into the gas torus and the reaction pushes the plant back toward the median then there are plants that send out a long root to grab anything thats passing there are kites what about the jungles i i dont know the scientist never skip it what about the trees now thats really interesting the scientist came up with this but be couldnt prove it the hand tightened the grad babbled if an integral tree falls too far out of the median it starts to die it dies in the center the insects eat it out theyre symbiotes not parasites when the center rots the tree comes apart see half of it falls further away and half of it drops back toward the median half lives half dies and its better than nothing clave mulled that he said which half east takes you out out takes you west west what are you doing im trying to remember we were too far in toward voy so our end it only hit him then the revelation blocked his throat a moment later so did claves fingers keep talking you copsik ive had it up to here with you telling half a secret thickly the grad said mister chairman you may call me the scientist the hand relaxed in shock quinn tribe is dead we are quinn tribe alfin broke the long silence that followed that terrible declaration are you happy grad you were right the tree was dying shut up said clave he released the grads neck maybe that had been a mistake maybe not hed have to apologize presently for now he clambered around to the edge of the fan jayan and jinny were coming near watching his approach alternately as they spun hed never felt like this so helpless so fearful of making decisions it bothered him that alfin and the grad bad seen him like that he tried his voice and found it normal theyre almost here good work alfin go for merril next i dont see glory the grad said i havent seen her since since he rubbed his throat she may not have jumped seven of us seven he flung a line jinny snagged it in her toes and clave pulled them both in together he said welcome to whats left of quinn tribe they clung to clave more in desperation than affection jinny pulled back to look into his face theyre dead all the rest as if shed already guessed alfin demanded why didnt the scientist see that coming he did said the grad treefodder why did he stay then he was an old man he couldnt climb fifty klomters of tree alfin gaped but but thats the same as murdering everyone who could climb there wasnt time for this clave said aiim pay attention to what youre doing alfin set off two jet pods then another the fan drifted toward mernil who waited in what might have been stoic calm he murmured the children somewhere off to the side there was motion what clave had taken for a purpleclad corpse was floundering in air dave pointed one killer left they watched she wasnt floundering now shed tied a line to her long knife and now she cast it out she snagged a dead companion and reeled it in she searched the corpse then pushed off from it in the direction of the next she hadnt found much but it must have been what she wanted now she fired two jet pods in turn the thrust carried herintoward voy alfin said shes not coming here or going home what does she think shes doing not our problem mcml caught a line thrown by alfin and pulled herself close by now there was no room to clutch the fan itself clave asked her did you see any sign of glory hanging on to the bark for dear life last i saw her she was in the out section gavvings a good distance in well go after him i hope we get there in time by then it was obvious the woman in purple had passed them and was heading toward gavving gavving watched her coming there was little else he could do when he could see her face he watched her watching him the rictus of hate hed seen earlier wasnt there he saw closecut dark hair a triangular face with an oddly narrow chin an expression that was thoughtfbi judging she was going to go past he didnt know how to feel about that he didnt want to die alone but he surely didnt want to die with those miniharpoons through him she was close now she reached behind her back for a tethered miniharpoon he could only try to put the meat between them as she pulled her odd weapon apart looking him in the eye and released it the feathered thing buried itself in warm meat then gavving moved in frantic haste pulling his knife reaching for her lineher words were strangely twisted but he understood her no no no let me live i have water i have jet pods i beg you it might be so he shouted freeze dont reel yourself in i have to think i obey she hung tethered motionless youve got water and ive got food what if you kill me and keep both my sword she answered and produced the long knife and threw it startled gavving reached out and managed to catch it by the handle my bow she said and he had time to bed the knife in the meat before she threw him the pullitapart weapon he caught that too now what she was just waiting what do you want i want to join you your people theres nobody else he could festoon himself with his weapons and hers and so what with nothing between them but forty kilograms of smoked meat either could snatch a weapon and kill the other at any time hed have to sleep sometime and still she waited he thought suddenly wiy not im dead anyway he called come on she coiled the line as she came gavving had been hanging onto his pack but she hugged herself up against the meat with no thought for what it would do to her purple clothing she worked a jet pod out of one of the dozen pockets that gave her body its shapeless lumpy look she set it and twisted the end when it had expended itself there was some change in their velocity she used another then another why were you carrying so many he asked i took them from my friends from their corpses gavving turned away quinn tribe now formed a single clump around the checkers hand said his enemy he had trouble understand ing her odd pronunciation theyre all moored to the checkers hand good enough fans are edible so is dumbo meat i know that word checker the grads used it but he never tells anyone what it means you should not have attacked the checkers hand we tend it tended it is that why you killed jiovan for a fan fungus for that and for returning from exile you were cast out for assassinating a chairman thats news to me weve been in quinn tuft for over a hundred years she nodded as if it didnt matter she was strange she was a stranger gavving knew every man woman and child in quinn tuft this citizen had dropped on him out of the sky complete and unknown he wasnt even sure he should hate her im thirsty he said she passed him a squeezegourd pod halffull of water he drank the clump that was quinn tribe seemed minutely closer gavving might have been imagining it he said what do we do now the way you use a jet pod maybe you handle yourself better in the sky than we do can you tell us what to do next dalton tuft daltonquinn tuft she corrected him your half of the tree is probably safe but its being pulled out by the tide i cant think of any way to reach it were lost then his curiosity suddenly became unbearable who are you minya daltonquinn im gavving quinn he said for the second time in his life the first had been at his rite of passage into adulthood he tried again who are you all why did you want to kill us smitta was excitable some of us are like that in the triune squad and you were killing the hand triune squad mostly women all women even smitta by courtesy we serve the tuft as fighters why did you want to be a fighter she shook her head violently i dont want to talk about it will your citizens accept me or kill me were not killers hed killed two himsell it caine to him that if the grad had taught him rightly those times when the scientist would have whipped them both for such talk then then minyas half of the tree falling out from voy was also falling out of a drought so can i tell them this if we can get you back to the far tuft youll see to it that were made members of your tribe it looks better if i can say that well she didnt speak at once and then she said i have to think the meat and the fan were passing at fair speed when clave cast out a weighted line hed reserved their last pod another mistake maybe now theyd have only one chance but the dark stranger caught the line neatly and made it fast they braced against their mutual spin gavving shouted across the gap this is minya of daltonquinn tribe she wants to join us dont pull in yet is she armed she was i want her weapons clave cast another line an impressively thick bundle came back clave studied the haul a knife the length of his own arm a smaller knife a bundle of miniharpoons and two of the pullitapart weapons one of wood and one of metal he preferred the look of the wooden one the metal thing looked like it had been made from something else by now hed guessed how they must work and he liked the idea alfin said she tried to kill us all true dave handed the grad his last jet pod not without reluctance stop our spin wait see that sheet of bark out from us and not moving very fast see if you can stop our spin and move us that way too alfin persisted what are you going to do recruit her if shell stand for it clave answered seven citizens in a tribe is ridiculous there isnt room to guard her where do you want to spend the rest of your life the jet pod sprayed gas and seeds the grad said we wont reach the bark this way not enough push alfin still hadnt answered dave told him unless youve learned to like falling id guess you want to live in an integral tree tuft we now have a prisoner who lives in a tuft we have the chance to earn her gratitude bring her in chapter nine the raft the pond was a small perfect sphere twenty klomters out from the checkers rand a giant water droplet trailing a tail of mist in the direction away from the sun when the sun shone through from behind as it did now minya glimpsed shadows wriggling within it it was going to drift past the ends of the tree were far away and still separating daltonquinn tuft drifting out and west the dark tuft in and east the smoke trail that joined them was growing faint save for dark streamers that were indecisive clouds of insects something surged from the pond and the pond rippled and convulsed in its wake the creature was big even at this distance hard to judge its size but it seemed little more than a mouth with fins minya watched it uneasily it didnt seem to be coming toward them it was flapping toward the smoke trail a loose cluster of citizens floated about the checkers hand they couldnt all cling there wasnt room and the fungus wasnt holding together that well either they used spikes and tethers and showed a reluctance to approach minya too closely the old one alfin clung to the stalk his look of terror had smoothed out but he wouldnt talk and he wouldnt move the grad studied her he said meen ya have i got that right close enough minya ah mineeyaif we could reach your end of the tree could you help us join your tribe their eyes were on her the old ones seemed desperate well it had had to come she said we have a drought too many mouths to feed already the grad said your droughts probably ending about now therell be water youre the quinn tribe scientists apprentice thats right i accept what you say how long before that new water grows new food in any therell be meatbirds in the wind now i dont want to go back there it was said clave asked did you commit a crime i was thinking about committing a crime i would have had to please leave it then but if we spend our lives here theyre likely to be short any passing triune family would think were some kind of mushroom tidbit or that flying mouth that came out of the pond a minute ago cant we get to another tree one with nobody in it i know we cant go anywhere now but if we could get to daltonquinn tuft we could get to another tree dont you think they werent buying it distract them anyway we can do better than were doing now we should be eating the hand not clinging to it it wont last long now that its been picked we need a place to moor ourselves she pointed that that was a ragged sheet of bark ten meters long and half that wide a couple of hundred meters away most of its spin had by now been lost to air friction davethe chairmansaid ive been watching it for the past day it isnt getting any closer treefodder if we could move ourselves id go for the pond the grad said maybe the tree left a partial vacuum that might pull it in we can hope we can do more than that the bark may be close enough minya reached for the weapons a hand clamped on her wrist the fingers circling almost twice around what do you think youre doing long strong fingers and no qualms about touching another citizen there were men like this dave in daltonquinn tuft they had driven minya into the triune squad minya shook her head violently she was his prisoner and she had come as a killer she spoke slowly carefully i think i can put a tethered arrow into that wood he hesitated then released her go ahead and try she used sals metal bow the arrow slowed as it flew and presently drifted she tried another now two arrows floated at the ends of slack lines there were murmurs of disgust as the boy oavving reeled the lines in id like to try that dave said and took the bow when he released it the string brushed his forearm and he cursed the arrow stopped short minya never dithered she made decisions fast important or no that too had helped to put her in the triune squad now she said hold your left arm straight and rigid pull as hard as you can swing the string a little right and you wont hit your arm look along the arrow now dont move she picked up the loop of line and hurled it as hard as she could in the direction of the sheet of bark now the arrow wouldnt pull so much weight whenever you feel ready the arrow sped away it ticked a corner of the bark and stayed dave put pressure on the line slowly slowly it was coming the arrow worked itself free dave repeated the exercise with no sign of impatience the bark was meters closer now he reached it again and pulled line in as if he were fighting some huge meatbird the bark came to them dave fired another arrow deep into the wood they crossed on the line minya noticed alfins shuddering breath once h was safely moored to the bark and she noticed claves well done minya but he kept the bow well used the other side of the bark for privacy dave instructed now the bark is all weve got so theres no point in getting it dirty when you feed the tree the fertilizer should go outward itll float around us alfin said his first words in hours he must have seen how they looked at him yes i do have a better idea be at the rim when you feed the tree the spin will throw it away from us wont it grad yes good thinking minya chewed on fan fungus it was fibrous and nearly tasteless but there was damp in it and the damp was delicious minya looked longingly toward the pond which was no closer so near so far they had eaten the smoked dumbo meat down to the bone to prevent its spoiling maybe that had been a mistake their bellies were full even overfull but they were left thirstier yet they could die of thirst here aside from that things were going well the goldenhaired boy gavving she had made a good choice there perhaps he thought he owed her his life perhaps it was true harmless as he looked she had seen him kill twice hed make a better ally than enemy alfin she couldnt judge if he was that terrified of falling hed be dead soon anyway merril was something else again legless but she swung a fist like another womans kick after all shed lived through she must be tough more handicapped as she was shed be dead without friends she must be well thought of then minya intended to make merril her friend the grad was a dreamer hed never notice whether minya was dead or alive dave was the dominant male perhaps he still considered her an enemy but she had brought them to this raft and let dave take the credit it couldnt hurt if clave thought he needed her she didnt care if he trusted her but what else might he want of her jayan and jinny they both acted as if clave belonged to them or vice versa two women sharing a man was not unheard of they seemed to accept claves decisions but would they resent a potential third best stay clear of clave if she could she could solve that problem perhaps merril spoke around a prodigious yawn does it feel like sleeptime i personally feel like ive been hit on the head clave said i want someone awake at all times on each side of the tree is there anyone who ian t sleepy im not said alfin so alfin and jayan took the first days watch gavving and merril would be next thenminya ignored the rest physically and emotion ally she was exhausted she settled for sleep floating next to the bark curled half into fetal position the sun was just passing north of voy she half noticed activity as citizens took their turns behind the bark feeding the tree clave and jmny slapped bugs off each other jayan presently disappeared around the edge alfin alfin was hovering next to her he said mineeya she straightened alfin what do you want i want you for my wife suddenly she was utterly awake she could not afford enemies now she said carefully i had not considered marriage he hadnt recognized her unform youd be a fool to turn me down what better way to become one of us i will consider what you say she said and closed her eyes im a respected man in dave tuft i supervised the tending of the treemouth her arms hugged her knees and tightened her into a ball without her volition alfins hand shook her shoulder mineeya your choices arent wide here on this sheet of bark you came as a killer some of us may still see you that way he wouldnt leave her alone well she tried to keep her voice cool but she couldnt make herself uncoil and it came out muffled your argument is good i should marry one of you clave is spoken for isnt he alfin laughed thrice am zing and the grad youre playing games with me consider my offer then he saw that she was sobbing minya was horrified but she couldnt stop the sobs racked her like convulsions she couldnt even muffle the sounds of distress she wanted a man yes but not this man did she have a choice she might find herself forced to mate this ugly abrasive old man only to prevent quinn tribe from killing her or she could speak of her oath to the triune squad and never be mated at all it was just too much iill come back when youre feeling better she heard alfins distress and guilt then quiet when she forced herself to look she saw him weaving among the sleepersstealthilyto reach the far edge of the bark she had lost her home her family her friends she was lost in the sky cast among strangers copsik how could he inflict such a decision on her now filthy treefeeding copsik the tears were drying on her face at least no triune squad companion had seen her so shamed it came to her that her tears had driven alfin away just as they had been her primary defense when she was fourteen but what could she do she hadnt been quite fair to the old man he had spoken a partial truth one shed already considered marriage was the way into quinn tribe and she found that she had made her decision after all dared she sleep now she must the sun was a hands breadth past voy and she curled up and slept when the sun neared voy again minya woke some had the knack minya could tell herself when to sleep and when to wake and she would she flexed muscles without moving much she was thirsty there was restless motion around her the grad seemed to be having a nightmare she watched until he was quiet alfin shook gavving awake then merril he settled down while gayving disappeared to his post on the far side minya waited a little longer for jayan and alfin to fall asleep alfin clutched the bark with all his fingers and toes and for all minya could tell his teeth his face was pressed to the bark denying the sky hed never sleep that way but he wouldnt see her either she uncurled and made her way to the edge of the bark merril watched her go minya waved and pulled herself around to the smooth side of the bark sheet gavving saw her coming he started moving away from herto give her privacy she called wait gavving he paused gavving i want to talk to you all right but he was wary she didnt want that i dont have any weapons she said and then oh ill prove it you dont have to she pulled her blouse over her head and moored it to the bark she came closer wishing for toeholds to let her walk upright this crawling lacked the dignity she wanted at least shed shed the lumpypregnant look of the triune squad she said there are no pockets in my pants you can see that i want to tell you why i cant go back to daltonquinn tuft why he was trying to keep his eyes off her breasts on her face i mean im willing to listen ive got a name for asking embarrassing questions he tried to laugh it stuck in his throat but shouldnt everyone hear this she shook her head they might have killed me without you gayving let me tell you about the triune squad you told me youre fighters and youre all women even the men thats right if a man wants to be a woman or a woman doesnt ever want to be pregnant she joins the triune squad she can serve the tribe without making babies gavving digested that if you dont want to make babies they make you fight thats right and it isnt just fighting its anything dangerous this she pulled the rim of her pants down and he shied perhaps flinching at the scar it ran half a meter from her short ribs past her hip tip of a swordbirds tail if my jet pod hadnt fired i would have been all over the sky she suddenly wondered if he might see it as a flaw rather than a matter of pride too late and better that he see it now than later he said three of us fought a swordbird a few waketimes ago two came back theyre dangerous so you dont like men i didnt gavving i was only fourteen he stared why would a man bother a fourteenyearold girl she hadnt thought she could still laugh but she did maybe it was the way i looked but they all bothered me and the only way out was the triunes he waited and now im twentytwo and i want to change my mind and i can t nobody changes her mind once shes in the triune squad i could be killed for even asking and i did ask she caught her voice rising this wasnt going as planned she whispered he told me i should be ashamed of myself maybe hell tell i dont care im not going back he reached as if to pat her shoulder and changed his mind dont worry about it we cant move anyway if we could well an empty tree would still be a better bet and i want to make babies she said and waited he must have understood he didnt move with me why me oh treefodder why cant you just all right who else the grad lives all in his head alfins afraid of falling clave im glad hes here hes a good leader but claves type pushed me into the triunes in the first place he scares me gavving i saw you kill sal and smitta but you still dont scare me i think you had to do that she knew instantly that shed said the wrong thing he started to tremble i didnt hate them minya they were killing us without a word they were your friends werent they she nodded its been a bad bad waketime but im not going back all for a fan fungus gavving dont turn me down i couldnt stand it im not turning you down ive just never done this before neither have i she pulled her pants off then didnt have a spike to tether them gavving saw the problem and grinned he pounded a spike into the bark and added two tethers one he tied to minyas pants then to his own pants and tunic the other he tied around his waist ive watched he confided thats a relief i never did she reached to touch what his pants had covered a man bad put his male member into her hand once against her will and it hadnt looked like this except that it was changing before her eyes yes she had thought she could just let it happen it wasnt like that but she was used to using her feet as auxiliary hands and thus she pulled him against her shed been warned against the pain some of the triunes had not joined while they were still virgins she had known far worse then gavving seemed to go mad as if he were trying to make two people one she held him and let it happen but now it was happening to her shed made this decision in the cool aftermath of disaster but now it was changing her yes she wanted them joined forever she could pull them closer yet with her heels and her hands no they were coming apart it was ending ending when she had her breath back she said they never told me thal gavving heaved a vast sigh they told me they were righl hey didnt you hurt he pulled away from her a little and looked down theres blood not a lot it hurt im tough gavving i was so afraid i didnt want to die a virgin me too he said soberly a hand shook the grads ankle and pulled him out of a nightmare uh what grad can you think of any reason gavving shouldnt make a baby with a woman what then a musrum his head felt muzzy he looked around who is it the prisoner merril said yes now i dont see any reason to stop it unless shes got something else in mind i just want to keep an eye on them but someone has to be on watch why me you were closest the grad stretched okay youre on watch ill keep track of the prisoner merrils glare lost out to a smile all right thats fair the grad heard voices as he poked his head around the edge of the bark gavving and minya floated at the end of a tether quite naked talking a hundred and seventytwo of us minya was saying twice as many as you about that enough to crowd the tuft anyway the triune squad isnt a punishment its a refuge we shouldnt be having children any faster than we are and i was good you know i fight like a demon you need a refuge from uh this a laugh this and being pregnant my mother died of her fourth pregnancy and that was me arent you afraid now sure are you volunteering to carry it for me sure good enough they moved together the grad was intrigued and embarrassed his eyes shifted and the sky had opened a mouth the shock only lasted a moment a great empty mouth closed and opened again it was rotating slowly an eye bulged above one jaw something like a skeletal hand was folded below the other it was a klomter away and still big the beast turned ponderously still maintaining its axial rotation its body was short its wings wide and gauzy no illusion it really was mostly mouth and fins and big enough to swallow their entire bark raft sunlight showed through its cheeks it was cruising the clouds of bugs left in the wake of the disaster not a hunting carnivore good but wasnt there such a beast in the scientists records with a funny name merril touched the grads shoulder and he jumped im a little worried about the bugeater she said were embedded in bugs have you noticed noticed how could i not but in fact he had learned to ignore them the bugs werent stinging creatures but they were all around the bark raft millions and millions of winged creatures varying from the size of a finger down to dots barely big enough to see were a little big to be eaten up by accident maybe whats happening with i would say gavving is in no danger ill keep an eye open though good of you were being watched minyas whole body convulsed in reflex terror gavving said easy easy its only the grad she relaxed will they think were doing wrong not really anyway i could marry you he heard an incipient stutter when she said are you sure you want to do that for a fact he was not his mind lurched and spun the destruction of the tree had been no more disorienting than this first act of love he loved minya now and feared her for the pleasure she could give or withhold would she think she owned him the lesson of claves marriage what he knew of it was not lost on him like mayrin she would be older than her mate and none of that mattered there were four women in quinn tribe jayan and jinny were with clave that left merril and minya gavving said im sure shall we go make an announcement let them sleep she said and snuggled close her eyes tracked a moving mouth sweeping through the clouds of bugs it was closer now it didnt have teeth just lips and a tongue like a restlessly questing snake it rotated slowly a way of watching the entire sky for danger i wonder if its edible gavving said me im thirsty there has to be a way to reach that pond gavving dear we need sleep too isnt your watch about over his face cracked in a great yawn closed in a grin ive got to tell someone the grad was curled half into the fetal position snoring softly gayving jerked twice on his tether and said were getting married the grads eyes popped open good thinking now no well wait till sleeptimes over its your watch okay chapter ten the moby voices woke her she came awake fully alert thirsty and nervous he was young she had given him what he wanted had virtually forced it on him he would lose interesl he would remember that shed tried to kill him hed had hours to change his mind the voices were some distance away but she heard them clearly ten years older than you and you dont have the brideprice but thats trivia six or seven days ago she was trying to kill us all she could have her pick of us clave speaking and he was amused all but me of course you wouldnt like that would you loves i think its wonderful said jayan or jinny the other twin said itshopeful gavving you are not old enough to know what youre doing feed it to the tree alfin gavving noticed minya when she stirred and pulled herself back to the bark hello he called ready yes too eager it was a little late to be coy what kind of ceremony will it be we cant use mine i left our scientist in the tuft and hed have me killed theres that too said alfln the scientist the grad said im the scientist now ignoring alfins contemptuous snort he opened his pack and spread the contents packed in spare clothing were four small flat boxes of starstuffplasticand a flat polished surface that was glassy like the chairmans mirror but didnt reflect quinn tribe seemed as surprised as minya gavving asked have you been carrying that all along no i materialized it from thin air we scientists have our ways you know oh sure they grinned at each other the grad picked up the mirror and one of the boxes he fitted the box into the thick rim of the mirror prikazyvat menu the grads pronunciation had shifted it was odd archaic minya had heard the daltonquinn scientist speak like that the mirror responded it glowed like the diffuse nighttime sun then bloomed with tiny black print minya couldnt read it the grad apparently could he pulled the box loose and substituted another prikazyvat menu okay prikazyvat record he said briskly first day since sleeptime the first sleep following the breakup of the tree year three hundred and seventy jeffer speaking as scientist quinn tribe consists of eight individuals prikazyvat pause then nothing happened until minya couldnt stand it anymore whats wrong the grad looked up his face was a mask of pain a keening moan tore through his throat crystal lenses trembled over his eyes tears didnt run here without tide to pull them clave put his hand on the grads shoulder take a minute take as long as you need ive been trying not to think about it the scientist he knew he sent these with me what good does it do if were dying too were not dying were a little thirsty clave said firmly were all dead except us i feel like recording it makes it real clave glared around him the tears were about to become contagious jayan and jinny were sniffling already minya had to remind herself that daltonquinn tuft still lived invisibly far somewhere clave snapped come on scientist youve got a marriage to perform the grad gulped and nodded teardrops broke loose and floated away the size of tuftberries he cleared his throat and said in a creditably crisp voice prikazyvat record the tree has been torn in half seven of us survive plus a refugee from the outer tuft marriage between minya daltonquinn and gavving quinn exists as of now no children are yet born terminate he pulled the box from the mirror and said youre married minya was stunned thats it thats it my first act as scientist tradition says you should cons immate the marriage the first chance you just what have you got there aluin demanded everything i need the grad said this cassette is recent records it used to be medicine but the scientist ran out of room and erased it we couldnt use that stuff anyway starmen got sick in ways nobody ever heard of and used medicines nobody ever heard of either this cassette is life forms this one is cosmology this one is old records theyre all classified of course classified secret the grad started rolling the gear in clothing again clave said hold it the grad looked at him is there anything in your classified knowledge that we might need to know to go on living clave paused not long enough for the grad to answer if not why should we guard that stufl or let you carry it to slow you down pause if so youre hiding knowledge we need why should we protect you the grad gaped grad youre valuable were down to eight we cant spare even one but if you know why we need a scientist more than an apprentice hunter youd better show us now it was as if the grad had been frozen with his mouth open then he gave a jerky nod he chose a cassette and fitted it into the rim of the nonmirror he said prikazyvat find moby em oh bee wye the screen lit filled with print the grad read moby is a whalesized creature with a vast mouth and vertical cheek slots that are porous used as filters it feeds by flying through clouds of insects length seventy meters mass approx eight hundred metric tons one major eye two smaller eyes better protected and probably nearsighted for close work on either side of a single arm it stays near ponds or cottoncandy jungles it prefers to be spinning for stability and to watch for predators since there is no safe direction in the freefall environment moby avoids large creatures and also shies from our carms when attacked it fights like captain ahab its single arm is tipped with four fingers and the fingers are tipped with harpoons grown like finger dave glanced over his shoulder they had a side view of the flying mouth despite the swarm of insects near the raft it was going around them that id think so carms captain ahab whalesized i dont know what any of that means doesnt matter i guess so its timid and it eats bugs not citizens doesnt sound like a threat and that is why you need a scientist without the cassettes you wouldnt know anything about it maybe said gavving we dont want it to go around us he explained stumbling a little nobody laughed maybe they were too thirsty dave studied the massive bugeater pursed his lips nodded clave stood as minya posed him gripping the steel bow in his left hand drawing the bowstring halfway back toward his cheek it felt awkward instead of one of minyas miniharpoons a meter and a half of his own harpoon protruded before him the moby was watching him he waited until the creatures spin put the major eye on its far side throw the line he said gavving hurled the coiled line toward the moby clave let it unroll for a moment then sent the harpoon after it the harpoon wobbled in flight until the trailing line dragged it straight again with the steel bow and claves muscles to propel it the massive harpoon might have flown as far as the moby it didnt it didnt even come close reel it in and coil the line he told alfin to the others he said arrows put some arrows in the beast get it mad get its attention the grads arrow went wide and dave stopped him from wasting another gavvings and minyas were flying true and each had fired another when clave said stop we want it mad not scared not injured grad how timid is that thing likely to be i read you everything i know classfiedl the first chance he got clave was going through all of the information on all of those cassettes hed make the grad read them to him the mobys gauzy tail was in motion it had spotted the harpoons motion and was edging away then the first arrows reached it one struck the fin one a cheek neither with any great force the moby convulsed its fins thrashed and it turned a third arrow struck near its major eye it turned to face them alfin have you got that line coiled not yet then hurry you copsik are we all tethered the sky had opened a mouth it gaped and grew huge a skeletal arm folded forward presenting four harpoons alfin asked do we want to hurt it now dave discarded the metal bow and took up the harpoon treefodder i want this in its tail the moby obliged its tail flicked forwardand they felt the wind as it circled to expmine the situation as the tail came into sight dave cast the harpoon struck solidly in the meaty part ahead of the spreading translucent fin the moby shuddered and continued to advance the hand lashed forward gavving whooped and leapt from between closing horn harpoons away into the sky until his tether went taut and pulled him around the edge of the bark minya yelled and slashed at the hand feels like bone she reported and swung again clave snatched up another harpoon and jumped toward the tremendous face he pricked the creatures lip before his line pulled him back the great skeletal fingers curled around behind him minyas sword slashed at a joint and one of the harpoonfingers was flying loose the moby snatched its hand back fast its mouth closed and stayed that way the creature backpedaled with side fins gavving reeled himself back to the bark they watched the moby turning retreating the bark raft surged the moby stopped turned to look back the raft was following it it began swimming strongly against the air a point of sunlight blazed near the edge of the pond vagrant breezes rippled the surface shadows moved within a distant seed pod sent a tendril growing across a klomter of space toward the water gavving licked his lips and yearned tens of thousands of metric tons of water dwindled in their wake dave was cursing steadily he stopped then said sorry the moby was supposed to dive into the water and try to lose us gavving opened his mouth reconsidered and spoke anyway my idea why arent you blaming me id still get the blame im the chairman anyway it was worth a try i just wish i knew where the beast was taking us they waited to learn gavvings eyes traced the line of the smoke ring congealing out of the background of sky into the pale blue of water vapor and distance toothpick splinters all aligned might have been a grove of integral trees tens of thousands of klomters beyond a clot of white storm marked gold a thickening halfway down the arch toward voy would be the far clump here were all the celestial objects a child had once wondered about harp had told him that he might see them someday more practical heads had denied this the tree moved at the whim of natural forces and nobody left the tree he had left the tree and was married and marooned and thirsty quinn tribe clung along the forward edge of the bark raft at claves insistence they had donned their packs anything could happen but nothing had except that the pond continued to dwindle so near and yet so far the grad said dont we still have a few jet pods not enough clave looked around him at least we havent lost anyone okay were moving and were moving out thats good isnt it scientist thicker air thicker anything said the grad air water plants meat meateaters the moby was turning swinging gradually east and slowing tiring its fins folded against its side presenting a streamlined eggshape to the wind it continued to fall outward towing the bark raft the pond had become a tiny jewel glowing with refracted blue voylight clave said well cut loose as soon as we get near anything interesting integral tree pond forest anything with water in it i dont want anyone cutting the line too soon aoud ahead merril said a distant clotted streamer of white fading into blue clave barked laughter how far ahead sixty seventy klomters anyway it isnt ahead its straight out from us were aimed almost east maybe not said the grad were aimed out from east and moving pretty fast gavving remember east takes you out out takes you west west takes you in in takes you east port and starboard bring you back what the treefodder is that clave demanded gavving remembered but he said nothing it was classified and the grad had never told him what it meant but minya was saying every child learns that its supposed to be the way to move if youre lost in the sky but youve got jet pods the grad nodded happily were being pulled east were moving too fast for our orbit so well fall outward and slow down ill bet the moby is making for that cloud bank the mobys fins were spread and flapping slowly there was nothing at all ahead of them out to where the arch of the smoke ring formed from infinity minya moved her tether to bring herself alongside gayving they clung to the rim of the bark and watched the wisp of cloud out from them and hoarded their thirst the sun circled behind voy again already they had moved many klomters outward the daynight cycle had grown longer the cloud bank was growing it was itll try to lose us in the fog the grad said with more hope than conviction the moby hadnt moved for some time the spike that tethered the harpoon was working itself loose clave pounded another into the wood and wrapped the slack line around it but the cloud bank was spreading itself across the sky details emerged streamlines knots of stormy darkness lightning flashed deep within jayan and jinny took off their shirts alfin enjoying the sight without questions suddenly said theyre right get our shirts off try to catch some of that wet darkness brightened as the sun emerged below the edge of the cloud it continued to sink they watched the first tenuous edge of mist envelop them and began flapping their shirts gavving asked do you feel damp merril snarled i feel it i smell it i cant drink it but its coming lightning flashed off to the west gavving felt the mist now he tried to squeeze water out of his shirt no keep swinging it now he wrung the shirt tight and tried to suck it and got sweaty water they were all doing it now they could barely see each other gay ving had never in his life seen such darkness the moby was invisibly far but they felt the tugging of the tether they swung their shirts and sucked the water and laughed there were big fat drops around them it was getting hard to breathe gavving breathed through his shirt and swallowed the water that came through light was gaining were they emerging from the cloud clave maybe you want to cut that tether do we want to stay in here anybody still thirsty silence drink your fill but we cant live in here breathing through our shirts lets trust the moby a while longer the pale green light was getting stronger through thinning fog gayving thought he could see sky greentinged sky with a texture to it green was this some effect in his eyes due to the long abnormal darkness clave bellowed treefodder and swung his knife the harpoon tether sang a deep note cut short as clave slashed again the line whipped free the bark sheet shuddered then they were out of the mist in a layer of clear air gavving glimpsed the moby flapping away free at last and spared it only a glance he was looking at square klomters of textured green expanding growing solid it was a jungle and they were going to ram chapter eleven the cottoncandy jungle the carm was like nothing else in the universe it was all right angles inside and out all plastic and metals unliving starstuff the white light that glowed from the dorsal wall was neither voylight nor sunlight weirder lights crawled across the control panel and the bow window itself the carm was mobile where london tree moved only with the help of the carm if london tree was a living thing inhabited by other living things then lawn saw the cam as a different form of life the carm was a mighty servant it served kiance the scientist and lawn sometimes it went away into the sky with navy men as its masters this time it carried lawn too it grated on her nerves that she was not the carms master here seen through the picturewindow bow the jungle was green dotted with every color of the rainbowincluding overlaid scarlet dots that were heat sources the navy pilot pushed the talk button and said let go several breaths went by before lawn heard were loose the pilot touched attitude jet keys a tide pulled lawn forward against her straps warriors had been clinging to nets outside the hull now they swept into view of the bow window as the cam decelerated a cloud of skyblue men fell toward undulating clouds of green the pilot released the keys after twelve breaths shed watched numbers flickering on a small display in front of him hed released at zero and the jungle was no longer moving toward the carms bow window the savages havent moved yet he reported he was ignoring lawn or trying to his eyes kept ificking to her and away hed made it clear enough a nineteenyearold girl had no place here no matter what the first said theyre just under the greenery are you sure you want to do this we dont know who they are the ancient microphone put a squawk in the squad leaders voice if its just fighters well retreat we dont need fighters if its noncombatants hiding right have you found any other heat sources not yet that greenery is a pretty good reflector unless youre looking right into it we can pick up some meat flocks of salmon birds squad leader i see something off to the side somethings falling toward the jungle something like what something fiat with people clinging to it i see it could they be animals no im using science the pilot said the display superimposed on the bow window showed scarlet dots clustered close warmer objectssalmon birds for instanceshowed more orange in that display ribbon birds showed as cooler wavy lines of a darker bloodier red the pilot turned and caught lawn looking learned anything darling dont call me darlin lawn said primly evasively pardon me scientists apprentice have you learned enough to fly this ship do you think i wouldnt like to try it lawn lied unless youd like to teach me it was something she wanted very much to try classified the pilot said without regret he returned to his microphone that thing hit pretty hard id say its not a vehicle at all those people may be refugees from some disaster just what we need for copsiks might even be glad to see us well get to you when we can the squad leader sounded distracted and with reason spindly savages taller than a man ought to be were boiling out of the green cloud riding yellowgreen pods bigger than themselves they were clothed in green hard to see there was a quick exchange of arrows as the armies neared each other london trees warriors used long footbows the bow grasped by the toes of one or both feet the string by the hands the cloud of arrows loosed by the savages moved more slowly and the arrows were shorter cnossbows the pilot murmured he played the jets kicking the carm away from the fight lawn felt relief until he started his turn youll endanger the carm those savages could snatch at the nets calm down scientists apprentice were moving too fast for them the cam curved back toward the melee we dont want them close enough for swordplay not in freefall lithe scientist had his wish the cam would never be used for war at all putting his apprentice aboard had been a major strategic victory hed told her your sole concern is for the cam not the soldiers if the carm is threatened it must be moved out of danger if the pilot wont you must he had not told her how to subdue a trained fighter nor how to fly the ancient machine the scientist had never flown it himself savages flew toward the bow window lawn saw their terrified eyes before the pilot spun the cam about masses thumped against the carms belly lawn shuddered she would do nothing this time she would more likely wreck the cam than save it and there would be hell to pay even if she got home to london tree the savages were grouping to attack again the pilot ignored them he eased the carm into the midst of his own warriors nice going thanks said the radio voice lawri watched the cloud of savages advancing were all aboard said the squad leader the carm turned and coasted across the green cotton southwest savages screamed or jeered in its wake they hadnt a hope of catching up there was time to look and time to feel rising fear gavving tried to take it all in before the end it was curves and billows of green wall spotted with blossoms yellow blue scarlet a thousand shades and tones insects swarmed in clouds birds were there in various shapes dipping into the blossoms or the insect clouds some looked like ribbons and moved with a fluttering motion some had membranous triangular tails some were themselves triangles with whiplike tails sprouting from the apex far to the east was a dimple in the green funnelshaped perhaps half a klomter across distances were hard to judge would a jungle have a treemouth why would it be rimmed with gigantic silver petals the biggest flower in the universe set behind the jungles horizon as they fell the storm had hidden a jungle hed never seen one close but what else could it be the moby had planned this well gavving thought birds were starting to notice the falling mass motionless wings and tails blurred into invisibility ribbons fluttered away as in a strong wind larger torpedoshapes emerged from the greenery to study the falling bark sheet clave was snapping orders check your tethers arm yourselves some of those things look hungry well be shaken up when we hit has anybody noticed anything i might miss gavving thought he saw where theyd strike green cloud could it be as soft as it looked east and north far away more darting swarms of dots at this distance men men clave its inhabited i see them treefodder theyre fighting just what we need another war now whats that grad do you see something like a moving box lea well gavving located a brickshape with rounded corners and edges it was turning in sentient fashion moving away from the battle a vehicle then big andglitteringasifmadeofmetalorglass men clung to its flanks the grad said i never saw anything like it starstuff the aft end of the box was spiky with bellshaped structures four at each corner and one much larger in the middle nearly invisible flames not flamecolored but the bluewhite color of voy puffed from some of the smallnostrils the vehicle stopped its turn and surged back into the battle that should do it clave said gavving turned and saw what he had been doing setting his last jet pods to orient the turning raft so that the underside would strike first it seemed to be working but the jungle was hidden now gavving clutched the bark waiting his head was ringing his right arm was bangec up somehow his stomach was trying to find something to reject and he couldnt remember where he was gavving opened his eyes and saw the bird it was torpedoshaped about the mass of a man it hung over him long wings stretched out and motionless while it studied him with two forwardfacing eyes in deep sockets the other side of its head bore a sawtoothed crest its tail was a ribbed fan the four ribs ended each in a hooked claw gavving looked around for his harpoon the crash had bounced it free of his hand it was meters away slowly turning he reached for his knife instead and eased himself out of the greenery in which he was halfburied he whispered im meat are you intending it as a threat the bird hung back two companions had joined it their mouths were long and blunt and closed they dont bluff gavving thought a fourth bird skimmed across the green cloud moving fast right at his head he scrambled for cover as the bird dipped its tail hooks into the foliage and stopped dead gavving stayed where he was half under the raft the birds watched him mockingly a tethered harpoon thudded into a birds side it screamed the open mouth had no teeth just a scissorsaction serrated edge the bird set itself whirling as it tried to snap at its belly a third eye was behind the crest facing backward the rest made their decision they fled with his toes locked in branchiets alfin reeled the bird into knife range by then gavving had retrieved his own harpoon he used it to pin the birds tail while alfin finished the kill a performance that left alfins sleeves soaked in pink blood a wide grin stretched his wrinkles into uncustomary patterns dinner he said and shook his head as if hed drunk too much beer i cant believe it we made it were alive during all the years in quinn tuft gavving couldnt remember seeing alfin grin how could alfin be consistently morose in quinn tuft and happy while lost in the sky he said if wed hit something solid at that speed wed all be dead lets hope the luck holds missing citizens emerged from the green depths merrill jayan jinny grad minya gavving whooped and gathered her in his arms alfin asked wheres clave the others looked around the grad tethered himself to the bark and jumped toward the storm with a turning motion i dont see him anywhere he shouted back jayan and jinny burrowed into the foliage minya called wait youll get lost and prepared to follow hes here dave was under the bark sheet they moved it to expose him he was halfconscious and moaning softly his thigh bent in the middle and white bone protruded through skin and blood the grad hung back squeamishly but everyone was looking at him and it was clearly the scientists job he set alfin and jayan to holding daves shoulders gavving to pulling on the anlde while the grad moved the bones into place it took too long clave revived and fainted again before it was finished that flying box alfin said its coming here were not finished here said the grad the starstuff box fell toward them through the clear air between foliage and storm cloud men garbed in skyblue clung to all four sides the glassy end faced them like a great eye claves eyes had opened but it didnt seem he understood somebody had to do something gavving said alibi minya jinny lets get the bark sheet out of sight at least they turned it edgewise and pushed it down into the greenery gayving moved after it and minya after him forcing their way through the thicket into dark green gloom the foliage was dense at the surface underneath were open spaces and masses of springy branchiets grad the grad looked up scientist all right scientist i need a scientist alibi said can you leave him for a moment clave was halfconscious and whimpering he should be all right with two women watching him call me if he starts thrashing around he told them he moved away and alibi followed whats the problem i cant sleep the grad laughed its been a busy time which of us do you accuse of sleeping well i havent slept since we reached the midpoint were in a jungle weve got food and water but gradscientist were still falling alfins laugh surprised the grad it had a touch of hysteria in it alibi didnt look good his eyes were puffy his breathing was irregular he was as jumpy as tonights dinner turkey the grad said you know as much about freefall as i do you learned it the same way are you about to run amok feels that way im not helpless i killed a bird that was after gayving and for that moment his pride was showing the grad mulled the problem ive got a bit of that scarlet fringe from the fans you know how dangerous it is anyway you dont want to sleep now alfin glanced at the sky the starstuff box was taking its sweet time but no when its safe and i havent got much alfin nodded and turned away the grad stayed where he was he wanted solitude to nurse his jumpy stomach hed never set a broken bone before and hed had to do it without the scientists help alibi made his way back toward jayan and merril and dave he looked back once and the grad was looking at the sky he looked back again and the grad was gone jayan screamed the darkness and the strange dappled shadows made them almost invisible even to each other we can hide in here gavving said minya was nodding burrow deep stick together what about clave well have to pull him through what looks like a good spot none of it jinny said it would hurt him gavving tracked a dense cluster of branchlets back to a single spine branch cut here he told minya she didnt have room to swing she used the sword as a saw and it took her a hundred breaths or thereabouts then gavving pushed against the freed end and found that the entire cluster moved outward as a plug he pulled himself into open air and looked about him menni here good merril called she and alibi towed clave toward the opening moving with frantic haste the oneeyed box was too close the occupants must be watching them by now theyd have to dig in fast get lost in the deep branchlets but wheres jayan wheres the grad gone mernil puffed hes gone something pulled him down into the thicket wzat move it gavving they got dave inside and pulled the plugbush closed gavving saw that daves leg had been splinted with strips of a blanket and two of minyas arrows the men on the box minya said theyll follow us i know merril what got the grad an animal i didnt see he yelled and disappeared jayan snatched up a harpoon and ducked through and saw people disappearing deeper in shes trailing a line gavving should we stop her theyll trap her too why did it all have to happen at once claves leg the kidnappers the moving boxokay the soldiers on the box would be fools to come in here its the natives territory were here were more desperate never mind youre right we go after jayan right now because it gets us away from that starstuff relic mernil would merril slow them down probably not in freefall okay merril me minya well follow jayan and see whats going on maybe we can bust the grad loose jinny you and alfin follow as fast as you can with dave merril wheres jayans line somewhere over there treefodder why does it all have to happen at once yeah chapter twelve the copsik runners buws were raising an incredible ruckus unseen hands pulled the grad headfirst through darkness and the rich smell of alien foliage branchlets no longer scratched his face there must be open space around him hed had no warning at all hands had grasped his ankles and pulled him down into another world his yell was strangled by something stuffed into his mouth something that wasnt clean and a rag was tied to hold it in a blow on the head convinced him not to struggle his eyes were beginning to adjust to the gloom a tunnel wound through the foliage it was narrow big enough for two to crawl side by side not big enough to walk in no need the grad thought you couldnt walk with no tide his captors were human roughly speaking they were all women though this needed a second glance they wore leather vests and trousers dyed green the looseness of the vests was their only concession to breasts three of the five wore their hair very short and they all had a gaunt stretchedout look two and a half to three meters taller than any of quinn tribes men they held implements small wooden bows on wooden platforms the bowstrings pulled back ready to fire they were making good time the tunnel turned and twisted until the grad was entirely disoriented his directional senses wouldnt give him an up it presently opened into a bulbshape four or five meters across with three other tunnels leading off here the women stopped one pulled the rag out of his mouth he spit to the side and said treefodder a woman spoke her skin was dark her hair a compact black storm cloud threaded with white lightning her pronunciation was strange worse than minyas why did you attack us the grad shouted in her face stupid we saw your attackers theyve got a traveling box made of starstuff thats science we got here on a sheet of bark she nodded as if shed expected that an eccentric way to travel who are you how many are you should he be hiding that but quinn tribe must find mends somewhere go for goldeight of us all of quinn tribe now plus minya from the opposite tuft our tree came apart and left us marooned she frowned tree dwellers the copsik runners are tree dwellers why not you dont get a tide anywhere else whore you she studied him dispassionately for a captured invader you are most impertinent ive got nothing to lose a moment after he said it the grad realized how true it was eight survivors had done their best to reach safety and this was the end of it nothing left she had spoken he said what we are carther states the blackhaired woman repeated impatiently i am kara the sherman she pointed lizeth hild they looked like twins to the grads untrained eye spectrally tall pale of skin red hair cropped two centimeters from the skull lisa usas pants were as loose as her vest that discrete abdomingi bulge usa was pregnant her hair was blond ftizz her scalp showed through long hair must be a problem among the branchiets debby debbys hair was clean and straight and soft brown and half a meter long tied in back how did she keep it that neat sharman mean shaman an old word for scientiri could mean chairman except that she was a woman but strangers wouldnt do everything the way quinn tribe did since when did the chairman take a name you havent given us your name kara said pointedly there was something left to him after all he said it with some pride im the quinn tribe scientist name the scientist doesnt take one once i was called jeffer what are you doing in carther states youd have to ask a moby lizeth snapped her knuckles across the back of his skull hard enough to sting he snarled i meant it we were dying of thirst we hooked a moby clave was hoping hed try to lose us in a pond he brought us here instead the sharmans face didnt reveal what she thought of that she said well it all seems innocent enough we should discuss your situation after we eat the grads humiliation kept him silent until he saw their meal and recognized the harpoon thats alfins bird it belongs to carther states lizeth informed hini he found he didnt care his belly was stridently empty that wood looks too green to make a cookflre salmon bird is eaten raw with falling onion when we can get it raw yuk falling onion they showed him falling onion was a plant parasite that grew at the forks of the branchlets it grew as a green tube with a spray of pink blossoms at the tip the pretty brownhaired woman named debby assembled a handful and cut the blossomends off usas sword carved the scarlet meat in translucently thin slices meanwhile kara bound the grads right wrist to his ankles then freed his left dont untie anything else she warned him raw meat he thought and shuddered but his mouth watered hild wrapped sheets of pink meat around the stalks and passed one to the grad he bit into it his mind went blank you learned to put hunger out of your mind during a famine but he had definitely been hungry the meat had an odd rubbery texture the flavor was rich the onion taste was fiery mouthfilling they watched him eat i have to talk to them he thought hazily its our last chance we have to join them otherwise what is there stay here and be hunte or let the invaders catch us or jump into the sky the mansized bird was dwindling lizeth seemed content to carve slices until they stopped disappearing debby was now cutting the falling onions to stretch them the women had long since finished eating they watched with irritating smiles the grad wondered if they would consider a belch bad manners and belched anyway and had to swallow again hed learned while climbing the tree a belch was bad news in freefall without tide to bring gas to the top of the stomach he asked for water lizeth gave it to him in a squeezegourd he drank a good deal the falling onion had run out feeling pleasantly full the grad topped off his meal with a handful of foliage nothing could be entirely bad when he felt this good kara the sharman said one thing is clear you are certainly a refugee i never saw a starving copsik runner a test the grad took his time swallowing cute he said now that thats established shall we talk where are we nowhere in particular i wouldnt lead you to the rest of the tribe until i knew who you were even here the copsik runners might find us who are they these runners copsik runners dont you use the word copsik it sounded more like corpsik when she said it he answered its just an insultword not to us or them they take us for corpsiks to work for them the rest of our lives boy what are you doing the grad had reached for his pack with his free hand i am the quinn tribe scientist he said in freezing tones i thought i might find some background on that word go ahead the grad unwrapped his reader he had carther states undivided attention the women were awed and wary lizeth held her spear at the ready he chose the records cassette inserted it into the reader and said prikazyvat find copsik not found prikazyvat find the grad said and held the reader to karas face the sharman shied then spoke to the machinery corpsik corpsicle the grad said prikazyvat expound the screen filled with print the grad asked can you read it no kara said for them all corpsicle is an insultterm first used to describe people frozen for medical purposes in the century preceding the founding of the state some tens of thousands were frozen immediately after death in the hope of someday being revived and cured this was fothid to be impossible the state later made use of the stored personalities memory patterns could be recorded from a frozen brain and rna extracted from the central nervous system a brainwiped criminal could thus be fitted with a new personality no citizenship was conferred upon these corpsicles the treatment was later refined and used by passengers and crew on long interstellar voyages the seeder ramship disciplines crew included eight corpsicles the memory sets were those of respected citizens of advanced age with skills appropriate to an interstellar venture it was hoped that the corpsides would be grateful to find themselves in healthy youthful bodies this assumption proved i cant make sense of all that one thing seems clear enough a copsik isnt a citizen he has no rights hes property thats right said debby to the sharmans evident annoyance so the sharman doesnt trust me so how do they find you in here there must be cubic klomters of it and you know it and they dont i dont see why you fight at all they find us twice now they have found us hidden in the jungle kara said bitterly their sharman is better than i am it may be that their science enhances their senses grad we would be glad to have your knowledge would you make us citizens the pause lasted only seconds if you fight said kara clave broke his leg coming down we make citizens only of those who will fight our warriors are fighting now and who knows if they will repell the corpsik runners if we can hurt a few perhaps they will not seek out the children and old men and women who host guests guests oh the pregnant ones what about clave and the women what happens to them the sharman shrugged they may live with us but not as citizens not good but it might be the best they could get i cant say yes or no well have to talk kara wbat is it i just remembered something kara there are kinds of light you cant see there used to be machines that could see the warmth of a body thats how they find you the women looked at each other in dread debby whispered but only a corpse is cold so light little fires all through the forest make them check each one very dangerous the fire might she trailed off never mind fires go out unless fanned the smoke smothers them it might be possible after all near the jungle surface the grad nodded and reached for more foliage things were looking better if some could become citizens they could protect the rest perhaps quinn tribe had found a home three groups and theyre all going deeper the traces are getting blurred said the pilots blurred voice the carm hung behind squad leader patrys shoulder bow aimed at the jungle are you going after them groups how big three and three and a bigger group the big group started first you probably wont catch them in the hands of patrys men a mass of greenery rose from the rest and floated free patry reported weve found where they dug in okay were going after them he joined the waiting men mark take the point the rest of you follow me go wide of that yellow stufl its poison fern mark was a dwarf the only man in london tree who could wear the ancient armor and thus the only possible custodian of the spitgun ten years ago he had tended to shy back from an attack until he gained confidence in his invulnerability the men had called him tiny until patty himself raised hell about it mark was born to wear the armor hed learned to wear it well he climbed past the severed bush and into the dark with london trees infantry behind him the agony was real centered above claves knee but spreading in flashes throughout his body the rest faded in and out he was being towed through a tunnel soon the scientists plant extracts would erase the pain but hadnt the plants died in the drought and the tree was gone there wasnt any scientist and the grad had no drugs and the grad was gone too too few survivors followed the grad through green gloom daves pitiful remnant of a tribe was split and there was no medicine for an injured man jinny and minya stopped abruptly jarring his leg the pain shouted in his brain then they had plunged into the tunnels branchlet walls and dave tumbled in freefall abandoned his tumble turned him and the dream turned nightmare he faced a bulky faceless silver thing the apparition raised something metal a splinter stabbed into daves ribs he plucked it out his mind was muzzy was it a thorn the metalandglass creature forced itself through the tunnel wall ignoring clave acolytes followed it in blue men carrying huge unwieldy bows the pain had gone and reality was fading here was medicine after all i see youve caught up with the first group the pilot said the forward group has stopped the middle group has joined them maybe you should quit i sent toby back with two copsilcs the third had a broken leg so we left him were almost at full strength lets just see what happens patty is there something unusual about your mission classfled oh what did it matter catch some copsiks shoot some meatbirds collect some spices pick up anything scientific that last wasnt usual maybe the first officer wanted the scientist to owe him a favor patty didnt comment not with the scientists apprentice listening fine youve got copsiks how many do you need you dont really expect to find science here do you theres a big group ahead im going to at least look at the situation patty turned the volume down pilots tended to argue a point to death and patry wanted silence gavving hadnt burrowed far before jayans line led them to a tunnel carved through the foliage they moved faster then despite its alien smell gavving was hungry enough to try the foliage the taste was alien too but it was sweet and went down well he ate more in fact he felt almost at home here his toes thrust into branchlets and pushed him down the tunnel in remembered rhythm cheeping and croaking rose from thousands of unseen throats they wouldnt be birds this deep in the thicket but they chirped and if need came they could probably fly the sound was the sound of gavvings childhood before the drought killed the small life throughout the tuft it was an effort to remember that this wasnt quinn tuft that he followed enemies who knew this thicket as gavving knew his tree minya it seemed didnt have that problem she was snatching handfuls of foliage but the hand she used clutched an arrow and her bow was in the other they were moving faster than the line that slithered ahead of them merril wound it up as they went the coil trailed from a thumb she used both hands to move herself when gavving noticed he said let me do that for a while eat keep your hands free a little later perhaps regretting her sharpness she said i need my hands to move you can fight with your hands wheres your harpoon on my back were all right as long as jayan is still pulling on the line he said and immediately noticed that the line had gone slack gavving reached for his harpoon before he moved again a disembodied white arm thrust out of the tunnel wall and beckoned jayan looked out through a screen of branchiets her voice was a hoarse and frightened whisper theyre ahead of us where not far dont take the tunnel theres a long straight part then it swells out theyd see you go where i go or theyll hear branchiets breaking they followed her into the thicket jayan had broken a trail twice shed had to cut thicker spine branches in the end they watched from behind a screen of branchiets as the grad spoke with the weird women they were lean and elongated like exaggerated cartoons of the ideal woman or like a further stage in human evolution they looked relaxed so did the grad his feet and one hand were bound but he was casually eating foliage while they talked the carcass of a bird was mostly bones minyas breath was warm on his shoulder she whispered it looks like the grad may have talked them around i cant hear can you no there was too much birdsong and an occasional crackling as someone moved making gavving glad for the birdsong still someone was making too much noise minya leapt through the branchiets in a hideous crackling straight into the midst of the weird women screaming monster made of starstufli there gavving leapt after her ready to do battle hed have appreciated some warning the weird women didnt hesitate an instant five of them jumped toward other tunnels and were gone in three directions the sixth jumped clumsily she struck the edge of the opening and tumbled away unconscious had she struck that bard the grad was struggling to free his hands gavving felt something sting his leg he turned to fight to fight what a thing of glass and metal there were men behind it ordinary men who floated free sighting over their toes as they pulled huge bows taut with their handsbut they didnt fire the thing of science pointed a metal tube at minya then at the grad gavvings harpoon bounced off its mirrorglass face it pointed at gavving and stung him again you cant fight science gavving thought and he drew his long knife and leapt at the monster then everything went dreamy youre too deep the pilot said i cant get individual readings on you ive got a hot spot a cluster of a dozen or so you and the copsiks together sounds right weve got six copsiks here one already tied up for us well leave the one with no legs that gives us seven total a bunch went off through the tunnels can you locate them yes it looks like theyre together again theres you and theres a tighter brighter spot east of you id say quit now kill some meatbirds on the way out theres something here ive got something scientific here something i dont understand too scientific by half squad leader patty picked up a rectangular mirror that didnt reflect a mirror that shone by its own light with some trepidation he flipped an obvious switch the light went out to his relief youre right weve got enough were coming out chapter thirteen the scientists apprentice lassitude an odd pleasant sensation like fizzing in the blood constriction and resistance at his wrists and anldes memories drifting into place sorting themselves the grad waited until his mind was straight before he opened his eyes he was bound again tension at wrists and ankles holding his body straight getting to be a habit his bonds gave as he tugged at them he was tied to netting face down to a wall that was hard and cold and smooth and translucent to a millimeters depth over a gray substrate hed never seen the like before but from a distance this stuff might look like metal it was the flying box he was tied to the flying box he twisted his head left and saw others minya gavving jayan jinny to his right a row of dead salmon birds and ribbon birds alfin smiling in his sleep and one of the carther tribe women the pregnant one ilsa her eyes were open and empty of hope a jovial voice boomed at them some of you are awake by now the grad arched his back to see over his head the copsik runner was big burly cheerful he clung to the net near the windowed end dont try to wriggle loose youll just get lost in the sky and we wont come back for you we dont want fools for copsiks minya called to him may we talk among ouzselves sure if you dont interrupt m now youre wondering whats going to happen to you youre going to join london tree theres tide when youre in a tree youll have to get used to the pull on things and balancing on your feet without falling and so forth youll get to like it you can heat water till it boils without it spewing all over the place and that lets you cook things you never tasted you always know where you are by what a thing does if you let go of it you can drop garbage from below their feet came an unnerving whistling roar the copsik runners voice rose and know it wont float back at you he stopped talking because some of his prisoners were screaming a tide pulled toward the grads feet he was not surprised to see sky wheeling past green forest a strip of blue billowing white the textured green below his feet began to contract a wet wind blew past mist thickened around them the panicky screams thinned to whimpers and the grad heard alfins treefodder were going back into the treefeeding storm cloud whose bright idea and he must have silenced himself because nobody else could have reached him their guard waited for quiet he said its very impolite for a copsik to interrupt a citizen i am a citizen ill forget it for the duration of this voyage but you will learn questions minya screamed what gives you the right dont ever say that again the copsik runner said anything else minya seemed to calm herself in an instant what about our children will they be copsiks too theyll have the chance to be citizens theres an initiation some wont want to take it some wont pass mist enclosed them completely the copsik runner himself was halfinvisible a wave of droplets each the size of a thumb swept across them leaving them soaked nobody else seemed inclined to so the grad spoke is london tree stuck in this storm cloud the copsik runner laughed were not stuck anywhere we moved into the cloud because we need water after we get you home well move out i expect how classified gavving was just waking up he looked left and right and found the grad whats happening the good news is were going to live in a tree gavving tested his bonds while he absorbed that as what copsiks property servants huh better than dying of thirst where are we the flying box right i dont see clave or merril right again i feel wonderful gavving said why do i feel so good something was on those thorns maybe like the red fringe on a fan fungus could be youre not saying much the grad said i dont want to miss anything if i know how we get to london tree maybe i could get us back i had some carther tribe citizens convinced that we should join them gavving turned to minya they spoke together at length the grad didnt try to hear it was too noisy anyway the whistling roar had faded but the windsong was nearly as loud too many changes minya said i know i cant seem to feel anything i want to get angry but i cant were drugged its not that i was minya of the triune squad of dalton quinn tuft then i was lost in the sky and dying of thirst i found you and married you and joined the dark tuft people we hitched a ride with a moby and got slung into a jungle now were what copsiks its too many changes too much all right im a little numb myself well get over it they cant keep us drugged forever youre still minya the berserker warrior just forget it till you need it what will they do with us i dont know the grads talking escape i think wed better wait we dont know enough she found a laugh somewhere at least we dont die virgins we met each other we were dying and now were not dying at all were going to a tree and it can move itself well never see another drought it could be worse its been worse i wish i could see clave though it was dark and wet around them lightning marched a meandering path across the bow the vehicle swung around npw the wind blew up from their feet in that direction a bushy shadow was forming there said minya the roar of motors resumed gavving watched for a time before he convinced himself that it was one tuft of an integral tree hed never seen any tree from such a vantage they were coming up on the in branch the tuft was greener and healthierlooking than quinn tuft had been and foliage reached farther to cover the branch the bare wooden tail sported a horizontal platform of hewn wood clearly a work of tremendous labor the roar of scienceinaction wavered rose and fell as the flying box settled toward the platform a great arching gap had been chopped through the branch itseli linking this platform to one on the other side at its west end where foliage began to sprout a large hut had been woven the whistling roar died then things happened fast people left the hut on the jump more appeared from underneath perhaps from inside the flying box london trees citizens didnt have the incredible height of the forest denizens some wore gaudy colors but most wore tuftberry red and the men had smooth faces scraped clean of hair they swarmed to what was now the roof of the flying box and began pulling prisoners loose jinny jayan minya and the tall carther tribe woman were freed in turn and escorted off the roof of the vehicle then nothing happened for a time they took the women first the drug on the needles still held him calm but that bothered gavving nonetheless he couldnt see what was happening on the ledge presently he was pulled free of the net lifted and walked off the roof somehow he had expected normal tides here was no more than a third of the tidal force at quinn tuft he drifted down alfins eyes popped open when the copsik runners turned him loose they were closing again when he hit the platform he grunted in protest then went back to sleep two men in tuftberry red picked him up and carried him away a copsik runner a goldenhaired woman of twenty or so with a pretty triangular face held up the grads reader and tapes which of you belongs to these she demanded the grad called from above gavvings head he was still falling theyre mine stay with me she commanded do you know how to walk youre short enough to be a tree dweller the grad staggered when he touched down but stayed upright i can walk wait with me well use the carm to reach the citadel strangers were among them leading gavving and alfin toward the big hut the grads eyes followed them and gavving would have waved but his wrists were still tied a smallish fussylooking man in red pushed a birds carcass into his hampered armsit was nearly his own massand said take this along can you cook come the copsiks hand shoved against the small of his back he moved in that direction toward where the fin flowered into tuft but where were the women the flying box had blocked his view now he saw the women through the arch on the other ledge minya began struggling crying wait thats my husband the drug slowed him down but gavving threw the bird into the copsiks arms sending him tumbling backward under its mass and tried to jump toward minya he never completed the first step two men stepped in from either side and caught his arms they must have been waiting for just such a move one clouted him across the head hard enough to set the world spinning they hustled him into the but the copsik was studying lawn as she studied him he was thin with stringy muscles three or four cemeters taller than lawri herself and not much older his blond hair and beard were raggedly cut he was dirty from head to foot a line of dried blood ran from his right eyebrow to the corner of his jaw he was very much the kind of copsik who might come spinning from the sky on a sheet of bark and hardly a convincing man of science but his eyes inquired they judged her he asked citizen what will happen to them call me scientists apprentice lawri said who are you im the quinn tribe scientist he said that made her laugh i can hardly call you scientist dont you have a name he bristled but he answered i did jeffer jeffer the other copsiks dont concern you now get aboard the carm and stay out of the pilots way he stood stupidly carm she slapped its metal flank and pronounced th syllables as she had been taught cargo and repair module carm in he got through both doors and a few paces beyond and there he stopped gaping trying to see in every direction at once for the moment she left him to it she didnt blame him few copsiks ever saw the interior of the carm ten chairs faced into a tremendous curved window of thick glass images were there that couldnt be outside the glass nor could they be reflections they must be in the glass itself numbers and letters and line drawings in blue and yellow and green behind the chairs was thirty or forty cubic meters of empty space there were bars set to swivel out of the walls and floor and ceiling and numerous loops of metal anchorage for stored goods against the jerky pull of the motors even so the cabin was only a fifth the size of the carm what was the rest when the carm moved flame had spurted from nostrils at the rear it seemed that something must burn to move the carm a good deal of it if it occupied most of the carms bulk and pumps to move the fuel and mysteries whose names hed glimpsed in the cassettes attitude jet ljfe support system computer mass sensor echo laser the calm left by the needle had almost left his blood he was starting to be afraid could he learn to read those numbers in the glass would he have the chance a man in blue lounged before the box window a bigboned man of average height he was still too tall for the chair what would have been a curved head rest poked him between the shoulder blades the scientists apprentice spoke briskly please take us to the citadel i dont have orders to do that just what are your orders her voice was casual peremptory i dont have orders yet the navy may be interested in these scientific items confiscate them if youre sure enough and ill tell the scientist what happened to them as soon as im allowed to contact him will you confiscate the copsik too he says he knows how to work them maybe youd better confiscate me to talk to him the pilot was looking nervous his glance at the grad was venomous a witness to his discomfiture he decided citadel right his hands moved the girl forewarned was clutching the back of a chair the grad wasnt the lurch threw him off balance he grabbed at something to stop his fall a handleon the back wall it twisted in his hand and dirty water spilled from a nozzle he turned it off quick and met the girls look of disgust after perhaps twenty heartbeats the pilot lifted his fingers the familiar whistling roarbarely audible through the metal walls but still fearfully strangewent quiet the grad immediately made his way to one of the chairs the carm was moving away from the tuft east and out were they leaving london tree why he didnt ask he was uncharacteristically leery of playing the fool he watched the pilots hands symbols and numbers glowed in the bow window and in the panel below it but the pilot touched only the panel and only the blue he could feel the response in shifting sound and shifting tide blue moves the carm jeffer how did you get those wounds the blond girl spoke as if she didnt care very much wounds oh his face the tree came apart he said they do that if they fall too far out of the smoke ring we had a close encounter with gold some years ago that touched her curiosity nerve what happens to the people quinn tuft must be dead except for us five of us now hed accepted that clave and merril were gone too youll have to tell me about it sometime she tapped what she was carrying what are these cassettes and a reader records she thought it over longer than seemed necessary then she reached to plug one of the grads cassettes into a slot in front of the pilot the pilot said hey science my preogative she said she tapped two buttons buttons permanent fixtures in a row of five yellow blue green white red the panel was otherwise blank save for the transitory glowing lights within a tap of the yellow button made all the yellow lights disappear the white button raised new symbols in white prikazyvat menu the familiar table of contents appeared within the glass white print flowing upward shed chosen the cassette for cosmology the grad felt his hands curling to strangle her classifie classtfled mine prikazyvat gold the print shifted the pilot was gripped by ternfled fascination unable to look away the scientists apprentice asked the grad can you read certainly goldblatts world probably originated as a neptunelike body a gas giant world in the cometary halo that circles levoys star and teethree hundreds of billions of kilometers klomters out a supernova can spew its outer envelope asymmetrically due to its trapped magnetic field leaving the remaining neutron star with an altered velocity the planetary orbits go all to hell in levoys sscenario goldblatts world would have dropped very close to levoys star with its per perihelion actually inside the neutron stars roche limit strong roche tides would quickly warp the orbit into a circle the planet would have continued to leak atmosphere to the present day replacing gasses lost from the smoke ring and the gas torus to interstellar space goldblatt estimates that levoys star went supernova a billion years ago the planet must have been losing atmosphere for all of that time in its present state goldblatts world defies description a worldsized core of rock and metals enough very good you can read can you understand what you read not that i can guess that levoys star is voy and goldblatts world is gold the rest of it the grad shrugged his eye caught the pilots and the pilot flinched he seemed shrunken into hirnself dominance games the scientists apprentice had assaulted the pilots mind with the wonders and the cryptic language of science now she was saying we have that data on our own cassettes word for word as far as i can remember i hope you brought us something new a shadow was congealing in the silver fog around them they were drifting back toward london tree the carms freefalling path had curved back toward the trees midpoint east takes you oul out takes you westhe had a great deal to learn about flying the carm because he must learn he would learn to fly this thing or end his days as a copsik there were structures here huge wooden beams formed a square inward four huts in a column not of woven foliage but of cut wood cables and tubes ran down the trunk in both directions further than the grad could follow a pond had touched the trunk a silvery globule clung to the bark and that seemed strange a single pond in this region of mist men in red moved around it feeding it water carried in seed pods it too must be artificial with all these artificial structures london tree made quinn tuft look barbaric but was it wise toscientists apprentice do you cut the wood for these structures from the tree itself she answered without looking at him no we bring it from other integral trees now she turned startled and annoyed he wasnt expected to judge london tree the grad was developing a dislike for the scientists apprentice which he would try to keep in check if she was behaving as a typical citizen toward a copsik it augured badly for quinn tribe the trunk was coming at them too fast the grad was relieved when he heard the motors start and felt the carm slowing those wooden beams would just about fit against the carms windowed end and that was what the pilot was doing tapping at blue lights fitting the window into that wooden frame watch his hands chapter fourteen treemouth and citadel in the large hut the women were stripped naked and examined by two women taller than humans like ilsa of carther tribe their long hair was white and thin enough to expose scalp the skin seemed to have withered on their bones forty to fifty years old minya thought though that was hard to judge they looked so strange they wore ponchos in tuftberryjuice scarlet closed between the legs their walk was easy practiced minya judged that they had spent many years in the tide of london tree it looks like people live a long time here she whispered to jayan and jayan nodded the supervisors would not answer questions though they asked many they found dirt and wounds in plenty but no disease they treated minyas bruises and brusquely advised her to avoid offending citizens in future minya smiled offended she was sure she had broken a mans arm before they clubbed her unconscious lisa was clearly pregnant jayan was also declared pregnant to her obvious surprise and sent off with usa minya gripped jinnys arm afraid that she would attempt a futile battle for her twin one of the supervisors noticed jinnys distress theyll be all right she said they carry guests one of the scientists apprentices will have to look them over also the men wont be allowed near them the what would what but she would say no more and minya had to wait the grad watched through the small windows the big bow window now gave on to rugged bark four cemeters distant things were happening outside a man in a white tunic was talking to men in blue or red ponchos that fit like oversized sacks presently the others all launched themselves along the bark toward the lowest of the column of huts whos that the grad asked the scientists apprentice disdained to answer the pilot said thats kiance the scientist your new owner no surprise there he thinks he owns the whole tree klance the scientist was arguing with himself as he approached the carm his white smock reached just below his hips the ends of a citizens loose poncho showed below he was tall for a tree dweller and lean but for a developing pot belly not a fighter the grad thought fortyodd with slack muscles his hair was thick and white his nose narrow and convexly curved in a moment the grad heard his voice speaking out of the air lawn sharp with a peremptory snap in it the pilot tapped the yellow button and spread two fingertips apart over the resulting pattern of yellow lines beating lawri to it the carms two doors swung out and in the scientist was already in conversation as he entered they want to know when i can move the tree damn fools they only just finished topping off the reservoir if i moved it now the water would just float away first we have to he stopped his eyes flicked to the pilots back then to the grad then to lawri well hes the scientist of a ruined tribe he carried these lawn held up plastic boxes old science his eyes turned greedy tell me later he said pilot the navy mans head turned was the carm damaged in any way was anything lost certainly not if you need a detailed report no that will do the rest of the navy party is waiting for the elevator i think you can still catch it the pilot nodded stiffly he rose and launched himself toward the twin doors he nearly brushed the scientist who held his ground pulled himself through the doors and was gone the scientist tapped at yellow lights the window sprouted a display fuel tanks are damn near dry well be filling them for weeks otherwise looks all right lawn from you i do want a detailed report but tell me now if anything happened he seemed to know what he was doing i dont love the treefeeder but he didnt bump any rocks the foray team brought back these and him the scientist took the plastic objects lawn handed him a reader he breathed you bring me treasure whats your name the grad hesitated then jeffer jeffer ill wait for your story well get you cleaned up first all these years ive been waiting for the navy to lose my carm reader and all i cant tell you what it means to have a spare the tide was lighter otherwise minya couldnt tell london tree from her own tuft here was the same green gloom the same vegetable smells branching tunnels ran through foliage stripped bare by passersby the tall women led them in silence jinny and minya followed they passed nobody they were still naked jinny walked hunched over as if that would cover her she hadnt spoken since jayan was taken away they had traveled some distance before minya felt the wind minutes later the tunnel swelled out into a great cavity lit by harsh daylight at the far end jinny was the commons this big in quinn tuft jinny looked about her dutifully and showed no reaction no neither was ours the cavity ran round the trunk and all the way to the treemouth itself she could see the empty sky beyond the shadows were strange with the blue tinge of voylight glaring from below in daltonquinn tuft voy had been always overhead all that foliage had had to be torn out werent the copsik runners afraid of killing the tree or would they only move to another thirty or forty women had formed a line for food many were attended by children three years old and younger they ignored minya and jinny as they were marched past toward the treemouth tell me what bothers you most minya said jinny didnt answer for several breaths then clave he wasnt on the box he must be still in the jungle jinny his leg has to heal before he can do anything ill lose him jinny said hell come but ill lose him jayans got his child i wont be his anymore clave loves you both minya said though she hadnt the remotest idea how clave actually thought jinny shook her head we belong to the copsik runners the men look theyre already here minya frowned and looked about her was jinny imagining her eye picked up something in the green curve that roofed the commons a dark shape hidden in shadow and foliage she found two more four five men she said nothing they were led to the edge of the treemouth almost beneath the great reservoir mounted where branch merged into trunk minya looked downslope offal garbage two bodies on platforms completely covered in cloth when she turned away their escorts had stepped out of their ponchos they took their charges by the arms and led them beneath the huge basin one of the supervisors heaved on a cord and water poured forth like a flood in miniature minya shuddered with the shock the women produced lumps of something and one began rubbing it over minyas body then handed it to her minya had never experienced soap before it wasnt frightening but it was strange the supervisors soaped themselves too then let the flood pour forth again afterward they dried themselves with their garments then donned them they handed scarlet ponchos to jinny and minya the suds left her skin feeling strange tingly minya had little trouble stepping into the poncho despite its being sealed between the legs but it did seem uncomfortably loose was it made for the elongated jungle people it bothered her more that she wore tuftberryred copsikred here citizenred at home she had worn purple too long their escorts abandoned them at the serving table four cooks more of the elongated womenladeled a stew of earthlife vegetables and turkey meat into bowls whose rims curved inward minya and jinny settled themselves into a resilient arm of foliage and ate the fare was blander than what she was used to in daltonquinn tuft another copsik settled beside them two and a half meters tall mid cueaged walking easily in london trees tide sile spoke to jinny you look like you know how to walk you from a tree jinny didnt answer minya said a tree that came apart im minya daltonquinn this is jinny quinn the stranger said heln no last name now how long have you been here ten years or something like i used to be carther i keep expecting well rescue heln shrugged i keep thinking theyll try something of course they couldnt then anyway ive got kids now married heln looked at her they didnt tell you okay they didnt tell me either the citizens own us any man who wants you owns you i thought it was something like that she moved her eyes only toward the shadows at the outskirts and theyd watched her nakedwhat are they doing making their selections thats right hem looked up eat faster if you want to finish two shadowy men were coming toward them drifting at leisure along the interlocked branchlets that formed the ground minya watched them while she continued eating they paused several meters away waiting their ponchos fit more closely than hers and were a riot of colors they watched the women and talked minya heard one with the bruises broke karals hein ignored them minya tried to do the same when her bowl was empty she asked what do we do with these leave them hein said if no man takes you take it back to the cooks but i think youll have company you look like citizens the men like that she grimaced they call us jungle giants too many changes three sleeptiines ago no man in her local universe would have dared to touch her what would they do to her if she resisted what would gavving think of her even if they could escape later if she strolled toward the treemouth now minya thought would anyone stop her shed be feeding the tree a short sprint past the treemouth would put her into the sky before anyone could react shed been lost in the sky and survived but how could she alert gavving to jump too he might not have the chance he might think it was a mad idea it was mad minya dropped it and the men strolled over to join them the grads first meal at the citadel was simple but strange he was given a gourd with a fairsized slot cut in it and a squeezegourd for liquids and a twopronged wooden fork thick stew shipped from the out tuft had cooled by the time it reached the citadel he could recognize two or three of the ingredients he wanted to ask what he was eating but it was klance who asked the questions one of the first was were you taught medicine certainly the word was out of his mouth before his mind quite caught up lawri looked dubious kiance the scientist laughed youre too young to be so sure have you worked with children injured hunters sick women women carrying guests not with children women with guests yes injured hunters yes ive treated malnutrition sicknesses always with the scientist supervising his racing mind told him what to tell klance in fact he had worked with children he had inspected a pregnant woman once he had set the bone in daves leg the old copsik runner wont let me practice on citizens will he hell try me out on copsik first my own people klance was saying we dont get malnutrition here thank the checker how did you come to be found in a jungle inadvertently eating strange food with strange implements in freefall took concentration not letting it make him sick took a distraction the grad was glad for the chance to talk he ate what he was given and told the tale of quinn tribes destruction the scientist interrupted with questions about quinn tuft treemouth tending musrums flashers the duinbo the moby the insects at the tree median lawn seemed fascinated she burst in only once demanding to know how one fought swordbirds and triunes the grad referred her to minya and gavving maybe shed let them know where he was the meal ended with a bitter black brew which the grad refused and he continued to talk he was hoarse when he finished kiance the scientist puffed at his pipeshorter than the one the quinn chairman had usedand clouds of smoke drifted sluggishly about the room and out the room was more a cage of timber than a hut there were narrow windows everywhere and boards would swing to cover them klance said this giant mushroom bad hallucinogenic properties did it i dont know the word klance the red fringe made you feel strange but nice maybe that was the reason they were protecting it i dont think so there were too many of those fan fungi this one was big and nicely formed and had a special name the checkers hand jeffer have you ever heard that word checker before my grandmother used to say treefeeder must think hes the checker himself when she was mad at the chairman i never heard anyone else the scientist reached for the grads reader and one of his own cassettes i think i remember checker officer entrusted with seeing to it that one or a group of citizens remains loyal to the state the checkers responsibility includes the actions attitudes and wellbeing of his charges the checker aboard discipline was the recording of sharls davis kendy in the ships master computer this is strictly starman stufl hmp the state it took me four days to read the insert on the state have you seen it yes strange people i did get the feeling that they lived longer than we do kiance snorted your scientist never tumbled to that they had shorter years they used one whole circle of their sun for their year we only use half a circle but its still about sevenfifths of a state year the truth is we live a little longer than they do and grow up more slowly too to hear his teacher so slighted set the grads ears burning he barely heard klance add all right jeffer from now on you must think of me as your checker yes scientist call me klance how do you feel the grad answered with careful halftruth im clean fed rested and safe id feel even better if i knew the rest of quinn tribe was all right theyll get showers and food and drink and clothing their children may become citizens the same goes for you jeffer whether or not i keep you here but i think youd be bored in the tuft so do i klance fine for the time being i have two apprentices lawn exploded its unheard of for a freshly claimed copsik to be at the citadel at all wont the navy the navy can feed the tree the citadel is mine chapter fifteen london tree gavving was on the bicycle with three other copsiks there wasnt tide enough to pull him against the pedals straps ran from the belt around his waist to the bicycle frame forcing his legs down against the pedals pushed him up against the belt after the first session hed thought he was crippled for life the endless passage of days had toughened him his legs no longer hurt and the muscles were hard to the touch the bicycle gears were of old metal they squealed as they moved and gave forth a scent of old animal grease the frame was massive of cut wood there had been six sets of gears once gavving could see where two had been ripped out the frame was anchored to the trunk where the tuft grew thin foliage grew around the copsiks surrounded by sky with most of the tuft below them they could still snatch and eat a handful while pedaling they worked naked with sweat pooling on their faces and in their armpits high up along the trunk a wooden box descended slowly a similar box had risen almost out of sight gavving let his legs run on while he watched the elevator descend the mindless labor let his eyes and ears and mind run free there were other structures around the trunk this level was used for industry and here were all the men mans work and womans work never seemed to intersect in london tree at least not for copsiks sometimes children swarmed through or watched them with bright curious eyes today there were none the citizens of london tree must have kept copsiks for generations they were skilled at it they had chopped quinn tribe apart even if opportunity came to run how would he find minya gavving pumping steadily watched storms move sluggishly around a tight knot on the eastern arm of the smoke ring gold was nearer than he had ever seen it save for that eerie time when he was a child when gold had passed so near and everything had changed the jungle hovered hundreds of klomters beyond the out tuft a harmlesslooking green puffball how are you doing clave did that broken leg save your freedom merril were those shrunken legs finally good for something or have you become copsiks among the jungle people or are you dead over the past eightyfive days or so twenty sleeps the tree had drifted to the eastern fringes of the cloud bank hed been told during the trip across the sky to london tree that the tree could move by itself he had seen no evidence of it rain swept across them from time to time surely the tree had collected enough water by now the elevator had settled into its slot and was releasing passengers gavving and the others stopped pedaling navy men horse puffed come for the women gavving said what citizens live in the out tuft when you see a boxful come down and its all men theyre come for the women gavving looked away nine sleeps said horse he was in his fifties three cemeters shorter than gavving with a bald freckled head and tremendously strong legs he had driven the bicycles for two decades forty days till we meet the women you wouldnt believe how rancy i get thinking about it by now gavving was strangling the handbar horse saw the muscles standing out along his arms and said boy i forgot i was never married myself i was born here failed the test when i was ten gavving forced himself to speak born here horse nodded my father was a citizen at least mother always said so who ever knows seems likely youd be taller if na na the jungle giants kids arent any taller than the citizens so children raised in the jungle grew taller without tide to compress them what are the tests like were na supposed to say okay the supervisor called pedal you copsiks and they did more passengers were coming down over the squeal of the gears horse said i flunked the obedience test sometimes im glad i didnt go huh go to another tree thats where you go if you pass the tests heh you are green arent you did you think your kids would stay as citizens if they passed the tests thats yes he hadnt been told that hed been allowed to assume it there are other trees how many who lives in them horse chuckled you want to know everything at once i think its four bud trees now settled by any copsik womans kid who passes the tests london tree goes between them trading for what they need any mans kid has the same chance as a citizens because nobody ever knows see i thought i wanted to go once but its been thirtyfive years i did think id be picked for service in the out tuft i shouldve been im secondgeneration and when they turned me down for that i damn near lost my testes for swatting a supervisor jorg therehorse indicated the man pedaling in front of himhe did poor copsik i dont know what the gentled ones do when the holidays come gavving still hadnt learned to shave without cutting himself it was not his choice all copsiks shaved he had seen no man wearing a beard in london tree save one and that one was patry a navy officer horse is that why they make us shave so the gentled ones wont be quite so obvious i never thought of that maybe horse you must actually have seen the tree move horses laughter brought a supervisors head around he lowered his voice did you think it was just a story we move the tree about once a year ive been on water details too to feed the carm whats it like its like the tide goes slantwise going to the treemouth is like climbing a hill you dont want any hunting parties out when it happens and you have to tilt the cookpot the whole trunk of the tree bendsalittle lawn said the grad trouble lawn glanced back the pond clung to the bark a flattened heinisphere the grad had run the hose into the water now the water was flowing up the outside of the hose forming a collar dont worry about it just get to the bicycle and pedal lawn told him and dont call me that the grad strapped himself to the saddle and started the pedals turning the gears moved a pump it was all starstufl metal discolored with age the collar of water shrank as water was sucked into the hose it was strange work for the quinn tuft scientist or for the london tree scientists apprentice for that matter hadnt kiance suggested that he would be better off than the standard run of copsiks he wondered what gavving was doing now probably worrying about his new andalienwife andwithreason water spurted from the hose as lawn carried it into the carm the grad couldnt see what she was doing in there he pedaled in klances presence the grad was lawns equal otherwise lawn treated him as a copsik a spy or both he was clean fed and clothed of the rest of quinn tribe he had not even rumors he and lawn and the scientist explored the cassettes together for old knowledge and that was fascinating enough but he was learning nothing that would rescue quinn tribe it was night both voy and the sun were hidden behind the in tuft in the peculiar light that remained two faint streamers of blue light fanned out from the tuft if he stared at them they went away he could catch them by looking near them he could almost imagine human shapes pouring as smoke from a squeezegourd to starboard the blue ghost to port even fainter the ghost child the scientist had told him that they were discharges of peculiar energies from the poles of voy itself the scientist had seen them when he was younger but the grad had never been able to see them not even from the midpoint of daltonquinn tree he was sweating he watched the elevator climb the tree to its housing a navy man and two copsiks emerged none were jungle giants he had never seen a firstgeneration copsik at the citadel barring himself they entered the scientists laboratory complex and presently left carrying the dishes from brunch lawn called from the carm the tanks full the grad moved with a briskness he didnt feel unfastening the belt jerking the hose free of the pond there were lineholds wooden hoops set in the bark to crisscross the citadel region the grad used them to make his way toward the carm calling ahead of him can i help just coil the hose lawri answered she hadnt yet let him into the carm during this operation the hose must lead somehow into a water tank in the carm they filled it repeatedly and a couple of days later they would fill it again the grad coiled the hose as he moved toward the carm he heard cursing from within then lawn called i cant move this damn fitting the grad joined her at the doors show me that easy she showed him the hose attached to a thing on the back wall with a collar it has to be turned that way she rotated her hands he set his feet grasped the metal thing put his back into it the collar lurched again he turned it until it was loose in his hands and kept turning the hose came loose a mouthful of water spilled out lawri nodded and turned away scientists apprentice where does the water go its taken apart she said the skin of the carm picks up sunlight and pumps the energy into the water the water comes apart oxygen goes in one tank and hydrogen goes in the other when they come together in the motors the energy comes back and you get a flame he was trying to imagine water coming apart when lawn asked why did you want to know i was a scientist why did you tell me she sent herself skimming across the seats and settled herself at the controls the grad moored the coiled hose to fixtures in the cargo area the tank must be behind the wall the carm had been nearly out of fuel which came in two flavors there must be fuel by now the artificial pond was visibly shrunken lawri tapped the blue button as he came up behind hen the display shed been studying disappeared before he could see it the grad had half forgotten his question when she turned to him and said the scientist quizzes me like that since i was ten if i cant answer i get some dirty job but i dont like having my buttons pushed jeffer and that information is classified scientists apprentice who is it that calls you lawn not you copsik i know that the scientist my parents i dont know anything about marriage customs here copsiks dont get married youre not a copsik would your husband call you lawri the airlock thumped and lawn turned in some relief kiance yes put that display on again will you lawn she looked at the grad then back at klance now said the scientist lawn obeyed shed made her point shed show scientific secrets to a copsik but only under protest dominance games again if she really cared she would have removed the hose herself theblueightsandnumbershadtodowithwhatmovedthecarm as green governed the carms sensing instruments and yellow moved the doors and white read the cassettes and more he was sure that they all did more than he knew and red hed never seen red every time he saw this display certain numbers were larger now they read h klance was nodding in approval ready to go any time still i think well feed in the rest of the reservoir jeffer come here he cut the blue display and activated the yellow this number tells you if theres a storm coming if you watch it what is it its the external air pressure cant you see a storm coming coming yes forming no if the pressure goes up or down fast over a day or so theres a storm forming lets you impress hell out of the citizens this is classified of course the grad asked where does the tree go from here out of this rain then on to brighton tree they havent seen us in a while grad youll get a good chance to look the bud colonies over and pick and choose among them for what kiance for your children of course the grad laughed klance how am i going to have children if i spend my life at the citadel dont you know about the holidays i never heard of them well every yearsend when voy crosses in front of the sun the copsiks all get together at the treemouth its holiday for six days while the copsiks mate and gossip and play games even the food comes from the out tuft the holidays start in thirtyfive days no exceptions not even for a scientists apprentice dont worry youll go klance chuckled lawn had turned away showing her bowed back the wealth of blonde hair floating around her he wondered then how would lawn have children the scientist didnt seem to be her lover the grad knew that he imported copsik women from the in tuft if she never left the citadelhow would lawri ever find a man me a copsik could have children but lawn could not it couldnt be helped he dared not think of lawri as other than an enemy there was flesh against her as she woke it happened often minya shifted position and refrained from wrapping her arms around the citizen who slept beside her she might hurt him her motion wakened him he turned carefullyhis arm was bound with cloth against his torsoand said good morning good morning hows your arm she searched her memory for his name you did a good job on it but itll heal i wondered why you came looking for me given that i broke it he scowled you stuck in my head while lawn was setting the bone i kept seeing your face two cemeters away with your teeth bared like you were going for my throat next yeah so im here the scowl relaxed under eh different circumstances better now yes his name surfaced karal i dont remember a lawri lawris not a copsik shes the scientists apprenticeone of his apprentices nowand she treats navy men if we get hurt one of his apprentices minya gambled i hear the new one is a copsik yes i saw him from a distance and hes not a jungle giant one of yours maybe she stood donned her poncho will we meet again he hesitatedmaybeand added the holidays are eight sleeps away she let her smile show through gavvingl how long do they last six days and all work stops well i have to get to work now karal disappeared into the foliage while minya strolled into the commons she missed daltonquinn tuft shed grown almost used to the obtrusive differences the huge commons the omnipresent supervisors hen own servility but little things bothered her she missed cupvines and copter plants nothing grew here but the foliage and the carefully cultivated earthlife beans and melons and corn and tobacco as thoroughly regimented as herself a dozen copsiks were up and stirring minya looked for jinny and spotted her at the treemouth just her head showing above the foliage as she fed the tree the schedules were loose if you arrived late you would work late beyond that the supervisors didnt care much but minya cared she would do nothing badly she would be an exemplary copsik until the time came to be something else she tried to remember nuances of karals speech a citizens accent was odd and she had been practicing it it had been strange for minya her instincts were at war a conditioned reflex that resisted sexual assault as blasphemy incarnate versus the will to live survival won she would do nothing badly jinny stood up set her poncho in order then sprinted west minya screamed she was too far to do anything but shout and point as she ran a pair of supervisors much closer saw what was happening and ran too jinny plunged through a last screen of foliage into the sky minya kept running the supervisors had reached the edge dloris swung a weighted line round her head twice and out haryet waited her turn then swung her own line while dloris pulled the line resisted as she pulled it in then gave abruptly dioris reeled back off balance minya reached the edge in time to see the stone at the end of haryets line spin round jinny dlonis threw her line while jinny was still fighting haryets jinny thrashed then went limp haryet pulled hen in jinny huddled on her side face buried in her arms and knees by now they were surrounded by copsiks while dlonis gestured them away haryet rolled jinny on her back groped for hen chin and pulled her face out of the protection of her arms jinnys eyes stayed clenched like fists minya said madam supervisor a moment of your attention dionis looked around surprised at the snap in minyas voice later she said jinny began to sob the sobs shook her like ialtonquinn tree had shaken the day it came apart haryet watched for a time impassively then she spread a second poncho oven the girl and sat down to watch hen dlonis turned to minya what is it if jinny tries this again and succeeds would it reflect badly on you it might well jinnys twin sister is with the women who carry guests jinny has to see her thats forbidden the jungle giantess said wearily when citizens talked like that minya had learned to ignore them these girls are twins theyve been together all their lives they should be given some hours to talk i told you its forbidden that would be your problem dlonis glared in exasperation go join the garbage detail no wait first talk to this jinny if shell talk yes supervisor and id like to be checked for pregnancy at your convenience later minya bent to speak directly into jinnys ear jinny its minya ive talked to dlonis shell try to get you together with jayan jinny was clenched like a knot jinny the grad made it hes at the citadel where the scientist lives nothing just hang on will you hang on something will happen talk to jayan see if shes learned anything treefodder there must be something she could say find out where the pregnant women are kept see if the grad even comes down to examine them he might tell him were hanging on waiting jinny didnt move hen voice was muffled all right im listening but i cant stand it i cant youre tougher than you think if another man picks me ill kill him some of them like women who fight minya thought she said instead wait wait till we can kill them all after a long time jinny uncurled and stood up chapter sixteen rumblings of mutiny gavving woke to a touch on his shoulder he looked about him without moving there were three tiers of hammocks and gavvings was in the top layer the daylit doorway made a black silhouette of a supervisor he seemed to have fallen asleep standing up easy enough in london trees gentle tide in the dimness of the barracks alfin clung to gavvings h immockpost he spoke in a whisper that wanted to shout in jubilation theyve put me to work at the treemouth i thought only women did that gavving said without moving at all jorg snored directly below hima gentled man pudgy and sad and too stupid to spy on anyone but the h immocks were closepacked i saw the farm when they took us for showers theres a lot theyre doing wrong i talked to a supervisor about it he let me talk to the woman who runs the farm kors her name and she listens im a consultant clood give me a couple of hundred days and i might get you in on it too i want to show what i can do first did you get a chance to speak to minya or jinny dont even think it theyd go berserk if wq tried to talk to the women to be a treemouth tender again seeing minya but not allowed to speak to hen meanwhile maybe aliin could carry messages if he could be talked into taking the risk gavving put it out of his mind i learned something today the tree does move and its the carm the flying box that moves it theyve settled other trees what does that do for us i dont know yet alfin moved away to his hammock patience came hard to gavving in the beginning he had thought of nothing but escape at night he could drive himself mad with worry over minya or he could sleep and work and wait and learn the supervisors wouldnt answer questions what did he know what had he learned the women farmed the treemouth and cooked pregnant women lived elsewhere men tended machinery and wonked with wood here in the upper reaches of the tuft the copsiks talked of rescue but never of revolt they wouldnt revolt now anyway with the holidays eight sleeps away afterward maybe but wouldnt the navy know that from experience theyd be ready the supervisors were never without their truncheons sticks of hardwood half a meter long horse said the women supervisors carried them too during an insurrection the navy might be given those instead of swords or not what else bicycle works wore out damaging themdamaging anything made of starstuffwould hurt london tree but not soon here was where the elevators could be sabotaged but the navy could still put down a revolt by using the carm the carm did everything it lived at the trees midpoint where the scientist kept his laboratory was the grad there was he planning something hed seemed determined to escape even before they reached london tree was any of that worth anything if we were together we could plan something he had learned that he might spend the rest of his life moving an elevator on pumping water up the trunk he had not had an allergy attack since his capture it was not a bad life and he was dangerously close to becoming used to it in eight sleeps he would be allowed to see his own wife carther states was setting fires halfway around the biggest flower in the universe clave flapped his blanket at the coals his arms were plunged elbowdeep in the foliage to anchor him his toes clutched the edge of the blanket he undulated his legs and torso to move the blanket in waves exerting himself just enough to keep the coals red eighty meters away a huge silver petal gradually shifted position turning to catch the sun at a sharper angle a fire would die in its own smoke without a breeze and breezes were rare in the jungle the day was calm and bright clave took it as a chance to exercise his legs there was a knot as big as a boys fist where the break had been on his thighbone his fingers could feel the hard lump beneath the muscles his body felt it when he moved merril had told him it couldnt be seen would she lie to spare him he was disinclined to ask anyone else he was disfigured but the bone was healing it hurt less every day the scar was an impressive pink ridge he exercised and waited for war there had been tens of days of sleep merging into pain hed seen spindly impossibly tall nearhuman forms flitting about him at all angles green shapes fading like ghosts into a dark green background quiet voices blurred in the eternal whisper of the foliage he had thought he was still dreaming but merril was real homely legless merril was entirely familirr entirely real and mad as hell the copsik runners bad taken everyone everyone but us they left us ill make them sorry for that he had taken little notice in the pain of a healing bone and the sharperacheofhisfailure ahuntleaderwhobadlost histeam a chairman who had lost his tribe quinn tribe was dead he told himself that depression always followed a serious wound he stayed where he was deep in the dark interior of the jungle for fear that fluff might grow in the wound and he slept he slept a great deal he didnt have the will to do more merril tried to talk to him things werent that bad the grad had impressed the carthers merril and dave were welcome in the tribe though as copsiks once he woke to find merril jubilant theyll let me fight she said and dave learned that the carthers were p inning war against london tree over the following days he grew to know tjie jungle people of around two hundred carthers half were copsiks it didnt seem to carry any onus copsiks here lacked for nothing save a voice in the council he saw many children and many pregnancies and no starvation the jungle people were healthy and happy and better armed than quinn tribe had been he was questioned at a gathering of the tribe carther states commons was a mere widening in a tunnel perhaps twelve meters across and twice that long surprisingly the space held everyone men and women and children copsiks and citizens all clung to the cylinder wall covering it with an inner layer of heads while comlink or the sharman spoke from one end how can you even reach london tree he had asked but only once that information was classified spies would not be tolerated but he could watch the preparations he was sure these fires were part of it he had been flapping wind at the coals for half a day now his leg was holding up soon he would have to shift position kara the sharman came skimming toward him she dipped her grapnd into the foliage and stopped herself next to clave how are you doing you tell me does the fire look right she looked keep it that way feed it another branch a few hundred breaths from now hows the leg fine can we talk ive other fires to check the sharman was carther states equivalent to the scientist maybe the word had meant chairnan once she seemed to have more power than the political boss the comlink who spent most of his time finding out what everybody else wanted getting her attention was worth a try clave said sharman im a tree dweller were going to attack a tree shouldnt you be using what i know she considered that what can you tell me tides youre not used to tides i am and so are these copsik runners if you her smile was twisted put you in charge of our own warriors not what i meant attack the middle of the tree make them come to us there i saw them fighting in freefall and youre better we thought of that she saw his grimace no dont stop im glad you agree weve watched london tree for decades now and two of us did escape once we know that the copsiks live in the inner tuft but the carrier is kept at the center of the tree should we go after that first science at the level of the carrier the flying box made clave uneasy he tried to set the feeling aside i saw how they use that thing they put their own warriors where they want them and leave yours floundering in air yes get the carrier first even if you cant fly it all right sharman i dont know how you plan to attack if youll tell me more i can give you better answers hed said it before it was like talking to the tree kara freed her grapnel with a snap of the snag line she was moving on theefodder clave added one thing if i know the grad he knows how to fly the carrier by now if bes had any kind of a chance at it or gavving might have seen something and told the grad theres no way well learn that dave shrugged well go for the carrier and try for the grad dave pushed a dead spine branch into the coals and resumed flapping his blanket kara said you call yourself sharman chairman of a destroyed people i trust you know how to be a leader if you learn things thatshouldnotbeknown toourenemies if you rideto warinthe first gust of warriors what would you tell my citizens if you were me that was clear enough clave must not live to be captured and questioned sharman i have little to lose if i cant rescue my people ill kill copsik runners merril shell fight with me not under tides though and dont tell her anything i wont kill merril if shes captured fair enough you called the funnel a treemouth i was wrong wasnt i the jungle cant feed itself that way theres not enough wind what is it its what makes the jungle move the petals are part of it too whatever side of the jungle is most dry there the funnel wants to face the petals reflect sunlight to swing the jungle round in that direction you talk like the jungle is a whole creature that thinks she smiled its not very smart were fooling it now the fires are to make the jungle dry on one side there are tens of life forms in the jungle one of them is a kind of spine for the whole thing its life is deep down and it lives off the dead stuff that drifts toward the center everything in the jungle contributes something the foliage is various plants that root in what the jungleheart collects but they rot and feed the jungleheart and shield the jungleheart if something big hits the jungle we do our part too we transport fertilizer down dead leaves and garbage and our own dead and we kill burrowing parasites how does a jungle move the grad didnt know the silver petals turn the jungle to put the funnel where the jungle is most dry if everything gets too dry then the funnel spits hot steam dave its time to put the fires out i must tell the others ill be back minya followed dloris through twisting branching tunnels minyas grip on jinnys arm was relaxed it would tighten if jinny tried anything foolish but the treemouth and any chance to leap into the sky were farther away with every step the way the tunnels twisted minya wasnt sure where she was near the midbranch she thought and the tuft would be narrowing toward the fin she couldnt see solid wood but from the way the spine branches pointed the branch was below and to her left earlier she had passed a branching tunnel and heard childrens laughter and the shouting of frustrated adults the schools she could find this place again the mouth of a woven hut showed ahead dloris stopped minya if anyone asks you and jinny both think youre pregnant so the scientists apprentice will examine you both jinny ill take you to your sister and what happens then is none of my business they had reached the hut dloris shooed them in two men waited inside one in navy blue the otherwho are you dioris demanded madam supervisor im jeffer the scientists apprentice other apprentice lawn is otherwise engaged to meet both minya and jinny was more than the grad had hoped for he introduced his navy escort to the women ordon was clearly interested ordon and dloris stayed while the grad questioned jinny she couldnt be pregnant the timing was wrong and he told her so she and dloris nodded as if theyd expected that and departed the hut through the back he asked minya the appropriate questions she hadnt menstruated since a dozen sleeps before daltonquinn tree caine apart he told the navy man im going to have to examine her ordon took the hint ill be right outside the grad explained what was needed minya stepped out of her ponchos lower loop lifted it and lay down on the table the grad palped her abdomen and her breasts he tested the secretions of her vagina in plant juices kiance had shown him how to use hed practiced such an ei rniination in quinn tuft with the scientist supervising as part of his training once no problem a normal pregnancy he said its anyones guess when it happened minya sighed all right dioris said so too at least it gives me a chance to see you could it be gavvings the timings right but youve been available to the citizens havent you minya shall i tell gavving its his let me think minya ran faces past her memory some were blurs and she liked it that way did they resemble gavving at all but the arrogant dwarf had claimed two of her sleeptimesno whats the truth you dont know thats right tell him that well just have to see what the child looks like all right jinny and dloris had gone down to the pregnant womens complex a good safe distance away luckily the grads guard was male a woman might not have given them privacy during the examination with her poncho hiked up and her legs apart minya said stay where you are in case ordon peeks in grad is there any chance of getting us out of here keeping his head clear wasnt easy under the circumstances but he made the effort dont move without me i mean it we cant do anything unless we can stop them using the carm i wasnt sure you were still with us with you he was startled though he had had doubts there was so much to learn here but what was it like for the others for gavving or minya of course i want to break us free but no matter what we do they can stop us while theyve got the carm and have you seen a dwarf around like harp he thought but minya hadnt known harp i know him mark acts like hes three meters tall but hes less than two thickbodied lots of muscles likes to show them off bruises healing on her arms helped her to remember hes important hes the only one who can use the old armor wed like him to meet with an accident if its convenient dont do anything till were ready to move she laughed suddenly i admire your coolness really look down she looked and blushed and covered her mouth how long ever since you pulled up your poncho im going to have a serious case of lovers plaint when i first met you i thought no dont move remember the guard he nodded and stayed where he was she said grad my guest i hope its gavvings but its already there no matter whose lets she sought words but the grad was already moving she finished in a breathless laugh solve your problem the poncho was ludicrously convenient it need only be pulled aside he had to bite hard on his tongue to hold his silence it was over in a few tens of breaths it took longer to find his voice thank you thank you minya its been shes i was afraid id be giving up women dont do that minyas voice was husky she laughed suddenly she the other apprentice is a citizen who treats me like a thieving copsik either im dirt for the treemouth or im a spy anyway its my problem thinks it wasnt a gift grad she reached down to squeeze his hands im sick of being treated like a copsik too when do we get loose quick it has to be the first officer has spoken we move the tree as soon as possible whens that days maybe less ill know when i get back to the citadel lawris up there countingdown the carms motor systems id give either testicle to be in two places at once but i couldnt miss the chance to talk to you can you pass a message to gavving no way at all okay theres a cluster of huts under the branch and thats where the women stay when they carry guests for more tidal pull while the babys developing so is there anyone at the treemouth that you want fighting beside you maybe she thought of heln maybe isnt good enough skip the treemouth if something happens grab jayan and anyone else you think you need and go up a lot of the men spend their time at the top of the treemouth we can hope gavving and alfin are there but wait till something drastic happens chapter seventeen when birnham wood the huge silver petals were rising folding inward the funnel at their center faced east and out and the sun was moving into line with the funnel gold was eastward and seemed close the sluggish whorl of storm was a strange sight neither mundane nor scientific but mindgripping clave and kara were alone the other firetenders had gone elsewhere after the fires were quenched the sharman asked do you know the law of reaction im not a baby when the steam spits from the funnel the jungle moves in the opposite direction that would be back to moister surroundings back into the smoke ring if we werent meddling afterward something must be regrown fuel perhaps it takes twenty years thats why theyve been getting away with the raids yes but no more the petals stood at thirty degrees from vertical the sun shone directly into the funnel and the petals were shining into it too the funnel cupped an intolerable glare kara said the jungleheat spits when the sun shines straight into the blossom its not easy to make it spit at a chosen time but this day i think it came as if by the sharmans command a soft bonesh lking fumf from the funnel clave felt heat on his face the jungle shuddered kara and clave clung tight with hands and feet a cloud began to form between himself and the sun a column of steam racing away from him he felt a tug a tide pulling him toward the sky it works he said i didnt how long till we reach the tree a day maybe less the warriors are gathering now what why didnt you tell me without waiting for an answer clave dove into the foliage his thoughts were murderous had she cost him his place in the coming battle why four copsiks were running the elevator lines with their legs and the grads eye caught gavving among them the elevator had almost reached its cradle was there no way to tell him minyas with the pregnant women shes flne im in the citadel ordon said so you couldnt wait for the holidays the grad jumped violently for a moment he was actually floating ordon bellowed laughter hey forget it its nothing with a chance like that how could you not thats why dloris got a little upset when she saw you werent lawn the grad grinned a sickly grin did you watch the whole time no i dont need to get my kicks that way i can visit the commons i just poked my head in and saw what you were poking and pulled it back out again he put the grad into the elevator with a friendly forceful shove in the small of his back and followed him in he seemed friendly enough but first and last he was the grads guard the grad was not to be harmed the grad was not to escape he liked to talk but they had come to the pregnant womens complex the long way round by way of the navy installation on the fin they had returned by the same route presumably ordon had some business on the fin the grad had asked about it ordon had become coldly suspicious he would not talk to a copsik about his work the tuft sank away this was far easier than the fourday climb up daltonquinn tree a flock of small birds was veering wide of the trunk harebrains ordon said good eating but you have to use the carm to chase them down the old scientist used to let us do that klance wont a streamer of rain was blowing across the out tuft was that why the first was so eager to move the tree wet citizens a mobile tree it boggled the mind find your own weather a fluffy green bauble hung east of the out tuft with a strange spreading plume of white mist behind it within a day or two london tree would have put it from sight the grad wondered if he was being unreasonably antsy the carm could reach carther states across any distance if he couldnt capture the carm he would be here forever and if he could what was the hurry but time had a choke hold on his throat life was not intolerable for the scientists apprentice in a hundred sleeps he might grow into this new life when the time came he feared he would move too slowly or not at all clave found merril in the commons she was dipping the points of crossbow bolts in the evilsmelling brew the carthers made from poison fern the increasing tide caught clave jumping toward her he paused then floated back laughing its real i sure wasnt going to call her a liar but clave whats happening merril was drifting too arrows all about her she managed to catch the poison pot and cap it before it spilled were on our way the warriors are on the surface clave jumped to his pack against the pull of the strange tide he had readied it some sleeps ago merril barked what how long have we got she had spent her days learning how to make arrows twist bowstrings shape a crossbow and fire it clave had watched her at target practice she was as good as most of the carthers and her powerful arms were faster at resetting the crossbow he said it anyway merril youre in carther states whether you go or not a lot of carthers arent citizens you dont have to go you can feed that to the tree chairman dave shoved a handful of the freshly poisoned bolts into his quiver then grab your gear and go the tide was about like that in quinn tuft using the tunnels was almost like walking but it was strange every branchlet and foliage tuft had the tremors clave pulled himself through crackling branchiets and soft green turf through to the sky a column of cloud raced outward from beyond the jungles horizon the surface was nearly vertical he took care for his handholds skeletal warriors emerged like earthworms out of the green billows fifty or sixty carthers had already chosen and boarded pods clave was annoyed the sharman had told him late and nobody had told merril why to give them a chance to back out sure id have fought but i didnt get the word in time maybe the carthers needed copsiks more than citizens he helped merril through the foliage the light of battle was in her eye she said the copsik runners left us behind not worth their time i had a broken leg clave got it then and bid his grin they made a terrible mistake leaving you though theyll find out dont you laugh she shook a harpoon its point was stained with evil yellow this goop will drive you crazy if it doesnt kill you the sky was a vast sheet of cloud lightning flashed in dark rifts clave searched the western fringe until he found a thin line of shadow london tree was too big to hide in a cloud fifty klomters or so half the length of daltonquinn but five times the long axis of this puffball jungle the comlinks chosen leader anthon already had his legs wrapped around the largest pod anthon was brawnier than the average carther man and darker to clave he might have had a fragile look with long bones that could be snapped at whim but he was festooned with weaponry crossbow and bolts and a club with a knot on the end his nails were long and sharp scars showed here and there on his body and in fact he looked savage and dangerous the stemends of the jet pods had been pierced by wooden stakes that now served as plugs a warrior would nestle into the inner curve of the pod and move his weight to guide it clave had used up a few pods practicing there were more pods than warriors a hundred or so spaced wide apart and tied down with light line merril chose one and boarded it dave asked shall i tether you ill handle it she swung her coil of line below her and caught it coming up clave shrugged and chose his own pod it was bigger than he was but less massive thirty kilos or so men outnumbered women but not by a lot merril said notice the women you fight for citizenship in carther states a citizen makes a better wife the family gets two votes clave how are they doing this classified he grinned and ducked the butt of her harpoon i cant tell you everything the sharman says the jungle will pass the tree at an angle about midpoint with a klomter to spare by then well have launched well match speed with the tree and come in while theyre still terrified how do we get back i asked that too daves brows furrowed lizeth and fluid are bringing extra pods theyll hover in the sky till they see the battles over but theyll just be caught with the rest of us if the copsik runners use the carm weve got to take the carm what are we trying to do exactly i mean you and me gather quinn tribe we want to look good to carther states but quinn tribe comes first i wish i knew where they all are mist was drifting over them seeping into the foliage a wind was rising storm blurred the sky he kept his eyes on the faint shadowy line of london tree which was nearer and growing the out tuft was nearest the citizens tuft citizens would be first to see the oncoming terror a green mass klomters across flying at the trunk green warriors coming out of the sky not much chance of surprise here the jungle too was too big to be hidden realistically they hadnt a ghost of a chance of rescuing anybody they would do as much damage as possible and die why not attack the out tuft first kill some citizens and theyd remember better too late now the sherman was klomters away tending a pillar of fiery steam aiming it to send the jungle a fingernails width from the tree fat chance of getting to her with a change in plan the line within the fog had solidified into a tremendous integral sign tufted at the ends every carther now held a sword dave drew his warriors anthon bellowed he waited for silence then cried our attack must be remembered its not enough to break some heads we must damage london tree london tree must remember for a generation to come that offending carther states is dangerously stupid unless they remember they will come when we cannot move let them remember the lesson launch sixty swords slashed at the lines that tied them to the jungle sixty hands pulled the plugs from the stemends of sixty jet pods pods jetted away in a wind that smelled of rotted plants at first they clustered even bumping into each other then they began to separate not all jet pods thrust alike clave clung with arms and legs tight against the screaming pod he was wobbling a little more than the others unskilled blood was drain ing from his head the tide was ferocious the sky was dark and formless and lightning flashed nearby they were approaching the center of the tree as planned there at the midpoint was the carrier its nose against the trunk its tail was on fire lawn tapped the blue button in a row of five blue numbers flickered and steadied in the bow window blue lights appeared in the panel below four clumps of four little vertical dashes each in diamond patterns around a larger vertical bar the array tickled at the grads memory lawns hands hovered like harp about to play strap in kiance said lawn looked back in annoyance then tapped rapidly the grad got it then he was in a chair when the carm roared and trembled and lunged tide pulled the grad back in his seat then eased off it hadnt mattered in quinn tuft but the scientist had drummed it into his head not tide this was thrust it might feel the same but causes and consequences were different the dead scientists legacy thrust the bow window nestled snug against the trunk a breeze had sprung up eddies swirled through the airlock doors the grad couldnt see anything of import through the side windows lawn activated green patterns and tapped at them within the bow window appeared a smaller window in which an edge of sky peeped around a glare of white light an aft view within the forward view disconcerting kiance was going for a better look he made his way to the airlock gripping chair backs as he went the grad followed a few kilograms of tide of thrust took the vibrating walls forward past him till he hit the aft wall with a solid thump kiance was braced in the outer door all of his fingers and toes gripping the rim ill let you see in a minute jeffer dont fall out you might not get back he craned his head out damnation what is it its the jungle i had no idea they could move the jungle hah well give them a surprise well just move away from them kiance grinned over his shoulder he saw the grad brace himself too late the grads foot lashed out and caught the scientist above the hip kiance yelled and flew outward long fingers and toes still clung the grads heel smashed at a hand and a foot kiance disappeared he moved into the outer door and leaned out the drive screamed in his ears the tree was massive but it was moving klance drifted slowly aft thrashing trying to reach the nets on the carms hull in his terror he seemed to have forgotten his line he saw the grad leaning out and shrieked at him curses or pleading the grad couldnt tell he looked away the tree now had a slight curve to it like minyas bow the carm thrust in the center and the tufts trailed behind not very far a stronger thrust might break the tree in the middle but the carm was so much tinier than the tree it was probably thrusting at full power now klance was a thrashing black shadow against a brilliance like voy brought close the carms main motor sprayed bluewhite fire pushing the carm forward against the mass of the tree klance was floating into the flame ordon halfway to the elevator had seen them the jungle had become half the sky scores of objects moved alongside it shapes like those hed seen before the bark raft crashed into the jungle jungle giants on jet pods but they wouldnt arrive if the carm continued to push the tree away he had to turn off the main motor now so he hadnt been premature hadnt murdered kiance for nothing lawrll he reentered the carm and leapt toward the bow lawn hadnt seen him she stiffened suddenly and half rose staring aghast at the rear window display a shadow was thrashing in the flame dissolving she whirled about she was staring him in the eye when the grad lashed out at her jaw her head snapped back she bounced against her straps and hung limp the grad used his line to tie her to one of the chairs he sat down at the controls and studied them yellow governed life support systems including interior lights and the airlock green governed the carms senses internal and external blue had to do with what moved the carm including the motors the two flavors of fuel supply the water tank and fuel flow white read the cassettes what had lawri done to activate the drive his mind had gone blank he tapped the blue button no good the blue displays disappeared but the motors roar continued he restored the display through a side window he glimpsed patches of navy blue cloth moving across the bark no time think blue vertical bar surrounded by blue dashes in a pattern like the motors at the stern he tapped the blue bar the roar and the trembling died to nothing the tree recoiled he felt himself pulled forward then it was quiet kendy was prepared to beam his usual message when the source of hydrogen light disappeared that was puzzling normally the carms main motor would run for several hours that or the attitude jets would send it jittering about like the ball in a soccer match kendy held his attention on a drifting point within the smoke ring maelstrom and waited a dozen navy men were making their way toward the carm using lines and the lineholds wary that he might start the drive again ordon was far ahead of the rest mere meters from the window there was murder in his face quick now hit the yellow button the display was too cluttered turn off the blue yellow display interior lights showed dim internal wind on temperature shown by a vertical line with numbers and a notch in the middle here a complicated line thawing of the carms cabin seen from above the grad closed lines that should represent the doors with a pinching motion of his fingertips behind him the airlock sealed itself lawn stirred he heard muted clanging from the doors the grad began playing with the green displays summoning different views from the carms cameras he had precious little time to learn to fly this starstuff relic he felt lawris eyes on him but would not look the clanging stopped then resumed elsewhere ordon snarled through a side window he must be clinging to the nets pounding at the glass the grad moved to the window he spoke a word ordon reacted puzzledhe couldnt hear the grad repeated it exaggerating the motions of his lips the word that would justify murdering his benefactor kiance assaulting lawn betraying his friend ordon leaving london tree helpless against attack war ordon war chapter eighteen the war of london tree clave was being left behind the carthers had judged him a novice and he was he hadnt known how to choose among these strange pods they had let him pick a slow one hed flown past the trunk his path was curving back now he would be among the last halfdozen to land lines ran along the trunk of london tree and wooden boxes were rising toward the center from both ends clave saw both boxes break open almost simultaneously spilling men in blue eight to a box the copsik runners seemed to know what they were about they rapidly oriented themselves and fired small jet pods to send them toward the midpoint of the tree on the eastern face toward the carrier twentyodd copsik runners already surrounded it the flame at its tail had died for whatever that might mean the carthers had passed the trunk in a gust of jet pods now they were returning coming up on the western side of the trunk drastically spread out feathered harpoons flew from the copsik runners long footbows the carther warriors sent crossbow bolts among them they outnumbered the enemy almost two to one the jungle was tremendous a green world passing less than a klomter away clave had wondered if it would actually hit the tree but it seemed to be going past the steam jet had stopped firing the jungle trailed a curdled line of cloud an a storm of birds trying to catch up and two dark masses lizeths and hilds clusters of twenty jet pods each this close to the tree the curve of the trunk hid the ancient carrier and its mooring but both gusts of enemy reinforcements seemed to be converging on the carrier they would know its value too they flew behind a thicket of feathered harpoons the jet from claves pod died away curses ran through his mind while he clambered around the pod to put it between himself and the harpoons he was still approaching the trunk others were there first carthers were using lineholds about the clustered buildings to dodge the feathered harpoons or tearing up sheets of bark for shields the copsik runners preferred to fire on them from the sky where their limbs were free to work their huge bows anthon and a dozen warriors were firing at the carrier using the curve of the trunk as cover merrils pod struck a wooden hut with merril behind it shed used the pod as a shock absorber good technique some of the copsik runners were trying to reach that building merril shot two from behind the building then abandoned the shelter when the rest came too close something valuable in that building the copsik runners seemed to want it clave put an arrow among them and thought he hit someones foot they wanted the carrier more clave could see it now they were all over it hanging on the nets and the bark most of the carther warriors had reached the trunk clave would touch down inward from the battle presently for now he could only watch from the chaos of battle patterns began to form the copsik runners were outnumbered they hung back for that reason and another in close work they couldnt use the bows they had swords and so did the carthers but the taller carthers had more reach they won such encounters the copsik runners had small jet pods the kind that would grow on an integral tree they preferred to stay in the sky clave watched carthers leap into an eightman gust of blue ponchos the copsik runners used their jet pods left carthers floundering in the sky behind them and fired back with the footbows then two carthers were among them slaying and two more joined them in freefall the copsik runners fought like children the carthers robbed the corpses of their jet pods clave drifted and carther states was winning without him in along the trunk a wooden box was rising slowly it spilled reinforcements six blueclad footbowman and a bulky silver creature there was a terrible familiarity to that shape but they wouldnt arrive for a kilobreath yet a copsik runner spotted clave a sitting target he carefully fired a harpoon through claves pod then moved in along the trunk hed have a clear shot when clave came nearer clave fired at him no good the copsik runner dodged and waited clave could see his grin the grin vanished when merril shot him from behind the bolt protruded below the kidney he could have fought on but his face was a silent scream he clawed at the bolt then went into convulsions that poisonfern brew must be terrible stuff the pod bumped wood with clave behind it he turned it loose clutched bark and made his way toward merril with his crossbow ready he saw blue against storm cloud sky fired a bolt through one man and drew his harpoon as the other came at him with a sword the copsik runner came too fast clave batted him in the face with the crossbow handle and as he recoiled stabbed him in the throat merril was making her way around the curve of the bark he followed her she stopped and crouched a moment before he saw the carrier outward along the trunk copsik runners were all over it he moved up beside her she said all right why arent they killing us with that scientific thing good question clave watched anthons team launching crossbow bolts from around the curve of the wood the carriers guardians fired back not very successfully he said forget it they arent using it they are using those wooden boxes to get reinforcements lets cut the lines two lines as thick as claves arm ran parallel along the trunk the last box was on its way in nearly gone from sight another box must be rising clave and merril made their way to the nearest line and began to chop at it six men and a silver thing were coming into footbow range clave and merril set bark sheets to protect themselves clave stared at the silver man it was as if he were trying to remember a nightmare a man made of starstuff with a blank ball forahead clave fired at it until he saw a crossbow bolt strike and bounce away there were feathered harpoons in his shield and merrils clave saw three tiny things like thorns strike her shield in a line aimed at her bare head he yelled she ducked thorns spat into the trunk she said oh the silver man you know him yes keep chopping he was with the copsik runners in carther states we dont have anything to breech that armor another box had come into sight when the line parted that box began to drift men spilled loose and flew in curves podpropelled mpking for the trunk they seemed too far in to do anything useful the other line had gone slack merril said its a loop we dont have to cut the other one then lets get out there was a cable running outward no lets go join the victory party quick or well be left behind victory then clave saw what she meant greenclad warriors clustered round the carrier some were crawling into the doors men in blue floated about it with the looseness of dead men live copsik runners had retreated around the curve of the trunk to wait for reinforcements it looked like the war of the carrier was over but other copsik runners were coming too near clave had made a lucky shot there were five now plus the silver man ordon died with a bolt peeking through his chest the grad saw his face through the window but even if ordon could have heard him there was nothing left to say he turned back to the yellow display he had five floating rectangles in the bow window aft view dorsal ventral and both sides he caught glimpses of men in blue men and women in green impossible to tell who was winning three navy men moved into the cover of the drive motors the grad touched blue dashes flames burst near them they yelled threw themselves clear floundered to orient themselves and one had a bolt through his hip lawn screamed murdererl some of us dont like being copsiks the grad said some of us dont even like copsik runners kiance and i never treated you with anything but kindness thats true enough what have you done for the rest of quinn tribe did you forget that i had a tribe your tribe is deadi your tree is torn apart we could have been your tribe you treefeeding mutineer you the grad had no particular urge to stop her mouth lawns accusations only echoed those in his own mind he had made his decisions so he spoke without heat do you know whats been happening to our women gavving might have had permission to visit his wife thirtyodd days from now but any male citizen had rights to her any time he liked now shes pregnant she doesnt know who the father is and i dont either lawn said theyll kill you shall i tell you what the penalty is for mutiny feel free but i notice the line of argument has shifted she told him anyway it sounded dreadful enough good reason to keep the doors closed he had found the infrared display it showed him red dots in along the trunk he cut the infrared out and recognized clave and merril and navychasingthem includingwhathadtobeadwarfinapressure suit clave and merril then the carthers were actually on his side he had wondered the greenclad warriors rushed the carm when the navy retreated he was able to wrap one in flame not as a casual killing but as a signal to the carthers im with you for it was carthers who now swarmed the carm and navy who retreated around the trunk the grad opened two yellow lines with his fingertips he turned to greet the tall bloody jungle giants gavving was on his feet held upright by two men before he even started to wake up he said what we need pedalers someone said four navy men helped three sleepy copsiks out of the barracks and up through the tuft gavvmg held his temper and horse took it with typical docility but alfin was still protesting as they broke through into sunlight im the treemouth tenders assistant not a treefeeding pair of legs listen you were sending men up to the citadel as fast as we can weve worked the regular team half to death youll take your place and pedal with the rest and carry out my regular duties too ill be halfdead what do i tell the supervisor you board that bicycle on youll be telling your supervisor where your testes went just before the holidays too the copsiks on the platform were sheathed in sweat it drifted in droplets from their hair they panted like dying men the navy men helped three of them down wincing at the soggy touch other navy men were boarding the elevator half the sky was textured green the jungle the jungle had come to london tree only three navy men remained one was an officer gavving recognized him and he carried a piece of old science a talking box the rest had entered the elevator gavving was lifted into the saddle he started pedaling the elevator rose the jungle had attacked london tree the jungle was mobile who would have guessed the green cloud was awesomely close and receding he should be doing something but what armed men were watching the elevator was tens of klomters above him now and gavving was gasping he felt the change before he saw it suddenly it was easier to pedal the grating whine of the bicycle gears rose half an octave he looked up the elevator box was turning falling blue shapes spilled out and made for the trunk one was too slow when he reached the trunk he was moving too fast he bounced away spinning like a broken thing and continued to fall but the box was falling faster stop pedaling hold your places the officer ordered the invaders had cut the cable now what in takes you east the box wouldnt hit here it would strike farther east along the branch but where gavving pictured the massive wooden structure smashing through diffuse cottony foliage officer suppose that thing hits the pregnant womens complex its under the branch the man said minm it could hit somebody though damn theres the school complex karall move east along the top of the branch and get everyone underneath dont miss the examination hut docking section too then get under yourself if youre fast enough sir a navy manwounded with one arm bound across his chest darted awkwardly away two left the officer spoke to his talking box squad leader patry here the enemy has cut our elevator cables whats your status the answer was almost unintelligible with static gavving let his chin droop and his eyes half close and listened hard he heard elevators running we ing troops enemy numbers forgarbl repeat forty to fifty garble outnumbered theyre gentling us they garble the carm but even cant use tethered i see two dark masses west of here forget them trouble enough we are sending more men to the citadel patry out the grad recognized the longlimbed woman debby by her long straight brown hair the two men with her were strangers the crossbows aimed at him didnt bother him as much as their fear they didnt like the carm at all he spread open hands to the sides im the quinn tribe scientist the only one who can fly this thing good to see you debby lawn broke in with feed it to the tree mutineer youd lose us in the sky or smear us all over the trunk and this is lawn the copsik runner one snapped out of it im anthon this is prez debby told us about you grad can we leave immediately pile all our warriors on the nets and go the silver man is coming the grad said were tied to the tree cut those lines and were free to go but i dont leave without clave and merril and i think theres time to get one more thing he pointed into the dorsal window display anthon and debby very gingerly moved up behind him all this scientific stuff must be daunting that hut is the lab debby youll find some cassettes and the reader inside on the walls you remember what they look like debby nodded go get them anthon get some warriors to cut the carm loose he looked into the displays clave was towing merril as he jumped along the bark his legs serving both while she fired bolts at their pursuers one navy man was dropping back hurt the silver man came on the grad said see if you can give them some covering fire anthon said quietly youre not the leader here scientist here i am and i have had enough of being a copsik debby go get that treefodder for the scientist take a team prez get those cables chopped anthon waited until they were through the doors before he spoke again he wanted no witnesses to this discussion grad have you fought in war i captured the carm you i cap he trailed off never mind how many are you forty or less now we wont fit inside but we can hang on to the nets i want to set the rest of quinn tribe free theyre in the in tuft and i can find them the carms got plenty of what makes it go weve got the small motors for spraying fire it should be easy anthon was in no hurry to make a decision into the silence lawn said he cant fly the carm i can im the scientists apprentice why havent you killed this one anthon demanded hold it shes what she says and i did have to kill the scientist himself lawrihasagreat dealtoteach us ifshecanbetalkedinto it shes harmless as long as shes tied up anthon nodded she lives then but i lead carther states i captain the carm anthon stepped into the doors and began to shout orders hed let the word pass captain he who violated the grads orders aboard the carm would be a mutineer carthers chopped at the lines that tethered the carm crossbow bolts flew among the blue men who followed clave and merril those dove for cover on the bark the silver man caine on alone he wasnt using jet pods there must be something on the pressure suit itself the carm was drifting free lawri spoke in an angry whisper theyd kill me wouldnt they they dont have my reasons for liking you the grad said without overt sarcasm keep your opinions to yourself for a while if you can did you really think a jungle warrior would let you at the controls clave and merril and debby entered like a storm debby was gashed and bleeding along the ribs merril flew into the grad and hugged him grad i mean scientist good work i mean glorious can you run this thing the grad felt huge relief let clave play these dominance games with anthon the grad would captain the carm and hope lawn was wrong i can fly it clave asked can you find the rest of us theyre all in the in tuft gavvings at the top where we can get at him jayan and minya are with the pregnant women jinny and alfin should be in the commons we may have to leave the carm to get to them then its going to work i cant believe it the grad grinned so whyd you come never mind debby i got these we had to fight for them seven cassettes we couldnt find the reader maybe kiance had it it doesnt matter get into a chair you too clave merril strap down he looked into the displays in a few breaths we can what clave saw the displays floating in the bow window this place is too strange for me those pictures make my eyes cross i grad have you got anything to take out the silver man not unless he crawls into a motor thats a starmans pressure suit well hes killing all our allies that spitgun only puts you to sleep and makes you feel wonderful doesnt matter to us though theyre still out of action anthon good timing get into a chair anthon was panting his crossbow was on line with the grads eyes you waited too long that goddam silver get into a chair and strap down and tell me how many weve got left the grad was trying to watch all the displays at once carthers were disappearing over the trunks horizon too many floated limp some were being towed by others who hadnt been hit the man in the pressure suit was hovering over the carm firing darts the glazed look left anthons eyes he worked himself into a chair we cant hurt him i was the only one who even got to the carrier the rest wont come anyway theyre afraid of it we cant leave them the silver man darted down at the doors the grad pinched his fingers together the silver man shied back as the doors closed in his face then moved back into view in the dorsal display now he was gripping the nets on the hull hes on the carm said the grad take off said anthon leave we can leave my citizens if we take the silver man with us ive got spare jet pods coming good enough the grads fingers tapped the silver man was still hanging on the nets when the carm backed away from the trunk and started down chapter nineteen the silver man the laundry vat was a tall glass cylinder it hung from the underside of the branch from lines pounded into the black bark over minyas head around it ran an extensive wickerwork platform woven from live spine branches a layer of rocks beneath the vat supported a bed of coals a pipe ran all the way from the treemouth reservoir to supply the water an impressive achievement had minya not been too tired to appreciate it minya and lisa stirred dirty clothing in a matrix of foaming water with a paddle two meters long it took skill and fine attention left to itself the laundrysoup would have foamed right out of the vat clothing and all the supervisor haryet kept popping out to see how they were doing minya wasnt t eling awkward yet but there was the sense of a guest building inside her lisas pregnancy looked ludicrous a bulge on a straightedge like the others she seemed to have adjusted to her new status with little difficulty once she had told minys we know all our lives that the copsik runners might come for us well they came a chain of huts ran along the underside of the branch moat of the women preferred to stay inside they werent all pregnant some were nursing their erstwhile guests they all had wrk knitting sewing preparation of food to be cooked at the treemouth the quiet was broken by a hurried rustling then four people burst from the tunnel that led down from the examination hut jayan and jinny the supervisor dloris and a navy man with his arm in a sling karal spotted her ran to her gripped her aim she shied from his wildness youre all right he was gasping good minya stay under the branch dont let anyone anyone else go wandering we dont tend to were too awkward i thought men werent allowed im not staying minya its both elevators and at least one man theyre falling from thirty klomters up and we dont know just where theyll hit ive got to warn the children in the school complex he pointed a finger at the tip of her nose stay here and he sprinted for the tunnel wobbling chest heaving if something happens the grad had said something was happening all right but what would dloris know minya guessed where the supervisor would be she moved down the line of huts and entered the last one as dloris came through with haryet weve been counting dloris said gwens missing have you seen her three meters tall and pale as a ghost with a yearold guest not lately whats happening get those clothes out and drying and then put the fire out do you have lines good keep them handy the two supervisors moved on minya turned to jayan and jinny give us a hand jinny were lucky you were around were all together now do you know whats happening no karal looked scared stiff is it war better stick to our task till were sure lisa said they pulled the clothing from the vat in a geid mass manipulating it with poles some water remained they inverted the vat and moved back while the waterglob flowed sluggishly out onto the fire live steam didnt rise fast enough in london trees feeble tide it tended to expand in an invisible globe scalding hot minys had never seen that fire go out dioris must be expecting something drastic they continued to work they set the laundry in the press and cranked two great wooden slabs together water squeezed out around the edges of the wad of clothing then began to slide downward something smashed through foliage somewhere nearby they from then minya plunged into the branchiets with jmny and lisa behind they made their way toward the sound minya angled above where she thought it had stopped there a trail of broken branchlets she followed it down to the broken and twisted rempins of what had been a navy officer the corpse wore a sword scabbarded and a quiver that was still full though the bow was missing now its war minya said well have to kill the supervisors lisa said minya jumped what it was as if a stone had spoken never mind youre right i thought you were i thought youd given up lisa only shook her head west takes you in in takes you easl at first the grad held the bow window pointed straight down they dropped smoothly faster he swung the cairn to point west and fired aft jets to correct as it drifted away from the trunk his passengers were rigid with terror save for lawn who was rigid with fury they still had a passenger on the hull anthons voice wanted to stutter he wouldnt let it i want to point out that we could go back to carther states now weve got the silver man and the cairn these copsik runners dont own anything they value more we can trade for your copsiks that actually sounded sensible the grad said dave feed it to the tree anthon said you want to kill some copsik runners au right i can underst i want to rescue them myself i am the quinn tribe chairman they are entitled to my protection clave spat the word trade they attacked us we attacked them weve got the carm and well have our people too all right gradscientist have you got an opinion they were dropping too fast the grad swung the carm nosedown and fired forward jets he said nice of you to ask weve got the scientists apprentice and the silver suit and the only man alive who can fit into it maybe they would trade we keep the carm never said lawn trade with copsiks anthon and dave looked at each other the grad said never mind and they laughed lawris tone of voice said it all minya stopped and looked out through a screen of branchiets the supervisors had found gwen haryet was scolding her as they led her toward the huts haryet was secondgeneration copsik shorter than minya she looked tiny beside her very pregnant captive theyll have heard us coming minya thought jinny must have realized that too she stepped out through the crackling foliage ten meters east of minyas position good theyll think they heard one not two dioris came toward jinny with thunder in her face breaking new paths was strictly forbidden minya emerged behind haryet and stabbed her gwen turned with her baby in her arms and shrieked dloris whirled and stared perhaps this place of mothers and babies had given the supervisor a false sense of safety she reacted slowly before she could reach her truncheon jinny was pinning her arms and minya was running at her in long low leaps dioris flipped forward jinny flew over her back and came spinning at minya who lost a moment sidestepping then dioris held half a meter of hardwood at guard but she faced a navy sword wait she said wait my child will not be born a copsik minya screamed and lunged dloris danced backward the tunnel was behind her and minya knew she bad to stop the supervisor from reaching it she ran at her ready to bat the truncheon aside then jayan and lisa were moving into place behind dloris jayan held the big paddle well up the haft blade first like a twohanded sword dioris dropped her truncheon dont kill me please dioris tell us whats happening carther states is all over the trunk i dont know whos winning have they got the carm the cairn dioris showed nothing but astonishment they tied her with line lisa wanted to do more minya knew dioris too well to allow it she wouldnt have killed haryet either if if gavving watched the carm descend in fire patry was talking to his box too far away for gavving to hear but the navy officer looked furious and frightened he caught gavving watching him you all of you stay where you are move and youll be shot do you understand amy take cover the two navy men disappeared into the foliage presently alfin said were bait theres only two horse asked do you really think your friends have the carm what will they do with it rescue us gavving said with more assurance than he felt alfin when it comes down jump for the doors and hope they open alfin snorted youve got to be out of your mind look at that thing you want to ride in it ill ride anything to get out of here if i can take minya you dont have minya listen gavving i remember you with your eyes red and halfclosed and crying in rivers they make their own weather here nobody starves nobody goes thirsty its a good healthy tree with a good crop of earthilfe ive got a responsible position you like it here oh treefodder maybe i dont really like it anywhere i took orders in daltonquinn too im seeing a supervisor a nice woman even if she towers over me i didnt have that in quinn tuft kors a year or two old for the citizens but we get along and i dont like that box i do it was horse who bad spoken gavving cede me alfins place the carm was falling straight at them those had better be friends aboard he could only die fighting if they were not he told horse its not my decision just do what i do and well see what dave says done alfin last chance why alfin met his eyes theres tide here gwens shriek of terror had started her baby screaming he was quieter now gwens awareness was in the hands that stroked and patted the child there was none in her eyes the conspirators ignored gwen as she ignored them lisa led her back once when she tried to return to the huts they didnt want gwen talking to the others jayan asked lisa are you sure you want in on this jinny wasnt pregnant jayan and minya were qot obtrusively so lisa was she said my baby wont be born a copsik either the branch shuddered with the force of a tremendous blow lisa said the second elevator karal said two jayan said minya youve talked to the grad what did he say the grad said to go up hell try to capture the carm if he cant get the carm then hes dead lisa concluded and all the carther states warriors are going to die and well never get loose at all so hes got to have the carm hes got the carm and as many carther states warriors as he can get aboard and hes trying to reach us who goes with us nobody suggested a name jayan said were the only new copsiks let the rest run their own revolt you cant go up they turned surprised dloriss eyes shied from their potentially lethal attention she repeated doggedly you cant go up the tunnels lead to the fin and the treemouth there isnt any connecting tunnel to the top of the tuft thats where the men live none of you are in shape to tunnel through foliage and if you got to the top youd stand out like so many mobies in a stewpot then what stay here till your friends come for you lisa shook her head the childrens complex karal must have the upper reaches evacuated by now lisa its big and complicated and it doesnt connect to the top the most youd do is get lost whats your stake in this dloris let me live dont tell anyone i helped why i wanted to escape once myself now ive been a supervisor too long somebody would be sure to want me dead but you cant go up stay here and wait they looked at each other minya said you did that for thirty years no i think i know what we have to do the grad tapped at the motor controls tricky they had to be used in pairs and clusters or theyd spin the carm he dropped into the foliage several meters from the platform with a horrendous crashing and opened the doors at once three men jumped toward the door gavving gripped an older mans arm the third man wore blue and he was swinging a sword debby took careful aim and put a crossbow bolt through him gavving and the stranger pulled themselves inside the older man was gasping get us moving gavving said this is horse he wants to join quinn tribe alfin isnt coming he likes it here a feathered harpoon ricocheted through the doors the grad closed them he said i left minya and jayan in the pregnant womens compound what minya shes carrying a guest gavving your child and men arent permitted there later the grad would tell bim the truth part of it for now for witnesses and the record minya is carrying her husbands chikl lisas there too anthon i told minya to gather them all and go up well have to wait for them clave nodded gavving stared with open mouth he said grad dont you know the mens tunnels dont connect to the womens what theyd have to go all the way to the fin or the treemouth and back or break trailgrad theyre sure to be captured clave had a hand on gavvings shoulder calm down boy grad where would they go the grad tried to think it was horse who spoke not the fin thats navy maybe nobody would notice some extra women at the commons or the schools or maybe theyd just stay where they are and wait jinnyll be at the treemouth anyway okay the grad fired the forward motors the carm lifted tailfirst from the tuft leaving fires in its wake lawn screamed youre setting the tree on fire she was ignored ive been to the pregnant womens complex the grad said i havent been in the commons aifm has gavving said its big and it reaches to the treemouth if we can get the carm into the treemouth lawn writhed you cant you cant burn the treemouth what are you this isnt mutiny anymore its just wanton destruction anthon asked mildly will london tree trade with copsik mutineers lawn was silent lying wouldnt have helped you were too convincing before well go get our people the cam moved sideways above the tuft accelerating sluggishly then there was clear sky below and the grad swung the carm around they were dropping past the treemouth the carm slowed hovered the grad touched paired yellow dots light flared into the commons in twin beams as if the carm were a tethered sun women were running away jungle giants all leapfrogging across the woven spinebranch floor none were the right size nor dark enough to be jinny drop it clave said as if his voice hurt him go for the pregnant womens compound how do we get there the grad let the carm sink they were below the tuft now blue sky below green passing above its under the branch i think our best move is to go up into it i may not hit it exactly and the navy may have figured out what were doing by now are you ready for a fight yes said several voices the grad grinned maybe i can scrape off the silver man too i notice hes still with us now whats that things were falling from the foliage a bundle of cloth tied with line long loaves of bread a bird carcass cleaned and skinned then the green sky was raining women jayan jinny and a jungle giant lisa they jumped gavving said in wonder what if we hadnt come we did merril said get em two big leather bags fell and then another woman leaping head down to catch up with the rest minya the grad cut the motors and took a moment to think he was aware of voices yelling at him but was able to ignore the intrusive noises got to catch them in the airlock what about the silver man he was still clinging to the dorsal surface the grad rotated the carm to put it between the pressuresuited dwarf and the falling women they were separating it would be three operations jayan and jinny first they faced each other across clasped hands as they had after daltonquinn tree caine apart they seemed calm enough under the circumstances the cam eased toward them the silver man was crawling around to the airlock hang on the grad said and he started the cam spinning faster his head spun too he could see sickness in the faces behind him the silver man caught rounding a corner was hanging by his hands the grad used the motors again against the spin and slapped the silver man hard against the hull he flew free the grad opened the doors the twins were flying at him he jetted flame to slow the carm stopped just alongside them backed and moved sideways then they were crawling into the carm blue shapes crawled within the green sky armed navy men carrying jet pods and footbows and a massive thing that took three men to handle the reunion would have to wait get em into chairs he called back to clave minya next he was flying the carm like hed done it all his life he got a little careless minya thumped the hull then came in with a bloody nose sorry he said gavving never mind that get her to a chair whos the other one its lisa anthon said theyre shooting at her grad get her im doing that do we need the food and other stuff he was alongside lisa now between her and the failing navy men voy glared behind her footbow arrows ticked off the hull but that thump had no place in his scheme what lisas look of terror and determination faded into blissful sleep he knew before he looked the silver man was back spitgun and all he was on the dorsal surface out of reach of the doors and anthon had thrown a line round lisas waist and was pulling her in get her into the chairs were full get her against the back wall and stay with her dont turn any fixtures debby put a tethered bolt in that carcass and well pull it in anthon said the silver man these are close quarters if he gets through the door swarm him the spitgun doesnt kill but if he shoots us all he owns us jinny called to the grad we brought a stack of clean laundry and a water supply weve got water laundry why not hey i told minya to go up you did it right wed never have found you minya said if you had the carm you could find us in the sky so we grabbed what we could and went down the navy men had not left the branchs green underside hardly surprising if they failed to capture the cam how would they reach the tree again they would have looked futile the grad thought were it not for the bulky starstuff thing they handled like a weapon the salmon bird carcass was a black silhouette with voy painfully bright behind it anthon and debby had to squint but their tethered arrows nailed it and they reeled it in maybe the silver man was hoping someone would show his head none did he tried to enter with the stack of ponchos and the grad almost managed to catch him in the closing door that left the laundry outside top and a red border around the yellow diagram i never saw red before whats it mean lawn deigned to answer contemptuously emergency your lines holding the airlock open the grad opened the door and debby pulled the mass in the silver man didnt try to follow the door may have scared him it was his last chance the grad closed the doors and sighed with satisfaction his sigh chopped off when his ventral view flared pure diizzling red then disappeared from the bow window from other displays he caught glimpses of painfully bright scarlet can that thing hurt us anthon demanded while lawri cried now youll see theyll cut us in half and clave said theyre almost on us well have them all over the hull if feed it to the tree the grad shouted at them all he couldnt think what could that light do to them neither klance nor lawri had ever mentioned such a thing weve got what we need forget the bread forget the water get out theyll never catch the carm lawri saw his hand move and screamed wait the grad didnt he tapped the center of the big blue vertical bar chapter twenty the position of scientists apprentice the air sighed out of the grads lungs he was being crushed flat his left arm had missed the arm rest it was behind him being pulled gradually from the shoulder socket the chair was too low to support his head his neck hurt savagely above the muted shriek of the main motor he heard his passengers fighting for breath this must be killing the jungle giants london tree dwindled like a dream in the aft view they were in the storm now and blind the grad tried to raise his right arm to touch the blue bar to end the force that flattened him up up farther his arm fell back across his chest with a jolt that smashed the last sipful of air from his lungs his sight blurred lawns chin was tucked down against her collarbone she was sure that if she relaxed her neck the tide would snap it she watched jeffer trying to turn off the motor and knew he couldnt make it and lawtis arms were bound thlc will kill some mutineer she thought with alloyed satisfaction and i did it to them the corn laser would burn or blind at close range but almost certainly it would not have hurt the cam shed lied in hope that the mutineers would panic shed succeeded beyond her ambitions but its killing me the screen of clouds swept past and away gold was to left of center in the bow window the smoke ring trailed left of gold they were accelerating east and a little out east takes you out they were leaving the smoke ring i knew it that crazy jeffers killed us all with his head pulled far back with the points of what should have been a neck rest digging savagely into his shoulder blades gavving looked along his nose and tried to make sense of what he was seeing the skyflowed away at the edges of the bow window a triune family split and fluttered and were gone before they could move a small flattish green jungle drifted close accelerated whipped past a fluffy white cloud showed ahead closer white blindness and the carm shuddered and rang with the impact of water droplets something tiny struck the bow window a terrific blow and left a pink film a quarter meter across in a breath the rain had pounded it clear the cloud was gone and the sky ahead was clear of further obstructions gold and the smoke ring showed like a puffball on a stem against blue sky a deep dark blue sky a color hed never seen in his life he rolled his head to look at minya the agony in his neck shifted the pressure was easier to take this way she looked back at him lovely minya her face fuller than he remembered he tried to speak and couldnt he could barely breathe she sighed almost the light of the carms main drive was back and blueshifting a shift in its spectral line and hed caught it lucky kendy aborted his usual message the carms timeeroded program would be busy enough without distraction for the carm was in flight it must have been accelerating for some minutes already by the frequency shift it was building up enough velocity to take it out of the smoke ring within a few thousand kilometers of discipline itself when the light went out kendy began his message the air was already thinning around the carm reception should be good kendy for the state kendy for the state kendy for the state the sound stopped the terrible tide was gone all in a moment bodies bent like bows recoiled citizens who had not had the breath for screaming screamed now as the reflexive screams died to groans the grad heard lawn say wearily jeffer never use the main motor unless youre pushing the tree the grad could only nod hed captured the carm hed treefodder everyone he knew if he hadnt murdered him hed put him aboard the carm and then hed touched the blue bar he said lawti im open to suggestions feed it to the tree the grad heard fullthroated laughter aft from anthon debby swatted him hard across the belly the blow snapped him into a u but he kept laughing and she joined him they had reason they had been flat against the back wall protecting lisa from what should have been mild jolting the killer chairs would have snapped their backs but none of the jungle giants had been in them others were groaning stirring moving from pain to fear ilsa was beginning to wake up merrilvacanteyed hypnotized by the peculiar sky rushing at the bowseemed to snap out of it well somebody do something claves voice was a carrying one and it filled the carms cabin to overflowing calm down citizens were not in that much trouble remember where we are other sounds stopped clave said the carrier was built for this it came from the stars we know it operates inside the smoke ring but it was built to operate anywhere wasnt it grad that simply hadnt occurred to him not anywhere but outside the smoke ring thats certain good enough whats our status give me a breath the grad was ashamed it had taken clave to get his mind working again were not in tmubleluck that clave didnt have the training to know what nonsense that was the blue display was on thrust acceleration the big blue rectangle had a border of flickering scarlet main motor on fuel exhaustel he tapped it off for what that was worth h h plenty of water but no fuel we cant maneuver i dont know how to find out where were going lawti no answer but were bound to fall back sooner or later green display pressures way down outside were this could start a riot but theyd have to know were leaving the smoke ring thats why the skys that peculiar color yellow display life support looks okay window displays oh my in the aft and side views all detail had become tiny integral trees were toothpicks ponds were drops of glitter everything seemed embedded in fog gold had become a bulge within a larger lens of cloud patterns that trailed off to east and west a storm pattern that spread across the smoke ring the hidden planet seemed indecently close sorry clave i got hung up citizens dont miss this nobodys seen the smoke ring from outside since men came from the stars others were craning forward to see the displays or peering out through the side windows but gavving said i think horse is dead horse the old man gavving had brought with him horse certainly looked dead enough small wonder if the tide had stopped an old mans heart poor copsilc the grad thought he had never met horse but what human could have wanted to die before seeing this check his pulse lawn said port view jeffer something in her voice the grad looked off to the edge a flash of silver i dont its mark hes still out there i dont believe it but the silver pressure suit was crawling into view the dwarf must have clung to the nets throughout that savage acceleration jeffer let him in what a man i lawn i cant the pressures too low outside wed lose our air hell die out there wait a minute open the doors one at a time hall thats why klance calls it an airlocki so did the cassettes sure two doors to lock the air in okay muffled thumps sounded aft the silver man wanted in anthon dave he may be dangerous take the spitgun away from him when he comes in the grad cleared all but the yellow display no fast decisions from now on he pinched both lines togethermake sure theyre closed tightlthen opened the outer door with a forefinger the silver man disappeared from view into the airlock good now close the outer line waitno red borders open the inner air shushed into the airlock the silver man stepped into the carm handed the spitgun to anthon and reached for his helmet in her heart of hearts lawn may have hoped for a lastbreath countermutiny from the navys toughest warrior she gave up that hope when she saw his face mark was a dwarf of course and the bones of his face were massive brutal but his jaw hung slack and his breath came fast and his face was pale with shock his eyes wavered about the cabin seeking reassurance minya a darkhaired woman answered hello mark her voice was flat and her face was hostile mark nodded unhappily now he recognized lawn hello scientists apprentice what now were in the hands of mutineers lawn said and i wish they were better at flying what theyve stolen the mutineers first officer said welcome to quinn tribe as a citizen quinn tribe doesnt keep copsiks im dave the chairman who are you navy point man armor names mark citizen doesnt sound too bad where we going nobody seems to know now we dont quite trust you mark so were going to tie you to a seat that must have been quite a ride maybe you really are made of starstuf mark was letting himself be led forward to an empty chair all things considered id rather ride inside i was too mad to let go were not really going to hit gold are we hes turned docile lawn thought in disgust hes given in to the mutineers are they really going to win and then she saw that they were not she kept her silence dave counted ten seats and thirteen citizens one dead horse didnt need a chair neither did the three jungle giants quite the contrary but even with the wide cargo space aft the carm was crowded the citizens seemed calm enough exhausted clave guessed and too awestruck to feel fear he felt a touch of that hixnself most of them even the silver manwere looking out the windows the sky was nearly black and scattered with dozens of white points the scientists apprentice broke her angry silence to say youve heard about them all your lives the stars you say it without knowing what youre talking about well there they are youll die for it but youve seen the stars real they were and impressive enough but they were just points it was the blue ghost and ghost child that held daves attention hed never seen them either the paired fans of violet light were vivid and terrif jing they were entirely outside the smoke ring flowing out along the hole in the ring anthon and debby were keeping busy they had moored the ponchos and the smoked and cleaned carcass of a salmon bird to fix tures along the cargo hold walls now they were carving thin slices from the bird dave remembered feeling like this when the tree came apart he didnt know enough to make decisions then he had been ready to strangle the grad for withholding information now the grad was watching him uneasily did he think dave would attack their prisoners dave smiled back he made his way aft and helped the jungle giants pass curls of meat forward now was different dave was not chairman here if they died it would not be daves fault probably the jungle giants found the carm more frightening than mostthan clavelyet they were acting to make it their home squeezegourds of water were passing up and down the chairs three squeezegourds looking somewhat flat clave wondered about the carms water supply he was about to ask when the grad spoke first gavving would you come here for a moment there was secret urgency in his voice anthon noticed and continued whathewasdoingsodidclaveiftheirhelpwasneededitwouldbe h requested gavving squeezed between lawn and the grad the summons was something of a relief minyas news had startled him and he did time to compose his face the grad pointed see the red border blinking around that number sure red means emergency that number is the air in the cabin how do you feel allergy attack coming on actually it was the last thing on my mind gavving listened to his body ears and sinuses were unhappy eyes scratchy maybe the yellow number dropped a digit behind the decimal point scientists apprentice any comments fix it yourself jeffer the scientist grad what does it mean oh sorry gavving theres no air outside the air inside must be leaking out into the um universe you know i talk to you when i get confused maybe youll come up with something gavving chewed it over what clave said dave did not say that the carm is almost four hundred years old and maybe falling apart like all those bicycle gears okay whats your opinion of the scientists apprentice lawn bore their considering stares with her lips pressed tight and her eyes full on gavvings the grad smiled and said better you ask her opinion of us gavving didnt have to four enemy warriors six copsiks caught in mutiny one corpse and a navy man who surrendered his weapon her expression ifickered had she forgotten the silver man this wouldnt be easy guessing at a strangers thoughts try anyway i only wondered if shes good enough to save us if she wanted to we could waste too much time on that the grad nodded lawri if the scientist were here could he save us maybe but he wouldnt kiance wouldnt save the carm the grad smiled she shrugged as best she could within her bonds all right hed save the carm if he could how she didnt answer can you save us she raised an eyebrow at him gavving found that admirable but what he said was bluff grad well have to fix it ourselves the scientist told you things about gases didnt he both scientists did come to that oxygen we must be getting air from the oxygen tank its the hydrogen tank thats empty and well have more fuel pretty soon the carm splits water into the two flavors of fuel the one flavor the oxygen its what we breathe at least well have some time gavving studied the blonde girls face what did she know what did she want if she only wanted everybody dead then dead they were but there was something she might hate even more than mutiny it depended on getting the grad moving which was a good idea anyway how ask stupid questions that worked sometimes can we find the leak set something smoldering and watch the smoke yes itll tell the others whats wrong though and burn up air too mph inspiration molecules of bits of air move more slowly when theyre cold the board was already alive with yellow numbers and drawings the grad touched an arrowhead on a vertical line then moved his fingertip slowly toward him the arrowhead became two arrowheads and one followed his finger i never even wondered if we could make the cabin warmer or cooler but it has to be true that oxygen is liquid cold itd be freezing our lungs out if something wasnt keeping the cabin warm okay now itll be cold in here but well live longer i think youd better tell dave whats on and let him make the announcement theyll have to know now because well have to pass out the extra ponchos then well try the smoke lawn spoke just let me at the damn controls gavving turned from her hide the smile lawn might want their deaths but she couldnt let the grad save them without her help he asked is it too complicated to tell the grad no but i wont grad try the smoke worst she can do is kill us besides lawn always wanted to fly the carm lawn the position of scientists apprentice is now open lawn flexed her arms and looked about at her captors her hands prickled her arms hurt her urge was to strike out at the mutineers but the look on jeffers face considering like kiance waiting for the right answer to some stupid rote question the sky was black as charcoal the stars were white points like tiny versions of voy but thousands of them and if they roused fear in lawri what must they be doing to these savages she watched them nibbling on rolled slices of raw meat and suddenly smiled she reached past the grad and tapped the white key pnikasyvat voice hear this you treefeedersi ready said a voice belonging to nobody in the carm identify yourself the lunchtime conversation went dead silent the jungle giant male cocked his crossbow she turned her back on him i am lawn the scientist give us your status fuel tanks nearly empty power depleted batteries charging air pressure dropping will be dangerously low in five hours lethal in seven displays are available why are we losing air pressure all openings are sealed i will seek the source of a leak lawn tapped the white switch again thats what will kill us well strangle without air too bad it would have been quite a show but you wont see it she flashed at the grad why did you turn oft the display voice cant hear us till i tap it again it can do almost anything if you say the wrong thing just talking would it talk to me youre a her scorn became something else it wants you to identify yourself and it remembers hmm try it she tapped the talk button prikazyvat voice said the grad identify yourself im the scientist of quinn tuft do we have enough fuel to get back into the smoke ring for a moment the grad forgot how to breathe then we have a water supply wont it be separated into fuel voice paused then if the flux of sunlight maintains its intensity i will have fuel soon enough to affect a return i note a mass near our course i can use it as a gravity sling would that be gold rephrase the mass is it goldblatts world the grad tapped the switch before he began laughing go for gold if we live that long the whispering aft had become obtrusive with the air turning icy and voice speaking from the walls luncheon was sliding over to panic jeffer said gavving youd better tell them about the pressure we dont have time to brief clave lawn asked shall i do it she knew more ajout what was going on jeffer seemed appalled lawn theyd think you started the leaki savages anyone would she couldnt decide if he meant it gavving was telling the rest of the mutineers about the leak he told it long including what they planned to do about it jeffer tapped the white button pnikazyvat voice have you found the leak i find no point of leakage air is disappearing will we live long enough to get back into the smoke ring no the course ive programmed would take twentyeight hours air pressure will have dropped to lethal levels in ten hours times are approximate lawn couldnt remember how long an hour might be still ten hours it had been seven before the cabin got so cold she wondered why voice hadnt taken it into account sometimes voice could be such a fool she said display the areas where you have looked for a leak the yellow line diagrams of the cabin sprouted green borders along twothirds of the interior red dots blinked elsewhere those are sensors that have died lawn told jeffer voice implement your course correction jeffer added pnikazyvat voice do not use the main motor at any time i will fire as i have fuel voice said first burn in ten seconds nine eight everybody grab something jeffer called mutineers were pulling the extra ponchos over their clothing they stopped to strap themselves in the jungle giants moved against the aft wall and grabbed fixtures two one but only the attitude jets lit the carms nose swung toward the smoke ring and stayed there while the aft motors fired it lasted several tens of breaths they would pass closer to gold which had become huge a spiral storm seen edgeon whose rim was already below them if mark werent tied lawni thought and the main motor fired nobody would be able to move except mark it was something to keep in mind jeffer didnt seem to realize that the thrust could be controlled by touching the top or bottom of those rectangles to raise or lower the fuel flow meanwhile how could the leaks be blocked if there was a way lawn was damned well going to find it before jeffer did chapter twentyone go for gold kendy for the state kendy for the state kendy for the state the response came almost instantly sharp and crisp through nearvacuum and dwindling distance the carm was out of the smoke ring kendy had clear sending for the first time since the mutiny he sent status the motors were functional all of them fuel a few teacupaful water a good deal solar power converters functional batteries charged but running down as they changed water into liquefied hydrogen and oxygen sunlight flux from t would be steady in vacuum there would be fuel the carm was on manual co flux indicated a full load of passengers the carbon dioxide was accumulating slowly the life support system could almost handle it and the cabin was leaking air oh shit they were dying course record since initiating burn it came the carm was rising it would have passed near the l pointkendys own location the point of stability behind goldblatts worldwere it not for goldblatts world itself and were it not for goldblatts world the carm would presently fall back to safety but the core of an erstwhile gas giant planet was pulling the carms orbit into a tilted nearcircle entirely outside the smoke ring switch to my command massive malfunction give me video link with crew denied and the cabin pressure was dropping something had to be done kendy sent copy and waited the carm computer thought it over slowly bit by bit geared up and began beaming its entire program it took twentysix minutes kendy looked it overa simplified kendy patched with subsequent commands and garbled by time and entropywhile he sent stand by for update programming standing by kendy didnt believe it the longdead programmer would have embedded protect commands he simply hadnt reached them yet unless they had deteriorated too kendy didnt have an update program hed been so sure hed have to assemble it from scratch the speed with which a computer can think was kendys triumph and tragedy always he was freshly surprised by the boredom of his evenfless life it stayed fresh because kendy was constantly editing his memories the storage capacity of his computerbrain was fixed he was always near his limit he had edited his memory of the mutiny deleting the names of key figures for fear that he might later seek vengeance against their descendants he regularly deleted the memory of his boredom once he had examined the solution to the fourcolor problem in topology the proof submitted in by appal and haken could not be checked except by a computer kendy was a computer he had experienced the proof directly and found it valid he remembered only that the details he had deleted he had used a simplified program for the carm computers then deleted it but now he had the carms program as a template he ran through it sharpening everywhere correcting where suitable updating his own simplified personality leaving intact the carms own memories of the time of mutiny because he was determined to ignore them he looked for a way to plug the leak in the cabin it was hopeless the life support sensors had failed not the program he almost deleted the command that barred use of the main motor the main motor was more efficient he didnt understand that command but it was input and recent he left it alone now a course program to bring them here to study them he barely had time to hope kendy apprehended orbital mechanics directly he saw instantly that the fuel wasnt there nor the sunlight to electrolyze enough water in time his own pair of carms which fed him power via their solar collectors didnt have fuel to meet and tow the savages carm even if he were willing to risk them both forget it and try again he could get them back into the smoke ring via a close approach past goldblatts world in fact the carms computer had already worked out a course change it didnt matter theyd be dead by then he left that part of the program intact he deleted the barriers that barred him from communication he beamed the revised program to the carm at the snails pace the carm could accept the carm filed it it had worked at least he could look them over get to know them a little before they were gone after five hundred and twelve years the cold had gotten to the jungle giants anthon and debby and ilsa were curled into a friendly cuddling shivering ball with the spare ponchos pulled around them the other passengers were taking it better there were ponchos for everyone but mark and two to spare one they tore into scarves jinny wound a scarf around marks neck and tucked the ends into the collar of the silver suit comfortable the silver man seemed cheerful enough despite the lines that held him immobile in his chair fine thanks is that suit thick enough damn it woman youre the one whos shivering this suit keeps its own temperature just like the carm if anyone needs my scarf you want it jinny smiled and shook her head of course id be even better off with my helmet closed mark said and they laughed as if hed said something funny it didnt need saying if they couldnt plug the leak or if lawn chose to kill them somehow mark would die with the rest the grad had made a torch from one of the scarves plus fat scraped from the skin of the salmon bird he was about to light it when he noticed mist before his face he blew white smoke everyone save horse was breathing white smoke as if they were all using tobacco if you think somethings leaking breathe on it he announced watch your breath no jayan forget the doors voice has sensors there lawn did something to the controls im turning up the humidity the wetness in the air more fog that way citizens took their turns at the control panel to find the blank spots in the yellow diagram the grad began the uncomfortable job that others might miss he crawled between the seats edging around the cold corpse of gavvings friend blowing mist where the floor joined the starboard wall merril called ive got it its the bow window a crowd of citizens crawled around the rim of the bow window blowing watching the pale smoke form streamlines where the window joined the hull the window was loose around the ventralport corner keep looking lawri ordered there may be more she herself made her way aft the grad joined her at the back wall what have you got in mind is there a way to plug the leaks voice began a countdown lawn waited while small jets fired the cluster of jungle giants sagged against the aft wall without falling apart lisa giggled she must be still floating from the spitgun drug the burn ended lawri said maybe have we got something to hold water the grad called we need squeezegourds they found three merril collected them and brought them back jayan and jinny were blowing on the side windows which seemed all right gavving and minya moved along the rim of the bow window blowing and watching mist formed outside and vanished immediately along a curve of window as long as the grads arm shoulder to fingers lawn turned a valve brown water oozed from the aft wall formed a growing globule its mud merril said in disgust lawri said we put pond water in the cann breaks the pure water into hydrogen and oxygen but it leaves the goo behind every so often we have to clean it out thats why theres an eject system and you can be damn glad of it we cant drink that stuff we should have picked up minyas water supply say that if we live long enough to get thirsty lawn took the gourds and filled them from the brown globule merril winced watching each of their water gourds become fouled lawn went forward with the gourds would she plug the leak with mud he could do it himself now if lawn balked but he wanted her on his side as far as that was possible lawn squeezed muddy water along the rim of the bow window mist showed outside the glass began to frost the water stayed where she put it in a long brown bubble over the next several minutes while lawn alone watched the controlsthe water dwindled and thickened to a darker brown presently it began to turn hara clave said grad is it working the grad had read of ice it was no more real to him than the liquefied gases in the tanks he looked to lawri lawn met his eyes and said i will not accept the position of scientists apprentice after such a performance was she quitting on them clave spoke first and in haste im certain theres room in quinn tribe for two scientists especially under the circumstances ive saved you now i want to go home to london tree thats all i want shes earned it the grad thought but clave said point to it the carm was nosedown to the smoke ring closest was the storm pattern that surrounded and cloaked gold a turbulent spiral of cloud humped in the middle the whole pattern drifted west at a speed that looked sluggish but must be quick beyond imagination the arms of the smoke ring reached away in both directions they could see the flow of cloud currents faster toward voy drifting backward near the carm minor detailslike integral treeswere invisibly small youre the scientist clave said could you get us back to london tree lawn shook her head she began to shiver and once begun she couldnt stop minya got her the last of the ponchos and they wrapped it around her then tied a strip of cloth round her head and throat she said were not losing air anymore leave the humidity up and we wont get thirsty so fast jeffer im cold and tired and lost i cant make decisions dont bother me they werent human kendy had watched them for a bit they had the temperature turned far down kendy was going to fix it until he realized that the lowered temperature had slowed the leak they must have kept some of the old knowledge but the cold was killing them too he watched the really strange ones succumb first and crawl into a ball to wait for their deaths the carms medical sensors indicated a corpse and twelve citizens not one of them quite normal one had no legs if lethal recessive genes were appearing in the smoke ring it might point to inbreeding otherwise they seemed healthy he saw no scars or pockmarks no sign of diseasewhich was reasonable discipline had carried none of the parasites or bacteria that had adapted over the millions of years to prey on humanity they didnt even show the sores that came with insufficient bathing the abnormal height the long vulnerable necks and long fragile fingers and long long toes must be evolution at work an adaptation to the freefall environment he would have his problems bringing these back into the state in its way this small group was a perfect test sample he could make his mistakes here and never pay a penalty in time the carm would be found by other savages time to make his appearance lawn was eating raw salmon bird clearly hating it but eating jayan and jinny had gone aft to join the clustered carther states warriors it looked like fun the grad thought wistfully but he was needed here something was happening to the bow window a pattern like a colored shadow occluding the view lawri have you done something somethings wrong ive never seen anything like she trailed off the carm was silent a ghostly face filled the bow window it took on color huge and transparent with the storms around gold showing through it was brutal with bushy brown hair and brows thick brow ridges and cheekbones a square muscular jaw a short neck as thick in proportion as a mans thigh a face that resembled marks or harps a gigantic dwarf it spoke in voices voice citizens this is kendy for the state speak and your reward will be beyond the reach of your imagination the passengers looked at each other i am sharls davis kendy the face said i brought your ancestors here to the smoke ring and abandoned them when they made mutiny against me i have the power to send you into gold to your deaths speak and tell me why i should not do so too many were looking at the scientists was this some trick of lawris the grad could feel the hair rising in a halo around his head but somebody had to speak he said i am the quinn tribe scientist and i am the london tree scientist lawri said firmly can you see us we are lost and helpless if you want our lives take them tell me of yourselves where do you live why are you of different sizes the grad said we are of three tribes living in two very different places the three tall ones he kept talking while his mind sought a memory sharis davis kendy lawri broke in you were the checker for dlcciplina i was and am said the spectral face the checkers responsibility includes the actions attitudes and wellbeing of his charges lawn quoted if you can help us you must you argue well scientist but my duty is to the state should i treat you as citizens i must decide how did you come in possession of the carm are you mutineers the grad held his breath and lawri said certainly not contemptuously the carm belongs to the navy and the scientist im the scientist who are the rest of you introduce me the grad took over he tried to stick to lies he could remember naming the copsiks of london treejayan jinny gavving minya as london tree citizens clave and merril as refugees who had become copsiks himself as a privileged refugee the jungle giants as visitors too late he remembered mark tied motionless in his chair go for goldnow mark is a mutineer he said he tried to steal the carm would the dwarf brand him a liar but the rest would back him up except lawri mark let his eyes drop he looked sullenly dangerous sharis davis kendy began to question mark mark answered angrily belligerently he created a wild tale of himself as a copsik barred from citizenship by his shape of trying to steal the carm by activating the main motor hoping to immobilize all but himself then finding that the ferocious thrust left him as helpless as the rest the face seemed satisfied scientist tell me more of london tree you keep some who are barred from citizenship do you lawri said yes but their children may qualify why does a tree come apart the face asked and how does london tree move and why do you call yourself scientist and are many of you crippled and how many children do you expect to die before they grow to make children it wanted populations distances durations numbers lawn and the grad answered as best they could with these they could stick close to the truth and finally the voice of kendy said very well the carm will reenter breathable atmosphere in eleven hours the air will slow it keep the hours what measure do you use the circuit that teethree makes around the sky in about onetenth of a circuit youll be falling through air air is dangerous at such speeds keep the bow forward youll see fire dont worry about it dont touch anything at the bow it will be hot dont open the airlock until youve stopped by then youll have fuel to move about do you understand all of that lawri said yes what are our chances of living through this the face of kendy started to answerand froze with its mouth halfopen update cabin pressure has returned to normal they had blocked the leak how a man without glands might naturally feel curiosity and duty as his strongest emotions for kendy these were now in conflict and the carm was about to pass out of range kendy had never intended to tell them that they would not live to see reentry medical readouts implied that they had lied to him too and he dared not accuse them of it this changed everything the savages might actually return to describe kendy and discipline he could stop them of course by beaming some wild course change to the carm or he could spend the next few minutes indoctrinating them into the state impossible he could take one trivial step in that direction then try to impress them with the need to talk to him again and when they did thatyears from now or decadeshe could begin the work that had waited for half a thousand years the face said you have stopped the leak well done now you must kill the mutineer mutiny cannot be tolerated in the state mark went pale lawn started to speak the grad rode her down hell face trial on our return do you doubt his guilt that will be decided the grad said at this point he probably became guilty of mutiny himself but what choice did he have if mark didnt talk to save himself lawri would and i captain the carm justice is swift in the state the grad countered justice is accurate in quinn tuft our swiftness may well depend on instant communication which you clearly do not have the face began speaking louder and more rapidly as if in haste very well i have a great deal to tell you i can give you instant communication and power that depends on sunlight instead of muscle i can tell you of the universe beyond what you know i can show you how to link your little tribes into one great state and to link your state to the stars you now see for the first time come to me as soon as you can the voice of kendy died in a most peculiar fashion blurring into mere noise as the brutal face blurred into a wash of colored lines then the voice was silent and the storm pattern around gold glowed blue and white through the bow window chapter twentytwo citizens tree kendys readings were beginning to blur frustratingly the carms aft and ventral cameras worked perfectly he had two fine views of the stars and the thickening smoke ring atmosphere plasma streamed past the dorsal camera and kendy sought the spectral lines of silicon and metals signs that the carms hull was boiling away there was some ablation not much more than he would have expected when the carm was new inside the cabin the co content was building the jolting looked bad enough to tenderize meat the passengers were suffering mouths wide chests heaving temperature was up to normal and rising a blurred figure snapped its safety bands loose and struggled to tear its clothing away kendy couldnt get medical readings through the growing ionization but the pilot had been under terrific tension earlier it looked chancy whether the carm would live or die kendy wasnt sure which he preferred he had bungled the principle was simple and had served the state before to further the cause a potential convert was ordered to commit some obscene crime he could never repudiate the cause after that to do so would be to admit that he had committed an abomination the caveat was simple too one must never give such an order unless it would be obeyed kendy was ashamed and angry he had attempted to bind their loyalty to him by ordering an execution instead he had almost turned them all into mutineers hed had to back down gracefully and fast hed had no chance to recover from that with the ionosphere building up around the carm cutting communications his medical readings told him that they had lied to him somewhere he shouldnt have forced them to do that either he didnt know enough even to guess at what they were hiding too late now if he sent some lethal course correction now ionization would garble it if they lived they would tell of a kendy who was powerful but gullible a kendy who could be intimidated if they died kendy would remain a legend fading into a misty past the forward view was a blur of fire as the carm plowed deeper into atmosphere he was losing even the cabin sensors there was flame in front of them transparent blue streaming to the sides the grad felt the heat on his face theyd be losing air again the black ice around the rim of the bow window had turned to mud mud that bubbled hed been wrong the screaming flamehot air massed before the bow was coming in things came at them little things were hopeless they hit or they didnt blood spots turned black and evaporated larger objects could be avoided his hands strangled the chair arms trying to steer the carm through this would have been bad enough watching lawri steer was distilled horror from her rigid posture the knotted jaw and bared teeth she was just at the edge of screaming hysterics her hands hovered like claws reached withdrew then tapped suddenly at blue dashes his own hands twitched when she was slow to see danger the chairs were full citizens had objected but the grad had simply kept yelling until it got done the corpse of horse moored to cargo fixtures mark the silver man in back gripping cargo moorings with his abnormal strength clave beside him swearing that his own strength was enough everyone else strapped into seats that would give some protection even to jungle giants against thrust from the bow reentry wasnt like using the main motor it was an attack the air was trying to pound the carm into bits of flaming starstuff lawn had lived half her life with the carm she hadtobebetterat this than the grad shed insisted and she was right he gripped the chair arms and waited to be smashed like a bug the carm fell east and in integral trees showed foreshortened as three four pairs of green dots hard to see shed seen them jets fired a bit of green fluff dead ahead lawn fired port jets the carm swung sluggishly around shuddering as the flpming air blasted the nose offcenter forward jets the carm eased backward too slowly while the fluff swelled to become an oncoming jungle a grunt of pain aft clave had been jarred loose the silver man was holding him in place with a hand on his chest the grad saw birds and scarlet flowers before the jungle was past lawri let the bow face forward again a pond a klomter across just missed swatting them droplets of fog in its wake rang the hull like a myriad tiny chimes the debris was growing ever thicker and it was moving past them more slowly something barred their path like a green web it might have been half of an integral tree with the tuft gone wild the foliage spreading like gauze the trunk ending in a swollen knob small birds played in the slender branches swordbirds hovered at the edges hed never seen such a plant and lawn was steering clear of it the grad said lawri its over she said damn im tired take the controls jeffer i have it relax lawri rubbed her eyes fiercely the grad touched blue dashes to slow the cairn further a fingertip touch set the cabin warmth control to normal the cabin was already warm if it hadnt been lethally cold when they entered atmosphere they might well have roasted he looked back at his passengers six of quinn tribe remained twelve total to start a new tribe were back he said i dont know just where are we all alive does anyone need medical help lawn you did it merril chortled we lived long enough to get thirsty the grad said were low on fuel and theres no water at all lets find a pond then pick a home open the doors jayan said she released her straps and moved aft with jinny following why horse right he opened the airlock to a mild breeze that smelled fresh clean wonderful the carms air stank it was stale a treefodder stink fear and rotting meat and too many people breathing in each others faces why hadnt he noticed the twins released the corpse from its mooring wincing at the touch they towed it through the doors the grad waited while they sent the bones of the salmon bird after it then he fired the aft motors if i met his ghost he wouldnt even recognize me how can i say im sorry never use the main motor unless horse dwindled into the sky the pond was huge spinning fast enough to form a lensshape fast enough to have spun off smaller ponds the grad chose one of the smaller satellites no bigger than the carm itseif he let the carm drift forward until the bow window just touched the silver sphere what happened then left him breathless he was looking into the interior of the pond there were waterbreathing things shaped like long teardrops with tiny wings moving through a maze of green threads he turned on the bow lights and the water glowed there was a jungle in there and swimming waterbirds darting in flocks among the plants lawn roused him come on jeffer nobody else knows how to do this pick two mutineers with good lungs he followed her aft and didnt ask her about lungs until hed figured it out himself clave anthon we need some muscle bring the squeezegourds better than lungs scientist squeezegourds fine if youd planned your mutiny better youd have dismounted the pump and stored it aboard he laughed and thought should i have asked your advice too and didnt say it after all lawri had been through it was good to hear her joking even in treemouth humor while she mounted the hose to the aft wall the grad carried the other end outside he saw no sign of the nets that had covered the hull even the char had been burned off he tethered himself before he jumped toward the water a few meters away clave came after him also properly moored carrying squeezegourds followed by jinny and jayan everyone was coming out mark was out of his pressure suit and tethered to anthon merril usa debby in a tangle of lines they plunged into the water and drank the grad hadnt let himself think of his thirst now he surrendered to it submerging head and shoulders and doing his best to swallow the pond the carms headlamps lit the water around him it was playtime why not he tugged on his line pulled himself out before he drowned the rest of the citizens were drinking splashing washing themselves and each other was lawri alone in the cairn alone with the controls of a vehicle that could hover near the pond spraying fire on men and women who would have to choose between burning and drowninghe saw lawn emerge with minya and gayving behind her hed been careless they hadnt the grad kept an eye on her thenceforth to be sure she didnt return alone she splashed in the water she and the dwarf washed each other and talked a little in earshot of anthon her motions were jerky twitchy she looked wiretense in the aftermath of reentry his suspicions seemed silly she was in no shape to contemplate a countermutiny he wondered if she would have nightmares they took turns pumping the technique was to shove the neck of a squeezegourd into the hose warily because there were three gourds in motion squeeze duck it under water squeeze wait while it filled into the hose squeeze my arms just quit minya said and handed her gourd to merril with her archers muscles she had lasted longer than most gavving was some distance from the others motionless in the water hed already speared four peculiar supple scaly waterbirds she watched him and wondered how he really felt about the guest growing in her how did she feel her impregnation was part of her past the past was dead for anyone but stone dead for these citizens with hundreds of thousands of klomters and the storms of gold itself between them and their homes she would have a child time was when she had given up hope of that but how did gavving feel mcml said nobodys talking about sharls davis kendy what for debby wondered he never bothered us before and he never will again still its something to have seen the checker isnt it something to tell our children someone that old must have learned a lot if he wasnt lying or crazy he had the facts right the grad said we did take him at his word didnt we maybe he only had cassettes like me a dwarf scientist stuck out there in a carm like we almost were hes not all that bright either he swallowed marks story come on i was brilliant the silver man bellowed you tell a fine story mark why did you back me up it was a breath or two before the dwarf answered you understand that i cant support a bloody copsik revolution okay why it was none of this kendys business whoever he is whatever he is yeah he did have some interesting machinery maybe he got stuck aboard disc pline itself somehow id have liked to see dlxipline lawri hadnt even tried pumping she flexed her fingers wondering if they would heal she had smelled the stink of fear on hersell that at least was gone she said i wouldnt deal with sharls davis kendy if he gave me discipline ugly arrogant treefeeder he wanted mark dead like youd kill a turkey because its time convenient and he ordered us around like copsiks they laughed at that even mark at the end of three hours their forearms were distilled pain the blue indicator inside read h the grad asked lawri enough for what weve got in mind we wondered about going home debby said clave snorted but they waited for lawris reply she said reluctantly id never find london tree again carther states is even smaller and theyre both on the wrong side of gold wed have to accelerate west drop in from the smoke ring and let gold pull us around do you want to go for gold again she smiled at their reactions me neither im tired we can get to another tree and moor the carm well build a pump before we need more water than that wed prefer a jungle of course lisa said one of the women bristled nine of us and three of you if clave said hold it merril usa are you sure you can move a jungle and thats good right lisa nodded cautiously anthon said thats one of the things we like about jungle life but you can only do it every twenty years or so we can moor the carrier carm to the middle of an integral tree and move it when and where we like why not do that with a jungle where would you mount the carm anthon thought it over the funnel no it might suddenly blow live steam he smiled suddenly there are more of you than us anyway sure pick a tree there was a grove of eight small trees thirty to fifty kilometers long the grad chose the biggest without asking he hovered on the forward jets at the western reach of the in tuft it was a wilderness a stream ran down the trunk and directly into the treemouth he looked for the rounded shapes of distorted old huts and they werent there the foliage around the treemouth had never been cut there were no paths for burial ceremonies or moving of garbage no earthlife showed not even as weeds it was daunting he said cheerily it seems were the first here lawn have you thought of a way to land this thing you have the helm hed thought it through in detail im afraid our best move is to moor at the trunk and go down climb we did it before clave could lead most of us down while say gavving and i wait wed have the carm for rescue operations after the rest of you get down gavving and i can follow weve climbed before hold it clave said this is taking too treefeeding long grad quit fooling around and just land in the treemouth we might set it on fire then we try again with another tree lawn had gone berserk at the suggestion of landing in the treemouth of london tree now she just rubbed her eyes tired they were all too tired theyd had enough of shocks and strangeness dave was right delay would be torment and there were trees to waste there was no kind of landing site in that wilderness everything he saw was green there was no drought here would it burn go for gois he went in over the treemouth and rammed the carm into the foliage hard enough to stick still shaken by the impact they forced their way through the doors fast and flailed with ponchos at the smoldering fires until they went out then finally they had time to look around minya stood panting grinning her black hair wild and wet the blackened poncho trailing from hen hand she snatched at his hand and cried copter plants gavving laughed i didnt know you liked copter plants i didnt either but in london tree they weeded out the copter plants and flowers and anything else they couldnt use she tapped at one two three ripe plants and the seed pods buzzed upward suddenly she was looking into his eyes close we did it just like we planned we found an unoccupied tree and its ours six of us six out of quinn tuft sorry twelve of us more to come she had fought the fire with a predatory grace unhampered by the thickening around her hips mlne gavving thought whether it looks like me or some copsik runner or harp or merrill mine ours hed tell her when the mood was right but that was too serious for now okay everything you see is ours what shall we call it thethingllikebest lean say citizen and mean all of us im no copsik and im not a triune citizens tree the foliage tasted like quinn tuft in the grads childhood before the drought he lay on his back in virgin foliage and sucked contemplatively he became aware that lawri was watching him from the dappled shadows she looked cold or just twitchy hugging her elbows cringing as if from a blow he snapped cant you relax eat some foliage i did its good she said without inflection it was irritating all right whats got you worried nobodys ever going to call you a copsik runner you saved our lives and everyone knows it youre clean fed rested safe and admired take a break scientist its over now she wouldnt meet his eyes jeffer how does this sound there are only two london tree citizens for at least ten thousand kiometers around doesnt it stand to reason that wed get along best together he sat back on his haunches why ask him i suppose it does well mark thinks so too okay he didnt have to say so we talked a little about building huts thats all but he looks at me like he knows like hes too polite to broach the subject yet but where else can i go who else is there jeffer dont make me marry a dwarf uh huh she turned convulsively to see his face he held up a hand to stop her from speaking in principle two scientists ought to make good mates too does that make sense but you watched me murder kiance i didnt warn him i didnt make any speeches about copsiks and freedom and war and justice i just killed him the first good chance i got id have killed you too to get us free of that place she didnt nod she didnt speak you could put a harpoon in my belly while im sleeping so dont push me i have to think she waited he thought now he knew why she irritated him with her twitchy unhappiness he was guilty and she had seen it not quite what one wanted in a mate did he want a wife hed always thought he did and with seven women and five men in nameless tuft no chance for an unm rried man to play around in such a tiny population but he should have his choice of wives so who gavving and minya married gave jayan jinny a unit and the twins seemed to like it that way anthon debby lisa might all have left mates in carther states and they might all be looking around but anthon didnt seem to think so and even if debby or lisa were available a romp might be fun but they looked so odd which left lawn he said being nearly sure he could get away with it lawri will you forgive me for murdering klance i notice you said murder not kill im not even c iming it was war i know what he was to you lawn i demand this she turned her back and wept the grad did not turn his back hed virtually invited her to try to kill him now or never lawn you can add too theres me or theres mark or theres nobody i might be giving mark another reason to kill me do i want to risk that she turned around i forgive you for murdering kiance then lets go to the carm and register a marriage well pick up witnesses along the way gave looked down into the treemouth i see rocks down there good well have to collect them for a cookflre cook gavvings waterbirds tear out some foliage so well have room where do we want the commons he didnt see many of his citizens in earshot and none were listening he raised his voice treefodder we have to get organized a reservoir tunnels huts pens maybe we wont find turkeys but were bound to find something maybe dumbos we need everything sooner or later we want elevators to the midpoint so we can moor the carm there but for now anthon flat on his back in the foliage with a long long woman in each arm bellowed claaave feed it to the treeee gave grinned at anthon he did seem to represent the majority opinion take a break citizens were home for good or ill they were alive and safe twothirds of the distance from goldblatts world to the congestion of masses and life forms around the l point and they would remember kendy he had promised a treasure of knowledge a pity he hadnt had time to give them more of a foretaste but they must have experienced exactly what hed predicted during reentry given that theyd survived a savages gods were omniscient werent they or were they gullible easily manipulated kendys memory had been pruned of such data whatever the legend would spread i can show you how to link your little tribes into one great state he had altered the progrpmming in the carm the carm would watch their behavior and record everything before the children of the state came again to kendy he would know them he would know one tiny enclave within that
