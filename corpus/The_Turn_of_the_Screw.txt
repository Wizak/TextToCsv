 the turn of the screw the story had held us round the fire sufficiently breathless but except the obvious remark that it was gruesome as on christmas eve in an old house a strange tale should essentially be i remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child the case i may mention was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion an appearance of a dreadful kind to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again but to encounter also herself before she had succeeded in doing so the same sight that had shaken him it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention someone else told a story not particularly effective which i saw he was not following this i took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait we waited in fact till two nights later but that same evening before we scattered he brought out what was in his mind i quite agree in regard to griffins ghost or whatever it was that its appearing first to the little boy at so tender an age adds a particular touch but its not the first occurrence of its charming kind that i know to have involved a child if the child gives the effect another turn of the screw what do you say to two children we say of course somebody exclaimed that they give two turns also that we want to hear about them i can see douglas there before the fire to which he had got up to present his back looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets nobody but me till now has ever heard its quite too horrible this naturally was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price and our friend with quiet art prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on its beyond everything nothing at all that i know touches it for sheer terror i remember asking he seemed to say it was not so simple as that to be really at a loss how to qualify it he passed his hand over his eyes made a little wincing grimace for dreadful dreadfulness oh how delicious cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of for general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain well then i said just sit right down and begin he turned round to the fire gave a kick to a log watched it an instant then as he faced us again i cant begin i shall have to send to town there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained the storys written its in a locked drawer it has not been out for years i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it it was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate he had broken a thickness of ice the formation of many a winter had had his reasons for a long silence the others resented postponement but it was just his scruples that charmed me i adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing then i asked him if the experience in question had been his own to this his answer was prompt oh thank god no and is the record yours you took the thing down nothing but the impression i took that here he tapped his heart ive never lost it then your manuscript is in old faded ink and in the most beautiful hand he hung fire again a womans she has been dead these twenty years she sent me the pages in question before she died they were all listening now and of course there was somebody to be arch or at any rate to draw the inference but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation she was a most charming person but she was ten years older than i she was my sisters governess he quietly said she was the most agreeable woman ive ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever it was long ago and this episode was long before i was at trinity and i found her at home on my coming down the second summer i was much there that year it was a beautiful one and we had in her offhours some strolls and talks in the garden talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice oh yes dont grin i liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me too if she hadnt she wouldnt have told me she had never told anyone it wasnt simply that she said so but that i knew she hadnt i was sure i could see youll easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me youll easily judge he repeated you will i fixed him too i see she was in love he laughed for the first time you are acute yes she was in love that is she had been that came out she couldnt tell her story without its coming out i saw it and she saw i saw it but neither of us spoke of it i remember the time and the place the corner of the lawn the shade of the great beeches and the long hot summer afternoon it wasnt a scene for a shudder but oh he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair youll receive the packet thursday morning i inquired probably not till the second post well then after dinner youll all meet me here he looked us round again isnt anybody going it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay i will and i will cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed mrs griffin however expressed the need for a little more light who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i cant wait for the story the story wont tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way mores the pity then thats the only way i ever understand wont you tell douglas somebody else inquired he sprang to his feet again yes tomorrow now i must go to bed good night and quickly catching up a candlestick he left us slightly bewildered from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair whereupon mrs griffin spoke well if i dont know who she was in love with i know who he was she was ten years older said her husband raison de plus at that age but its rather nice his long reticence forty years griffin put in with this outbreak at last the outbreak i returned will make a tremendous occasion of thursday night and everyone so agreed with me that in the light of it we lost all attention for everything else the last story however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial had been told we handshook and candlestuck as somebody said and went to bed i knew the next day that a letter containing the key had by the first post gone off to his london apartments but in spite of or perhaps just on account of the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner till such an hour of the evening in fact as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so we had it from him again before the fire in the hall as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night it appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth the departing ladies who had said they would stay didnt of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up but that only made his little final auditory more compact and select kept it round the hearth subject to a common thrill the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun the fact to be in possession of was therefore that his old friend the youngest of several daughters of a poor country parson had at the age of twenty on taking service for the first time in the schoolroom come up to london in trepidation to answer in person an advertisement that had already placed her in brief correspondence with the advertiser this person proved on her presenting herself for judgment at a house in harley street that impressed her as vast and imposing this prospective patron proved a gentleman a bachelor in the prime of life such a figure as had never risen save in a dream or an old novel before a fluttered anxious girl out of a hampshire vicarage one could easily fix his type it never happily dies out he was handsome and bold and pleasant offhand and gay and kind he struck her inevitably as gallant and splendid but what took her most of all and gave her the courage she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of favor an obligation he should gratefully incur she conceived him as rich but as fearfully extravagant saw him all in a glow of high fashion of good looks of expensive habits of charming ways with women he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed he had been left by the death of their parents in india guardian to a small nephew and a small niece children of a younger a military brother whom he had lost two years before these children were by the strangest of chances for a man in his position a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience very heavily on his hands it had all been a great worry and on his own part doubtless a series of blunders but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could had in particular sent them down to his other house the proper place for them being of course the country and kept them there from the first with the best people he could find to look after them parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself whenever he might to see how they were doing the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time he had put them in possession of bly which was healthy and secure and had placed at the head of their little establishment but below stairs only an excellent woman mrs grose whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother she was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent to the little girl of whom without children of her own she was by good luck extremely fond there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority she would also have in holidays to look after the small boy who had been for a term at school young as he was to be sent but what else could be done and who as the holidays were about to begin would be back from one day to the other there had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose she had done for them quite beautifully she was a most respectable person till her death the great awkwardness of which had precisely left no alternative but the school for little miles mrs grose since then in the way of manners and things had done as she could for flora and there were further a cook a housemaid a dairywoman an old pony an old groom and an old gardener all likewise thoroughly respectable so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question and what did the former governess die of of so much respectability our friends answer was prompt that will come out i dont anticipate excuse me i thought that was just what you are doing in her successors place i suggested i should have wished to learn if the office brought with it necessary danger to life douglas completed my thought she did wish to learn and she did learn you shall hear tomorrow what she learned meanwhile of course the prospect struck her as slightly grim she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness she hesitated took a couple of days to consult and consider but the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure and on a second interview she faced the music she engaged and douglas with this made a pause that for the benefit of the company moved me to throw in the moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man she succumbed to it he got up and as he had done the night before went to the fire gave a stir to a log with his foot then stood a moment with his back to us she saw him only twice yes but thats just the beauty of her passion a little to my surprise on this douglas turned round to me it was the beauty of it there were others he went on who hadnt succumbed he told her frankly all his difficulty that for several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive they were somehow simply afraid it sounded dull it sounded strange and all the more so because of his main condition which was that she should never trouble him but never never neither appeal nor complain nor write about anything only meet all questions herself receive all moneys from his solicitor take the whole thing over and let him alone she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked she never saw him again oh said the lady which as our friend immediately left us again was the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till the next night by the corner of the hearth in the best chair he opened the faded red cover of a thin oldfashioned giltedged album the whole thing took indeed more nights than one but on the first occasion the same lady put another question what is your title i havent one oh i have i said but douglas without heeding me had begun to read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the beauty of his authors hand i i remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong after rising in town to meet his appeal i had at all events a couple of very bad days found myself doubtful again felt indeed sure i had made a mistake in this state of mind i spent the long hours of bumping swinging coach that carried me to the stopping place at which i was to be met by a vehicle from the house this convenience i was told had been ordered and i found toward the close of the june afternoon a commodious fly in waiting for me driving at that hour on a lovely day through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome my fortitude mounted afresh and as we turned into the avenue encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk i suppose i had expected or had dreaded something so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise i remember as a most pleasant impression the broad clear front its open windows and fresh curtains and the pair of maids looking out i remember the lawn and the bright flowers and the crunch of my wheels on the gravel and the clustered treetops over which the rooks circled and cawed in the golden sky the scene had a greatness that made it a different affair from my own scant home and there immediately appeared at the door with a little girl in her hand a civil person who dropped me as decent a curtsy as if i had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor i had received in harley street a narrower notion of the place and that as i recalled it made me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman suggested that what i was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise i had no drop again till the next day for i was carried triumphantly through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my pupils the little girl who accompanied mrs grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her she was the most beautiful child i had ever seen and i afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her i slept little that night i was too much excited and this astonished me too i recollect remained with me adding to my sense of the liberality with which i was treated the large impressive room one of the best in the house the great state bed as i almost felt it the full figured draperies the long glasses in which for the first time i could see myself from head to foot all struck me like the extraordinary charm of my small charge as so many things thrown in it was thrown in as well from the first moment that i should get on with mrs grose in a relation over which on my way in the coach i fear i had rather brooded the only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad to see me i perceived within half an hour that she was so glad stout simple plain clean wholesome woman as to be positively on her guard against showing it too much i wondered even then a little why she should wish not to show it and that with reflection with suspicion might of course have made me uneasy but it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl the vision of whose angelic beauty had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that before morning made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect to watch from my open window the faint summer dawn to look at such portions of the rest of the house as i could catch and to listen while in the fading dusk the first birds began to twitter for the possible recurrence of a sound or two less natural and not without but within that i had fancied i heard there had been a moment when i believed i recognized faint and far the cry of a child there had been another when i found myself just consciously starting as at the passage before my door of a light footstep but these fancies were not marked enough not to be thrown off and it is only in the light or the gloom i should rather say of other and subsequent matters that they now come back to me to watch teach form little flora would too evidently be the making of a happy and useful life it had been agreed between us downstairs that after this first occasion i should have her as a matter of course at night her small white bed being already arranged to that end in my room what i had undertaken was the whole care of her and she had remained just this last time with mrs grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity in spite of this timidity which the child herself in the oddest way in the world had been perfectly frank and brave about allowing it without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness with the deep sweet serenity indeed of one of raphaels holy infants to be discussed to be imputed to her and to determine us i feel quite sure she would presently like me it was part of what i already liked mrs grose herself for the pleasure i could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as i sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil in a high chair and a bib brightly facing me between them over bread and milk there were naturally things that in floras presence could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks obscure and roundabout allusions and the little boy does he look like her is he too so very remarkable one wouldnt flatter a child oh miss most remarkable if you think well of this one and she stood there with a plate in her hand beaming at our companion who looked from one of us to the other with placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us yes if i do you will be carried away by the little gentleman well that i think is what i came for to be carried away im afraid however i remember feeling the impulse to add im rather easily carried away i was carried away in london i can still see mrs groses broad face as she took this in in harley street in harley street well miss youre not the first and you wont be the last oh ive no pretension i could laugh to being the only one my other pupil at any rate as i understand comes back tomorrow not tomorrow friday miss he arrives as you did by the coach under care of the guard and is to be met by the same carriage i forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance i should be in waiting for him with his little sister an idea in which mrs grose concurred so heartily that i somehow took her manner as a kind of comforting pledge never falsified thank heaven that we should on every question be quite at one oh she was glad i was there what i felt the next day was i suppose nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale as i walked round them gazed up at them took them in of my new circumstances they had as it were an extent and mass for which i had not been prepared and in the presence of which i found myself freshly a little scared as well as a little proud lessons in this agitation certainly suffered some delay i reflected that my first duty was by the gentlest arts i could contrive to win the child into the sense of knowing me i spent the day with her outofdoors i arranged with her to her great satisfaction that it should be she she only who might show me the place she showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret with droll delightful childish talk about it and with the result in half an hour of our becoming immense friends young as she was i was struck throughout our little tour with her confidence and courage with the way in empty chambers and dull corridors on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy her morning music her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked rang out and led me on i have not seen bly since the day i left it and i daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted but as my little conductress with her hair of gold and her frock of blue danced before me round corners and pattered down passages i had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a rosy sprite such a place as would somehow for diversion of the young idea take all color out of storybooks and fairytales wasnt it just a storybook over which i had fallen adoze and adream no it was a big ugly antique but convenient house embodying a few features of a building still older halfreplaced and halfutilized in which i had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship well i was strangely at the helm ii this came home to me when two days later i drove over with flora to meet as mrs grose said the little gentleman and all the more for an incident that presenting itself the second evening had deeply disconcerted me the first day had been on the whole as i have expressed reassuring but i was to see it wind up in keen apprehension the postbag that evening it came late contained a letter for me which however in the hand of my employer i found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another addressed to himself with a seal still unbroken this i recognize is from the headmaster and the headmasters an awful bore read him please deal with him but mind you dont report not a word im off i broke the seal with a great effort so great a one that i was a long time coming to it took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed i had better have let it wait till morning for it gave me a second sleepless night with no counsel to take the next day i was full of distress and it finally got so the better of me that i determined to open myself at least to mrs grose what does it mean the childs dismissed his school she gave me a look that i remarked at the moment then visibly with a quick blankness seemed to try to take it back but arent they all sent home yes but only for the holidays miles may never go back at all consciously under my attention she reddened they wont take him they absolutely decline at this she raised her eyes which she had turned from me i saw them fill with good tears what has he done i hesitated then i judged best simply to hand her my letter which however had the effect of making her without taking it simply put her hands behind her she shook her head sadly such things are not for me miss my counselor couldnt read i winced at my mistake which i attenuated as i could and opened my letter again to repeat it to her then faltering in the act and folding it up once more i put it back in my pocket is he really bad the tears were still in her eyes do the gentlemen say so they go into no particulars they simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him that can have only one meaning mrs grose listened with dumb emotion she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be so that presently to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind i went on that hes an injury to the others at this with one of the quick turns of simple folk she suddenly flamed up master miles him an injury there was such a flood of good faith in it that though i had not yet seen the child my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea i found myself to meet my friend the better offering it on the spot sarcastically to his poor little innocent mates its too dreadful cried mrs grose to say such cruel things why hes scarce ten years old yes yes it would be incredible she was evidently grateful for such a profession see him miss first then believe it i felt forthwith a new impatience to see him it was the beginning of a curiosity that for all the next hours was to deepen almost to pain mrs grose was aware i could judge of what she had produced in me and she followed it up with assurance you might as well believe it of the little lady bless her she added the next moment look at her i turned and saw that flora whom ten minutes before i had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper a pencil and a copy of nice round os now presented herself to view at the open door she expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties looking to me however with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person which had rendered necessary that she should follow me i needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of mrs groses comparison and catching my pupil in my arms covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement nonetheless the rest of the day i watched for further occasion to approach my colleague especially as toward evening i began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me i overtook her i remember on the staircase we went down together and at the bottom i detained her holding her there with a hand on her arm i take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that youve never known him to be bad she threw back her head she had clearly by this time and very honestly adopted an attitude oh never known him i dont pretend that i was upset again then you have known him yes indeed miss thank god on reflection i accepted this you mean that a boy who never is is no boy for me i held her tighter you like them with the spirit to be naughty then keeping pace with her answer so do i i eagerly brought out but not to the degree to contaminate to contaminate my big word left her at a loss i explained it to corrupt she stared taking my meaning in but it produced in her an odd laugh are you afraid hell corrupt you she put the question with such a fine bold humor that with a laugh a little silly doubtless to match her own i gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule but the next day as the hour for my drive approached i cropped up in another place what was the lady who was here before the last governess she was also young and pretty almost as young and almost as pretty miss even as you ah then i hope her youth and her beauty helped her i recollect throwing off he seems to like us young and pretty oh he did mrs grose assented it was the way he liked everyone she had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up i mean thats his way the masters i was struck but of whom did you speak first she looked blank but she colored why of him of the master of who else there was so obviously no one else that the next moment i had lost my impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant and i merely asked what i wanted to know did she see anything in the boy that wasnt right she never told me i had a scruple but i overcame it was she careful particular mrs grose appeared to try to be conscientious about some things yes but not about all again she considered well miss shes gone i wont tell tales i quite understand your feeling i hastened to reply but i thought it after an instant not opposed to this concession to pursue did she die here no she went off i dont know what there was in this brevity of mrs groses that struck me as ambiguous went off to die mrs grose looked straight out of the window but i felt that hypothetically i had a right to know what young persons engaged for bly were expected to do she was taken ill you mean and went home she was not taken ill so far as appeared in this house she left it at the end of the year to go home as she said for a short holiday to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right we had then a young woman a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever and she took the children altogether for the interval but our young lady never came back and at the very moment i was expecting her i heard from the master that she was dead i turned this over but of what he never told me but please miss said mrs grose i must get to my work iii her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not for my just preoccupations a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem we met after i had brought home little miles more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction my general emotion so monstrous was i then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict i was a little late on the scene and i felt as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down that i had seen him on the instant without and within in the great glow of freshness the same positive fragrance of purity in which i had from the first moment seen his little sister he was incredibly beautiful and mrs grose had put her finger on it everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence what i then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that i have never found to the same degree in any child his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love it would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence and by the time i had got back to bly with him i remained merely bewildered so far that is as i was not outraged by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room in a drawer as soon as i could compass a private word with mrs grose i declared to her that it was grotesque she promptly understood me you mean the cruel charge it doesnt live an instant my dear woman look at him she smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm i assure you miss i do nothing else what will you say then she immediately added in answer to the letter i had made up my mind nothing and to his uncle i was incisive nothing and to the boy himself i was wonderful nothing she gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth then ill stand by you well see it out well see it out i ardently echoed giving her my hand to make it a vow she held me there a moment then whisked up her apron again with her detached hand would you mind miss if i used the freedom to kiss me no i took the good creature in my arms and after we had embraced like sisters felt still more fortified and indignant this at all events was for the time a time so full that as i recall the way it went it reminds me of all the art i now need to make it a little distinct what i look back at with amazement is the situation i accepted i had undertaken with my companion to see it out and i was under a charm apparently that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort i was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity i found it simple in my ignorance my confusion and perhaps my conceit to assume that i could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning i am unable even to remember at this day what proposal i framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies lessons with me indeed that charming summer we all had a theory that he was to have but i now feel that for weeks the lessons must have been rather my own i learned something at first certainly that had not been one of the teachings of my small smothered life learned to be amused and even amusing and not to think for the morrow it was the first time in a manner that i had known space and air and freedom all the music of summer and all the mystery of nature and then there was consideration and consideration was sweet oh it was a trap not designed but deep to my imagination to my delicacy perhaps to my vanity to whatever in me was most excitable the best way to picture it all is to say that i was off my guard they gave me so little trouble they were of a gentleness so extraordinary i used to speculate but even this with a dim disconnectedness as to how the rough future for all futures are rough would handle them and might bruise them they had the bloom of health and happiness and yet as if i had been in charge of a pair of little grandees of princes of the blood for whom everything to be right would have to be enclosed and protected the only form that in my fancy the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic a really royal extension of the garden and the park it may be of course above all that what suddenly broke into this gives the previous time a charm of stillness that hush in which something gathers or crouches the change was actually like the spring of a beast in the first weeks the days were long they often at their finest gave me what i used to call my own hour the hour when for my pupils teatime and bedtime having come and gone i had before my final retirement a small interval alone much as i liked my companions this hour was the thing in the day i liked most and i liked it best of all when as the light faded or rather i should say the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded in a flushed sky from the old trees i could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me the beauty and dignity of the place it was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified doubtless perhaps also to reflect that by my discretion my quiet good sense and general high propriety i was giving pleasure if he ever thought of it to the person to whose pressure i had responded what i was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me and that i could after all do it proved even a greater joy than i had expected i daresay i fancied myself in short a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear well i needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign it was plump one afternoon in the middle of my very hour the children were tucked away and i had come out for my stroll one of the thoughts that as i dont in the least shrink now from noting used to be with me in these wanderings was that it would be as charming as a charming story suddenly to meet someone someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve i didnt ask more than that i only asked that he should know and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it and the kind light of it in his handsome face that was exactly present to me by which i mean the face was when on the first of these occasions at the end of a long june day i stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house what arrested me on the spot and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for was the sense that my imagination had in a flash turned real he did stand there but high up beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which on that first morning little flora had conducted me this tower was one of a pair square incongruous crenelated structures that were distinguished for some reason though i could see little difference as the new and the old they flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious dating in their gingerbread antiquity from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past i admired them had fancies about them for we could all profit in a degree especially when they loomed through the dusk by the grandeur of their actual battlements yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure i had so often invoked seemed most in place it produced in me this figure in the clear twilight i remember two distinct gasps of emotion which were sharply the shock of my first and that of my second surprise my second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first the man who met my eyes was not the person i had precipitately supposed there came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which after these years there is no living view that i can hope to give an unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred and the figure that faced me was a few more seconds assured me as little anyone else i knew as it was the image that had been in my mind i had not seen it in harley street i had not seen it anywhere the place moreover in the strangest way in the world had on the instant and by the very fact of its appearance become a solitude to me at least making my statement here with a deliberation with which i have never made it the whole feeling of the moment returns it was as if while i took in what i did take in all the rest of the scene had been stricken with death i can hear again as i write the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped the rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky and the friendly hour lost for the minute all its voice but there was no other change in nature unless indeed it were a change that i saw with a stranger sharpness the gold was still in the sky the clearness in the air and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame thats how i thought with extraordinary quickness of each person that he might have been and that he was not we were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who then he was and to feel as an effect of my inability to say a wonder that in a few instants more became intense the great question or one of these is afterward i know with regard to certain matters the question of how long they have lasted well this matter of mine think what you will of it lasted while i caught at a dozen possibilities none of which made a difference for the better that i could see in there having been in the house and for how long above all a person of whom i was in ignorance it lasted while i just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person it lasted while this visitant at all events and there was a touch of the strange freedom as i remember in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat seemed to fix me from his position with just the question just the scrutiny through the fading light that his own presence provoked we were too far apart to call to each other but there was a moment at which at shorter range some challenge between us breaking the hush would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare he was in one of the angles the one away from the house very erect as it struck me and with both hands on the ledge so i saw him as i see the letters i form on this page then exactly after a minute as if to add to the spectacle he slowly changed his place passed looking at me hard all the while to the opposite corner of the platform yes i had the sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me and i can see at this moment the way his hand as he went passed from one of the crenelations to the next he stopped at the other corner but less long and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me he turned away that was all i knew iv it was not that i didnt wait on this occasion for more for i was rooted as deeply as i was shaken was there a secret at bly a mystery of udolpho or an insane an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement i cant say how long i turned it over or how long in a confusion of curiosity and dread i remained where i had had my collision i only recall that when i reentered the house darkness had quite closed in agitation in the interval certainly had held me and driven me for i must in circling about the place have walked three miles but i was to be later on so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill the most singular part of it in fact singular as the rest had been was the part i became in the hall aware of in meeting mrs grose this picture comes back to me in the general train the impression as i received it on my return of the wide white panelled space bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet and of the good surprised look of my friend which immediately told me she had missed me it came to me straightway under her contact that with plain heartiness mere relieved anxiety at my appearance she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident i had there ready for her i had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up and i somehow measured the importance of what i had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one as i may say with the instinct of sparing my companion on the spot accordingly in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me i for a reason that i couldnt then have phrased achieved an inward resolution offered a vague pretext for my lateness and with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet went as soon as possible to my room here it was another affair here for many days after it was a queer affair enough there were hours from day to day or at least there were moments snatched even from clear duties when i had to shut myself up to think it was not so much yet that i was more nervous than i could bear to be as that i was remarkably afraid of becoming so for the truth i had now to turn over was simply and clearly the truth that i could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom i had been so inexplicably and yet as it seemed to me so intimately concerned it took little time to see that i could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications the shock i had suffered must have sharpened all my senses i felt sure at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention that i had not been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any game of whatever it was that i knew nothing was known around me there was but one sane inference someone had taken a liberty rather gross that was what repeatedly i dipped into my room and locked the door to say to myself we had been collectively subject to an intrusion some unscrupulous traveler curious in old houses had made his way in unobserved enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view and then stolen out as he came if he had given me such a bold hard stare that was but a part of his indiscretion the good thing after all was that we should surely see no more of him this was not so good a thing i admit as not to leave me to judge that what essentially made nothing else much signify was simply my charming work my charming work was just my life with miles and flora and through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could throw myself into it in trouble the attraction of my small charges was a constant joy leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office there was to be no gray prose it appeared and no long grind so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty it was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the schoolroom i dont mean by this of course that we studied only fiction and verse i mean i can express no otherwise the sort of interest my companions inspired how can i describe that except by saying that instead of growing used to them and its a marvel for a governess i call the sisterhood to witness i made constant fresh discoveries there was one direction assuredly in which these discoveries stopped deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boys conduct at school it had been promptly given me i have noted to face that mystery without a pang perhaps even it would be nearer the truth to say that without a word he himself had cleared it up he had made the whole charge absurd my conclusion bloomed there with the real rose flush of his innocence he was only too fine and fair for the little horrid unclean school world and he had paid a price for it i reflected acutely that the sense of such differences such superiorities of quality always on the part of the majority which could include even stupid sordid headmasters turn infallibly to the vindictive both the children had a gentleness it was their only fault and it never made miles a muff that kept them how shall i express it almost impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable they were like the cherubs of the anecdote who had morally at any rate nothing to whack i remember feeling with miles in especial as if he had had as it were no history we expect of a small child a scant one but there was in this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive yet extraordinarily happy that more than in any creature of his age i have seen struck me as beginning anew each day he had never for a second suffered i took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised if he had been wicked he would have caught it and i should have caught it by the rebound i should have found the trace i found nothing at all and he was therefore an angel he never spoke of his school never mentioned a comrade or a master and i for my part was quite too much disgusted to allude to them of course i was under the spell and the wonderful part is that even at the time i perfectly knew i was but i gave myself up to it it was an antidote to any pain and i had more pains than one i was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home where things were not going well but with my children what things in the world mattered that was the question i used to put to my scrappy retirements i was dazzled by their loveliness there was a sunday to get on when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church in consequence of which as the day declined i had arranged with mrs grose that should the evening show improvement we would attend together the late service the rain happily stopped and i prepared for our walk which through the park and by the good road to the village would be a matter of twenty minutes coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall i remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them with a publicity perhaps not edifying while i sat with the children at their tea served on sundays by exception in that cold clean temple of mahogany and brass the grownup dining room the gloves had been dropped there and i turned in to recover them the day was gray enough but the afternoon light still lingered and it enabled me on crossing the threshold not only to recognize on a chair near the wide window then closed the articles i wanted but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in one step into the room had sufficed my vision was instantaneous it was all there the person looking straight in was the person who had already appeared to me he appeared thus again with i wont say greater distinctness for that was impossible but with a nearness that represented a forward stride in our intercourse and made me as i met him catch my breath and turn cold he was the same he was the same and seen this time as he had been seen before from the waist up the window though the dining room was on the ground floor not going down to the terrace on which he stood his face was close to the glass yet the effect of this better view was strangely only to show me how intense the former had been he remained but a few seconds long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized but it was as if i had been looking at him for years and had known him always something however happened this time that had not happened before his stare into my face through the glass and across the room was as deep and hard as then but it quitted me for a moment during which i could still watch it see it fix successively several other things on the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there he had come for someone else the flash of this knowledge for it was knowledge in the midst of dread produced in me the most extraordinary effect started as i stood there a sudden vibration of duty and courage i say courage because i was beyond all doubt already far gone i bounded straight out of the door again reached that of the house got in an instant upon the drive and passing along the terrace as fast as i could rush turned a corner and came full in sight but it was in sight of nothing now my visitor had vanished i stopped i almost dropped with the real relief of this but i took in the whole scene i gave him time to reappear i call it time but how long was it i cant speak to the purpose today of the duration of these things that kind of measure must have left me they couldnt have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last the terrace and the whole place the lawn and the garden beyond it all i could see of the park were empty with a great emptiness there were shrubberies and big trees but i remember the clear assurance i felt that none of them concealed him he was there or was not there not there if i didnt see him i got hold of this then instinctively instead of returning as i had come went to the window it was confusedly present to me that i ought to place myself where he had stood i did so i applied my face to the pane and looked as he had looked into the room as if at this moment to show me exactly what his range had been mrs grose as i had done for himself just before came in from the hall with this i had the full image of a repetition of what had already occurred she saw me as i had seen my own visitant she pulled up short as i had done i gave her something of the shock that i had received she turned white and this made me ask myself if i had blanched as much she stared in short and retreated on just my lines and i knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that i should presently meet her i remained where i was and while i waited i thought of more things than one but theres only one i take space to mention i wondered why she should be scared v oh she let me know as soon as round the corner of the house she loomed again into view what in the name of goodness is the matter she was now flushed and out of breath i said nothing till she came quite near with me i must have made a wonderful face do i show it youre as white as a sheet you look awful i considered i could meet on this without scruple any innocence my need to respect the bloom of mrs groses had dropped without a rustle from my shoulders and if i wavered for the instant it was not with what i kept back i put out my hand to her and she took it i held her hard a little liking to feel her close to me there was a kind of support in the shy heave of her surprise you came for me for church of course but i cant go has anything happened yes you must know now did i look very queer through this window dreadful well i said ive been frightened mrs groses eyes expressed plainly that she had no wish to be yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience oh it was quite settled that she must share just what you saw from the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that what i saw just before was much worse her hand tightened what was it an extraordinary man looking in what extraordinary man i havent the least idea mrs grose gazed round us in vain then where is he gone i know still less have you seen him before yes once on the old tower she could only look at me harder do you mean hes a stranger oh very much yet you didnt tell me no for reasons but now that youve guessed mrs groses round eyes encountered this charge ah i havent guessed she said very simply how can i if you dont imagine i dont in the very least youve seen him nowhere but on the tower and on this spot just now mrs grose looked round again what was he doing on the tower only standing there and looking down at me she thought a minute was he a gentleman i found i had no need to think no she gazed in deeper wonder no then nobody about the place nobody from the village nobody nobody i didnt tell you but i made sure she breathed a vague relief this was oddly so much to the good it only went indeed a little way but if he isnt a gentleman what is he hes a horror a horror hes god help me if i know what he is mrs grose looked round once more she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance then pulling herself together turned to me with abrupt inconsequence its time we should be at church oh im not fit for church wont it do you good it wont do them i nodded at the house the children i cant leave them now youre afraid i spoke boldly im afraid of him mrs groses large face showed me at this for the first time the faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute i somehow made out in it the delayed dawn of an idea i myself had not given her and that was as yet quite obscure to me it comes back to me that i thought instantly of this as something i could get from her and i felt it to be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more when was it on the tower about the middle of the month at this same hour almost at dark said mrs grose oh no not nearly i saw him as i see you then how did he get in and how did he get out i laughed i had no opportunity to ask him this evening you see i pursued he has not been able to get in he only peeps i hope it will be confined to that she had now let go my hand she turned away a little i waited an instant then i brought out go to church goodbye i must watch slowly she faced me again do you fear for them we met in another long look dont you instead of answering she came nearer to the window and for a minute applied her face to the glass you see how he could see i meanwhile went on she didnt move how long was he here till i came out i came to meet him mrs grose at last turned round and there was still more in her face i couldnt have come out neither could i i laughed again but i did come i have my duty so have i mine she replied after which she added what is he like ive been dying to tell you but hes like nobody nobody she echoed he has no hat then seeing in her face that she already in this with a deeper dismay found a touch of picture i quickly added stroke to stroke he has red hair very red closecurling and a pale face long in shape with straight good features and little rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair his eyebrows are somehow darker they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal his eyes are sharp strange awfully but i only know clearly that theyre rather small and very fixed his mouths wide and his lips are thin and except for his little whiskers hes quite cleanshaven he gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor an actor it was impossible to resemble one less at least than mrs grose at that moment ive never seen one but so i suppose them hes tall active erect i continued but never no never a gentleman my companions face had blanched as i went on her round eyes started and her mild mouth gaped a gentleman she gasped confounded stupefied a gentleman he you know him then she visibly tried to hold herself but he is handsome i saw the way to help her remarkably and dressed in somebodys clothes theyre smart but theyre not his own she broke into a breathless affirmative groan theyre the masters i caught it up you do know him she faltered but a second quint she cried quint peter quint his own man his valet when he was here when the master was gaping still but meeting me she pieced it all together he never wore his hat but he did wear well there were waistcoats missed they were both here last year then the master went and quint was alone i followed but halting a little alone alone with us then as from a deeper depth in charge she added and what became of him she hung fire so long that i was still more mystified he went too she brought out at last went where her expression at this became extraordinary god knows where he died died i almost shrieked she seemed fairly to square herself plant herself more firmly to utter the wonder of it yes mr quint is dead vi it took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could my dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified and my companions knowledge henceforth a knowledge half consternation and half compassion of that liability there had been this evening after the revelation left me for an hour so prostrate there had been for either of us no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows of prayers and promises a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out the result of our having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements she herself had seen nothing not the shadow of a shadow and nobody in the house but the governess was in the governesss plight yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as i gave it to her and ended by showing me on this ground an awestricken tenderness an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities what was settled between us accordingly that night was that we thought we might bear things together and i was not even sure that in spite of her exemption it was she who had the best of the burden i knew at this hour i think as well as i knew later what i was capable of meeting to shelter my pupils but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract i was queer company enough quite as queer as the company i received but as i trace over what we went through i see how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that by good fortune could steady us it was the idea the second movement that led me straight out as i may say of the inner chamber of my dread i could take the air in the court at least and there mrs grose could join me perfectly can i recall now the particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night we had gone over and over every feature of what i had seen he was looking for someone else you say someone who was not you he was looking for little miles a portentous clearness now possessed me thats whom he was looking for but how do you know i know i know i know my exaltation grew and you know my dear she didnt deny this but i required i felt not even so much telling as that she resumed in a moment at any rate what if he should see him little miles thats what he wants she looked immensely scared again the child heaven forbid the man he wants to appear to them that he might was an awful conception and yet somehow i could keep it at bay which moreover as we lingered there was what i succeeded in practically proving i had an absolute certainty that i should see again what i had already seen but something within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience by accepting by inviting by surmounting it all i should serve as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions the children in especial i should thus fence about and absolutely save i recall one of the last things i said that night to mrs grose it does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned she looked at me hard as i musingly pulled up his having been here and the time they were with him the time they were with him and his name his presence his history in any way oh the little lady doesnt remember she never heard or knew the circumstances of his death i thought with some intensity perhaps not but miles would remember miles would know ah dont try him broke from mrs grose i returned her the look she had given me dont be afraid i continued to think it is rather odd that he has never spoken of him never by the least allusion and you tell me they were great friends oh it wasnt him mrs grose with emphasis declared it was quints own fancy to play with him i mean to spoil him she paused a moment then she added quint was much too free this gave me straight from my vision of his face such a face a sudden sickness of disgust too free with my boy too free with everyone i forbore for the moment to analyze this description further than by the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the household of the halfdozen maids and men who were still of our small colony but there was everything for our apprehension in the lucky fact that no discomfortable legend no perturbation of scullions had ever within anyones memory attached to the kind old place it had neither bad name nor ill fame and mrs grose most apparently only desired to cling to me and to quake in silence i even put her the very last thing of all to the test it was when at midnight she had her hand on the schoolroom door to take leave i have it from you then for its of great importance that he was definitely and admittedly bad oh not admittedly i knew it but the master didnt and you never told him well he didnt like talebearing he hated complaints he was terribly short with anything of that kind and if people were all right to him he wouldnt be bothered with more this squared well enough with my impressions of him he was not a troubleloving gentleman nor so very particular perhaps about some of the company he kept all the same i pressed my interlocutress i promise you i would have told she felt my discrimination i daresay i was wrong but really i was afraid afraid of what of things that man could do quint was so clever he was so deep i took this in still more than probably i showed you werent afraid of anything else not of his effect his effect she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while i faltered on innocent little precious lives they were in your charge no they were not in mine she roundly and distressfully returned the master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed not to be well and the country air so good for him so he had everything to say yes she let me have it even about them them that creature i had to smother a kind of howl and you could bear it no i couldnt and i cant now and the poor woman burst into tears a rigid control from the next day was as i have said to follow them yet how often and how passionately for a week we came back together to the subject much as we had discussed it that sunday night i was in the immediate later hours in especial for it may be imagined whether i slept still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me i myself had kept back nothing but there was a word mrs grose had kept back i was sure moreover by morning that this was not from a failure of frankness but because on every side there were fears it seems to me indeed in retrospect that by the time the morrows sun was high i had restlessly read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences what they gave me above all was just the sinister figure of the living man the dead one would keep awhile and of the months he had continuously passed at bly which added up made a formidable stretch the limit of this evil time had arrived only when on the dawn of a winters morning peter quint was found by a laborer going to early work stone dead on the road from the village a catastrophe explained superficially at least by a visible wound to his head such a wound as might have been produced and as on the final evidence had been by a fatal slip in the dark and after leaving the public house on the steepish icy slope a wrong path altogether at the bottom of which he lay the icy slope the turn mistaken at night and in liquor accounted for much practically in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter for everything but there had been matters in his life strange passages and perils secret disorders vices more than suspected that would have accounted for a good deal more i scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture of my state of mind but i was in these days literally able to find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of me i now saw that i had been asked for a service admirable and difficult and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen oh in the right quarter that i could succeed where many another girl might have failed it was an immense help to me i confess i rather applaud myself as i look back that i saw my service so strongly and so simply i was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit a deep constant ache of ones own committed heart we were cut off really together we were united in our danger they had nothing but me and i well i had them it was in short a magnificent chance this chance presented itself to me in an image richly material i was a screen i was to stand before them the more i saw the less they would i began to watch them in a stifled suspense a disguised excitement that might well had it continued too long have turned to something like madness what saved me as i now see was that it turned to something else altogether it didnt last as suspense it was superseded by horrible proofs proofs i say yes from the moment i really took hold this moment dated from an afternoon hour that i happened to spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone we had left miles indoors on the red cushion of a deep window seat he had wished to finish a book and i had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless his sister on the contrary had been alert to come out and i strolled with her half an hour seeking the shade for the sun was still high and the day exceptionally warm i was aware afresh with her as we went of how like her brother she contrived it was the charming thing in both children to let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround they were never importunate and yet never listless my attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer i walked in a world of their invention they had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine so that my time was taken only with being for them some remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that was merely thanks to my superior my exalted stamp a happy and highly distinguished sinecure i forget what i was on the present occasion i only remember that i was something very important and very quiet and that flora was playing very hard we were on the edge of the lake and as we had lately begun geography the lake was the sea of azof suddenly in these circumstances i became aware that on the other side of the sea of azof we had an interested spectator the way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world the strangest that is except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged itself i had sat down with a piece of work for i was something or other that could sit on the old stone bench which overlooked the pond and in this position i began to take in with certitude and yet without direct vision the presence at a distance of a third person the old trees the thick shrubbery made a great and pleasant shade but it was all suffused with the brightness of the hot still hour there was no ambiguity in anything none whatever at least in the conviction i from one moment to another found myself forming as to what i should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising my eyes they were attached at this juncture to the stitching in which i was engaged and i can feel once more the spasm of my effort not to move them till i should so have steadied myself as to be able to make up my mind what to do there was an alien object in view a figure whose right of presence i instantly passionately questioned i recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities reminding myself that nothing was more natural for instance then the appearance of one of the men about the place or even of a messenger a postman or a tradesmans boy from the village that reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as i was conscious still even without looking of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not of the positive identity of the apparition i would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second meanwhile with an effort that was already sharp enough i transferred my eyes straight to little flora who at the moment was about ten yards away my heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see and i held my breath while i waited for what a cry from her what some sudden innocent sign either of interest or of alarm would tell me i waited but nothing came then in the first place and there is something more dire in this i feel than in anything i have to relate i was determined by a sense that within a minute all sounds from her had previously dropped and in the second by the circumstance that also within the minute she had in her play turned her back to the water this was her attitude when i at last looked at her looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still together under direct personal notice she had picked up a small flat piece of wood which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make the thing a boat this second morsel as i watched her she was very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place my apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some seconds i felt i was ready for more then i again shifted my eyes i faced what i had to face vii i got hold of mrs grose as soon after this as i could and i can give no intelligible account of how i fought out the interval yet i still hear myself cry as i fairly threw myself into her arms they know its too monstrous they know they know and what on earth i felt her incredulity as she held me why all that we know and heaven knows what else besides then as she released me i made it out to her made it out perhaps only now with full coherency even to myself two hours ago in the garden i could scarce articulate flora saw mrs grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach she has told you she panted not a word thats the horror she kept it to herself the child of eight that child unutterable still for me was the stupefaction of it mrs grose of course could only gape the wider then how do you know i was there i saw with my eyes saw that she was perfectly aware do you mean aware of him no of her i was conscious as i spoke that i looked prodigious things for i got the slow reflection of them in my companions face another person this time but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror and evil a woman in black pale and dreadful with such an air also and such a face on the other side of the lake i was there with the child quiet for the hour and in the midst of it she came came how from where from where they come from she just appeared and stood there but not so near and without coming nearer oh for the effect and the feeling she might have been as close as you my friend with an odd impulse fell back a step was she someone youve never seen yes but someone the child has someone you have then to show how i had thought it all out my predecessor the one who died miss jessel miss jessel you dont believe me i pressed she turned right and left in her distress how can you be sure this drew from me in the state of my nerves a flash of impatience then ask flora shes sure but i had no sooner spoken than i caught myself up no for gods sake dont shell say she isnt shell lie mrs grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest ah how can you because im clear flora doesnt want me to know its only then to spare you no no there are depths depths the more i go over it the more i see in it and the more i see in it the more i fear i dont know what i dont see what i dont fear mrs grose tried to keep up with me you mean youre afraid of seeing her again oh no thats nothing now then i explained its of not seeing her but my companion only looked wan i dont understand you why its that the child may keep it up and that the child assuredly will without my knowing it at the image of this possibility mrs grose for a moment collapsed yet presently to pull herself together again as if from the positive force of the sense of what should we yield an inch there would really be to give way to dear dear we must keep our heads and after all if she doesnt mind it she even tried a grim joke perhaps she likes it likes such things a scrap of an infant isnt it just a proof of her blessed innocence my friend bravely inquired she brought me for the instant almost round oh we must clutch at that we must cling to it if it isnt a proof of what you say its a proof of god knows what for the womans a horror of horrors mrs grose at this fixed her eyes a minute on the ground then at last raising them tell me how you know she said then you admit its what she was i cried tell me how you know my friend simply repeated know by seeing her by the way she looked at you do you mean so wickedly dear me no i could have borne that she gave me never a glance she only fixed the child mrs grose tried to see it fixed her ah with such awful eyes she stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them do you mean of dislike god help us no of something much worse worse than dislike this left her indeed at a loss with a determination indescribable with a kind of fury of intention i made her turn pale intention to get hold of her mrs grose her eyes just lingering on mine gave a shudder and walked to the window and while she stood there looking out i completed my statement thats what flora knows after a little she turned round the person was in black you say in mourning rather poor almost shabby but yes with extraordinary beauty i now recognized to what i had at last stroke by stroke brought the victim of my confidence for she quite visibly weighed this oh handsome very very i insisted wonderfully handsome but infamous she slowly came back to me miss jessel was infamous she once more took my hand in both her own holding it as tight as if to fortify me against the increase of alarm i might draw from this disclosure they were both infamous she finally said so for a little we faced it once more together and i found absolutely a degree of help in seeing it now so straight i appreciate i said the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken but the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing she appeared to assent to this but still only in silence seeing which i went on i must have it now of what did she die come there was something between them there was everything in spite of the difference oh of their rank their condition she brought it woefully out she was a lady i turned it over i again saw yes she was a lady and he so dreadfully below said mrs grose i felt that i doubtless neednt press too hard in such company on the place of a servant in the scale but there was nothing to prevent an acceptance of my companions own measure of my predecessors abasement there was a way to deal with that and i dealt the more readily for my full vision on the evidence of our employers late clever goodlooking own man impudent assured spoiled depraved the fellow was a hound mrs grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense of shades ive never seen one like him he did what he wished with her with them all it was as if now in my friends own eyes miss jessel had again appeared i seemed at any rate for an instant to see their evocation of her as distinctly as i had seen her by the pond and i brought out with decision it must have been also what she wished mrs groses face signified that it had been indeed but she said at the same time poor woman she paid for it then you do know what she died of i asked no i know nothing i wanted not to know i was glad enough i didnt and i thanked heaven she was well out of this yet you had then your idea of her real reason for leaving oh yes as to that she couldnt have stayed fancy it here for a governess and afterward i imagined and i still imagine and what i imagine is dreadful not so dreadful as what i do i replied on which i must have shown her as i was indeed but too conscious a front of miserable defeat it brought out again all her compassion for me and at the renewed touch of her kindness my power to resist broke down i burst as i had the other time made her burst into tears she took me to her motherly breast and my lamentation overflowed i dont do it i sobbed in despair i dont save or shield them its far worse than i dreamed theyre lost viii what i had said to mrs grose was true enough there were in the matter i had put before her depths and possibilities that i lacked resolution to sound so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies we were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what in our prodigious experience was least to be questioned late that night while the house slept we had another talk in my room when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that i had seen exactly what i had seen to hold her perfectly in the pinch of that i found i had only to ask her how if i had made it up i came to be able to give of each of the persons appearing to me a picture disclosing to the last detail their special marks a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them she wished of course small blame to her to sink the whole subject and i was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it i encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence for recurrence we took for granted i should get used to my danger distinctly professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts it was my new suspicion that was intolerable and yet even to this complication the later hours of the day had brought a little ease on leaving her after my first outbreak i had of course returned to my pupils associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their charm which i had already found to be a thing i could positively cultivate and which had never failed me yet i had simply in other words plunged afresh into floras special society and there become aware it was almost a luxury that she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached she had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having cried i had supposed i had brushed away the ugly signs but i could literally for the time at all events rejoice under this fathomless charity that they had not entirely disappeared to gaze into the depths of blue of the childs eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which i naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and so far as might be my agitation i couldnt abjure for merely wanting to but i could repeat to mrs grose as i did there over and over in the small hours that with their voices in the air their pressure on ones heart and their fragrant faces against ones cheek everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty it was a pity that somehow to settle this once for all i had equally to reenumerate the signs of subtlety that in the afternoon by the lake had made a miracle of my show of selfpossession it was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion i then surprised was a matter for either party of habit it was a pity that i should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having in my delusion so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as i actually saw mrs grose herself and that she wanted by just so much as she did thus see to make me suppose she didnt and at the same time without showing anything arrive at a guess as to whether i myself did it was a pity that i needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention the perceptible increase of movement the greater intensity of play the singing the gabbling of nonsense and the invitation to romp yet if i had not indulged to prove there was nothing in it in this review i should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me i should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my friend that i was certain which was so much to the good that i at least had not betrayed myself i should not have been prompted by stress of need by desperation of mind i scarce know what to call it to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall she had told me bit by bit under pressure a great deal but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat and i remember how on this occasion for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help i felt the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain i dont believe anything so horrible i recollect saying no let us put it definitely my dear that i dont but if i did you know theres a thing i should require now just without sparing you the least bit more oh not a scrap come to get out of you what was it you had in mind when in our distress before miles came back over the letter from his school you said under my insistence that you didnt pretend for him that he had not literally ever been bad he has not literally ever in these weeks that i myself have lived with him and so closely watched him he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful lovable goodness therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had not as it happened seen an exception to take what was your exception and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer it was a dreadfully austere inquiry but levity was not our note and at any rate before the gray dawn admonished us to separate i had got my answer what my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the purpose it was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for a period of several months quint and the boy had been perpetually together it was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to criticize the propriety to hint at the incongruity of so close an alliance and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to miss jessel miss jessel had with a most strange manner requested her to mind her business and the good woman had on this directly approached little miles what she had said to him since i pressed was that she liked to see young gentlemen not forget their station i pressed again of course at this you reminded him that quint was only a base menial as you might say and it was his answer for one thing that was bad and for another thing i waited he repeated your words to quint no not that its just what he wouldnt she could still impress upon me i was sure at any rate she added that he didnt but he denied certain occasions what occasions when they had been about together quite as if quint were his tutor and a very grand one and miss jessel only for the little lady when he had gone off with the fellow i mean and spent hours with him he then prevaricated about it he said he hadnt her assent was clear enough to cause me to add in a moment i see he lied oh mrs grose mumbled this was a suggestion that it didnt matter which indeed she backed up by a further remark you see after all miss jessel didnt mind she didnt forbid him i considered did he put that to you as a justification at this she dropped again no he never spoke of it never mentioned her in connection with quint she saw visibly flushing where i was coming out well he didnt show anything he denied she repeated he denied lord how i pressed her now so that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches i dont know i dont know the poor woman groaned you do know you dear thing i replied only you havent my dreadful boldness of mind and you keep back out of timidity and modesty and delicacy even the impression that in the past when you had without my aid to flounder about in silence most of all made you miserable but i shall get it out of you yet there was something in the boy that suggested to you i continued that he covered and concealed their relation oh he couldnt prevent your learning the truth i daresay but heavens i fell with vehemence athinking what it shows that they must to that extent have succeeded in making of him ah nothing thats not nice now mrs grose lugubriously pleaded i dont wonder you looked queer i persisted when i mentioned to you the letter from his school i doubt if i looked as queer as you she retorted with homely force and if he was so bad then as that comes to how is he such an angel now yes indeed and if he was a fiend at school how how how well i said in my torment you must put it to me again but i shall not be able to tell you for some days only put it to me again i cried in a way that made my friend stare there are directions in which i must not for the present let myself go meanwhile i returned to her first example the one to which she had just previously referred of the boys happy capacity for an occasional slip if quint on your remonstrance at the time you speak of was a base menial one of the things miles said to you i find myself guessing was that you were another again her admission was so adequate that i continued and you forgave him that wouldnt you oh yes and we exchanged there in the stillness a sound of the oddest amusement then i went on at all events while he was with the man miss flora was with the woman it suited them all it suited me too i felt only too well by which i mean that it suited exactly the particularly deadly view i was in the very act of forbidding myself to entertain but i so far succeeded in checking the expression of this view that i will throw just here no further light on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to mrs grose his having lied and been impudent are i confess less engaging specimens than i had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man still i mused they must do for they make me feel more than ever that i must watch it made me blush the next minute to see in my friends face how much more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing this came out when at the schoolroom door she quitted me surely you dont accuse him of carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me ah remember that until further evidence i now accuse nobody then before shutting her out to go by another passage to her own place i must just wait i wound up ix i waited and waited and the days as they elapsed took something from my consternation a very few of them in fact passing in constant sight of my pupils without a fresh incident sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge i have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing i could actively cultivate and it may be imagined if i neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield stranger than i can express certainly was the effort to struggle against my new lights it would doubtless have been however a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful i used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that i thought strange things about them and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark i trembled lest they should see that they were so immensely more interesting putting things at the worst at all events as in meditation i so often did any clouding of their innocence could only be blameless and foredoomed as they were a reason the more for taking risks there were moments when by an irresistible impulse i found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart as soon as i had done so i used to say to myself what will they think of that doesnt it betray too much it would have been easy to get into a sad wild tangle about how much i might betray but the real account i feel of the hours of peace that i could still enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied for if it occurred to me that i might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them so too i remember wondering if i mightnt see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations they were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me which after all i could reflect was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged the homage of which they were so lavish succeeded in truth for my nerves quite as well as if i never appeared to myself as i may say literally to catch them at a purpose in it they had never i think wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress i mean though they got their lessons better and better which was naturally what would please her most in the way of diverting entertaining surprising her reading her passages telling her stories acting her charades pouncing out at her in disguises as animals and historical characters and above all astonishing her by the pieces they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite i should never get to the bottom were i to let myself go even now of the prodigious private commentary all under still more private correction with which in these days i overscored their full hours they had shown me from the first a facility for everything a general faculty which taking a fresh start achieved remarkable flights they got their little tasks as if they loved them and indulged from the mere exuberance of the gift in the most unimposed little miracles of memory they not only popped out at me as tigers and as romans but as shakespeareans astronomers and navigators this was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which at the present day i am at a loss for a different explanation i allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for miles what i remember is that i was content not for the time to open the question and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness he was too clever for a bad governess for a parsons daughter to spoil and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery i just spoke of was the impression i might have got if i had dared to work it out that he was under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement if it was easy to reflect however that such a boy could postpone school it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been kicked out by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end let me add that in their company now and i was careful almost never to be out of it i could follow no scent very far we lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals the musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of catching and repeating the schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies and when that failed there were confabulations in corners with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to come in as something new i had had brothers myself and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys what surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age sex and intelligence so fine a consideration they were extraordinarily at one and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness sometimes indeed when i dropped into coarseness i perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away there is a naive side i suppose in all diplomacy but if my pupils practiced upon me it was surely with the minimum of grossness it was all in the other quarter that after a lull the grossness broke out i find that i really hang back but i must take my plunge in going on with the record of what was hideous at bly i not only challenge the most liberal faith for which i little care but and this is another matter i renew what i myself suffered i again push my way through it to the end there came suddenly an hour after which as i look back the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering but i have at least reached the heart of it and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance one evening with nothing to lead up or to prepare it i felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which much lighter then as i have mentioned i should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated i had not gone to bed i sat reading by a couple of candles there was a roomful of old books at bly lastcentury fiction some of it which to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown but never to so much as that of a stray specimen had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth i remember that the book i had in my hand was fieldings amelia also that i was wholly awake i recall further both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch i figure finally that the white curtain draping in the fashion of those days the head of floras little bed shrouded as i had assured myself long before the perfection of childish rest i recollect in short that though i was deeply interested in my author i found myself at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room there was a moment during which i listened reminded of the faint sense i had had the first night of there being something undefinably astir in the house and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the halfdrawn blind then with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it i laid down my book rose to my feet and taking a candle went straight out of the room and from the passage on which my light made little impression noiselessly closed and locked the door i can say now neither what determined nor what guided me but i went straight along the lobby holding my candle high till i came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase at this point i precipitately found myself aware of three things they were practically simultaneous yet they had flashes of succession my candle under a bold flourish went out and i perceived by the uncovered window that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary without it the next instant i saw that there was someone on the stair i speak of sequences but i required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with quint the apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window where at sight of me it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden he knew me as well as i knew him and so in the cold faint twilight with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below we faced each other in our common intensity he was absolutely on this occasion a living detestable dangerous presence but that was not the wonder of wonders i reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didnt meet and measure him i had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment but i had thank god no terror and he knew i had not i found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this i felt in a fierce rigor of confidence that if i stood my ground a minute i should cease for the time at least to have him to reckon with and during the minute accordingly the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview hideous just because it was human as human as to have met alone in the small hours in a sleeping house some enemy some adventurer some criminal it was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close quarters that gave the whole horror huge as it was its only note of the unnatural if i had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour we still at least would have spoken something would have passed in life between us if nothing had passed one of us would have moved the moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even i were in life i cant express what followed it save by saying that the silence itself which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strength became the element into which i saw the figure disappear in which i definitely saw it turn as i might have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an order and pass with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost x i remained awhile at the top of the stair but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone he had gone then i returned to my room the foremost thing i saw there by the light of the candle i had left burning was that floras little bed was empty and on this i caught my breath with all the terror that five minutes before i had been able to resist i dashed at the place in which i had left her lying and over which for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward then my step to my unutterable relief produced an answering sound i perceived an agitation of the window blind and the child ducking down emerged rosily from the other side of it she stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown with her pink bare feet and the golden glow of her curls she looked intensely grave and i had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired the thrill of which had just been so prodigious as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach you naughty where have you been instead of challenging her own irregularity i found myself arraigned and explaining she herself explained for that matter with the loveliest eagerest simplicity she had known suddenly as she lay there that i was out of the room and had jumped up to see what had become of me i had dropped with the joy of her reappearance back into my chair feeling then and then only a little faint and she had pattered straight over to me thrown herself upon my knee given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep i remember closing my eyes an instant yieldingly consciously as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own you were looking for me out of the window i said you thought i might be walking in the grounds well you know i thought someone was she never blanched as she smiled out that at me oh how i looked at her now and did you see anyone ah no she returned almost with the full privilege of childish inconsequence resentfully though with a long sweetness in her little drawl of the negative at that moment in the state of my nerves i absolutely believed she lied and if i once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which i might take this up one of these for a moment tempted me with such singular intensity that to withstand it i must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that wonderfully she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright why not break out at her on the spot and have it all over give it to her straight in her lovely little lighted face you see you see you know that you do and that you already quite suspect i believe it therefore why not frankly confess it to me so that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps in the strangeness of our fate where we are and what it means this solicitation dropped alas as it came if i could immediately have succumbed to it i might have spared myself well youll see what instead of succumbing i sprang again to my feet looked at her bed and took a helpless middle way why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there flora luminously considered after which with her little divine smile because i dont like to frighten you but if i had by your idea gone out she absolutely declined to be puzzled she turned her eyes to the flame of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant or at any rate as impersonal as mrs marcet or ninetimesnine oh but you know she quite adequately answered that you might come back you dear and that you have and after a little when she had got into bed i had for a long time by almost sitting on her to hold her hand to prove that i recognized the pertinence of my return you may imagine the general complexion from that moment of my nights i repeatedly sat up till i didnt know when i selected moments when my roommate unmistakably slept and stealing out took noiseless turns in the passage and even pushed as far as to where i had last met quint but i never met him there again and i may as well say at once that i on no other occasion saw him in the house i just missed on the staircase on the other hand a different adventure looking down it from the top i once recognized the presence of a woman seated on one of the lower steps with her back presented to me her body halfbowed and her head in an attitude of woe in her hands i had been there but an instant however when she vanished without looking round at me i knew nonetheless exactly what dreadful face she had to show and i wondered whether if instead of being above i had been below i should have had for going up the same nerve i had lately shown quint well there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve on the eleventh night after my latest encounter with that gentleman they were all numbered now i had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed from the particular quality of its unexpectedness proved quite my sharpest shock it was precisely the first night during this series that weary with watching i had felt that i might again without laxity lay myself down at my old hour i slept immediately and as i afterward knew till about one oclock but when i woke it was to sit straight up as completely roused as if a hand had shook me i had left a light burning but it was now out and i felt an instant certainty that flora had extinguished it this brought me to my feet and straight in the darkness to her bed which i found she had left a glance at the window enlightened me further and the striking of a match completed the picture the child had again got up this time blowing out the taper and had again for some purpose of observation or response squeezed in behind the blind and was peering out into the night that she now saw as she had not i had satisfied myself the previous time was proved to me by the fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste i made to get into slippers and into a wrap hidden protected absorbed she evidently rested on the sill the casement opened forward and gave herself up there was a great still moon to help her and this fact had counted in my quick decision she was face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake and could now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do what i on my side had to care for was without disturbing her to reach from the corridor some other window in the same quarter i got to the door without her hearing me i got out of it closed it and listened from the other side for some sound from her while i stood in the passage i had my eyes on her brothers door which was but ten steps off and which indescribably produced in me a renewal of the strange impulse that i lately spoke of as my temptation what if i should go straight in and march to his window what if by risking to his boyish bewilderment a revelation of my motive i should throw across the rest of the mystery the long halter of my boldness this thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and pause again i preternaturally listened i figured to myself what might portentously be i wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were secretly at watch it was a deep soundless minute at the end of which my impulse failed he was quiet he might be innocent the risk was hideous i turned away there was a figure in the grounds a figure prowling for a sight the visitor with whom flora was engaged but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy i hesitated afresh but on other grounds and only for a few seconds then i had made my choice there were empty rooms at bly and it was only a question of choosing the right one the right one suddenly presented itself to me as the lower one though high above the gardens in the solid corner of the house that i have spoken of as the old tower this was a large square chamber arranged with some state as a bedroom the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years though kept by mrs grose in exemplary order been occupied i had often admired it and i knew my way about in it i had only after just faltering at the first chill gloom of its disuse to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as i could one of the shutters achieving this transit i uncovered the glass without a sound and applying my face to the pane was able the darkness without being much less than within to see that i commanded the right direction then i saw something more the moon made the night extraordinarily penetrable and showed me on the lawn a person diminished by distance who stood there motionless and as if fascinated looking up to where i had appeared looking that is not so much straight at me as at something that was apparently above me there was clearly another person above me there was a person on the tower but the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceived and had confidently hurried to meet the presence on the lawn i felt sick as i made it out was poor little miles himself xi it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs grose the rigor with which i kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet her privately and the more as we each felt the importance of not provoking on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the children any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries i drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences she believed me i was sure absolutely if she hadnt i dont know what would have become of me for i couldnt have borne the business alone but she was a magnificent monument to the blessing of a want of imagination and if she could see in our little charges nothing but their beauty and amiability their happiness and cleverness she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble if they had been at all visibly blighted or battered she would doubtless have grown on tracing it back haggard enough to match them as matters stood however i could feel her when she surveyed them with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look thank the lords mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve flights of fancy gave place in her mind to a steady fireside glow and i had already begun to perceive how with the development of the conviction that as time went on without a public accident our young things could after all look out for themselves she addressed her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress that for myself was a sound simplification i could engage that to the world my face should tell no tales but it would have been in the conditions an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers at the hour i now speak of she had joined me under pressure on the terrace where with the lapse of the season the afternoon sun was now agreeable and we sat there together while before us at a distance but within call if we wished the children strolled to and fro in one of their most manageable moods they moved slowly in unison below us over the lawn the boy as they went reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch mrs grose watched them with positive placidity then i caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry i had made her a receptacle of lurid things but there was an odd recognition of my superiority my accomplishments and my function in her patience under my pain she offered her mind to my disclosures as had i wished to mix a witchs broth and proposed it with assurance she would have held out a large clean saucepan this had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that in my recital of the events of the night i reached the point of what miles had said to me when after seeing him at such a monstrous hour almost on the very spot where he happened now to be i had gone down to bring him in choosing then at the window with a concentrated need of not alarming the house rather that method than a signal more resonant i had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which after i had got him into the house the boy met my final articulate challenge as soon as i appeared in the moonlight on the terrace he had come to me as straight as possible on which i had taken his hand without a word and led him through the dark spaces up the staircase where quint had so hungrily hovered for him along the lobby where i had listened and trembled and so to his forsaken room not a sound on the way had passed between us and i had wondered oh how i had wondered if he were groping about in his little mind for something plausible and not too grotesque it would tax his invention certainly and i felt this time over his real embarrassment a curious thrill of triumph it was a sharp trap for the inscrutable he couldnt play any longer at innocence so how the deuce would he get out of it there beat in me indeed with the passionate throb of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce i should i was confronted at last as never yet with all the risk attached even now to sounding my own horrid note i remember in fact that as we pushed into his little chamber where the bed had not been slept in at all and the window uncovered to the moonlight made the place so clear that there was no need of striking a match i remember how i suddenly dropped sank upon the edge of the bed from the force of the idea that he must know how he really as they say had me he could do what he liked with all his cleverness to help him so long as i should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears he had me indeed and in a cleft stick for who would ever absolve me who would consent that i should go unhung if by the faintest tremor of an overture i were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire no no it was useless to attempt to convey to mrs grose just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to suggest here how in our short stiff brush in the dark he fairly shook me with admiration i was of course thoroughly kind and merciful never never yet had i placed on his little shoulders hands of such tenderness as those with which while i rested against the bed i held him there well under fire i had no alternative but in form at least to put it to him you must tell me now and all the truth what did you go out for what were you doing there i can still see his wonderful smile the whites of his beautiful eyes and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk if i tell you why will you understand my heart at this leaped into my mouth would he tell me why i found no sound on my lips to press it and i was aware of replying only with a vague repeated grimacing nod he was gentleness itself and while i wagged my head at him he stood there more than ever a little fairy prince it was his brightness indeed that gave me a respite would it be so great if he were really going to tell me well he said at last just exactly in order that you should do this do what think me for a change bad i shall never forget the sweetness and gaiety with which he brought out the word nor how on top of it he bent forward and kissed me it was practically the end of everything i met his kiss and i had to make while i folded him for a minute in my arms the most stupendous effort not to cry he had given exactly the account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it and it was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that as i presently glanced about the room i could say then you didnt undress at all he fairly glittered in the gloom not at all i sat up and read and when did you go down at midnight when im bad i am bad i see i see its charming but how could you be sure i would know it oh i arranged that with flora his answers rang out with a readiness she was to get up and look out which is what she did do it was i who fell into the trap so she disturbed you and to see what she was looking at you also looked you saw while you i concurred caught your death in the night air he literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly to assent how otherwise should i have been bad enough he asked then after another embrace the incident and our interview closed on my recognition of all the reserves of goodness that for his joke he had been able to draw upon xii the particular impression i had received proved in the morning light i repeat not quite successfully presentable to mrs grose though i reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made before we separated it all lies in half a dozen words i said to her words that really settle the matter think you know what i might do he threw that off to show me how good he is he knows down to the ground what he might do thats what he gave them a taste of at school lord you do change cried my friend i dont change i simply make it out the four depend upon it perpetually meet if on either of these last nights you had been with either child you would clearly have understood the more ive watched and waited the more ive felt that if there were nothing else to make it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each never by a slip of the tongue have they so much as alluded to either of their old friends any more than miles has alluded to his expulsion oh yes we may sit here and look at them and they may show off to us there to their fill but even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale theyre steeped in their vision of the dead restored hes not reading to her i declared theyre talking of them theyre talking horrors i go on i know as if i were crazy and its a wonder im not what ive seen would have made you so but it has only made me more lucid made me get hold of still other things my lucidity must have seemed awful but the charming creatures who were victims of it passing and repassing in their interlocked sweetness gave my colleague something to hold on by and i felt how tight she held as without stirring in the breath of my passion she covered them still with her eyes of what other things have you got hold why of the very things that have delighted fascinated and yet at bottom as i now so strangely see mystified and troubled me their more than earthly beauty their absolutely unnatural goodness its a game i went on its a policy and a fraud on the part of little darlings as yet mere lovely babies yes mad as that seems the very act of bringing it out really helped me to trace it follow it all up and piece it all together they havent been good theyve only been absent it has been easy to live with them because theyre simply leading a life of their own theyre not mine theyre not ours theyre his and theyre hers quints and that womans quints and that womans they want to get to them oh how at this poor mrs grose appeared to study them but for what for the love of all the evil that in those dreadful days the pair put into them and to ply them with that evil still to keep up the work of demons is what brings the others back laws said my friend under her breath the exclamation was homely but it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what in the bad time for there had been a worse even than this must have occurred there could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent of her experience to whatever depth of depravity i found credible in our brace of scoundrels it was in obvious submission of memory that she brought out after a moment they were rascals but what can they now do she pursued do i echoed so loud that miles and flora as they passed at their distance paused an instant in their walk and looked at us dont they do enough i demanded in a lower tone while the children having smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us resumed their exhibition we were held by it a minute then i answered they can destroy them at this my companion did turn but the inquiry she launched was a silent one the effect of which was to make me more explicit they dont know as yet quite how but theyre trying hard theyre seen only across as it were and beyond in strange places and on high places the top of towers the roof of houses the outside of windows the further edge of pools but theres a deep design on either side to shorten the distance and overcome the obstacle and the success of the tempters is only a question of time theyve only to keep to their suggestions of danger for the children to come and perish in the attempt mrs grose slowly got up and i scrupulously added unless of course we can prevent standing there before me while i kept my seat she visibly turned things over their uncle must do the preventing he must take them away and whos to make him she had been scanning the distance but she now dropped on me a foolish face you miss by writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and niece mad but if they are miss and if i am myself you mean thats charming news to be sent him by a governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry mrs grose considered following the children again yes he do hate worry that was the great reason why those fiends took him in so long no doubt though his indifference must have been awful as im not a fiend at any rate i shouldnt take him in my companion after an instant and for all answer sat down again and grasped my arm make him at any rate come to you i stared to me i had a sudden fear of what she might do him he ought to be here he ought to help i quickly rose and i think i must have shown her a queerer face than ever yet you see me asking him for a visit no with her eyes on my face she evidently couldnt instead of it even as a woman reads another she could see what i myself saw his derision his amusement his contempt for the breakdown of my resignation at being left alone and for the fine machinery i had set in motion to attract his attention to my slighted charms she didnt know no one knew how proud i had been to serve him and to stick to our terms yet she nonetheless took the measure i think of the warning i now gave her if you should so lose your head as to appeal to him for me she was really frightened yes miss i would leave on the spot both him and you xiii it was all very well to join them but speaking to them proved quite as much as ever an effort beyond my strength offered in close quarters difficulties as insurmountable as before this situation continued a month and with new aggravations and particular notes the note above all sharper and sharper of the small ironic consciousness on the part of my pupils it was not i am as sure today as i was sure then my mere infernal imagination it was absolutely traceable that they were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made in a manner for a long time the air in which we moved i dont mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar for that was not one of their dangers i do mean on the other hand that the element of the unnamed and untouched became between us greater than any other and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement it was as if at moments we were perpetually coming into sight of subjects before which we must stop short turning suddenly out of alleys that we perceived to be blind closing with a little bang that made us look at each other for like all bangs it was something louder than we had intended the doors we had indiscreetly opened all roads lead to rome and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground forbidden ground was the question of the return of the dead in general and of whatever in especial might survive in memory of the friends little children had lost there were days when i could have sworn that one of them had with a small invisible nudge said to the other she thinks shell do it this time but she wont to do it would have been to indulge for instance and for once in a way in some direct reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline they had a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history to which i had again and again treated them they were in possession of everything that had ever happened to me had had with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father of the furniture and arrangement of our house and of the conversation of the old women of our village there were things enough taking one with another to chatter about if one went very fast and knew by instinct when to go round they pulled with an art of their own the strings of my invention and my memory and nothing else perhaps when i thought of such occasions afterward gave me so the suspicion of being watched from under cover it was in any case over my life my past and my friends alone that we could take anything like our ease a state of affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders i was invited with n
