south of heaven by jim thompson copyright south of heaven six hundred miles southwest of cowtown where there aint no trail or track where the sun will scorch your gizzard while the wind blows up a blizzard and a louse looks like a lizard and the waters stale and brack there the pipeline seams the prairie built by men all wild and hairy like the wolves who howl so scary while you shiver in your sack ballad of the big line as dawn speared across the far west texas prairie the last of the nights heavy dew fell i sat up shivering looking down along the twisting bed of the driedup creek where six hundred of us were jungled up while we waited for the pipeline job to start the line was to be one of the biggest jobs in years all the way from out here in this highlonely gas field to port arthur on the gulf but word of it had gone out weeks ago and the men had been drifting in here all those weeks jailbirds mission stiffs hoboes and hardly a manjack among em with more than an empty gut and the raggedyass clothes he wore one of the few exceptions was the guy i traveled with fruit jar he was dozing a few feet away from me sprawled out on the cushions of his modelt ford i toed him in the ribs jerking my foot back fast as he sat up cursing and flailing his arms huh hey whassa matter he glared wildly out of his redrimmed eyes whatcha doin tommy thought id tell you i was going into town i said see if i can get us something to scoff he stared at me a moment longer figuring out what id said then he suddenly winced and groaned and put on his smeary sunglasses fruit jar was on canned heat about half the boes you saw out here were heatheads they eventually went blind from drinking it and while they were getting that way even a very little light drove them crazy youre a good boy tommy he said at last see if you can stem a little heat huh i said no i wouldnt hustling scoff grub was my limit you and me rubbertramp it together but that doesnt make me your punk aah now tommy he rubbed shaky hands over the stubble of his bloated face well maybe you can pick up a can of tin cow huh and maybe just about a quart of gasoline the way i feel a little milk and gas would make a mighty fine drink no i said he was still whining and begging as i walked away from him and i decided that it was past time that we parted company id be on a job soon and i didnt owe him anything having a way of getting around was awfully handy out here but id more than paid for any rides id got by changing tires and keeping the tford running and doing all the things that fruit jar was too drunk or lazy to do for himself i walked on up the creekbed toward town stepping over and around the sleeping boes brushing the twigs and dirt off my jeans and shirt i was wearing a good hat a gray citystyle stetson with the brim turned up front and back and of course i had good stout shoes with an extra pair of soles nailed on them thats one thing you learn when you make the big labor camps always wear a good hat and good shoes so even if you dont have much in between folks will know youre not a bum a bo hobo yes but not a bum theres a big difference between the two just around a turn in the creek bed three boes were huddled around a little fire warming up a can of last nights coffee grounds i nodded to them kind of hesitating but they didnt nod back and one of them took out a match and handed it to me thats the hobo way of saying youre not welcome that youre to start your own fire in other words so i kept on going rounding another bend and then i came up short my mouth falling open in surprise he was a tall goodlooking guy in his middlethirties lounged back against the grassy hillside he was drinking from a halfpint bottle of bonded whiskey and smoking a tailormade cigarette and he gave a lazy grin and a wink tommy boy he drawled light and look at your saddle friend i couldnt speak or move for a minute i was that surprised and glad to see him then my voice came out in a yell four trey four trey whitey please tommy he winced tapping his head not so early in the morning i hunkered down in front of him grinning from ear to ear boy am i ever tickled to see you i said why i heard youd been killed just shot a few times tommy just cut up a little it was the other guy that got killed you figure on sittingin here i have set in here tommy and being reasonably sure that youd be here i set you in with me hey thats great i said thats sure good news four trey so act like it he chuckled drink up and smoke up he tossed me the bottle and a partpackage of cigarettes i lit up and took a long thirsty drink and he took another bottle and another package of cigarettes from his pocket we drank and smoked not saying anything for a time just grinning and looking at each other like old friends will when they come together yes tommy he said at last the sere and yellow days are gone and the birds are about to bust their guts with singing briefly the line starts hiring tomorrow and you and i shall be working on it and two weeks thence with the coming of the first payday guess what we will be doing then tommy now how could i ever guess i laughed he was sitting on a bindle of work clothes but he wore an expensive suit and shoes and a snowy white shirt a white one for petes sake i was sure he was carrying a big roll plenty to travel firstclass but he liked it this way so here he was jungled up with six hundred other boes so youve got the stroke on the gambling i said taking a small sip of the booze he nodded that he had the exclusive stroke tommy it just happened that i knew some of the highpressure from a drainage job in east texas higby remember him so its you and me alone from here to the gulf you on blackjack and me with the dice now about your cut hell i said i trust you four trey four trey said drily that that was nice but spelling things out was much nicer anyway well make it the usual i bank the game and you cut twenty per cent of the take fair enough fair enough i said maybe i should tell you that contractors on pipeline jobs liked to have one or two straight gamblers around nor did they mind if a couple of women followed the camp as long as they were clean and didnt come into the campproper it wasnt often that a woman did follow it it just wasnt practical you know roughing it on her own as much as a hundred miles from the nearest town but there were always gamblers pipelining is rough hard work seven days a week and gambling kept the men from getting restless it also kept them broke enough so that they werent always jumping the job what kind of a job are we getting four trey i asked because we would have to live in the camp naturally and if you lived in camp you had to work are we down for timekeeping again he shook his head looking a little unhappy for the first time im afraid not tommy the banks or whoever it is thats backing the job are putting in their own timekeepers well you mean were going to have to muck it oh no were certainly not going to stoop to mucking it just wouldnt be worth it getting our hands all calloused with those longhandled spoons i said i could muck it swing a pick and shovel with any man but i was just as pleased to be doing something else four trey said that i wouldnt like the job we were going to do but it was the only halfway decent thing open tommy the only job we could possibly hold and handle our gambling i dont care what it is i said as long as it isnt powder monkey i dont work with dynamite dynas a good girl tommy you can chew her up and spit her out and she wont say a word you i stared at him you mean thats the job powder monkeyin you you i choked up you think im goin to powder monkey after what happened to a real good girl dyna is he wheedled she wears lousy perfume and you get bygod hellish headaches from it but safe the safest stuff in the world sure it is thats why the job is open why powder monkeys get wages and a half you had me fooled tommy you never struck me as being a coward im not a coward i snapped i just dont like dynamite and you know why i dont i know he said softly but thats the way it is kid im down for powder monkey and youre down as my helper thats what you do or you dont do anything i hesitated i took another small drink he caught my eye nodded slowly thats it tommy dyna or depart but dammit four trey so whats it going to be there was only one thing i could say and i said it he grinned approvingly and held out his hand thats my boy lets shake on it we shook i looked down at my hand and saw that there was a fivedollar bill in it happy birthday tommy he said oh now look i said feeling kind of embarrassed you didnt need to do that four trey why not a man doesnt get to be twentyone but once in his life but im not even sure that i am twentyone i think so but im not sure well now you can be sure he said i say so so you can depend on it anyway my birthday was last week i said i forgot all about it until just now he yawned and leaned back in the grass making a waving motion for me to be on my way go scoff tommy have some fun if you can find anything to have it with thanks i said thanks a lot four trey just be sure you meet me out at the camp in the morning better make it around five oclock well have to hire on and well be working up ahead of the ditchers and draglines wherever theres hard rock right i said ill be there he cocked his hat over his eyes and folded his hands on his stomach seemingly he fell asleep at once and i went on up the creekbed and into town they tell me that things havent changed much in far west texas in the last forty years it was a wild and lonely land to begin with it had been so since the world was young and when man had gotten what he could from it it went back to the wildness and loneliness or so im told at least i cant say of my own knowledge having had no reason to go back that way and maybe a few for not going back so all i can tell you is what it was like that morning some forty years ago when i was twentyone or thereabouts the town was named after a place in russia as many towns in west and far west texas are the geologists discovered that they were all part of the permian basin which the drillers had first tapped in russia so they were given russian names or sometimes persian like iraan since its underlying rock structure was also permian basin it the town wasnt like any other town you ever saw there was no pattern to it the streets if you could call them streets ran every whichway the buildings wooden unpainted wobblylooking from the unceasing wind seemed to have been dropped down wherever their builders took a notion thered be two or three huddled together in a row kind of leaning into each other for support then maybe a couple of hundred yards away thered be another building and sitting catercornered to it by fifty or sixty feet a halfdozen more all in all the town probably covered a couple of square miles with perhaps a hundred buildings cothouses stores restaurants barbershops and so on all but three of the businesses a general store a restaurant and a garage were closed down now many of them would go back into operation with the first payday on the pipeline and for as long as the camp remained close to town but right now it was as desolate a place as youd ever see the wind was blowing as it always did soughing and whining like a weary giant even early in the morning and with everything dewwet dust devils were dancing across the prairie marching up and down the crazyquilt streets like long lines of dirty clothes it was very quiet so quiet that seemingly you could have heard a sage hen drop an egg in her nest and then way off to the southeast coming from the direction of matacora the county seat i heard the sound of a car it was coming on fast and the racket told me what it was a tford with a patent gearshift and a highspeed head you saw quite a few of them in the oilfields in the days before the modela and the v by the time i was passing the first empty buildings it was right behind me it roared past almost hiding me and it in its dust then the brakes slammed on and it skidded ploughing up still more dust and it backed up to where i was and stopped there was a big star painted on its side the man who climbed over the door and came toward me was also wearing a star a deputy sheriffs badge he was one of those squarebuilt guys with practically no neck and not much more forehead his name was bud lassen and id seen him and others like him in quite a few places out here wherever there was a large influx of transient labor it may sound melodramatic to call them hired guns but thats what they were the local authorities werent set up to handle large groups of men anyway the locals were usually pretty nice people and they didnt want to dirty up their reputations so men like bud lassen were deputized for a few weeks or months and they did whatever was necessary and a lot more besides because they liked giving people a hard time they liked having the whip hand over men who were usually too overworked and underfed to strike back lassen put himself in front of me one hand on the butt of his fortyfive the thumb of the other looped through his gun belt he looked me over hardeyed from head to foot teetering back and forth on the heels of his boots at last he said whats your name bo you know my name bud i said acting a lot braver than i felt you sure as heck ought to know it anyway dont be smart with me punk the oklahoma construction company i said a highline job out of odessa you tried to shake me and four trey whitey down guess you were too dumb to know that four trey wouldnt have operated without talking things over with the sheriff he stared at me the red spreading down his bull neck and up into his thick pockmarked face he nodded very slowly as much as to say he remembered me all right which he certainly should have since id helped to get him run out of odessa tommy burwell he said you sweatin the line tommy i said sure i was waiting for the line to open what else would i be doing out here then pass the word tommy tell your junglebird buddies ill just be waitin for em to start some trouble in town tell em the first bastard that pulls anything will get his skull parted tell them yourself i said theres six hundred of em jungledup along the creek bank and i know theyd be tickled to death to see a nice guy like you and heres some more news for you he went on as though he hadnt heard me im signing on with the line in a few days special guard and what i said about startin trouble goes double for then im glad to hear it i said you wont be wearing a badge his eyes flickered i weaved and tried to step back but his gun was already out of its holster upraised to slam me on the side of the head i threw my hands up to protect myself he laughed with a grunting sound and the gun barrel whipped into my guts i went down on my knees doubled over by the time i could straighten up he was clear over the other side of town stopping in front of the general store and post office i managed to get to my feet i patted and rubbed the soreness a little and then i went on toward the greek restaurant id taken a lot more than a punch in the stomach before and i reckoned i probably would again so i wasnt particularly upset by what had happened or frightened by the possibility of something worse i didnt have enough imagination to be scared i suppose enough imagination or experience young people just cant believe that theyre ever going to die everyone else is but not them they cant believe that they wont survive anything thats thrown at them when youre twentyone what you believe is that somehow youre going to be a famous ballplayer or lawyer or writer or something that will make you a million dollars and that youll marry a beautiful wife and live in a beautiful house and well never mind and never mind how youre going to do it you just are and thats that still a hard crack with a gun barrel can have a sobering effect even on a twentyoneyearold and mine had taken quite a little of the perkiness out of me i took a long look at myself trudging along in the dust with my hat brim turned up front and back and my belly burning with beforebreakfast booze and the picture wasnt a nice one at all there was nothing romantic or dashing about it i was a drifter a day laborer a tinhorn gambler a man wasting his life in a wasteland thats what i was now thats what id be in another twentyone years if i lived that long unless i started changing my ways fast i told myself that i would the telling made me feel better sort of removing the need you know to actually do anything i began to whistle planning what id have for breakfast planning how id spend my five dollars because of course i was going to blow it that was what money was for and there was always more where the first came from always and always there is no end to always when youre twentyone i began to walk in time with my whistling sort of marching in time to it marching onward and upward to some vague but lofty goal or so i saw myself that longago morning what i was actually heading into was the big middle of the biggest mess of my thoroughly messed up life i suppose most of us aim a lot higher than the place we actually hit most of us mean to do better than we wind up doing i know i did anyway in the beginning that is i worked hard in school and i got better than good grades the teachers at the consolidated high school in my native oklahoma had pointed me toward college and put out feelers for scholarships my grandparents my only living kin had done everything they could to help me wanting for me what they had never had for themselves everyone was pulling for me and i was doing plenty of pulling on my own according to the high school yearbook i was the student most likely to succeed and no one could have convinced anyone that i wasnt then when i was just short of sixteen my grandparents blew themselves up and everything else seemed to blow up right along with them my grandma and grandpa god bless them sharecropped sixty acres of the worlds sorriest land stab a stick down anywhere and youd hit rock after about eighteen inches they needed a new privy and since you couldnt dig in the rock grandpa got half a box of dyna from the landlords store he was used to working with it sowas i and so was grandma you live on a rocky farm long enough and you dont think much more of a stick of dynamite than you do of a stick of candy i was about a halfmile away coming home from school when i heard the explosion and even that far away i could hear grandma scream it seemed like i ran forever before i got to where she and grandpa were and by then well i dont want to talk about it i dont want to remember what they looked like because what it was wasnt people im not sure how it happened but i suppose a charge misfired on them they waited a while making sure that it wasnt going to explode then they started to put a new cap and fuse on it and then then just when they were bending over it dont tell me dynas a good girl that it isnt dangerous i know better as i say i was just short of sixteen at the time of the accident in another month id have graduated from high school but i didnt wait around to do it i knew what happened to sixteenyearolds who didnt have kinfolk and i didnt want any part of it i went down and hid in the weeds along the railroad rightofway i caught the first freight train that was traveling slow enough to catch and i kept right on going the wheat harvest all the way to canada the stoop crops in california the apples in washington and oregon the potatoes in nebraska and idaho and colorado and then the oil fields and the big construction jobs through the midwest and west and far west id made plenty of money to finish my education college and anything else i wanted id made plenty and peed it all off a couple of years ago four trey whitey and i had worked almost six months steady and what with gambling i came off the job with around six thousand dollars and the lord only knows how much whitey had so we went into highlivin dallas and got a suite at the biggest hotel in town and then we got drunk and stayed that way just booze no women whitey was impotent i think so it wouldnt have been polite for me to suggest women i probably wouldnt have anyway since id been raised a strict baptist and when you drink like we did you dont think much about sex at the end of the month we were both broke and i was having the dts but four trey managed to get me into the county hospital alcoholic ward before he left town that was his way nice and considerate up to a point but not taking anyone to raise hed work with you or go on a party with you but he was a loner a guy who didnt want anyone hanging on him and he could get awfully damned sharp if you got in his way so so here i was again trudging the red dust of another godforsaken town starting out on another job in the wilderness and telling myself that this time it would be different that i would be different i was walking past the deserted hotel when i heard the sound of voices sort of mumbling and singing and i stooped down and looked under the porch three boes were under it sprawled around a big oldfashioned chamber pot and sipping from its contents i figured correctly that theyd stolen the pot out of the hotel and what they had in it was antifreeze mixed with water from the pecos but i called to them kidding you boys getting pretty hard up drinking pee arent you they whooped and hollered best you ever tasted tommy come an join us i said thanks but i guessed not bud lassens in town maybe youd better play it kind of low they all said what bud lassen could do to himself and what theyd do to him hey listen tommy i got a new joke about pipeliners it wasnt new id probably heard it a hundred times a kind of dirty dialect joke but i listened to humor them mammy mammy big bunch o pipeliners comin hush yo mouf gal them pipeliners screws each other an does their own washing thats rich i said very funny well you boys be good i hurried on before they could stop me and their singing trailed down the street throw out the lifeline here comes the pipeline some bo is going to dragup an old dodge panel truck was parked a couple of doors down from the greeks restaurant a panel truck fixed up like a housecar with windows cut into the sides and the top knocked out and hooped over with canvas to make it higher the rear tire was flat and a kid in jeans and jumper and a stocking cap was trying to pry it off the rim he couldnt do it because he hadnt let all the air out of it which made him a pretty dumb kid in my book i spoke to him pointing out what he had to do but he was hunkered down with his back to me and his stocking cap apparently kept him from hearing so i put my foot out and toed him in the butt there was a wild shriek he rose straight up in the air and his stocking cap flew off and and it wasnt a he it was a girl and was she ever mad and was she ever pretty and was she ever built she was just about the teensiest little ol girl that ever lived short i mean and weighing maybe about ninetyfive pounds but the way she stretched her clothes it was kind of a case of the parts being greater than the whole she drew back her hand as though to slap me and then she asked just what i thought i was doing and just who did i think i was and before i could answer her she asked just what i thought i was looking at well she demanded her eyes blazing do you want me to take them out and show them to you do you you big stupid goof maam i said maam i i or maybe you want me to take my pants down and show you my bottom she said adding that i seemed to like to play with it thats what you really want isnt it to get my pants down so you can kick me again please maam i said i didnt know you were a girl i mean your back was to me and you had that stocking cap on and your jumper was hanging down over your uh how was i to know anyway ill bet ill just bet she said but she didnt sound quite so angry just where is this pipeline job ive been hearing so much about i told her the job wasnt going to start until tomorrow but the beginning of it was up the river about five miles come out in the street and ill show you she went with me a little stiffly and i pointed far far away up the pecos they were just specks from here blinking and winking as the sun hit them the rows of sleeping and office tents and the hundredyardlong chow tent but you could see a log way out there if your eyes were used to it and i could even identify the tractorlike generators and the strungout lengths of pipe looking like matchsticks from this distance and an antlike speck moving here and there which had to be the camp guard but the girl looked up into my face frowning suspiciously apparently unable to see a thing are you sure you know what youre talking about she said youre not just teasing me or something im sure i said ill be up there working this time tomorrow but she made a helpless gesture but why does the pipeline start here what are they going to put in it take another look i said off over this way i pointed again and she moved in close to me to sight along my arm it made me feel so prickly and funny that i could hardly keep my mind on what i was saying and it kept me from wondering about quite a few things that i might well have wondered about for instance she was no tourist she had come here knowing what she was coming to a girl with a purpose yet she apparently knew nothing at all about it she was smart you knew that at first glance but her behavior some of the things she said were downright dumb and that cutdown dodge of hers was a very solid job someone had put a lot of work and money into it and the tires were topoftheline and practically new it was a car that would take you anywhere and out again and do it fast and why it had taken her here why she should be here at all well you see but i didnt not at the time see off over there i said her black hair brushing against my face do you see all those pumping jacks hundreds and hundreds of them stretching off to the horizon she shook her head saying rather crossly that she couldnt see a thing i said that was natural enough i supposed the stuff being so old and weathered practically the same color as the landscape but anyway thats an oil field what used to be the largest shallow oil field in the world its pretty well pumped dry now but theres more natural gas here than youll find any place in the country what are those she squinted like matches being lighted there there goes another one i told her those were flambeaux big steel torches running up into the air to burn off the gas so it wouldnt drift around and cause trouble thats what this pipeline is about i went on theyll build a big casinghead plant around here somewhere to dry out the gas and then theyll pump it down to port arthur she nodded thanking me and drawing away again she said she guessed shed better get back to fixing the tire and i said i was sure it was the valve rather than the tire and i could fix it in a minute but why didnt we have some breakfast first well she hesitated i could use some coffee i was driving all night and and are the restaurants very high out here not for out here five to ten cents for a glass of water and other things accordingly but dont you worry about that i said taking her arm this is on me she came along without much urging the greek stopped us at the door making me show my money before he would let us in which was reasonable enough in a town with six hundred floaters and a normal population of less than fifty i let him see the five and we went on back to the kitchen to wash up the cook was skimming a stew with a big spoon and taking a swig now and then from a pint bottle of vanilla extract he was lean and meanlooking and i figured that if you looked in his pocket you would probably turn up a wobbly card almost all oilfield cooks were wobblies members of the iww to their way of thinking eugene debs was a conservative and about the only person they had any use for was big bill haywood they all hated the bosses just any bosses most of the time they were about halfstewed on flavoring extract which gave them belly pains and made them a lot meaner than they normally were hist he said jerking his head at me as i started to dipper water into the wash basin dont use that goddam river water why save money for a goddam greek capitalist he filled the basin with about three dollars worth of drinking water as we began to wash i gave him our breakfast order hot cakes ham and eggs and coffee he said wed get the goddam meat for free so never mind ordering it and dont hurry so goddam fast will you ill fix you some scoff to take with you we were moving kind of carefully when we went back into the restaurant because we both had a couple of big sandwiches stuffed down inside our shirts we ate breakfast pretty carefully too since the greek kept shooting glances our way and wed got a lot more than our check showed each of us had a big slice of ham hidden under our eggs and there was about a pound of butter under our hot cakes in retrospect there doesnt seem much to have laughed about we were cheating an honest businessman and if anything we should have been ashamed of ourselves still to us a couple of youngsters come together sharing with each other the situation was funny as all hell wed quiet down for a minute and concentrate on our food and then our eyes would meet and that would set us to laughing all over again we were laughing and carrying on so much that our food was cold before wed finished it all of course the greek caught on to what had happened and he didnt think it was a bit funny i figured on getting about two dollars change back from my five but what he gave me was fifty cents i started to argue about it and he got all excited and red in the face and began hollering the cook came to the kitchen door and looked out then he came out waving a meat cleaver as he headed toward the greek the greek grabbed up a sawedoff baseball bat carol that was the girls name carol and i got the heck out of there id been right about the tire all it needed was some pumping up and an adjustment of the valve we worked on it together making a job out of it you know hunkered down side by side in the red dirt like kids playing at mud pies along toward the last carol turned to me just as i turned toward her and our faces were barely an inch apart we looked at each other hardly breathing her eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger and her mouth softer and softer her lips parted they moved toward mine and her eyes started to drift shut and fruit jar drove up he wheeled into the curb bouncing the modelts tires against it he hollered at me motioning for me to come over to him i did so taking my time about it wondering how hed managed to get the heat which he was obviously full of lets have some stash tommy he demanded and i stepped back a little to avoid his breath we got to get over to matacora what for i said because he caught himself his mouth growing crafty give me the dough tommy i aint taking you if you dont i said id give him fifty cents if it would do him any good he snatched it out of my hand red eyes glaring at me from behind his sunglasses you got more than that you and that broad were scoffing in the greeks so i said so where did you get the stash where did you get it for that load of heat youre carrying he let out a string of curses he said it would be his happy ass if i ever rode with him again and i said i wouldnt ride with him again if i was paid to he revved the motor cursing the car shot backwards then stopped as he turned to yell at me better start walking you cheap chiseling punk theyre hiring on in matacora he drove away fast figuring maybe that id throw something at him i watched grinning as he stopped at the garage gasoline pump a couple of blocks away he was falling for a rumor of course the kind thats always floating around a jungle it didnt make any difference to me if the line was hiring in matacora since i already had a job nailed down but i knew that they werent all the men were waiting here what sense would it have made to have them go all the way over to matacora and then have to be hauled back carol came up and asked if there was any trouble i said that there wasnt a bit and we could get back to fixing the tire its already fixed tommy you know that well yeah i said i guess it is isnt it yes she said yes it is tommy we looked at each other i held out my hand and said well i guessed id better tell her goodbye i mean i guess id better tell you i said because i reckon a girl like you wouldnt want to kiss a fellow goodbye that shes just met right out in public i mean she took my hand and squeezed it staring down at the ground and then slowly raising her eyes to look up into my face what makes you think im going anywhere tommy what what makes you think im going anywhere that im not staying right here but i hesitated you mean youre meeting someone here in town you know someone here she shook her head i dont know anyone but you tommy well i frowned i dont know what youd do around town things will be busy for a few weeks after the pipeline camp opens up but then theyll have to move it south to keep up with the job so far away that the men cant make it into town her head moved in a little nod and she murmured indistinctly about doing something around the pipeline it sounded like i looked down into her face wondering why she was blushing so much im sorry i said but you sure couldnt work in the camp carol they dont have jobs for women why the highpressure wouldnt let a woman set foot inside a pipeline camp the highpressure the bosses i explained its kind of a bitter joke something the wobblies started i guess you know like the bosses are always highpressuring the working stiffs oh she said thats uh very interesting actually i said they dont push anyone too hard they cant a lot of the men just arent capable of hard work theyve been drifting going hungry too long and a lot more couldnt be pushed without buying yourself a broken head theyre jailbirds chaingang veterans guys that would climb a tree for trouble when they could stand on the ground and have peace my goodness her eyes were very big and round why arent they arrested whos going to do it i shrugged the lines a long way from civilization as a rule it moves from county to county through places where the population adds up to less than the pipeliners aside from that the big bosses do a lot of coveringup where the law is concerned they figure they have to you know otherwise theyd lose a lot of time and the job would be held up while the law poked around investigating and asking questions and arresting suspects and so on carol said my goodness again or something like that to show she was interested you know i went on talking stretching things quite a little as youve probably guessed to make myself look bold and brave actually there was quite a bit of law around the line not much of the official sort but the kind you get from a rifle butt or a hardash pick handle judge and jury were the highpressure and they also carried out their own sentences and troublemakers seldom came back for second helpings now getting back to you carol i said i was going to ask why i broke off for she was staring past me a startled look in her eyes i turned around to see what she was looking at it was fruit jar he was clattering away from the garage in his tford the tornoff hose from the gas pump trailing from his tank i groaned wondering just how stupid he could be to try such a stunt getting his tank filled with gasoline and then trying to run off without paying where was he going to run to in an area like this how far did he expect to get in a twelveyearold modelt a car that was already bucking and stalling and trying to die on him the garage owner obviously wasnt worried he was sauntering after fruit jar and taking his own sweet time about it then there was the roar of another motor and bud lassen wheeled out from behind the garage fruit jar looked back over his shoulder he tried to pour on more gas and the car stalled and stopped he fought with it for a moment then threw himself out the door and started running lassen shouted for him to halt ill have to admit that but fruit jar kept on running probably too scared to stop so lassen turned out on the prairie after him it was all over in a couple of minutes but it seemed a lot longer than that fruit jar running crazily his smoked glasses flying off as he stumbled lassen zigging and zagging to follow him lassen jumped out of his car gun drawn fruit jar looked around then turned around kind of stumblerunning backwards he tried to get his hands up or so it seemed to me but he tripped just then and instead of getting them up he made a wild grab at himself as a falling man would it was all the excuse lassen needed he had six bullets in fruit jar before you could snap your fingers and even from where i was i could see that his head was practically blown off by the time i got there there was a pretty big crowd gathered mostly boes like me and the rest the few people who lived in town someone had dropped a tow sack over fruit jar the upper part of him that is his legs were sticking out and the dirty soles of his feet were showing through the holes in his shoes hell the garage owner was scowling at bud lassen that was a hell of a thing to do killing a man over a few lousy gallons of gas i told him to halt didnt i lassen sounded a little defensive you all heard me tell him to halt so what you didnt need to shoot him dammit lassen said he thought fruit jar was going to draw a gun on him it looked to me like he was reaching in his pocket what the hell you expect me to hold still while some thief takes potshots at me there was a low murmur from the crowd a pretty unpleasant murmur lassens eyes shifted uneasily and fell on me and he tried to work up a warm smile you burwell you knew this thief didnt you had a pretty tough reputation didnt he he had a reputation for getting drunk i said which hardly made him unique out here there were laughs ugly laughs lassens eyes flickered angrily but he kept on trying a mean vicious drunk wasnt he tommy when he got drunk he might do almost anything right no it isnt right i said in fact its a damned lie and you know it why you he took a step toward me the only mean vicious guy around here is you i said and you dont have to get drunk to be that way that did it he whipped his gun out kind of swinging it in an arc to push the crowd back then leveling it at me get in that car burwell im taking you to matacora not me youre not i said anyway what are you taking me in for for investigation now move huhuh i said i start to matacora with you id never get there he slipped his gun grabbing it around the trigger guard getting ready to slam me with the barrel im telling you one more time punk you get in that buggy or hell do it four trey whitey stepped between us hell go with you lassen and ill go along with him lassen hesitated his tongue flicking his lips i dont want you whitey just burwell well both go four trey insisted and well have a good frisk before we leave how about it friend he winked at the garage owner mind doing the honors you bet said the garage owner you just bet i will he gave us as good a frisk as ive ever seen and ive seen plenty searching us from head to foot and proving in front of everyone that we werent armed that pretty well spoiled any little plans lassen had he wouldnt dare shoot us or rough us up now since wed never be held in matacora i wondered that hed bother to take us in at all but he had more plans than id figured on all right he grunted you want it that way youll get it that way pile into the front seat we got into the front with four trey driving lassen got in behind us his gun still drawn and we took off for matacora it was eightyfive miles away eightyfive miles without a filling station or a store or a house or any place where a man might get a drink of water or a bite to eat nothing but some of the sorriest land in the world a desert that even a mule jackrabbit couldnt have crossed without a lunch pail and a canteen so when we were about midway in those eightyfive miles more than forty miles from matacora or the town we had come from bud lassen unloaded us he forced us out of the car and drove off by himself it was a pretty bad spot to be in but four trey winked at me and said it was no sweat someone will come along tommy just relax and the time will go faster he jumped the ditch and stomped around in what little growth there was on the other side making sure that it was free of any vinegarroons or centipedes or tarantulas then he lay back with his hands under his head and his hat pushed over his eyes i went over to where he was and lay down next to him we stayed that way for a while the incessant texas wind scrubbing us with hot blasts and at last he pushed his hat back and squinted at me written any poetry lately tommy nothing i said i kind of got out of the habit along with eating lets have some of the old ones then that one about the road seems appropriate under the circumstances i said i wasnt sure i remembered it not all of it and he said to give him what i remembered then so i did i can still see that lonely grassgrown trail which clung so closely to the shambling fence sandswept windtorn at every gale a helpless prey to all the elements its tortuous ruts were like two treacherous bars so spaced to show an eyedeceiving gape so while one ever struggled for the stars they hugged too close for actual escape escape tell me the meaning of the word produce the man whos touched a star for me escape is something for a bird a star is good to hang upon a tree i guess thats about all i remember i said four trey said he liked the poem very much but it always gave him a touch of blues how about something a little lighter a couple of limericks maybe well lets see i said uh oh yeah quoth oedipus rex to his son i have no objection to fun but yours is a marital menace so play games no more in youknowwhos boudoir but practice up on your tennis thats actually not a true limerick i said but heres one that is said prometheus chained high in the sky where hed alternately shiver and fry while great birds of carrion his liver made merry on ill bet theyd like moms apple pie four trey made a chuckling sound go on tommy he said how about that booze poem the ode to a load or whatever you called it gee i said now you are going back i did that one when i was just a kid mm i know he said drily but the old things are best tommy so give me what you can of it let me hear that grand old poem once more before i die i laughed well all right if you want to punish yourself i said and i stared in again drink and forgo your noxious tonics nor pray for cosmic reciprocity earths ills for heavens high colonics drinks virtue is its virtuosity yes drink or close eyes ears and nose to all thats hideous and heinous let moss grow on your phallic hose i broke off for four trey had rolled over on his side his back to me i waited a moment and when he didnt say anything i asked him what was the matter you he said his voice coming to me a little muffled because he was speaking into the wind youre the matter you know if i was really a friend of yours id kick the crap out of you what i said what are you talking like that for prometheus he said oedipus rex cosmic reciprocity goddammit he rolled over and faced me scowling what kind of life is this for a kid as bright as you are why do you go on wasting your time year after year do you think youre going to stay young forever if you do take a look at me i was surprised at his talking this way because he just wasnt the kind to get personal as ive said he never liked to get too close to anyone since naturally that would give them the same privilege with him well i said finally i dont entirely waste my time four trey ive learned a lot about different jobs and i read a lot when i have the chance one time i wintered in six sands and i read every book in the public library six sands hmm that would be about eighteen volumes if i remember the town rightly i laughed and said no they had quite a few more books than that but anyway getting back to the subject this stuff i fool around with isnt poetry its doggerel i dont know much about writing or poetry but i know that much i see and you figure on getting able to do the real stuff by hanging around these godforsaken labor camps i said no i was pulling out after this pipeline job i was going to save my money and get a start on making something out of myself he studied me reflectively chewing on a piece of grass stem i hope you mean that tommy because youll have the money to do it deal blackjack for me and save your stiffs wages and youll have all the money you need im going to i said thats just what im going to do four trey he nodded studying me with thoughtful eyes who was the girl i saw you with today tommy you seemed to be getting along real friendly oh her i said oh shes just a girl i know shes a girl tommy i dont think ive ever seen a girl that was more of a girl in fact she wouldnt have needed much more equipment to be two girls i laughed a little uncomfortably her names carol i dont know her last name well now she must be a pretty dumb girl what did she say when you asked her look i said i was only with her a few minutes she had some idea of getting work around the pipeline but i told her there wasnt anything for girls mmm dont you think that was rather misleading tommy no i dont i said feeling my face redden not if youre talking about what i think you are thats what im talking about why else would she be in a place like this a girl who brings a shape like that to a pipeline isnt looking for a job tommy she has her office right in her pants thats not a very nice thing to say i said you shouldnt talk that way about a girl you dont even know why ill bet shes long gone by now she probably wouldnt even have stopped in town if she hadnt had a flat tire a flat tire huh he laughed softly well she certainly didnt have anything else that was flat my face was really beginning to burn by then and i was on the point of saying something very nasty but he smiled at me in a way he had of smiling warm and friendly and sympathetic so i choked down the nasty words and smiled back at him after all why should i be so defensive about a girl i didnt even know and would never see again he sat up gripping his hat brim front and rear and tilting it upward i sat up also unconsciously doing the same with my hat brim i think i must have imitated him a lot without knowing that i did i suppose every kid patterns himself after some older man and i might have done worse he drew his knees up and locked his arms around them looking off toward matacora pretty soon i was doing the same thing after a while he shifted his gaze and spoke to me you believe in god tommy well yeah i guess so i said thats the way i was raised then you believe thats heaven right up over us so close we can almost touch it were just a little south of heaven right well i hesitated i suppose you could put it that way think about it tommy think about it real hard the next time youre about to do something to screw yourself up he yawned and stood up he stretched himself then stood a little on tiptoe to peer off toward the horizon after a minute or so he said here we go tommy heres us our ride it was a pipeline company car a halfton pickup with a timekeeper and higby the chief highpressure in it trailing behind a ways was one of the companys big flatbed trucks the car stopped and higby nodded to me and shook hands with four trey starting a new jungle he said or were you just out for a walk or something or something four trey said you want to hear about it before you give us a ride higby said god forbid hearing about it at any time he had more than enough to think about already you can have some hours with your ride if you want em use you rigging up camp i guess we could be persuaded four trey said you dont have any other engagements do you tommy i said huh and then i said carelessly that i guess i didnt have anything scheduled that couldnt be postponed the timekeeper was fidgeting tapping on the steering wheel higby told us to climb in the back giving us a pursedlip look to let us know he didnt care for the guy we had a fast ride into town too fast for the road four trey and i were bouncing around every step of the way and we both took a banging from the loose tools that flew up from the truck bed by the time we reached town we were both of a mind to cloud up and rain all over the timekeeper but higby saw how we felt i guess and he hustled him off on an errand in one direction and sent us in another to round up a riggingup crew so the guy didnt get the pasting he deserved we went down to the jungle and passed the word by dusk about fifty men were piled on the big flatbed truck sitting around its edges with their legs hanging off higby had hired on the cook from the greeks restaurant and he rode in the back of the pickup with four trey and me sitting on his workingstiffs bindle and carrying his knives and cleavers in a dish towel as we drove out of town ahead of the truck i looked around for carol but there was no sign of her or her homemade housecar and i was relieved in a way and sort of sad in another sorry that i wouldnt ever be seeing her again id never had much to do with girls nothing at all to tell the truth it seemed a shame to be losing one the only one i could have cared about before i ever got to know her we were about a mile from camp when the truck began to honk wildly flashing its lights four trey banged on the roof of the pickup and shouted to higby without slacking speed the pickup wheeled around on the prairie and went back to where the truck had stopped a man had been killed he had been sitting near the rear of the flatbed and apparently a wheel had caught his dangling feet snatching him from the truck and slamming him down against the rocky earth higby glanced at the body looked quickly away with a sadly bitter curse dammit to hell anyway anyone know the poor devil someone said the mans name was bones but someone else said it wasnt his real name he was just called that because he was so thin no one knew who he was on a pipeline hardly anyone ever knew who anyone else was pipeliners didnt have names or homes or families higby stooped down and went through the dead mans pockets as well as he could under the circumstances there was nothing in them except some matches and a practically empty sack of bull durham no wallet no letters no social security card naturally since this was before the days of social security higby straightened rubbing his hands against his trousers he turned to the timekeeper a prissy owlishlooking guy with goldrimmed spectacles his name was depew and he wore a hairline moustache and storenew khakis ill phone a report into matacora tomorrow higby told him you can put that in your job log meanwhile well have to get him buried depew frowned importantly pursing his lips we cant assume any funeral expenses higby riding on the truck was his own choice he wouldnt have been an employee until he reached camp higby stared at him wonderingly why you silly sonofabitch he said you stupid snotnosed bastard his voice was soft but it cut like a whip do you know what the temperature was today do you know how far it is to the nearest undertaker to the nearest public cemetery to the nearest place where anyone gives a good goddam what happens to the body of a poor devil like this do you well do you you stinking little shitbird he yelled out the last part almost blasting the timekeeper from his feet depew turned white and put a trembling hand to his mouth he could hardly believe what was happening i imagine after all he was an important man not just a timekeeper but the timekeeper the chief representative of the banks nnow now really higby he stammered i resent screw your resentment higby snapped and put a mister in front of my name hereafter make it loud and clear get me he turned away from depew glanced around the circle of men until his eyes fell on us four trey i cant order you to but you dont have to four trey said just give us an hour and some mucksticks and tommy and ill bury him good higbys smile warmed us ill remember it but wont you need some dyna four trey said we wouldnt wed just look around until we found soft dirt higby nodded approvingly and we got picks and shovels from the pickup then everyone loaded up again and drove away leaving four trey and me with the body we poked around with the picks for a few minutes until we found a patch of rockfree prairie inside of a halfhour we had buried bones or whatever his name was mounding over the grave with rock to keep out the varmints four trey leaned on his pick resting looking down thoughtfully at the grave then raising his eyes to me well tommy can you think of anything appropriate to the occasion a few nice words for a guy who probably never heard any i guess not i said i heard some words said over a guy out in the panhandle but i cant say they were real nice lets see well all right i said here it is save your breath and hold your water hes only gone where all of us gotter four trey raised his brows at me he said that he could see what i meant whatever that meant we moved away from the grave lighting up cigarettes the soughing wind turned cool and the moon climbed up out of a distant hedge of spanish bayonets the giant cacti and down in the pecos bottoms a bobcat screamed in pointless fury far far away yet clearly visible in the silvery moonlight two wolves trotted up over a rise in the prairie haunched down side by side and howled tragic complaints to the heavens a little shiver ran up my spine four trey stomped out his cigarette butt idly asking me how many boes id run into out here that i knew i said i thought i knew most of the six hundred i dont mean i know them well but ive probably run into them on other jobs just probably right youd have to talk to them a while get close to them before you were sure well yeah sure i said boes look a lot alike after theyve jungled up for a while when they get bearded out and their clothes get ragged and dirty its pretty hard to tell one from another yes four trey said yes it is tommy in other words you might not recognize a man until you sat down next to him on a flatbed truck shall we say huh i said are you saying that that mmm no four trey hesitated i dont think id go so far as to say it merely to point out the possibility that what appeared to be an accident wasnt because those flatbeds were designed to carry men and i just dont see how a man could catch his foot in the wheel i said i thought i could see how if the truck went down in a rut on one side and if the guy slid out to the edge and if they hit a bad jolt all at the same time kind of thats a lot of ifs i admitted but well why would anyone want to kill a bo like bones the answer is in your question tommy what was bones like who was he what was his background four trey shook his head offhand however id say he was killed because he recognized someone who couldnt afford to be recognized if he was killed that is and im by no means sure that he was i laughed a trifle nervously you sounded pretty sure a moment ago maybe you should tell higby what you suspect four trey said firmly that he guessed he maybe shouldnt and i shouldnt either ill tell you about frank higby he went on franks got a line to build he has to eat line sleep line think line and he cant be bothered with anything else he wouldnt cover up a murder of course but he sure as hell wouldnt go looking for one either and he wouldnt be exactly fond of a guy who did it for him i nodded and said i supposed he was right but he made higby sound pretty callous four trey yawned and said that life was a pretty callous proposition when you got right down to it the callousness was more subtle on the upper levels you knifed a man by cutting off his credit or pulling a slick doublecross down in the dirt where we were you simply knifed him he lighted another cigarette slid a glance at me in the glow of the match his expression changed and he laughed softly giving me an amiable nudge in the ribs aah for gods sake tommy i havent got you upset have i oh no of course not i said what the hell anyway what the hell he agreed we were tired and hungry and thirsty and we had some time to kill so ive been tossing the bull around i was just talking understand i didnt mean anything by it and you arent to think anything of it sure i said relieved you really think it was an accident then didnt i just say so he said yeah sure i said but of course he hadnt said that at all a long while passed and no one came to pick us up finally we gathered up our tools and started into camp on foot but we hadnt gone very far before higby came roaring up the trail in the pickup he was late because dust had clogged the cars carburetor he blamed it on depews driving he looked more tired than we felt as we rode into the camp now lit up like a carnival with lanterns higby took us to the main highpressure tent the only one with a floor and screens and had us marked down for three hours work we got our badges at the same time then went over to one of the long tables sitting out on the prairie a table made out of planks laid on sawhorses and washed with river water and laundry soap everyone else had been fed some time before the cook and his seconds and flunkeys were now busy cleaning up and doing what they could to prepare for six oclock breakfast ordinarily since they worked on straight salary instead of hourly wages you couldnt have got a cup of coffee from em if youd held a gun to their heads but the cook knew me and he knew about us burying bones a victim of capitalist brutality so he fixed us up fine coffee with a big slug of jamaica ginger in it then a whole platter of canned roast beef with hashedbrown potatoes and canned peaches and warmedover biscuits i ate and ate only stopping because i was afraid of getting sick four trey had finished ahead of me so we carried our dishes back into the kitchen tent thanked the cook and went out into the starlit night a heavyset old guy with a shaved head and only one arm was fussing around at the wash benches laying out bars of laundry soap and rinsing basins and so on four trey nudged me pointing to him i see wingy warfields made camp boss again with his voice how could he miss i laughed being camp boss isnt nearly so important as it sounds in fact it isnt important at all since it doesnt involve much but waking the stiffs in the morning and keeping the camp grounds in reasonable order wingy all onearmed men are called wingy knew this as well as anyone but he put on more airs than a line boss he saw four trey and me watching him and he puffed himself up and strutted over to us im givin you fair warning he said in a voice like a foghorn the first bo i catch droppin his pants within a hundred yards of camp can go get his time well watch it wingy four trey nodded soberly fact is tommy and i are starting to blast slop pits and latrines the first thing in the morning well all right wingy warfield roared glaring from one to the other of us but what i said still goes he turned and strutted away importantly four trey and i lighted up cigarettes warfield was a boomer a guy who made the boom camps there was a joke going around that the places had been named for him like the town of sonofabitch for example which was nothing but one big whorehouse with an annex for gambling and which had the shortterm very shortterm reputation of being the toughest town in the world the rangers moved in after less than a month and chopped it to pieces with axes when they did they found more than a dozen bodies buried under the floors well tommy four trey squinted up at the sky taking a deep breath of the cool clean air maybe wed better put a button on the day hmm maybe we had i said its been a long one he caught his hat brim fore and aft and crimped it upward casually i did the same with mine we said good night and he sauntered away disappearing inside one of the twenty long sleeping tents i waited until i saw which one he chose then i entered one several tents away that was the way you had to operate if you wanted to get along with four trey whitey he didnt want anyone moving in on him as the saying is and he had some pretty funny ideas about what movingin meant i mean it took a lot of territory where he was concerned and you had to lean over backwards to avoid it the only other person in my tent was an old pappy guy which is what they call any old man on a pipeline i put him down as a crumbboss and i turned out to be right a crumb in the oil fields is a louse the joke is that the old men who take care of the tents are secretly the bosses of the lice telling them who to bite and so on he gave me a cross suspicious look as old men do sometimes because theyre afraid of you i suppose until you make them know they dont have to be he said i was to pick out my cot and be danged sure i didnt mess up any of the others and i said of course id do just that mind if i take one back by the rear flap i asked i like lots of air well he gave me a cautious look well i guess thatll be all right he actually had nothing to say about where i slept but he was scared and old and well what the hell its strictly up to you i said after all youre the boss and youve got the stroke in this tent he broke into a big smile it was as nice a smile as ive ever seen even if it didnt have any teeth in it sure its all right he said bunk down anywhere you want to son and if you need any extra blankets or anything you just let me know i went down the grassy aisle between the twin rows of cots to the rear of the tent i stretched out on an end cot putting my hands under my head and easing my shoes off lying in a bed or rather a cot with a mattress on it for the first time in weeks felt good too good when you havent been used to it comfort can be uncomfortable after a while i sat up and the crumb boss stopped fooling around up front doing things that didnt need to be done and came back to where i was we talked rather he talked and i listened i guess it had been a ling time since anyone was interested in anything he had to say and he needed to talk it didnt tell me much about him that i hadnt already surmised you saw quite a few old pappy guys and it was virtually the same story with all of them no homes no families or none that cared what happened to them anywhere else theyd have been in a poorhouse or an old folks home since there were no oldage pensions at the time out here they could usually pick up some kind of job on the big construction projects nothing important of course nothing that required any real effort but something that did have to be done they worked during the warm months the summer and spring and fall the only times there were jobs for them in the winter they stayed in the bleak godawful oil towns bunking in the dingy halfcanvas cothouses rag houses they were called or holing up three or four to a room in the rickety unpainted hotels they seldom had more than enough money to barely squeak by until spring spring sometimes found them too old and weak to work and they gradually starved to death but that didnt happen very often this was a young mans country a country for healthy young men there was little available in the way of medical facilities and old men sicken easily and when they took sick here they died it wasnt much to look forward to dying when you were too old and sick to work but maybe living isnt either we said good night the crumb boss and i he went back up front blew out the lantern and went to bed and i still couldnt relax i took off all my clothes and it was a little better that way with the cool breeze washing over me but it wasnt good enough for sleep id missed my bath that day not getting down to the pecos as i usually did and i felt all prickly and sticky finally after a lot of tossing around i put my shoes back on just my shoes nothing else and went out the rear flap of the tent it was a nice night just cool enough without being cold the moon streamed through a canyon of clouds painting a path across the sage and chaparral i sauntered down it feeling like i sometimes did at night in these farout places as though everything was mine the whole world and that i was the only person in it i kept walking not for any reason except that i felt like it and it was a nice night then when id probably walked a halfmile or so i suddenly came to a stop i was looking down into a wash a draw in the prairie an old panel truck was parked in it a track made over into a housecar i stood staring at it not at all sure of what i was seeing that it really was carols halfthinking that id gone to sleep back there in the tent and that this was a dream i closed my eyes for a moment then opened them again just as she came around the side of the truck she was as naked as i was wearing nothing but her shoes we stood looking at each other and it all seemed perfectly natural that we should be like this just the two of us standing naked in our own private world then she called my name softly tommy and held her arms out to me and i went down to her i picked her up and kissed her the first girl id ever really kissed i carried her to the truck and lifted her inside and climbed in after her back in camp that night again stretched out on my bunk i thought of countless things i should have asked her one very important thing in particular and it seemed incredible that id asked her nothing at all that wed hardly talked at all yet on the other hand it seemed natural enough exactly the way it should have been and basically i guess it was we were two kids a young man and a young woman come together for the first time the first time for her yes as well as for me for as little as i knew about women i knew that much we had given each other the gift that can only be given once and in the glory and wonder of giving it we had no thoughts for anything else how could we talk at such a time how could i even think of questioning her frankly i would have been a little worried about myself if i had i settled down under the blankets contentedly tired and ready to sleep but i wasnt due to get much that night my eyes were just drifting shut when the beam of headlights swept the prairie only one pair at first then another and another and another until the landscape leaped and danced with light and the sound of laboring motors filled the air i opened the tent flap wide and looked out the cars were all the same make big hudson sedans their rebuilt bodies were halfagain as long as they had been originally and they were equipped with extraheavy duty springs and tires canvas water bags hung from the radiator caps a winch for winching out of quicksand and mud was bolted to the reinforced front bumper roped to the roof were four spare tires and a set of digging out tools roped to a builton platform at the rear was a pile of baggage they were stagecoaches and they went wherever man went to all the places where trains didnt go and never would just as the horsedrawn stagecoach was the forerunner of the train these were the forerunner of our presentday bus system the drivers wore boots and broadbrimmed hats and they were tanned the color of saddle leather they wore gunbelts ands and they didnt wear them for decoration their passengers that night were welders and other skilled workmen dragline and ditcher operators heavymachinery mechanics and the like they were highpay men with strong unions so they doubtless all owned cars which needless to say theyd been smart enough to leave at home a pipeline was no place to bring a car not if it was worth anything it would be stolen whole or piece by piece the first time you turned your back to it the long line of hudsons pulled into camp and drove off into the night again their recent passengers began to bunk down in the tents calling back and forth to each other and making a lot of noise about it they were sore they had a right to be the line had waited until the very last minute before notifying them to report to work in the morning they were worn out from traveling yet they would get almost no rest before facing up to a hard day they were hungry but they could get no food the pipeline company its financial backers rather had let them in for this hardship merely to save a few dollars the relatively small cost of feeding them supper for if a man was in camp he had to be fed normally the bosses on pipeline jobs were pretty free and easy about such things your wages were docked a dollar a day for room and board and if you didnt have any pay coming if you were in camp a day before the job started you were welcome to eat without paying but it obviously wasnt going to be that way here the moneymen on this job werent giving anything away everything finally quieted down and i went to sleep little more than an hour later about an hour before dawn i was awakened again truckloads of men were coming into camp the common working stiffs guys who had been jungled up in town while they waited for the job to open they climbed down from the big flatbeds hurried blearyeyed into the tents to claim bunks for themselves like the welders and other skilled workmen they too were victims of the lines pennypinching called into camp at the last possible moment to save the cost of one meal they were hungry and wornout too tired to do anything but curse about as capable of doing the hard days work that lay just ahead of them as hospital patients so the pennypinchers would find their stinginess a damned expensive business and i wondered how anyone could have been so stupid but socalled smart people often outsmart themselves ive found to make a dollar they make an enemy for life to save a dollar they lose a hundred they have eyes only for whats happening at their end of the rope overlooking the guy at the other end the camp never got quiet again that night but i went to sleep anyway an hour passed a little less than an hour actually and it was dawn and i was brought wideawake by wingy warfields foghorn voice yeeowww he yelled yow yow yow yeeowww grab your shirt and hit the dirt yow yow yow pile out you boes get on your toes an blow your nose on your underclothes yow yow yow since most of the other men were already dressed they were at the wash benches ahead of me dabbling at their faces and hands and then running toward the long chow tent they began to pile up at the entrance where depew and his assistants were checking them off for time there were sullenly restless grumbles at the delay then yells and shouts and curses and then they were storming into the tent from all directions through the front and under the sideflaps knocking depew and his helpers out of the way bowling over everyone who tried to stop them there was a blast of gunfire i looked up from washing it was bud lassen he was firing into the air but not by very much a little bit lower and he would have hit someone and that of course would have been the end of him and probably the end of the camp it would have started a riot that nothing could have stopped i stared at him stunned as he raised his gun to fire again almost holding it level depew was only a few feet away making no move at all to stop him actually grinning a smugly mean little grin as he watched i looked around wildly for higby but i couldnt see him as i learned later he was deliberately keeping out of sight since depew was running this end of the show and higby wanted no part of it i let out a yell a warning but no one heard me there was too much noise i yelled again and then i vaulted over the wash bench and ran wondering why no one but me could see the terrible danger why they kept on jamming into the tent when they should have been running for their lives bud apparently saw or sensed my approach he hesitated for a second then swerved the gun toward me he wasnt quite fast enough his moment of hesitation had let me get in close and i left my feet in a flying tackle hitting him just above the knees he did an almost complete flipflop came down hard on the ground the gun flying from his hand as he rolled and grabbed for it i threw myself on top of him and began to pound him in the face i was killing mad everything had piled up in me the loss of sleep the senseless cruelty of the lines backers the brutal murder of fruit jar all the indignities and humiliations i had suffered or felt i had suffered during my weeks of waiting for work had piled up in me and now crashed down on top of me something seemed to snap in my brain and all i could see was a red haze and i did my damnedest to beat bud lassen to death i was screaming that i would kill him when four trey and some other guys dragged me off of him i tried to break away from them to get at him again four trey shook me yelling for me to stop for gods sake but i wouldnt i guess i couldnt so he knocked me cold with a hard clip to the button he may have hit me a little harder than he intended at any rate it was one hell of a good punch when i came to four trey was carrying me over his shoulder lugging me down the gentle slope away from camp i mumbled foggily and after a few more steps he paused in a kind of natural hedge of sage brush and set me gently upon my feet okay he frowned into my face all right now sure i said slurring the word what wheresh evyone never mind he snapped just stay here and keep out of trouble stay right here get me i nodded fuzzily wondering why he was so sore he turned and went back up the slope and i rubbed the fog out of my eyes at last coming into full consciousness above me men were streaming out of the chow tent coming out of it not going in and the strawbosses were sorting out their crews for the days work then pointing them to the particular trucks they were to ride in the distance i heard the rocking chugchug of the ditching machines still further away a chorus of jackhammers began to chatter there were shouts whistles cries of over here bo then the first of the big flatbeds broke into a thunderous roar wheeled out of camp with its jampacked load of men one by one the others roared thunderously and followed it a rocking jolting procession of men and machines heading for the startoline the last of the racket died away and the camp was almost completely silent four trey came into view started down the slope with an armload of tools i hurried to help him but he pushed past me with a curt shake of his head leaving me to trail after him emptyhanded he dropped the tools in the growth of sage stood examining the terrain for a few moments at last he turned back to me made a sweeping gesture with one hand all right he said this is our latrine fifty feet long three wide and two deep grab yourself a mattock and get busy i picked up a mattock a pick with a wide blade he went back up the slope to the supply tent returning a few minutes later with a case of dynamite balanced on one shoulder and two steel rock drills on the other he dropped the drills on the tool pile then carried the dyna some fifty feet farther before easing it down to the ground leaving it there he went on another fifty feet or so to a bare place in the prairie where he carefully took a small box of dynamite caps from his pocket and held it in both hands as he lowered it to the earth a dyna cap is black and not much bigger than a penny it is the percussive force which sets off the dynamite charge and it explodes very easily and one of them is enough to blow off a mans hand coming back to where i was four trey picked up a mattock and went to work with me neither of us saying a word as we marked off a rough outline of the latrine then began clearing it of sage and grass finally after we had been at it for more than an hour he rested on his mattock and slanted a wryly amused glance at me getting hungry tommy he asked i can make out i said you dont hear me kicking do you you should have eaten early machine and powder men always eat early he was right of course i should have left a call with the crumb boss but it had been so long since id worked powder that id forgotten all right i said its my own fault its not the only thing tommy that brawl with lassen was your fault too all right i said again but i was beginning to boil he was about to shoot into a crowd and it was my fault for trying to stop him i should have let him start a riot and have the camp torn down its your fault for being stupid there was a sharp edge to his voice sure depew is a complete stinker but hes not a sap did you actually think hed allow bud to commit murder that hed just stand and watch without saying a word of protest four trey shook his head disgustedly lassen was firing blanks for gods sake anyone even half as bright as you are should have known that he was he picked up his mattock and went back to work i did the same feeling like two cents worth of nothing the mattocks went up and down chugclomp clushclush and the sun began to pull sweat from me like a magnet the silence between four trey and me dragged on and on and then i brought the mattock blade down on a teninch centipede cutting it in two the two halves started to run away in different directions and four trey pounded them into the ground ever get bitten by one of those he asked casually no i said but one clamped onto my bare leg once i knocked him off all right but there were these two rows of little holes like pinpricks where hed held on with his feet they got infected and i had chills and fever for a week is that a fact four trey shook his head interestedly ive been lucky i guess i got bit by a tarantula but i was more scared than hurt the biggest damned spider you ever saw tommy as big around as a saucer and furred like a rabbit ill bet it jumped on you i said because tarantulas are great on jumping four trey said id bet right i was lighting a cigarette from a coaloil lamp and the thing jumped at the light they go for light you know it missed the lamp and landed right across my mouth and nose holy cow i said that must have given you a jolt it did tommy he chuckled oh it did i wouldnt care to go into embarrassing details but the hotel made me buy them a new mattress and bedclothes we laughed about it the laughter almost making me forget how hot and hungry i was four trey scrubbed his palms against his pants and took another grip on his mattock now getting back to bud lassen tommy yeah i said a little nervously what uh how do i stand on that four trey well lassen shouldnt have been firing into a crowd blanks or no blanks so depew couldnt have you run out of camp like he wanted to higby threatened to take the matter right to the top and depew had to back water im glad higby took my part i said i just wonder why he ever hired lassen in the first place he didnt depew hired him over higbys head but tommy four trey gave me a sober look forget that stuff about higbys taking your part dont lean on it because hell never do it the second time not unless it suits his own purposes well sure i said but lassens gone to matacora to get himself patched up if youd really hurt him instead of hurting his appearance higby would have had to let you go because he isnt going to run any real risk of losing his job on your account or anyones he cant tommy theres just one big pipeline construction job in the world thats this one theres just one job open for a bigline construction superintendent and higbys holding it he either works here or he doesnt work well i hesitated theres always another job coming up somewhere not this kind the only kind he knows and there may never be another one four trey paused in swinging the mattock and wiped the sweat from his face there was a peculiar sadness in his eyes something i could not understand at the time although i eventually did yes tommy i think we may be near the end of an era the building of the last big pipeline i think we may be the first white men to come this way and after were gone he shook his head resumed his grip on the mattock watch yourself around bud lassen from now on tommy keep your guard up dont do anything that he can twist into trouble i nodded with a twinge of uneasiness i thought of her of carol and i wanted to say something about her being here but i knew what four treys reply would be and of course he was wrong about her so so i kept my mouth shut we had the latrine and garbage areas cleared of brush by noon and most of the shotholes drilled since the pipeliners noon meal was sent out to the job we ate almost by ourselves in the big chow tent i put away a great deal more food than i should have and when we went back out in the sun i had to make a sudden run for the bushes i came back out of them weak and headachy and wanting nothing so much as to go to bed and four trey pointed to the sixteenpound sledge hammer i picked it up he picked up a rock drill he jobbed it around in the rock marking out a shothole then held it upright and nodded to me i swung the sledge bringing it down on the head of the drill each time i hit it four trey shook and twirled it forcing out the groundup rock my sledge blows had to be timed with this striking when he had the drill upright and of course it was my job to swing the sledge there was a strict protocol to this the powder monkey handles the drill and his assistant does the heavy work four trey had done a lot of things during the morning that i should have done but i couldnt let him go on doing it for that matter he was obviously of no mind to being very tired and hot himself we were working on the last hole when i swung the sledge out of time just a little but that was enough it grazed the head of the drill zipped down the side where four trey was holding he jerked his hands back with a howl clutching them between his knees as he did a doubledover dance of pain jeezass keerist he glared furiously at me what in the name of the living god is the matter with you tommy im sorry i mumbled im sure as hell sorry four trey sorry a hell of a lot of frigging good it does to be sorry just come out of your goddam daydreaming and you wont have to be sorry i began to get sulky and sore and i said it was all the fault of the bosses they should have given us a jackhammer and we could have drilled every hole we needed in an hour four trey told me to stop talking like a damned fool it takes power to run a jack doesnt it how the hell they going to give us a generator when they need em on the line he went on cursing and scolding me and finally i lost my temper and started yelling back at him just what the hell do you want me to do anyway i said i was sorry i apologized all to hell over the place now what else do you want me to do i want you to snap out of it i want you to stop acting like a goddamned dreamy horses ass i he caught himself swallowed heavily sorry tommy he said quietly it was my fault as much as yours well no no it was my fault i said it really was four trey but never mind he gave me a quick grin never mind tommy boy its been a sour day but sweet nights acomin so lets shoot some powder we were shooting the latrine area part of the ground structure was soft and could be mucked without blasting the rocky area took twentyfour shot holes twelve on each side while four trey measured off fuse lengths and cut them with his shooters knife i brought down the dyna case and opened it then working opposite each other we dropped a stick of dynamite into each hole as a rule they went down easily until they rested on the bottom of the hole when they didnt we poked and tapped them down with tamping sticks i didnt mind this part a bit since it takes a twelvepound blow to explode dynamite but that was only part of the job we had drilled twoshot holes which meant that another stick went on top and that second one took the little black cap four trey began capping the sticks on his side clamping a fuse to the top of each cap i waited a moment hoping ashamedly that he would cap for me also but he stuck strictly to his own side dropping the fusesticks into the holes as fast as he capped them then tamping them down firmly whenever they required it he whistled softly as he worked not once did he look at me seemingly taking it for granted that i was holding up my end of the job i waited a moment or two longer clearing my throat nervously and he still didnt give me a look or a word so finally i took a cap and a fuse and went to work i worked fast a lot faster than i should have since i wanted to get the job over with despite the stall id put up i was finished ahead of four trey and this did get a look from him a long thoughtful look then lowering his eyes again he began tying the unattached fuse ends together got em all tamped down good tommy well sure i said hell yes you know what could happen if you didnt i got em in good i said real good i mean hell you can check em yourself if you want to why thank you tommy he drawled thank you very much he went down my line of shots testing them with his tamping stick occasionally bending over to examine one i watched him not quite sure which i was most afraid of the blowup from the dyna or the one id get from him if he found something wrong but he didnt find anything no thanks to me id been lucky and the shots were all in tight very good tommy he gave me a cocked brow look of approval ill make a shooter out of you yet he hunkered down took the tiedtogether fuse ends in his hand with the other hand he struck a match to them setting them all to burning evenly so that the shots would all go off together the twentyfour fuses sputtered began to burn blackred toward the shotholes four trey stood up fire in the hole he shouted and i echoed his cry fire in the hole i ran then a good long way back into the sage four trey didnt run at all he just walked not dragging his feet of course but not working up a sweat either and he stopped before he was back even half as far as i was he stood facing the shot as the day seemed to blow up around us tons of rock and shale soared up into the air some of it splashing out sidewise like water from a leaky sprinkler big chunks of it veered toward him began to drop down around him but he stayed where he was weaving a little to let it go past sometimes batting at it with his tamping stick at last everything was quiet again the blownup sky had sealed itself and the air was clear of dust we walked back to the latrine site four trey walked around it looking it over carefully examining the depth of the blasts it was all okay apparently no buried shots so we picked up shovels and mucked out the loose earth and rock banking it high in front and low in the back it didnt take long not nearly as long as i would have liked we finished with work time still left and with a job still left to do four trey said wed better get to hell at it it the slop pit was somewhat closer to camp it had to be since the cook and kitchen staff simply wouldnt carry slops very far four trey and i worked as before one to each side i put my shots down as before byguess and bygod and hoping for the best again i finished ahead of him but this time he didnt ask if i had the dyna down good he didnt check the shots to see that i had he simply fired them i ran i turned to find four trey running with me the blast went off it wasnt like the first one it didnt sound like it somehow and it was ragged to use a shooters term a chunk of rock as big as a mans head shot right toward the rear flap of the kitchentent it struck against the tent pole almost knocking it over there were shouts and yells from inside and the cook stuck his head out and shook his fist at us finally the dust settled and four trey crooked a finger at me i followed him to the site of the slop pit my head hanging like a beaten dogs well lets see he said musingly after he had finished his inspection lets just see i figure you laid the second stick on two of your shots practically on top of the ground you hardly tamped them down at all so that means can you tell me what it means tommy boy i nodded miserably unable to meet his eyes yeah i guess i do four trey i guess so guess tommy you dont guess with dyna not more than once all right i said all right damn you it means ive got two sticks of dynamite buried under the rubble and tommy and i suppose you expect me to dig them out for you i dont expect anything such of a damned thing i said i wouldnt let you do it for all the tumblebugs in texas im going to do it myself so you just get the hell back out of the way he did and i did when i found the buried shots i clamped caps and fuses on them and blew them and i acted like he did when he shot powder i stayed in fairly close weaving my body to dodge the fill even batting at a little clod of dirt with my hand when it sailed close to me that one little clod was all that did come close with only two onestick shots and both of them deep i was in no danger at all none from flying rock that is thered been plenty of danger in digging out the shots four trey and i scooped the pit out and banked it then our days work was done the men hadnt come in from the line yet but their time began when they got there and ours started here we gathered up our tools and equipment and checked them in at the supply tent at the wash benches we stripped and took baths taking turns at pouring pails of water over each other all this in silence neither of us said anything even when wingy warfield started yelling about us wasting water wingy wandered away mumbling to himself four trey and i finished washing and got dressed again our eyes met and i tried to look stern and haughty just why i dont know but somehow everything suddenly struck me ridiculous and i almost broke into laughter four trey gave me a deadpan look but his eyes were twinkling something on your mind tommy he asked nno no i said no i jjust ha ha i was just ha ha ha and then i doubled up laughing whooping and hollering and wheezing like nine kinds of a damned fool i laughed and laughed while four trey looked on grinning and nodding as if i were doing exactly what i should have and maybe i was i guess because it seemed to straighten out an awful lot of things inside me and to put me into perspective with myself without quite knowing that i was doing it i could see tommy burwell as he was and accept him his fears his pretentiousness his preposterous strutting and posing his bad as well as his good without knowing that i was doing it i met maturity and accepted it i washed my face again washing away the tears of laughter four trey gave me a full dipper from the drinkingwater barrel and we lighted up cigarettes he crimped up his hat brim fore and aft and i did the same with mine so we stood there smoking and talking quietly and sniffing the good smells of supper man and boy man and man late in the afternoon of the far west texas day the sage suddenly turned golden the shortgrass perpetually leaning with the wind seemed abruptly to catch fire out on the line the chattering of the jackhammers came to a stop and the ditcher gasped a final chugwhush and was silent one by one the firm throbbing of the generators dwindled into sobs growing weaker with lengthening distance between them until they were gone entirely for a brief space then there was nothing no sound at all an immeasurable hiatus of silence a tiny void in a universe of noise then there was the hail of a mans voice reedily thin with distance but coming clear in the clean air eeeyahoo then another hail and another hundreds of them doubtless smothering and mingling with the racket of muck sticks dropped and flung aside and then the big flatbeds began their barking roar hogging out all other sound but their own thundering and fuming and groaning the first days work was over the men were coming in from the line the welders and machine men rode the first truck this was protocol the best men got the best were entitled to first place and i never heard anyone complain about it the succeeding trucks carried the common working stiffs seated around the outside edges of the flatbeds or squeezed squatting in the inside the truck swampers stood on the running boards while the strawbosses rode with the truckdrivers this too was accepted protocol a strawboss outranked a swamper and was entitled to preempt him the machine men the welders and strawbosses were hungry and exhausted who wasnt but there was something in their expressions the way they carried themselves which drew a sharp line between them and the working stiffs quite likely they were even more tired than the working stiffs since their jobs demanded more of them and it was impossible for them to dog it as a muckstick artist could but still they didnt look as tired they didnt show it as much they had come from somewhere not nowhere and they were going somewhere not nowhere they had something to live for in other words something to look back on and having it put starch in their spines it gave them a look that you could note without being made uneasy without wondering uneasily whether you looked the same way and hoping to god that you never did as for the working stiffs they climbed down from the flatbeds and every bit of their weariness and hunger was apparent this days and all the bitter days before this all the emptiness of all those days and all the days that lay ahead of them and the bad part about it was that they didnt seem to mind they had got through a day getting through a day getting through it any way they could was the sum total of their lives worn out as they were they did a lot of joking and laughing why not anyway they laughed at all the things they should not have laughed about at their general worthlessness the filthiness of their clothes and bodies clinging with mud made of mingled dust and sweat their ancient garments had given way under the strain of their first days work pants showed great rips with dirty flesh peeking through shirts had split into shreds and many had been discarded the men going naked from the waist up headkerchiefs instead of hats were common dirty bandannas tied around the head piratestyle most of the men made a stab at washing but it was something they didnt have to do so they didnt do much of a job of it the general effect was of smearing the dirt around instead of getting rid of it i wondered how i could have been around these men for weeks while waiting for the job to open without realizing how terrible they truly were how i could have put up with them for even a day but i suppose it was because i had been out of work so long because i had lacked better men to compare them with four trey gave me a little nudge pointed to the entrance flap of the chow tent where the welders and other skilled workmen were already gathering we better get up there tommy yeah i said we sure as heck had and we did the eatingearly privilege didnt apply at night actually it wasnt a privilege being more a means of speeding up the work at night it was more convenient for everyone to eat at once more convenient for the pipeline that is so everyone did there was a mob behind us by the time supper was served it swept us forward carrying us almost all the way back to the end of the tent before the pressure eased off and we were able to sit down pipelines always fed good and this was no exception the keynote was plenty plenty of variety and plenty of it there were at least two kinds of everything all served family style two kinds of meat potatoes and beans and three of green vegetables there was pie cake cookies and doughnuts there were pitchers of tea coffee and milk we drank from metal pint bowls instead of cups and the plates were big metal trays all through the meal flunkies were running back and forth from the kitchen carrying in food and carrying out empty dishes at the end of the meal boxes of apples and oranges were set at the entrance to the tent and everyone was allowed to take one of each four trey and i went out together helping ourselves to fruit i remarked that the chow was up to standard so maybe the lines backers wouldnt turn out to be so chinchy after all four trey shrugged they have to feel good the men would be draggingup right and left if they didnt a lot of em will dragup anyway i said some will quit in the morning as soon as theyve scoffed and therell probably be fifty by the end of the week i wonder why that is four trey do you he said well yeah here theyve finally made a job and they need dough so bad it hurts but they blowup or dragup over a bad cup of coffee or for no damned reason at all mmm strange isnt it of course four trey drawled ive never done anything like that myself have you tommy were known far and wide as the old reliables of the oil fields i laughed sheepishly well all right i said but its sure going to be different this time it can be tommy he said softly it can be were just south of heaven remember and if you reach hard enough and high enough youre going to make it im going to i said you just watch and see im going to stay on the job and keep out of trouble and ill deal blackjack for you and he yawned openly cutting me off it was a way of telling me something that he liked me but that was it that what tommy burwell did was strictly tommy burwells business and what four trey whiteside did was his and he wanted to keep it that way i wasnt offended but maybe i was just a little hurt hed drawn back from me on other occasions when hed felt himself drawn too close but id felt that a change had taken place today that a bond had somehow sprung up between us and so i was maybe a little hurt by his rebuff well i yawned even wider than he had guess ill go sack up take it easy four trey see you in the morning he nodded i started for my tent crimping my hat brim front and back before he could do it and walking like i was in one heck of a hurry to get to bed tommy yeah i whirled back around yeah four trey tommy he bit his lip took an uncertain step or two toward me i just wanted to tell you that that nothing he said curtly i mean be sure and leave a call with the crumb boss we dont want another screwup in the morning got you i said and then i went on to my tent and he went to his the old guy id talked to the night before the crumb boss was sitting on my bunk to hold it for me i thanked him and gave him my morning call then sat down and began to undress all the other bunks had guys sitting or lying on them smoking or sleeping or getting ready to sleep hardly anyone talked with anyone else if they were awake they lay with their eyes open staring vacantly up at the canvas roof or else they sat on the edge of their sack staring vacantly down at the dirt floor seeing nothing i guess seeing everything up near the front of the tent a guy was twanging on a juiceharp playing the same thing over and over the opening bars of home sweet home he must have played it umpteen times and i was about to yell at him but another guy beat me to it knock that off you sonofabitch then a dozen other guys were yelling threatening to make him eat the juiceharp if he played it one more time so he knocked it off getting under the covers fast and everyone else sacked up too the crumb boss dimmed the lantern hung from the ridge pole ten minutes later he blew it out i waited a while longer measuring the time by counting to a hundred by fives then when everyone seemed asleep and darkness had settled in i dressed and went out the back flap of the tent clouds hung over the moon and there was hardly any light at all it was hard walking that way dangerous walking in view of all the snakes and poisonous pests in the area but i got to where she was with nothing worse than a few snags from the sage i got to where her homemade housecar was parked down in a little dip in the prairie she was sitting on a packing box outside the car her back was to me and inside a protective rim of rocks she had a low fire going for light rather than heat i guess since the night was only pleasantly cool i whistled softly so as not to startle her she didnt seem to hear me and i was about to whistle again when i heard the soft sound of her weeping it sounded so lonely so lost and frightened that tears came into my own eyes and i had to gulp down a lump in my throat then i ran down the slope calling to her holding out my arms and i must have scared her out of her wits for a moment but then she recognized my voice and came running to me like a child my gosh honey i held her in my arms petting and comforting her what were you crying about who hurt you baby you just tell me and nothing no one she clung to me heaving a great shuddery sigh just hold me tight tommy just hold me tight well sure i will i said stroking her hair kissing it over and over but look carol no dont talk tommy just hold me i held her we held each other close minutes passed and then she lifted her face and looked up at me all right tommy im all right now darling what were you crying about i said nnothing no really i wasnt i was just lonesome and i thought that well id never see you again that you wouldnt want to see me again after you know last night so i said why wouldnt i why wouldnt i want to see you for petes sake i i broke off peering into her face she tried to draw back but i had already seen it a big blackandblue bruise puffily clotted with blood and extending from her left cheek to her eye who did that i said who hit you carol no one no really i mean it tommy she said firmly i well i was fixing dinner and i turned around and banged into the car door it was standing open you know and i hit myself on the edge of it well i studied her carefully if youre sure does it look very awful tommy huh well it looks pretty bad i said i figure youre going to get a shiner out of it then ill bet you dont want to kiss me do you just because i bumped into a door and got a bruise on my face an an everything you dont love me anymore she flounced around playpouting turning her back to me i laughed and started to pull her back around again but the mite of suspicion in my mind moved me to do something else raising my hand i gave her a sharp slap on the back she let out a scream then she whirled and slapped me in the face im sunburned damn you i was going without a shirt today and i got a bad sunburn im sorry i said i just thought that i know what you thought and i told you about sixteen times you were wrong now if youre going to keep on acting stupid you can just go on back to your stupid camp and stay there well i apologized i promised not to be suspicious any more i assured her that the bruise made her more beautiful than ever and that i thought shed look wonderful with a shiner even two of em i told her well i dont remember it all but it was enough i guess because she came into my arms again and pretty soon afterward i whispered in her ear and she hesitated a split second then whispered back that yes it was kind of cold outside i lifted her up and put her in the truck i climbed in after her then reached out and closed the swinging doors just before they swung shut the moon cleared for a moment and in its dimly briefly glow i saw a tall shadow standing at the crest of the rise it was gone almost before i saw it in the blink of a fastblinking eye so fast that i could not be absolutely sure that i had seen it or that the light and my imagination had not exaggerated its size i closed and locked the doors telling myself that it must have been a rabbit after all some of those mule jacks stood almost four feet high and when you saw them in faint moonlight carols urgent whisper came to me in the darkness what was i waiting for for heavens sake i undressed hastily and went to her and for a long time i had thoughts for nothing else no tommy no now you promised not to you mean you wont even tell me your name your full name oh well its long carol long what where are your folks carol parents she shook her head i dont have any no close kin at all her hair brushed my face as she shook her head again then bitterly at least i hope theyre not mine how do you mean just the people whove taken care of me since i was a little girl as far back as i can remember you dont sound like you like them much i dont like a lot of things like people who keep asking questions after theyve promised not to why are you following a pipeline camp carol silence theres only one reason why you would follow it why any woman would silence is that how did someone come over here from the camp and beat you up silence no it couldnt be even if they knew you were here maybe on payday on payday sure but no one would be looking for a woman before then silence why carol oh my gosh honey why how could you i love you youre the only girl ive ever loved or ever will so how why silence still and her lips stiff unrelenting under mine but i felt the damp of tears upon her cheeks i wont let you do it carol by god if i catch anyone even coming near you i grabbed her and shook her in a fury of frustration i told her i ought to turn her over my knee and paddle the butt right off her why doggone it damn you anyway the idea of a nice girl like you turning herself into a damned filthy whore why why dammit to hell i she rolled over on her stomach and buried her face in her arms i raised my hand to give her a hard sock on the bottom but she started crying and i couldnt stand that so i wound up by kissing and petting her instead she snuggled against me contentedly sighed on a drowsy note mmm this is nice isnt it tommy dont you wish we could just stay this way forever fat chance i grumbled dammit carol how can you ddont tommy please dont anyway itll be a long long time yet an the hell it will be paydays a day less than two weeks off and but but maybe somethingll happen maybe itll be longer than that and anyway lets dont talk about it not now darling not now what do you mean maybe somethingll happen payday comes every two weeks and when it does oh why dont you shut up she exploded why dont you just go on back to camp and go to bed all right i will i said and i got up and began to dress and im not coming back either i got no use for whores and that includes you she started crying again i told her she might as well knock it off because i was leaving and i wasnt coming back ive got just one thing more to say to you i said hopping around on one foot to get my sock on if i had my way id yow i sat down on the floor hard clutching my big toe carol jumped up and somehow found me in the darkness flung her arms around me protectively ttommy whats the matter darling nothing i said i just stubbed my big toe oh you poor baby you she hugged my head to her breast want me to kiss it an make it well i said aw naw its all right feeling kind of embarrassed you know i think id better kiss it she said firmly you cant take chances with stubbed toes naw now dont i said now dammit carol of all the doggone crazy girls let me kiss your toe tommy ill tickle you if you dont i tried to pull away from her i told her shed better knock off the nuttiness because i was plenty sore at her already and it wasnt going to change anything she began to tickle me i tickled her we wrestled all over the floor laughing and acting the fool and knocking things over until wed practically torn the place apart after a while we got back in bed i left for camp an hour later after promising to come back the next night she wouldnt let me go until i did and of course i wanted to anyway camp was dark except for a couple of lanterns one hung near the drinkingwater barrel and another spotted in the area where the flatbeds were parked i was thirsty after all my activity so i went between my tent and the adjoining one and dippered up a drink i rolled a smidgin of water around in my mouth spat it out on the grass i took a swallow then another drinking slow because i was hot and a man could get sick from gulping water when he was hot i emptied the dipper a swallow at a time hung it back over the rim of the barrel and turned to go to my tent and there was bud lassen i almost piled into him i froze for a second then jumped backward raising my fists he gestured frantically holding his hands palm outward in an appeal for peace dont tommy i just where you been anyway none of your damned business i said well sure sure it aint i mean i was just looking for you and you werent flopped so uh naturally i asked where youd been i began to relax he certainly didnt look like he wanted any trouble judging by his swollen eye and mouth and the courtplaster strips across his nose and forehead hed had all the trouble he wanted i was restless so i took a walk i said what are you doing up well thats kind of my job you know tommy to sort of mosey around and keep an eye on things i pointed out that there was nothing around camp at night to keep an eye on and that an armed guard walked the line he agreed with an ingratiating smirk but you know how i am tommy i like to be on my toes i got to keep my hand in you know i know i said you like to go poking your nose in all over the map whether youve got any business there or not now what do you want with me his face tightened for a split second pure murder gleamed in his eyes then he worked the smile back into place well you know tommy just to let you know that i dont hold no hard feelings and to make sure you dont i mean were all here together workin and livin together an no were not i said im not living with you and im not working with you theres no reason why we should have to come near each other in a camp this size now tommy he squirmed im trying to do the right thing here an you sure aint makin it easy sounds like you just dont want to be friends no matter what he was right about that of course but id promised four trey to stay out of trouble and its never smart to hold a man in a corner when hes trying to get out so i nodded and took a softer tone with him okay bud i said if youre saying you dont want trouble from me ill promise you wont get any unless you start it now why dont we leave it at that and turn in swell tommy swell he burbled eagerly i mean maybe i done a wrong thing or two an maybe you did but now were even an shake on it huh he stuck out his hand i nodded and walked past him and when i glanced back from the entrance flap of my tent he was still standing there his hand halfextended he dropped it gave it a rub against his pants and walked away i went on into my tent and got into bed wondering what had come over the guy it could be that he was afraid of getting canned after seeing depew play secondstroke to higby or it could be that he wanted to get my guard down before he laid it into me hard or it could be both as i saw it however i could be pretty damned sure of a couple of things that bud lassens friendliness was strictly an act and that he was going to make plenty of trouble for me and i was right or at least halfright whether i was any more than that im still not sure the camp had to be pitched in a certain place a large reasonably level area which would be convenient to the job it had to be in a place like that and if the soil was rocky it had to be put up with the route of the pipeline itself however had been surveyed to skirt as much rock as possible and it was being dug in what the geologists call a fault a place where the rock has shifted and broken there were two downward sloping ledges of rock with a filledin valley of earth between them and the valley was the route of the line there were stretches and patches of rocky outcrop in the valleys earth and there were stretches where the two ledges ran together wherever rock occurred four trey and i and of course the jackhammer men had work to do our first day on the line there wasnt enough rock to require both a powder monkey and a helper or so higby said as we started to board the first truck going out i figure you can shoot it all four trey in a day or two of course youll need tommy again i wanted to know what i was going to do in that day or two but four trey cut in on me ill tell you frank he said tommys a little rusty on shooting you know how a man gets when he doesnt keep his hand in id like to get him broken in good now that weve made a start id like a lot of things higby said curtly but all right i can let you keep him this morning no longer four trey said a morning wasnt enough and higby said it would have to be you run a jackhammer tommy weve got more jackhammer work than weve got men for it well i hesitated reluctantly i wouldnt exactly call myself a jackhammer man but mmm would you call yourself a mormonboard man or a dopepouring man huh i said what do you mean i mean youve got a choice mormon board dope or jackhammer come to think of it i said im one of the best damned jackhammer men in texas and higby grinned tightly and four trey chuckled and then he and i climbed aboard the flatbed it pulled out of camp and went jolting southward across the prairie after about a mile we came to the beginning of the ditch and from then on we stopped repeatedly to drop off men and equipment as we proceeded down the line the dope boiler behind us was fired up sending acrid smoke into the sunny sky then the power generators began to chug and hum and the welders torches bounced showers of sparks from the joints of line pipe and then finally the ditching machine began its groaning shaking clatter it took one man working fulltime to keep the ditchers thousands of nuts and bolts tight otherwise it would have fallen apart from its constant rocking and shaking only the jackhammer men were left on the truck when four trey and i unloaded while we set up for work they were taken on up the route of the line ahead of ditch about a quarter of a mile they cut in their air generator and their jackhammers began to rattle and clatter against the rock four trey gave me a commiserating look too bad you got stuck on that tommy of course itll only be for a day or so sure i said anyway id a lot rather do it than dope pipe or pull a mormon board who wouldnt maybe its all for the best tommy after running a jackhammer shooting powder will look pretty good to you yeah i said although nothing was ever going to make me like to work dynamite sure it will shooting lineditch was a different proposition from the pit work wed done in camp because the shots might be stretched out over a considerable distance there was no cutting fuses the same length and tying the ends together that would take too much time and fuse instead you cut a long fuse for the first shot in your series and you cut the last one short then you ran down the line of shots lighting them from a cigar butt until the last one was lit and then you ran to beat hell if you gauged things right all the shots went off simultaneously and you were safely out of the way when they did if you didnt do it right you were in trouble live shots could get buried they werent the only thing either if you know what i mean of course there are better ways now of firing dynamite probably there were better ways then but that was the quickest and cheapest way so that was the way it was done it was an easy morning for me the work was at least there were no long series of shots even shooting them all with four trey supervising i still hardly worked up a sweat either from nerves or effort somehow though i didnt feel too good either mentally or physically id missed a lot of sleep the night before after being up most of the previous night and the loss was catching up with me being tired i couldnt fight off the black thoughts which kept creeping into my mind sickening thoughts about what she was going to do or had said she was going to do why would she say so if she wasnt i thought of her painfully bruised face how could she have done that by banging into a door i thought of her being alone and helpless in this godawful wilderness i thought of the tall shadow id seen from the door of her housecar and i thought maybe it was a mule jackrabbit but what if it wasnt just before noon a flatbed truck stopped at one of the main workgangs behind us and the driver and swamper set off their dinner for them after it had gone on by us to take grub to the jackhammer men i blew my last series of shots and four trey checked them out as okay it was noon by then and we sauntered back to where the main gang was starting to eat youre coming right along tommy he told me shooting like an old pro getting over your scares are you yeah i guess so i said im glad to hear it he said i had the impression at times that you werent scared because you just werent thinking about what you were doing if thats the case youve been a very lucky boy this morning and youd better not count on your luck holding i mumbled something about just being tired i guessed four trey said sharply that id better get over it then and get over it fast i mean that tommy i like you but not nearly enough to let you blow me up now if youve got something on your mind lets get it to hell unloaded right now well i swallowed guiltily i uh yes well to tell you the truth i said and it was partly the truth ive been thinking about that guy bones you know the one that fell off the truck only you said maybe he didnt fall off that someone murdered him oh for gods sake four trey stopped dead in his tracks you mean youre still thinking about that but i told you i was just making talk just killing time yeah i know i said but i still cant get it out of my mind its so logical you know when you stop to think about it it could have happened just the way you said a lot of things could happen that dont now forget it for gods sake bones was a working stiff who fell off a truck thats all there was to it so forget anything i said i promised that i would and we went on down to where the chow was everything was steaming hot to prevent spoilage sometimes you got a little ice in your drinking water and the canned milk would usually be mixed with ice water but there was no ice for food the only time you got cold food on the pipelines was in the winter when you didnt want it all the food was served plain that is without gravies or sauces no pipeliner would have touched anything with sauce or gravy on it just as none would have eaten hash or chili or anything like that they had to be able to see what they were eating to know exactly what it was anyone whos ever had a bad case of dysentery will know why four trey and i filled platters with food and drew bowls of boiling coffee we carried them over to where a group of guys were eating and sat down alongside them on the fill from the ditch id just taken a big mouthful of baked beans when one of them called to me hey tommy you seen the chippy yet chippy i choked and coughed almost strangling four trey gave me a long slow look but i went on coughing pretending not to notice i also pretended like i couldnt answer the guy whod called to me and he spoke again pointing shes camped off over in there tommy i was standing up on the truck coming out this morning and i got a good look at her wowee what a babe i seen her too another guy said and a couple of others chimed in that theyd also seen her come payday im really gonna have some of that i went on eating forcing the food down my face on fire with shame and anger i wanted to stomp every one of them and i couldnt even object to what they were saying if id had a hold of carol right then id have shaken her until her teeth rattled ill tell you what im gonna do the first guy was speaking again im gonna pay that little doll a visit tonight ill bet if i talk to her right i can get it on credit until payday why save yourself a trip four trey said she wouldnt trust you for a penny of it yeah you talk like you know man i do i was over to see her last night it was a lie of course but they didnt know that i doubt if there was another person in the world who knew that he was impotent no sir four trey went on that little gal doesnt trust no one for nothing i had some dough more than enough i thought but it wasnt enough for her and she wouldnt wait for even a dollar of it yeah how much did she want anyway four trey said that she wanted twenty bucks and he held up his hand at their grunts of surprise and disbelief i know i know boys three to five bucks is the going price but its not going for her either you pay twenty or you can stay in your sack and dream about it maybe not from a big looselipped guy maybe i get it without payin nothing four trey gave him a pitying smile you mean you think you can take it away from her she wouldnt be the first one i took it from probably not four trey nodded evenly but youd probably be the first guy to have his bellybutton next to his asshole the little lady has a sawedoff twelvegauge and she knows how to use it he stood up lifting his tray and bowl with him i stood up with him and he looked down at the guy with a smile that would have chilled a polar bear maybe youd better try it he said or maybe youd just better dragup and get out of camp tonight because if i ever see you again im going to swing at you with a rock drill and ill be swinging right along with you i said the guy looked down at the ground no one said anything and finally he moved his head in a little jerk hed leave camp he knew that hed better four trey and i walked back up the line to the place where wed been shooting he stopped there and i stopped with him wanting to thank him or to explain to say something or do something i didnt know just what well tommy he began drawing on his gloves youd better be getting up to those jackhammers hadnt you im going right now i said i i got to tell you something four trey i know what youre thinking but what i think tommy is that a kid with a great potential is about to throw it all down the drain but thats his business as long as he keeps it his if it ever again gets to crowding in on mine as it did this morning four trey i said i wasnt lying when i said id been thinking about bones death it has bothered me it has huh he gave me a look of cynical amusement been losing a lot of sleep over it have you not that pipeline chippy out there but poor old anonymous bones all right i said doggedly i was just trying to explain but have your own way about it maybe id better explain something to you tommy the mortality rate on pipeline jobs is approximately one death to every ten miles of line since weve already had one death in our burial of brother bones hows that for alliteration tommy and since weve made a little less than five miles of line id say you need have no fear of the grim reaper for another day or two he bent down began looking for the shotholes which the jackhammers had drilled i turned away and began trudging upline in the scorching midday heat everything rested but man quail and pheasant hid beneath the sage and chaparral wings hung loosely from their bodies their undersides wallowed into the dust cottontails whole families of them napped in the windcooled stands of grass giant mulejacks stood like sleepy sentries under the needly groves of spanish bayonet prairie dogs dreamed in the sparse shade of their mounds all the life of this wild and lonely land was there to see for those with the eyes to see it nothing took cover nothing ran from you having seen no men before they saw no need to hide or run i stopped to light a cigarette and a long thick shape slid frantically across the blistering earth and began to wind itself around the relative coolness of my leg it was a bull snake all of five feet long with a middle as thick as my biceps i let it rest for a minute then gently unwound it it struck at me with its head its only weapon but the blows were lazy heatdrugged and the snake finding himself unhurt ceased them immediately i put it inside my shirt let it cool in my evaporating sweat when i took it out transferring it to the interior of a joint of pipe it was blissfully asleep there were two jackhammers two men spelling one another worked each jackhammer i took the place of a guy whod had so much of it that even a mormon board looked good to him he didnt know mormon boards i guess or maybe he just had an awful hate for jackhammers which is a mighty easy thing to get youve probably seen jackhammers or airhammers to use their proper name theyre used in breaking up pavement and the like they have a twohanded grip across the top in the shape of an elongated oval with a heavy aircylinder extending down from it a steel drill fits into the end of the cylinder and when the air is cut in that drill begins to vibrate and bounce about umpteen times a second its not the only thing that vibrates either as you may have noticed hanging onto that jackhammer is like holding onto a steel wildcat with st vitus dance it shakes you from your shoesoles to your eyeballs and little chips of rock sting your hide like birdshot and i guess god must have his ears plugged to the noise because he sure wouldnt put up with it if he could hear it on pavement jobs the jackhammer work is only a few minutes at a time on the pipeline its almost steady when you run out of rock you move right ahead until you find some more and if you dont move real fast if that jackhammer stops popping and rattling for more than a minute or two youve got highpressure on your tail two strawbosses ran a check on us that afternoon one of depews men also came by to check our time and note my change of jobs then a little after four in the afternoon higby drove up my partner and i had been taking fifteenminute runs on the hammer it was my turn to rest and i was sitting on the ditch fill when higby arrived he gave me a sharp look started to say something i guess then figured out the situation that i wasnt just loafing and came over and sat down by me hows it going tommy i shook my head shrugged howd you like to run a hammer steady i laughed still not saying anything higby grinned sourly then made his voice persuasive you run a nice hammer tommy and its a lot safer than powder you just check back over your memory and tell me if you ever saw an old powder monkey i said id never seen any old jackhammer men either then i looked at him frowning struck by the strangeness of his urging a change of jobs on me i work with four trey i said that was the understanding when i hired on i help on powder with him and i deal blackjack for him as soon as thats still the understanding as long as you cut the stuff and four trey wants you i had the impression however that you didnt care too much about shooting powder i like it all right i said i like it just fine now unless four treys got some complaints i imagine hed tell us both if he had higby shook his head but im sure hed be willing to change helpers if i asked him to and thered be no trouble about finding him one theres always someone willing to shoot powder someone with so little imagination that he cant picture himself getting killed or maimed or who actually wants to get killed you find a lot of those too around the big labor camps four treys got plenty of imagination i said he sure as hell doesnt want to get killed either and neither do i id like to see you stay on jackhammer tommy you could make a lot of overtime yeah i said and who can take it its good for a man keeps him out of trouble a man puts in a long day on a jackhammer and he doesnt want anything but bed i said id been keeping out of trouble long before i ever fitted hands to a jackhammer and i figured i still knew the secret he nodded and stood up dusting the seat of his pants i got up too since it was about time to go back to work kind of wondering about his mention of keeping out of trouble it might mean that hed somehow found out about carol but i didnt see how he could have certainly four trey would never never have butted into my affairs by asking him to talk to me i went back to work deciding that it was just a generality tossed off during a conversation hed stopped for a breather and used the time to make a hard sell on jackhammers he needed operators badly so hed pulled out all the stops getting a lot more personal than a pipeline boss ordinarily would have he spoke to the other men briefly about what i couldnt hear because of the noise of my hammer then he started walking up the line route stopping every now and then to make a little marker of piledup rock he made approximately twenty of them in the space of about five hundred yards then came back to his pickup and drove off toward camp those markers were places where we had work to do there appeared to be enough of them to keep us busy through noon tomorrow if not longer i mentioned this to my partner when it came his turn on the hammer and he gave me a sore look lay off pal i aint in the mood for kidding kidding what are you talking about the big boy didnt tell you huh he shook his head grimly we do that tonight every damned bit of it before we button up the day tonight but but dammit to hell cant do it hmmm just aint up to it well dont bother to tell the man because i already done it and he just didnt believe me at all he said i must mean that i wanted to dragup my time and if i didnt mean that id better get hot on this hammer gee i said i was just going to ask if i couldnt work over he grinned tiredly spat dust from his mouth and scoured his hands against his pants i turned the hammer over to him and he gave it a boost with his knee brought the drill down on a patch of rock and cut in the air it began to shake rattle and roar he bore down on it arms stiff and it whined and clattered and tried to jump away from him his teeth clenched with the effort to hold on and his whole body jerked and vibrated i moved back away from the noise and dropped down on the fill i began to massage my legs and arms groaning when i hit a knotted muscle and wondering what carol would think when i didnt show up i figured that shed probably be pretty upset about it that shed maybe think i was sore and wasnt coming back i looked up the line at the work that remained to be done and i decided that we might get through in time for me to pay her a quick call a doggone quick one just long enough to say hello and let her know i wasnt sore because i sure wasnt up to or interested in anything else tonight like higby had said all you wanted after a hard day on the hammer was bed just a bed with no one in it to crowd you at five oclock a kitchen flunky in a company pickup brought supper to us it was packed into fivegallon lard cans one for coffee another for beef chicken and ham another for breadandbutter cookies and doughnuts and the remaining two for potatoes and mixed vegetables we ate all we could hold and put a few doughnuts and cookies in our pockets the flunky dumped everything that was left over onto the prairie then drove back down the line toward camp we had a cigarette or two makins since none of us had any readyrolleds the we matched for turns on the hammers stepped up the speed of the generator and went back to work it was almost ten oclock by the time we had finished and long jagged streaks of lightning were crackling across the black sky seeming to rip it apart like a curtain then to sew it back up with thunder i rode in the seat with higby going into camp and he kept sticking his head out the window feeling for rain he looked as tired as i felt and he seemed to get older with each crack of lightning a hard rain one that continued through tomorrow would stop work on the line even a hard nights rain would set the job back but for only a few hours with any kind of luck the blazing sun and the constant wind dried things up fast you could toss a dipper of water on the ground and it would evaporate almost before it landed higby swore under his breath sidled a worried glance at me well tommy what do you think nothing to it i shrugged nothing more than a spring shower he said he sure as hell hoped i was right and i lied that id bet money on it i figured that he already knew that only a fool or a stranger prophesies the weather in west texas and there was no point in reminding him of it camp was dark except for the waterbarrel lantern and the lantern in the truckparking area higby brought the pickup to a stop spoke to me quietly as i started to climb out a hell of a hard day huh tommy i imagine you cant wait to hit the sack well i hesitated if theres something you want to talk to me about mr higby no no beds the best place for you i guess you know ill want you on the hammers again tomorrow i figured i said but that wraps it up right im down for powder monkeys helper and ill be back to it after tomorrow stay on the hammers tommy he said softly youll be glad you did later stay there and make your overtime and keep out of trouble and and that was as far as he got because i was about as exhausted as a man can get and every nerve of my body was raw and that second mention of keeping out of trouble well it was too damned much i was in plenty of trouble right then and id got it all from being put on those lousy hammers look i exploded what the hell is this mr higby what does the top man on a big pipeline job care what happens to a working stiff like me why are you bothering with me what am i to you anyway i appreciate your sticking up for me with depew but you dont owe me a thing burwell i did what i had to do what i thought was right and youd better make that mr depew his voice was stony cold it yanked me out of my mad like a skyhook made me realize that i was way way out of line in talking up to him im sorry mr higby i said really sorry if you want me on a hammer i dont youll go back on powder tomorrow morning but youre not going to fire me then he shook his head i laid myself open for backtalk from a punk its my own fault that i mistook him for a man no he cut me off before i could interrupt no im not going to fire you burwell not for this if i did id probably lose four trey along with you and he has friends who might pull out if he did and his friends have friends and so youre safe burwell for now at least im sorry i said miserably i ought to have my tail kicked youre not worth it he opened the door on his side and started to get out ive wasted too much time on you already he gave me a curt nod strode away toward the highpressure tent i got out and went over to the wash bench it would be hard to tell you how i felt shabby cheap crummy all those things and a lot more besides a tinhorn through and through a good man had tried to befriend me and id thrown dirt in his face it was a lowdown thing to do a punk thing and i felt as low as a guy could get i made a pass at washing up i went through the walkway between the tents headed across the prairie toward the place where carol was camped somehow i wasnt very setup about seeing her tonight i was even a little annoyed when i thought of her which was unfair but understandable except for her my touchiness about seeing her i wouldnt have blown up with higby except for her i would still have been aces with four trey instead of having him halfleery of me id considered myself a man a guy whod finally grown up and come to grips with himself id been a man and a little ol gal barely five feet tall had made me forget that i was i didnt know then that the right girl can do that to a man and that its the surest sign that he is one i was too miserable too anxious to push some of my blame on someone else i went stumbling across the pitchdark prairie brooding muttering to myself i caught my toe in a prairiedog hole and fell down and i remained flopped for a moment rehearsing a little speech i intended to make now im telling you girl youre going to straighten up and knock off the nuttiness or its going to be down on the mopepole for you ive had just a big plenty and from now on there was a crash the damnedest one i ever hope to hear a great bayonet of lightning speared down past my head and a plume of white fire leaped up from the ground to meet it there was a blinding flash literally blinding the prairie was suddenly as bright as blazing day i closed my eyes against it i opened them again on a world that was suddenly so dark that i thought i had lost my sight and then it began to rain not drops but streams rivers and lakes and oceans of water it can be a long time between rains in far west texas a year sometimes two years nature doesnt get around to the place often and she has to make up for lost time when she does and she must have had a lot to make up for tonight i couldnt see i could hardly take a deep breath without drowning i started running falling and stumbling at every step i became completely turnedaround losing all track of where carols housecar was or the camp was or i was i started traveling in what i hoped was a circle but i didnt make a very good go of it i guess because it was hours before i reached the line i began following it following it the wrong way at first and ending up at the far end i turned around and started back the other way and then as abruptly as it had begun the rain stopped not another drop fell it simply stopped as suddenly as though a faucet had been closed it was dawn by then when i finally reached camp the sun was creeping up over the horizon it was going to be another scorching hot day which meant nothing at all to me at the moment i was chilled through one side and out the other and i wanted to thaw out at the kitchen range and drink four or five gallons of scalding coffee i headed for it by the quickest route through the entrance to the chow tent and on back to the rear i had my head down hurrying and i almost tripped over the booted leg which swung lazily out in front of me now lets just slow down a little sonny wha i jerked my head up startled whats going on four men were seated at the head of the table a tin bowl of coffee in front of each higby and depew sat on the far side next to the tent wall the man who had stuck out his boot and another man sat on the aisle where i was they might have been in their thirties forties or even their early fifties it was hard to say with their type they had leathery sunseamed faces and their foreheads looked burned beneath the brims of their tiltedback stetsons they were broadshouldered but thinhipped and their booted feet looked preposterously small both wore guns at their hips weapons which somehow fittedin and blended with the lanky bodies like congruent parts of them the man who had first spoken to me took a small notebook from the pocket of his checked shirt he wet his thumb turned a page or two then nodded and raised his eyes again burwell thomas burwell been out all night tom yes i mean yes sir i said uhhah he nodded approvingly sliding a twinklingeyed glance at his companion nice young fella aint he hank got his manners about him reckon he ought to have some hot coffee and breakfast in him straight off dont you no more than fittin drawled the other man know id sure want some if id been out in the rain all night i sure would an thats a fact pete you want to write it down in that little book of yours ill be proud to swear to it i looked from one to the other fear mingling with my weariness a cold lump formed around my heart and i shivered and nervous halfhysterical laughter welled up in my throat petes twinkling eyes narrowed and he spoke regretfully to hank seems to think its funny thomas burwell does reckon maybe he aint such a nice young fella after all aw pshaw now hank protested he just aint got his bearins yet needs his coffee an vittles tget himself organized reckon we ought t feed him an then warn him an by ding i bet he dont do no laughin at all then warn me the lump around my heart grew larger and colder i looked at higby and he bit his lip and looked away i looked at depew noting his expression of smug contentment pete scratched his chin thoughtfully his eyes fixed on a point just above my head he sighed recrossed his boots and nodded to hank seems like you got the right of it pardner the man says so an the books says so an besides which its only decent thomas burwell you are under arrest on suspicion of murderin one albert bud lassen an anything you say may be used against you and what dyou want for breakfast the dragline was parked about four hundred yards out of camp a few hundred yards from the start of the line there was no use for it at this stage of the work and the lay of the land made it difficult to move it about so it had been left there out of the way until it was needed just before the rain started the night guard on the pipeline had heard a loud crash the sound of the dragline bucket dropping hurrying over to investigate he had found buds body the bucket had dropped on him its two halves open virtually cutting him in two as it smashed him into the ground the long sharp steel prongs had gone through his body in a dozen places the guard had notified higby despite the rain higby made it in to town and called the matacora sheriffs office apparently the downpour wasnt a general one and the two deputies had gotten most of the way here before they had had to stop they had come the rest of the way this morning arriving in camp in their big highbacked stearnsknight about an hour before i did uh huh i see pete nodded encouragingly you left camp right after you finished work an went to see your gal so naturally you couldnt been over at that whatchmacallit dragline killin old bud i wouldnt have been killing him anyway i said but that little ol gal said you never come near her last night you was supposed to but you didnt all right i said ive been trying to tell you i was going to see her but oh you was goin to but you didnt which means that you must have been somewheres else wouldnt you say it seemed that way to you hank seems as though hank drawled it plumb does an thats a fact you know how to run one of them uh draglines thomas no well i know how i mean i know the principle of it but ever been arrested thomas ever been tried and convicted well sure i said i bet everyone in camp has at one time or another you know things like drunk and disorderly and vagrancy and well things like that just things like that hah nothin else ill tell you hank said ill bet me a nickel pete that this here young fella is an a and b er id bet a whole nickel an i wouldnt ask for no change thomas you know what a and b is assault and battery i said but dammit thats just another way of saying selfdefense it was in my case anyhow the other guys started it and i finished it mmm what about yesterday morning when you jumped all over ol bud the way i get it he hadnt bothered you none atall well all right i said but said you was goin tkill him didnt you mightve done it right then an there if you hadnt been dragged off of him thats right officer depew interjected and im sure he did kill lassen last night he had the opportunity and the motive and you told me now thomas officer i dont understand your attitude why do you continue to shillyshally and delay when you already told him hank said he already told you didnt he pete maybe i didnt understand him real good pete said mr depew are you sayin that youre absolutely positive beyond the shadow of a doubt that thomas killed bud lassen yes i am positive anyone with half a brain would be well now pete said thats different now were gettin somewhere you got a car mr depew car why yes its back home with my wife but whats the license number pete waited whats your wifes birthday he waited again whats the date of your wedding anniversary another wait you mean you dont know mr depew you mean a plumb positive fella like you thats absolutely positive about things that aint a goddang bit of his business dont even know the license number of his car or when his wife was born or the date he first started diddlin her well now thats plumb surprisin aint it hank amazin hank stared hard at depew fella like that probably wouldnt know which end of his dingus to pee with aint that right mr depew i said aint that right mr depew depew looked from one to the other his face blazing he stumbled to his feet suddenly and almost ran out of the tent higby spoke for the first time gentlemen were going to have to give the men their breakfast here pretty pronto if youd like to move to one of the other tents pete drawled that that wouldnt be necessary got all we need for the present wouldnt you say so hank got all we need here right now a plumb plenty hank agreed an thats a fact thomas you want anything more besides that coffee got anything you want to take with you wwith take with me where he told me where to matacora the county jail got anything you better take it along might be gone quite a spell you sure might thomas hank wagged his head solemnly yes sir you sure as heck might id bet a nickel on it even money an i wouldnt ask for no change the county seat of matacora was actually two towns rather than one there was the very old one built around the courthouse square with its roots in the ranching industry a town of substantial brick and sandstone buildings with sheetmetal awnings extending out over the sidewalks surrounding and abutting this was the new town the one that had sprung up with the discovery of oil the usual boomtown collection of machine shops honkytonks flop houses and whathaveyou plus since the oil money was relatively old here a considerable number of structures which would have looked good even in a large city my cell was in the top of the courthouse tower a kind of cupola perched high above the steep slate roof there were windows on all four sides and i could see every section of town and for miles beyond the distant ranch houses and the oil derricks and the cars and trucks creeping along the roads it was all spread out there below me there were trains too both freight and passenger the first trains id seen in a long time i watched a couple of them making up in the yards then huffing and puffing out of town slowly gathering speed as they rolled out onto the prairie and at last fading away into the brilliant sunlight i watched those trains and when i sat back down on my bunk my eyes were watering so bad i was almost blind i got them cleared finally and rolled myself a cigarette i started thinking again my mind moving around in circles as it tried to latch onto something hopeful bud lassen had been pretty generally detested around the matacora sheriffs office without actually saying so the two deputies whod arrested me had made that clear nonetheless bud had been one of them hed been on their side a cop and a guy who beat up a cop was automatically their enemy you just didnt beat up cops you just didnt threaten to kill them to their way of thinking either of those things was reason enough for bud to have killed me and the only mistake hed made was in not doing it to their way of thinking id proved myself guilty and they saw no reason to try to disprove it id been jailed a little before noon and i saw no one the rest of that day except the elderly turnkey who brought me my meals early the next morning right after breakfast he herded me out of the cell and down to the sheriffs office where i was turned over to a deputy i hadnt seen before the latter gestured lazily waving me toward the door of a small anteroom i went into it and there was four trey whitey hows it going bo he winked at me holding out his hand looks like youre holding your own with em four trey oh gosh four trey i said and then i bit my lip getting ahold of myself hows it with you ill make it as soon as i stop rattling inside ive been riding a supply truck since three this morning ive got to be starting back in about an hour so he jerked his head signalling me to come in close i did so and he lowered his voice youre getting out of here tommy theyre going to let you go huh my heart skipped a beat holy gosh keep your voice down they dont know it yet and youre not supposed to know it so dont let on youll blow it if you do but but i gestured helplessly why i mean how never mind how or why i dont have time to explain just take my word for it that its going to happen all you have to do is keep your mouth shut and wait ill sure do that i said how long will it be four trey not long are you sweating for anything hows the chow i told him that the chow was good but i could use some cigarettes and maybe something to read id ask for pencil and paper if i was going to be here any length of time but ill see that you get everything you need he said cigarettes reading material everything now ive got something else to tell you a couple of things he took a long pull on his cigarette blew smoke from his nostrils do you remember that big bust we went on in dallas when you wound up with the dts im not likely to forget it i said i blew damned near six thousand dollars on it no you didnt tommy you blew around fifteen hundred the heck i did i had almost six grand to begin with and i took fortyfive hundred of it i knew it would get away from you if i didnt so i took it its deposited right here in your name in the first state bank of matacora i stared at him wordlessly my mouth wide open in surprise four trey nodded evenly i was going to tell you after this job was finished i figured youd have enough sense by that time if you were ever going to have enough to know how to use it but in view of whats happened my gosh i said i i just cant believe it four trey me with a whole fortyfive hundred dollars and and i hardly know what to say four trey said not to say anything just to get the hell away from the kind of life i was leading and go to college like id always talked about doing im going to count on your doing that tommy for your sake i hope im not mistaken well i said kind of looking away from him its certainly a lot of money i sure cant claim that i dont have the money for college and and im sure obliged to you i said still not looking at him here i thought i was flat broke and all the time i dont do it tommy im warning you dont do it uh do what i said you have no job on the line im through with you and so is higby theres nothing for you out here any more and when i say nothing im including that little whore youve been seeing shes not a whore i dont care how it looks what anyone says shes not a she isnt huh he chuckled grimly then i wonder why almost a dozen welders visited her after chow last night i wonder why they claimed she was the best they ever had i gulped feeling like id received a hard kick in the stomach feeling all the blood drain out of my face welders they were all wellheeled carrying heavy they wouldnt have needed to wait until payday tommy there was a pitying note in four treys voice im sorry tommy i wish i hadnt had to tell you that thats all right i said what the hell anyway thats it what the hell its hard for you to believe now but this is the best thing that could have happened to you youll meet some nice girl later on and do you mind i said do you mind if we just dont talk about it for gods sake why do you have to keep talking about it i mean if thats the way it is why why sure four trey said softly whatever you say kid we didnt talk much after that i promised to write him after i was settled and he promised to write me he said maybe hed come to see me after the job was buttoned up and i said id count on it then the deputy opened the door and said that time was up so four trey and i shook hands and i went back to my cell for a time i felt about as lousy as a man can feel even the fact that i was getting out of jail didnt cheer me up after what four trey had told me about carol i didnt think i could ever feel good again i had the blues so bad that i didnt even glance at the package of magazines and stuff that the turnkey tossed through the bars and then right when i was at my glummest i suddenly laughed out loud i laughed and i got mad so sore that if four trey had been there right then i think i would have socked him because hed lied about carol all i had to do was think about it a while and i knew he had lied those welders wouldnt be lining up for any pipeline whore most of them had wives and families and theyd just come from those wives and families theyd have to be a hell of a lot harder up than they were now before they went for a woman and when they did it wouldnt be the kind youd find out here they had too much at stake too much to lose by fouling themselves up well sure there might be one nut in the group theres always someone who just doesnt know when hes well off but a dozen never four trey had laid it on a little too thick i bunked in early after supper the light being too poor for reading or writing for that matter my mind was too full of plans for carol and me and that fortyfive hundred dollars to think about anything else so i just lay there in the semidarkness listening to the distant sounds from the street smoking and daydreaming if a guy can daydream at night and putting all sorts of schemes together four trey hadnt said just when they were setting me free but i figured that it would just about have to be by tomorrow night or at the very latest by breakfast the next morning i would have been in custody seventytwo hours by then which was as long as i could be held on suspicion theyd have to either charge me with murder or release me and since they apparently didnt have a case or they had a more likely suspect well anyway i was getting out four trey wouldnt have kidded me about that he couldnt tell me exactly when probably because he knew how the law would feel about a character who backtalked and roughedup a cop he knew theyd give me a hard time as long as they could get away with it but i was getting out i fell asleep at last dreaming about carol and going to college and god knows whatall smiling when i thought of how surprised shed be when i showed her the fortyfive hundred and told her to start moving because we were going to get longgone from pipeline camps and we were going to stay gone i had a hell of a good sleep that night most of the night that is the one time i didnt came around three in the morning when four treys sardonic face suddenly loomed up before me a bitter contemptuous face with eyes as cold as ice i squirmed under their stare silently mumbling a question why was he looking at me like that and his reply came to me as clearly as if he had been real right there in the cell with me instead of a dream i know shes not a whore now give me the rest of it the rest you heard me you lousy punk the real reason youre coming back i said what the hell are you talking about then i said ouch because i had sat up abruptly bumping my head on the bunk above me i rubbed my skull drowsily wondering what had awakened me the dream gone from my mind for the moment then i snuggled back under the covers and went to sleep and i was still sleeping when the turnkey called me for breakfast about an hour after breakfast he took me to a shower room and i had a bath and a shave while he looked on after that i was taken before a judge and charged with firstdegree murder like most public officials in that area the county attorney held his job as a sideline he was a rich man rich from cattle and oil and most of his time was spent taking care of his wealth his being county attorney was just a gesture at public service or civic responsibility or some such thing whatever a man calls it when he takes the credit for something that others do for him his next step up probably would be some kind of state office then maybe the governors chair or congress right now the duties of his office were being carried out by a couple of young deputies and he was pretty irritated with me for insisting on seeing him what the hells eating on you burwell the boys made a clearcut case against you so naturally you were booked theres nothing i can do about it but the case isnt clearcut it could easily have been an accident we dont think so frankly id have killed the sonofabitch myself if hed hung around this town much longer caught him kicking a horse one time but the way you went about it well thats bad if youd killed him in a fair fight id have stood in line to shake your hand but i didnt kill him wed made up our differences mmm he glanced at a paper on his desk weve got a witness who swears you didnt make up with him fella named wingy warfield he claims lassen offered to shake hands with you and you refused but wingys a loudmouth hell say anything to hear himself talk what actually happened was was yes he squinted at me thoughtfully seemingly caught by something in my manner whats the matter with you burwell matter i said what do you mean weve got a bigplenty of reason to hold you even i know that much and i dont know a goddamned thing about evidence but you act like you were absolutely sure of being freed he waited continuing to squint at me someone promise you something boy you just tell me who it was and ill skin the ass right off of em well of course i had been sure of getting out but i couldnt say so in view of four treys warning so i mumbled around a little bit saying that naturally i didnt think they could hold an innocent man and i was innocent by gosh and he stopped staring at me and began to fidget again for gods sake boy he suddenly cut in on me thats the way it is so thats the way it is got yourself a lawyer yet i think so i said i think there was a lawyer when i went before the judge this morning but oh that shitass i mean a real lawyer he glanced at his watch then rose abruptly rocking in his boots well no hurry about it i guess you dont come to trial for almost seven weeks yet he rammed a ranchstyle hat down on his head and started around the desk i stood up too and he dropped an arm around my shoulders and walked me to the door with him now tell me son he said pausing on the threshold and turning me around to face him did you kill that sonofabitch or not no sir i said i certainly did not kill him real sure about that now youre not lyin to me im sure i said im not lying his eyes bored into mine seeming to look right through me and out the other side at last he sighed and scowled rubbing his face with a knottylooking hand too goddamned bad he grumbled if you were guilty you could plead to seconddegree or manslaughter id certainly agree to it did i tell you i saw him kick a horse one time yes sir i said i believe you mentioned something about it but of course if youre actually innocent he shook his head scowling then brightened a little well you just get yourself a good lawyer ill help you if need be a good man ought to be able to beat the pants off of these boys of mine i said i sure hoped he was right then despite the jam i was in i laughed out loud i just couldnt help myself he gave me a startled look kind of offended you know then he laughed too giving me such a hard clap on the back that i was almost knocked from my feet thats what i like to hear he boomed show me something that a good laugh or a stiff drink wont cure and ill put in with you what the hell anyway whats the use crying when you can laugh yes sir i said whats the use youve got money in the bank right a nice little stake so all right then even if youre convicted youve got no problem just flash a little of the long green in front of the parkers and theyll have you home ahead of the jury i said yes sir again and he gave me another clap on the back and told me to keep my dauber up then he hurried off somewhere on his own private business i suppose and i went back to my cell years later i told a prospective publisher about that county attorney and some of the other people id bumped into in the texas of those days and long before id finished talking he was shaking his head people didnt act like that he flatly assured me there were no such people thats what the man said and i didnt try to talk him out of his ignorance but he couldnt have been wronger there were such people a big plenty of em quite a few of them made the history books and at least two of them bud and sis parker became governors of the state they were brother and sister bud and sis ignorant and lowdown crooked they had a homespun quality and a folksy gift of gab which got the vote every time bud was governor first when he got impeached sis parker ran for his job and she went into office on a landslide the two of them ran the statehouse together the joke was that they worked shifts one of them selling pardons while the other was offduty it wasnt quite that bad of course but no one did time in texas if he had a few thousand dollars for the parkers some criminals supposedly bought pardons before they pulled a job charging it off as business expense well that was the way things were in those days and the prospect of buying a pardon after being convicted didnt cheer me up any at the very best id be in jail for weeks to come and when i thought of what would be happening to carol during those weeks i couldnt eat lunch or supper just sipping a little coffee and almost gagging on it i smoked three packages of cigarettes lighting one as fast as i finished another fretting and worrying and wondering what the hell had gone wrong four trey had been so sure that they were going to free me yet how could he have been what could he have known that they didnt know here why couldnt he have told them right then and gotten me out immediately the more i thought about it the more confused i became my head began to ache like it was going to split and i knew i was going to be in a bad way if i didnt put my mind on something else but knowing it was a lot easier than doing it it was no good trying to read id go through a dozen pages without having the slightest idea of what they were about i began to pace the floor back and forth back wall to door side wall to bunk i stopped finally my legs weak from all the turning and twisting stood leaning against the wall with my eyes closed and the wind pouring over my face like water it felt good the wind it was something i knew a familiar friendly thing the steady texas wind which had gone with me wherever i had gone and it brought back memories of all those places mccamey and rigging highline towers my pants so stiff from alkali water that they could stand by themselves a casingcrew out of the town of chalk and seeing a guys head pinched off when a line buckled and looped a derrickdismantling job in the field west of big springs swinging from the top of a one hundred and twenty foot rig and knocking out the crossbracing until it jigged like a drunken dancer a honkytonk in four sands and a man who sat at the same table every day a man with snowy white hair and an obscenely youthful face a face like a dirty picture he spoke to no one he hardly moved except to raise his cheese glass of whitecorn whiskey or his jelly glass of chocbeer chaser he simply sat there staring down at the floor and listening to the wind it seemed like listening to the wind and never quite hearing what he was listening for i sat back down in my bunk i picked up paper and pencil and began to write by the time i had finished my headache was gone and i was able to sleep which was all that i really wanted what i wrote wasnt important from any angle and i balled it up and threw it on the floor but it went something like this a while ago as i sat here counting the cracks in the floor trying to blot out the future to forget all that happened before i heard a baby crying and i saw a face id known but the kid was dead and the face and head were crying there alone wailing in infinite sorrow sucking its finger tips till nothing was left but the marrow and the feebly gnawing lips the devil and a bearded saint peeked through the door at me the devil had a smoky taint the saint a golden key the devil laughed and he said to him i keep all whom i take and he bound me there to that very chair with a tenfoot rattlesnake but maybe its the wind kid yeah maybe its the wind kid that aching hungry breeze that blows all hell loose through the lid of one contagious sneeze or it could be the womans scream when the club came down on her back or the starving hounds on the grassy mounds where the dead fight off their attack or the gasps for breath as the rope brings death while mobfire turns bodies black or the mad men the bad men the sad and the glad men who bring rape and murder and sack where the bombs explode and the shells erode where sinnedagainst have sinned it was midmorning when i awakened i lay with my eyes halfclosed for a time letting the sunlight seep gradually under the lids putting the day off as long as possible at last i yawned stretched and looked around then suddenly sat up with a start the cell door stood open a man in boots and a blue serge suit was leaning against the wall reading the poem id written the night before he went on reading giving me a halfnod without looking up when he had finally finished he shook his head wryly and tossed the paper back to the floor he shouldnt have done that no one should ever treat a writers work disrespectfully if he does it all right but never do it yourself hell like you a lot better if you spit in his face how are you burwell he said darrows the name ben darrow im the sheriff here im all right i said and i know who you are ive heard quite a bit about you sheriff i turned around to the sink and began to wash up he grinned at me in the mirror blue eyes glinting in his tanned face a goodhumored intelligentlooking man in his thirties whom i might have liked under different circumstances i stared back at him coldly and he chuckled and winked at me good news burwell youve been cleared wha i whirled around my heart doing a big flipflop you you really mean that youre not just kidding me now of course im not the boys had the evidence to let you go last night but i was out of town and they decided to play it cute god knows why he shook his head frowning since they certainly didnt have any love for lassen but i can promise theyll never do it again but i have been cleared i insisted theres no doubt about that absolutely none three witnesses swear that lassen was fooling around the dragline when the bucket dropped on him he must have triggered something i suppose or why the hell didnt they say something sooner why dont a lot of people because theyre afraid of getting involved or they were doing something that they shouldnt have these three birds for example had stolen some jamaica ginger out of the cook tent and were tying on a drunk that sounded reasonable but it left some pretty big questions in my mind like how had four trey known about the three men and why had he wanted me to keep quiet about them but this was hardly the time or the place to raise those questions well burwell he gestured toward the door youve missed breakfast come on and ill buy you some thanks i said but ill buy my own i put on my hat and picked up my bindle darrow frowned laughed uncertainly oh come on now why so huffy im sorry you were held longer than you should have been but i get my own jobs i said i spend my own money now goodbye and give my regards to that zillionaire daddyinlaw of yours i went on through the door and started down the steps abruptly i turned around and went back to him im sorry i said you did something that made me sore but im sure it wasnt deliberate anyway i had no right to say what i did he nodded evenly his voice little more than a cold whisper you had no right and i usually answer talk hike that in a different way but no one gets swung on in this jail unless he swings first and im not about to break my own rules so let me just set you straight on something dont i said you dont need but he did need to id hit him in the touchiest spot a man has and hed been hit there plenty of times before and he just couldnt let it go im a graduate lawyer burwell im also a police academy graduate this is one of the richest counties in the state and they can afford the very best sheriff in the state and thats how i got my job because i was the best and they were willing to pay for it i was sheriff before i was married burwell before get me and the first time my fatherinlaw offers me a nickel will be the last time he broke off breathing heavily i repeated that i was sorry and he gestured curtly toward the steps i started down them and after a moment i heard him following me we went down them together neither of us saying anything until we were on the walk outside the courthouse then he tapped me on the arm and pointed to a restaurant across the street that look all right to you burwell he said quietly i eat there a lot whatever you say i said youre buying and i guess it was the right thing to say because the grin came back to his face as we started across the street i had a big breakfast bacon and eggs and hot cakes he settled for coffee taking a thoughtful sip of it as we faced each other across the table you said id made you angry burwell mind telling me how i told him admitting that id been foolish to take offense he agreed that i had been particularly after my temper had landed me in jail as a murder suspect on the other hand he went on im kind of glad in a way that you did blow up anyone that wasnt absolutely on the level wouldnt have done it criminals cant afford to be touchy not in front of cops at least theyre too much on the defensive to be offensive well i hesitated buttering a forkload of hot cake if thats a compliment i dont know how to take it he shrugged dismissing the matter i understand that youve come into quite a little money over four thousand dollars right thats right then you wont be going back to the pipeline you wouldnt in any case i understand since they dont want you any longer ive been cleared i said shortly im a good allaround man and im entitled to a job youve got a bad record burwell twentyone years old and youve got a record as long as my arm yes he held up his hand i know the good side of it too about your schooling and all but the best man in the world can go wrong in a bad environment and the pipeline is a bad one its been a long time since youve been in anything but bad ones now why not give yourself a break i said i appreciated his advice and id give it a lot of thought he shook his head irritably i dont get you burwell is it the girl is she the reason youre bound and determined to throw your life away im not throwing it away i said and i pushed back my plate that was a fine breakfast sheriff im obliged to you outside the restaurant i started to say goodbye but he didnt give up that easily he sort of guided me down the street making talk as we walked along directing my attention toward the bank where my money was and pausing before the windows of a couple of mens stores more or less forcing me to look at the array of clothes inside city clothes then he moved me on until we were within view of the railroad station there it is burwell tom he said theres a train east at four oclock i want you to be on it i asked if he was floating me out of the county he hesitated then shook his head like a man who found it hard to do i wish it could be but ive never believed in enforcing the law by breaking it so no its not an order but its the best damned advice you ever had in your life tom the very damned best and im going to take it i said but theres something ive got to do first you mean ask the girl to go with you he sighed gave me an exasperated looknow you know better than that if she was looking for a decent life she wouldnt be where she is i know better i said anyway i have to ask her he stared at me wearily started to say something then shrugged and glanced at his watch well he said i did my best but i guess theres no way of keeping a rat out of a hole he turned and started back up the street i called after him that hed see id be just fine and he could count on it he answered me without looking around not with words but a laugh the ugliest most dismal laugh id ever heard the stagecoach left matacora a little after two in the afternoon and we were almost four hours traveling the eightyfive miles the driver let me out in front of the greeks then swung the big hudson around in the dusky darkness and headed south toward fort stockton id got myself dolled up in matacora new khakis and underclothes and everything the barber had to sell but that made no difference to the greek he met me at the door demanding money before hed let me sit down then watched me while i ate to make sure i didnt steal anything the food tasted lousy how could it taste any other way i thought back on my talk with darrow and for a moment i almost wished id taken his advice because id suddenly had enough of myself as i was id had it with tommy burwell hobo junglebird working stiff gambler drunk and whathaveyou i couldnt stand him any more and the only way of getting away from him was to get him to hell away from here all the clothes and barbers in the world wouldnt change anything as long as i lived as i did nothing would help but a completely new life the greek tossed my change back at me without a word of thanks just threw it at me so that i had to do some wild grabbing to keep it from going on the floor any other time i might have cussed him out or jumped him but tonight i merely smiled at him and dropped a penny tip on the counter it struck me in the back as i went out the door but i kept right on going the way i was determined to stay out of trouble he could have kicked me in the pants and id probably have kissed his foot although they were some five miles away i could see the lights of camp as i started out of town i headed toward them following the truck ruts my heavy shoes trampling the wiry grass with the sound of secret whispering a stingy moon climbed up out of a distant stand of blackjack and rose slowly into the sky like a saggedinthemiddle candle the night wind bustled across the prairie and the first small stars flickered and winked as though about to blow out brave with darkness a coyote howled eerily a chorus of dogwolves began to bark sounding for all the world like they were scolding someone four trey had solemnly assured me one time that that was exactly what they were doing they were scolding the moon because their butts were built so close to the ground i went along with the gag and asked him why the moon the moon couldnt do anything about it and he said exactly that was the whole point he fell asleep about then the bottle being empty and there was nothing more said on the subject thinking back on it years later it dawned on me that thered been nothing more to say hed said it all and what hed said was pretty profound i stopped walking to take a breather coughing and spitting the dust from my mouth the spittle had hardly hit the ground before it was swarming with black beetles tumblebugs which rolled it into balls dust and all and rolled the balls away to their almost invisible nestholes in the grass tumblebugs are scavengers of the prairies keeping them clean by ballingup and disposing of anything in the way of waste matter you find a lot of them where there are cattle and horses in this particular area i figured they probably didnt have things too good what with nothing but men and machines around industrialization was playing hell with their business a situation id written a nutty piece of doggerel about when i should have been using my time for something better a tumblebug all ragged and black stumbled along with some dung on his back hed worked all the day and half the night making his ball compact and tight for with automobiles it was getting harder to fill the needs of the family larder now the path on which he plied his trade some campers there a john had made poor bug now blind with perspiration stumbled into the excavation he blew his nose and cleared his eyes and looked around in glad surprise surely said he i am dreaming all around abundance steaming in my most modest estimation heres food enough to feed a nation he well ill leave it at that it gets kind of dirty from then on i went on walking until i was within a couple hundred yards of camp veering off to the right there i aimed myself toward the slight dip in the land where carols housecar was parked it took me about twenty minutes to get to it her campsite that is i stopped on the rim above it looking down into the little hollow almost calling out to her before i saw that she wasnt there it was the right place i couldnt be mistaken about that but the housecar was gone for a moment i didnt know what to think hell i couldnt think at all the way i felt then it came to me that she might have moved to higher ground on account of that heavy rain and breathing easy again i started looking for her the night wasnt bright enough to see far or well if you didnt have a pretty good idea of where something might be you could come within a hundred yards of it and miss it carol of course had to be parked within a fairly limited area so i marked it out in my mind and began to search it moving ahead for fifty yards or so turning off at a sharp angle for a few hundred yards moving ahead again and then angling back for another few hundred yards crossing and crisscrossing id done a lot of walking without moving very far from her original campsite when i heard a car despite the fact that even small sounds carry far on the prairie i almost didnt hear it it was moving so quietly the softly powerful purring of its motor blending and all but losing itself in the soughing of the wind id never heard a car run like that one its lights were off in virtual silence it rolled across the uneven land swaying but never jolting smoothly smoothing out the hillocks and hummocks a dark shadow blowing through the night then it slid down into that little dip in the land and disappeared there was absolute silence for a moment a moment in which i wasnt sure that i hadnt been dreaming it ended abruptly with the sound of doors opening and voices carols and others mens voices there were three of them three men and they didnt linger with her i was running forward thinking you know that carol might need help although she hadnt sounded like it when the three suddenly came up out of the hollow moving fast and walking swiftly away in the darkness ducked behind a bush i tried to get a good look at them but i didnt have much luck at it they were about middling weight and height they had beards they were roughly dressed in other words they might be any three of half the men on the line and of course they were working on the line theyd headed toward camp where else would they go out here and if they were in camp they had to be working i stayed hidden behind the bush for several minutes making sure that they werent coming back then i went down to where the car was it was carols housecar all right i got inside and started it it sounded like hell i turned off the motor and got out of the car carol ran up and angrily snatched the keys from my hand well smarty she said what do you have to say for yourself now i didnt know what to say the car had run like any old car might have choking and missing as bad as any id ever heard well it didnt run that way a while ago i said but i was no longer so sure of myself i know it didnt and no one can tell me it did oh you she stamped her foot if you knew anything you wouldnt have come back here you didnt have to doggone it that friend of yours mr whiteside he told me hed turned a lot of money over to you money hed been saving for you and you could have four trey how come you were seeing four trey i said now dont you try to make something out of that tommy burwell he well he knew about us and he was afraid id be worried so naturally what about those three guys tonight were they afraid youd be worried about me too she looked at me lips together tightly i dont have to answer your questions mr burwell just who do you think you are anyway dont you bet any money that you dont have to answer i said because im the guy youre just as good as married to and the guy youre going to be married to so just dont you give me any argument her eyes shifted lowered she kicked at a pebble you you havent kissed me tommy i havent seen you for a long long time and you havent even kissed me what about those three guys will you kiss me if i tell you well uh yeah sure i will i said i mean and hug me real nice mmm she edged closer to me her voice a teasing littlegirl whisper an an after youve hugged an kissed me real good will you her arms went around me pulling my head down to hers so that she could whisper the last words into my ear will you tommy just for a little while well it wasnt any little while more than an hour passed before we came back out of the housecar plenty of time for her to think up a good explanation for the three men if she had needed time to think of one it was so plausible that i doubted that she did shed had to drive into town for supplies and water the three men had been loafing around the general store one of them had a couple of bucks it seemed and the others had come along to help him blow it which added up to a long walk for practically nothing but at least broke the monotony of camp anyway theyd helped carol load her supplies and fill her water barrel so she could hardly refuse when they asked for a ride back to camp it was safe enough dont you think so tommy i mean the storekeeper saw us leaving together he knew who they were and if anything happened to me why were you driving with your lights off they just went out one of the men thought id probably jolted a wire loose she put her arms around me murmured meekly against my chest thats the truth tommy you just try them and see if they come on i didnt see any point to that not after my experience in testing the cars motor tommy she said you shouldnt have come back here you just shouldnt have darling i thought my heart would break when i thought you werent coming back but but her voice was suddenly firm leave tommy right tonight dont go over to camp just go right back to town and keep going is that what you want me to do its what you should do honey what you have to do mr whiteside made me see that the longer you delay the harder it will become youve been in a lot of trouble already and if you get in any more all right i said all right ill leave you you will i will but youve got to leave with me bbut but i cant darling not right away ill tell you what she gave me a brave bright smile you go ahead first get a place for us and get started in school and and everything and then ill join you how will that be hmm okay honey i said no it sure as heck wasnt okay shed either go with me tonight or neither one of us would go ill tell you something girlie i said you may have a big lineup of guys over here on payday but im goin to be right at the head of it and the first bo that tries to climb into that truck with you is goin to get fanned with a forgy stick i was about as steamed up as a man can get and if shed said one word back to me id have done a little fanning right then and there on the seat of her pants that is and it wouldnt have cooled em off any if you know what i mean but she didnt talk back she looked up at me hesitantly seemingly on the point of speaking then took a quick look around as though to make sure that no one was listening tommy she said softly very very softly there wont be any lineup over here on payday no one will be over here but me now that makes a lot of sense i said six hundred men with fourteen days pay in their pocket and there wont be wont be i said wont be what well i waited frowning theres six hundred men on the line nothing can change that and theyll have two weeks made in another sixseven days so so wait a minute i said are you telling me that they wont get paid sshh she shot a terrified glance into the darkness no im not telling you anything i havent told you anything she started to back away from me her face very white in the night i grabbed her by the shoulders and she tore out of my grasp leave tommy go away you hear but but ill follow you later i swear i will ill write you general delivery in fort worth or dallas or but youve got to leave now please honey please no i said im staying but you cant you just cant i told her shed darned sure see if i couldnt whenever i left shed be going right along with me she pleaded with me a little longer and then she called me a darned old stubborn fool and said i could do whatever i doggoned pleased but id better not come near her again i dont like you tommy burwell i never did like you youre just as mean and hateful as you can be and i wouldnt go to a dogfight with you an an you ever come near me again ill just slap you good ill look forward to it i said see you tomorrow night i turned and walked away from her she ran after me a few steps scolding and pleading and finally crying but i kept right on heading for camp not daring to turn around for fear id weaken and give in to her and threefour minutes later i heard the slam of the housecar doors as she locked herself in for the night there was a kind of grim finality about it a dontforgetiwarnedyou sound it slowed me down for a moment forced me to think of what i might be getting myself into if i hadnt talkedup so big to her and if i hadnt been a chronic hardhead i just might have done what shed begged me to do but i had and i was so i didnt instead i went right on into camp a light was burning in the highpressure tent and i could see a shadow moving against the wall otherwise everyone appeared to be bedded down or everyone that is but wingy warfield he was out fooling around the wash benches trying to find something wrong i figured so he could bellow about it i remembered how hed knocked me to the law making it look like i had a deathgrudge against bud lassen just because i hadnt shaken hands with him a real nice guy wingy was risking my neck just for the fun of hearing himself loudmouth apparently he remembered too and he naturally thought id be sore because he was sure one nervous camp boss as i came up to him i put a big smile on my face and slapped him on the back how are you wingy my friend i said hows it goin old pal hhow friend he said ppal you know it i said you cant fool me wingy the law told me all the nice things you said about me why ill bet id be in jail yet if it wasnt for you i squeezed a fivedollar bill into his hand told him hed just have to take it or id be sore after all hed saved my life and friends were supposed to help each other wwell well jesus tommy he let out a long deep breath somehow managing to stick out his chest and look cocky by god thats damned white of you boy aint nothin like a real friend i always say an any time you need anything you just tell ol wingy warfield thats my pal i gave him another slap on the back by the way pal some guys came in from town about an hour and a half two hours ago three guys with beards i wonder if you happened to you mean the guys that witnessed for you he cut in on me those three wit what i said you know the guys that cleared you the three that saw bud lassen get hisself killed and the three that had been with carol yes i said those are the ones im talking about do you know what tents theyre in he said o course he knew there was damned little that went on in camp that wingy warfield didnt know longdens in number three tent biggers in four and goss is in seven i reckon theyre all asleep by now but burwell it was higby he came striding toward me jaw set swinging a pick handle in his hand wingy warfield took a quick look at him then at me and scooted away from his ol pal tommy burwell just as fast as his big flat feet could take him i lighted a cigarette casually flipping the match away as higby strode up yeah i said want something you were told not to come back here burwell now lets see you make tracks but ive been cleared i said you know that why cant i have a job weve got no jobs for birds like you youve made nothing but trouble since you hit camp and by god youre not making any more i dont plan on making any trouble i said i never make trouble when i can make money beat it he pointed with the pick handle get your ass longgone or youll be digging this irish toothpick out of it i drawled that i reckoned id wait for payday he jerked the pick handle up like a baseball bat and i repeated the word payday i said softly payday mr higby i hear its going to be something pretty special it was just a guess about all i had to go on was what four trey had said that higby would have no place to go when he wound up here that this would probably be the last big pipeline to be built i was betting a guess against a beating but the guess apparently was a good one he lowered the pick handle wet his lips hesitantly youre not being smart tommy i dont know where you tie in or how but the smartest thing you can do is to drop it and beat it i want a job i said what have you got open tommy for gods sake son yeah i said what did you say you could give me he started to say something else then brought his mouth shut with a snap how does a mormon board suit you punk mormon i gulped tried to make my voice nonchalant fine i said nothing i like better than riding a mormon board you do eh his eyes slitted grimly like pouring dope too why not good he grunted youre going to be doing both they were the lousiest jobs on a pipeline the lousiest jobs in the world the board killed you and the dope cooked you i wondered if i couldnt have squeezed him for something better and i reckoned i probably could have if i hadnt played right into his hands hed used my cockiness against me leading me into acting the tough guy now i couldnt back down without appearing the punk hed called me and it just wasnt in me to do that id bet into a cold deck and i couldnt pull my chips my working partner and i hoisted the mormon board behind the fill from the ditch we slammed it down hard forcing its blade flush with the earth then stiffarmed with all our weight bearing downward on the handles we signaled to the tractor driver on the other side of the ditch he began to back away slowly taking the slack out of the heavy cable between board and tractor when it was tight he poured on the coal and the tractor roared backward and our board went forward slowly dumping our load of fill back into the ditch when it was all in the tractor slacked off on the cable allowing us to reset the board for another bite it was about six feet long that board six feet long and maybe three feet deep put a plow handle at each end of the top of a kitchen table and youll have a pretty good picture of it of course it was built a hell of a lot heavier than any tabletop two men had just about all they could do to lift it but lifting it was the easiest part of the job the real work was in riding it toward the ditch the ditch was treetop deep in some places a man standing at the bottom of it could just barely clear the top with a longhandled muckstick naturally then you were never pushing a light load of fill any bite you took would be a big one seven or eight hundred pounds of rock and earth and it fought you every damned inch of the way it kicked it bucked it tried to ride up over the fill one side would be pushing rock when the other had only loose dirt that allowed one end to whip ahead of the other which meant that it was going to do some tall whipping to whoever was hanging on to it i almost had a shoulder dislocated my first day on the board an hour later the handle kicked back on the guy who was spelling me and he draggedup with two broken ribs thered been no spellers after that first day there just werent enough men whod take the job theyd dragup before theyd take it this was my third day on the job and id had five different sets of partners looking at the one i had now i figured i was just about due to have another one he was stripped to the waist his hair tied back pirate fashion with a bandanna his face was pockmarked from gravelstings and his mouth was caked with dusty blood where the board had jumped up at him there was an ugly heaving to his chest a losing struggle for breath the shuddery shaking of it was something to make you a little sick a mighty shaking yet somehow too weak to break the sweatformed crust of mud which encased his naked torso like a cast take a doss bo i told him its not worth it he turned glazed eyes toward me fixed unseeing eyes huh let go walk away from it i said huh i yelled trying to get through to him the tractordriver took it as a signal the slack went out of the cable and the board began to move forward there was nothing to do but grab the handle and ride it i didnt ride it long not more than a couple of seconds after that i stopped riding and flew i soared up into the air and headed straight down into the ditch i did a twisting jackknife managing to get my feet down and my head up but i couldnt miss the ditch it was a good thing i didnt too because of that mormon board and it would have cut me in two if i hadnt been out of the way i was shook up pretty bad when my feet slammed down on the pipe but i wasnt really hurt so much as shocked someone held a hand down to me and i climbed back up out of the ditch spitting dirt and brushing dust from my eyes i scrambled over the top of the fill and down the other side all work had stopped a cluster of men stood around the sprawled body of my former partner leaning on their shovels and picks while the straw boss bent over him the guy was dead of course hed needed the job too badly to quit and the board had killed him the straw boss straightened turned his head to spurt out a mouthful of tobacco juice he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and brushed the hand against the side of his pants that goddam board he said in a deep southwestern drawl that board done went and yanked the heart clean out of a fella named otto cooper an ill bet me a pretty no one knows a danged thing about him no one did higby drove up wanting to know why the hell the work stoppage and he had nothing on the guy either cooper had hired on late with a bad case of brokes so naturally hed gone straight on the mormon board that was all that was known about him higby drew the straw boss to one side and had a few words with him then he drove on down the line and the straw boss nodded to me bout caught up with the dope gang tommy so were givin the old board a rest just one more little goround for you an me and then well break for lunch i figured i said lets wrap it up and put a button on it he took the dead mans head and i took his feet we lowered him into the ditch spreading him face down against the pipe we climbed back up again latched on to the mormon board and signaled the tractor driver the board moved forward pushing its great load of earth into the ditch burying the body of otto cooper beneath it the straw boss spit tobacco juice down wind he squinted at the straightup sun wiping a hand against the mouth wiping the hand against his pants sonofabitch he drawled shit and three are nine well hes sure as hell got the worlds longest grave aint he hell have company before we make the gulf i said a lot of company aint it the truth now he nodded solemnly aint that the gods truth well screw and two is four and frig makes ten an here comes the chow truck the chow truck parked a ways upline near the largest gang of workmen i took my time about getting to it needing to get the kinks out of my arms and back as much as i needed food and wanting to avoid the jostling id get in a crowd the flunky loaded my tray and filled my coffee bowl i looked around for a good spot to sit finally hunkering down away from everyone on a joint of line pipe it wasnt a prize place to eat as it turned out the dopeboiler was a little too close and its pale thin smoke stung me like a swarm of ants i went on eating trying to tough it out just too tired and sore to move finally though i couldnt take it any longer and i started to get up you just stay there a foot came down on top of mine you just stay right there tommy boy i said what the and tried to lunge upward i couldnt do it of course with my foot pinned down and i banged back down on the pipe now thats better tommy boy not a real good spot to squat it seems like but this wont take long he was one of the bearded men id seen last night he squatted down in front of me his eyes dancing with malicious amusement as he did so the two other men id seen sat down on the pipe with me one on each side squeezed in close im longden the first man pointed a thumb at himself those two gents are bigger and doss and if youdve asked us who we were instead of wingy warfield wedve told you so real polite about answering questions aint we boys thats us the best little old questionanswerers in the world thats good i said trying to keep the shakes out of my voice then i reckon you wont mind telling me why you had to have your arms twisted before you admitted seeing lassen get killed what makes you think they were twisted tommy boy a friend of mine as good as said so i said and i told him how four trey had known they were clearing me before they did it he found out that you were out of camp that night and he threatened to talk if you didnt longden pursed his lips exchanged a glance with the other two a signal and said i had it all wrong now heres the way it was tommy boy heres exactly the way it was in the first place bud lassen didnt just get killed we killed him wha i stared at him you you admit it why not talk never hurt anyone without proof to back it up he chuckled softly being sound of mind and body as the saying is we naturally thought bud was ripe for killin he was a bum who could be trouble and you were building into a nuisance so we figured to kill him and stick you for it we like to do things that way tommy boy plan a killing so it either looks like an accident or points the finger at someone else thats the way doss nodded we made it an accident with nosy ol bones so you had to be chumped for murderin bud right bigger said you got to switch em around you know because too many accidents is as bad as an unsolved murder longden beamed at them like an admiring father good boys arent they good boys tommy well anyway it was carol that twisted our arms not four trey he told her what had happened to you and she did the rest swore she wouldnt go through with some plans we had unless we got you out of the clink he spoke as idly as though he were discussing the weather we were within fifty feet of hundreds of men yet these three these three killers youre going to hold up the payroll i said carol is going to drive the escape car and shell get a nice cut of the loot tommy boy plenty for the two of you to set up housekeeping on thats what you want aint it his brows quirked in cynical amusement me and the boys certainly have no objection do we boys doss said he certainly didnt object and bigger said that he was all for it i added up to an allright guy in his book and a girl just didnt get no better than carol you see tommy boy longden spread his hands expressively were all for you livin happily ever after an so on but right now youre going to have to keep away from her weve got plans to make and work to do and we cant have you hangin around he gave me an amiable tap on the knee by way of emphasis i tried to jerk away from him and the other two held me where i was why why damn you i sputtered what kind of punk do you think i am you think you can just walk up to me and tell me what i can do an what i cant do and make me like it ill see carol whenever i damned well please and huhuh no you wont tommy boy not unless you can see when youre dead big deal and whats carol going to say about you killing me you get tough with me and shell blow the deal on you she might tommy she just might if she knew about it but of course she aint going to no one is like hell i just disappear and no one thinks anything of it now that makes a lot of sense longden said that it sure did didnt it and bigger beamed that i sure caught on fast show me which end of a match to strike and id figure it out in no time doss said that a boy as bright as me probly had to hide under the bed in the morning so that folks could see the sun come up ysee heres the way it is tommy boy longden continued carols begged you to leave threefour people have everyone that gives a dang about you thats the way it is right carol an everyone else has done everything they could to point you away from here an start you to movin but well maybe they did but so you dont show up some fine morning and what do folks think why they just think that tommy burwell finally whistledup the dogs and pissed on the fire and made himself longgone he nodded firmly waited a moment to see if i had anything else to say i did have but i wasnt going to say it to him so he jerked his head at the other two and the three of them got up and walked away together the work whistle blew i carried my tray back to the chow truck and headed for the dope gang ditch pipe receives a protective coating in the factory these days and has for a long time past but in those times the coating was applied at the ditch as with blasting it was the quickest way of doing it and above all the cheapest in a different state with a different kind of economy it would never have been allowed but in texas a state largely dependent on cattle cotton and oil practically anything went cotton required large amounts of cheap backbreaking labor you could no more farm cotton under healthful conditions than you could raise cattle without men who spent endless hours in the saddle in all kinds of weather risking their health and their lives for a pittance growing old when they were young so also with the oil industry and those related to it there were no absolutely safe jobs in the oil fields they ranged from fairly safe to downright hazardous to have made them completely safe would have been too costly it was reasoned and the industry could not be hampered in any way on the contrary the states attitude was fiercely protective texas oil men complained that the standard oil company was unfair competition so for many years standard was barred from the state by law it could operate everywhere else in the world but not in texas anything or anyone who made trouble for texas industry was buying trouble for himself and that included people who did the unhealthy dirty and dangerous jobs of that industry they didnt have to do em did they no one forced them to they knew what they were getting into when they hired out and if they didnt want to risk it they didnt have to take it insurance sure there was insurance but insurance was a big industry too and fully deserving of the states protection you couldnt expect an insurance company to sell policies on workmen in certain kinds of jobs not unless those policies were so restricted and qualified as to make them virtually worthless it would cost too much it would cut profits costs had to be held down profits held up which takes us back to me and the dope gang there were three men in the gang plus a straw boss who checked the pipe after it was doped one man walked on each side of the ditch each holding one end of a hammocklike device this was wrapped one turn around the pipe and held loosely to form a kind of apron underneath the third man me poured the dope into this apron i used a pouring can pretty much like the sprinkling can youd use in your garden but with the spraynozzle removed as i poured the other two men pulled the hammock back and forth in a sawing motion coating the pipe with a thin layer of liquid asphalt the hammock men could keep pretty well out of the way of the fumes i had to stoop right into them they walked forward i had to walk backward to keep out of their way i wore goggles of course i also kept my hat jammed low and my collar turned up and a bandanna tied across my face like a western outlaw but that was all i could do and it wasnt even halfway enough in the time that i poured dope that afternoon plus two days more my face was burned so badly that the skin hung in strips my neck and forehead werent much better off either and i think my eyesight would have been permanently damaged in a very little while longer it was a tough world the far west texas of the twenties you might not live through it and you might not look pretty if you did but people would know you were a man from a mile away at the end of two and a half days the pipe was doped as far as it was welded and higby curtly told me that i could go back to shooting powder if four trey would have me i braced whitey for it all nervous and edgy and on the defensive because he hadnt even spoken to me since id been back he still didnt speak either he just listened then shook his head and turned away without answering i grabbed him and whirled him back around now nnow you listen to me i stammered my voice cracking with fury you just listen to me four trey whiteside im twentyone years old and im a man you keep poking it at me that i am im a man ive got to make my own life and you make me know it but the minute i start to do it you slap me down you i do it for your own good how do you know it is what have you done with your own life that makes you know whats good for me who the hell do you think you are anyway do you think youre god are you god mr four trey whitey he said now listen to me tommy and i asked for how long should i listen how long would he tell me what to do and give a damn whether i did it or not a day an hour a minute you play the father the big brother only when you take a notion to and what happens if i start playing my part thats another story isnt it then you freeze up fast im told to get back where i belong to go my own way and not bother you one minute youre my father and the next you dont know me you i stormed away at him about as near to crying as a man gets i needed a friend a real friend because i was all mixed up over carol and the mess id walked into i was scared and worried and i didnt know what to do or where to turn and he he his face softened he looked down at the ground uneasily guiltily and i think he spoke to me several times before he finally got my attention tommy im sorry tommy you go back on powder with me in the morning well you ought to be sorry i said you an you dont have to take me back on powder if you dont want me im a man and ive got pride an and ive still got half a pint in my bindle and you and i are goin to put it where itll do the most good we did and we made a lot of talk in the course of doing it rather he talked and i mostly listened some people are afraid of caring tommy theyre afraid of letting anyone get too close to them because when they do care they care too much they put all their eggs in one basket as the saying is and when something happens to the basket he shook his head staring off into space it almost kills them tommy it almost killed me when i lost my wife for a long time i wished that it would but instead im sorry i said i shouldnt have talked up to you the way i did yes you should have tommy it made me see something that i hadnt seen before and i needed to see it you cant live another persons life for him if you care for him youve got to do it on his terms for what he is not yours for what you think he should be now in my book you were dead wrong to come back here im convinced of it but i had to four trey i just had to you did he nodded and who am i to act like youre not worth spitting on because you did if youre for someone youre for em come hell or high water if you lose someone you care deeply about well at least you had em for a while youre still way ahead of the game and youve got no call to stop playing you loved someone and they loved you just as each of you was good bad and indifferent the only way to love because you were people not gods and you didnt make demands that it wasnt in the other fellow to meet and you were richer for having loved for even a little while thats about how our conversation ended with both of us understanding things we hadnt understood before and better friends than wed ever been it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him about longden and his two bearded buddies but i didnt want to push things too far just when wed gotten on a solid footing anyway wed have plenty of opportunities to talk now that wed be working together again as it turned out i didnt have to tell him because longden hadnt been kidding when hed warned me to stay away from carol or get killed but thats getting ahead of the story ive gotten a couple days ahead of it in telling about getting square with four trey so lets move back a little back to the end of my first afternoon on the dope gang higby had been driving hard and the line had been moving right along and the job was now almost an hours ride from camp going in that night the guy riding next to me on the flatbed remarked that wed have to be moving camp soon jumping it south maybe twentyfive or thirty miles because the ride was taking too much time i nodded without speaking trying to save my cracked and blistered lips as much as possible i could hardly bear soap and water for washing that night and i sort of groaned with every bite of the hot chow in the long run of course stretching the burned skin was good for it or a lot better anyway then letting it tighten on you like a blistered mask it helped it if you could stand it and after dinner i smeared it good with butter and that helped too the cook watched me sympathetically cursing the goddam capitalists he said hell was too cold for such people and come the revolution theyd all get their butts warmed with a cutting torch so theyd know how it felt to cook a man alive then he threw a thirtypound ham in the garbage and gave me a fourounce bottle of jake to ease me through the night the old crumb boss in my tent hovered around me for a long time wanting to do things for me and letting me know he was sorry finally i pretended to go to sleep and he went to his own bunk and sacked in when everyone else had done the same and the camp was dark i slipped out the back of the tent and headed for town id never felt less like walking five miles in my life but there was no phone short of town and i had to phone sheriff darrow id have walked five thousand miles to help carol and this was the only way i could do it i knew she couldnt have been mixed up in anything before she just wasnt old enough she was only taking part in the payroll robbery because she was forced to but that wouldnt cut any ice with the law if you commit a crime youre a criminal and you cant clear yourself by claiming that you were forced to commit it so the robbery had to be stopped before it started and darrow was the only one who could do it there was a booth phone next to the garage and i called him from there he wasnt at his office late as it was but i managed to reach him at home in the background i could hear a baby crying faintly and a few words of a womans voice complaining about people who were always late for dinner i didnt hear very much of it because there was a sound like a door being closed then an amused chuckle from him as he told me to go ahead i started talking after a minute or so he broke in on me those fellows are teasing you burwell it may be that they dont want you hanging around their sister or their foster sister i should say but the rest is nonsense nonsense i said theyve already killed two people and they threaten to kill me an they havent killed anyone both deaths were accidents the heck they were you you just dont know em sheriff you dont know yes i do burwell he said quietly i know everything there is to know about those men information is a big part of my job and im very good at getting it but in their case i didnt have to they came in and identified themselves the moment they entered my county bbut i stared into the phone wordlessly but dammit theyre the long brothers the long brothers understand ill admit they probably bought their pardons theyve done it before but they claim to be going straight now and they certainly act like they mean to i think theyve proved that by coming in to see me in the beginning and coming forward later to clear you you do huh i laughed shakily the worst killers and crooks in texas and you think i choked up for a moment unable to go on dont you see sheriff they knew youd find out who they were anyway so they played smart and beat you to the punch and they didnt clear me until they had to carol found out what he sighed cutting in on me again you told me burwell you told me i hold no brief for the longs longie thats longden or bigger or doss ive got no use for any of em i dont like what theyre letting a potentially nice girl make of herself but theyre not wanted anywhere now and im not running a sunday school so unless what about that car i said why sheriff if youd just what about it this is a bad part of the world to have a breakdown in a smart person keeps his car in firstclass condition but its more than that its a uh well its a getaway car if ive ever seen one well now of course thats different how many have you seen burwell he waited laughed teasingly i said a few things that werent very nice and he sobered and said he was sorry youve had a bad time burwell when a man goes to the trouble that you have to do the right thing he deserves something better than to be laughed at i was afraid thered be trouble if you went back there the longs are notorious for deadpan kidding even if they didnt indulge in it there was always the chance youd find out who they were and get the wind up because of the girl now if youll take my advice wait i said wait a minute sheriff i just remembered something else did you he stifled a yawn well higby hes in on the robbery why i just dropped a little hint that there was something screwy about payday and burwell his voice was suddenly curt have you been popping off any around camp about this of course not i said why would i do a thing like that because you seem to be about as brainless as a man can get higby has a pipeline to build within a certain amount of time there are enormous penalties to pay for every day he runs over that time and a whopping bonus for every day hes under he had to do the job and he has to do it without a hitch and what kind of men does he have to do it with now look i said i he has to do it with scum burwell thats what they are mostly hoboes bums drunks and jailbirds the scum of the oil fields men who make a career out of finding reasons for not working now just what do you think would happen if some lovesick loudmouth kid hinted that something might happen to their pay well my guess is that he wouldnt have enough men left to build a barn but i didnt say that much to higby i didnt hint that practically anything you said would have given him a jolt you see he knows who the longs are they were hired on at my suggestion hhe knows i said you suggested it why why thats crazy darrow sighed that if i was halfway as smart as i thought i was id see it differently the longs had no honest skill and the pipeline was the countys major employer of unskilled labor by seeing that they were hired on they could not only be kept track of their whereabouts known at all times but helped to earn a living instead of stealing it both the pipeline company and i could rest more comfortably by having them there what we didnt count on was you and that girl falling for each other which naturally was one hell of a big hazard because if she ever got confidential with you a romantic knothead with all his brains in his crotch my face was burning and not just from the dope either i said all right maybe i was a knothead but he could do one thing at least without upsetting anyones applecart just move in and take carol away from there sheriff if youll do that i wont im not in the business of rousting whores if i were i couldnt legally do anything until she actually started turning tricks he made sounds of hanging up i yelled that id bet he was in on the robbery himself and if he wouldnt do his job id call someone who would he snapped that what id do was go back to camp and keep my mouth shut and if i didnt do it hed break one of his own rules and float me out of the county one more thing burwell you tell the longs for me that im pretty good at joking myself and ill give em a sample of it if theres any more talk about killing or robberies there was a sharp click as he broke the connection i sorted through my change found enough to call the matacora county attorney he was expecting it having just received a call from darrow burwell huh he grunted what you been drinking boy speak up dammit a man ought to lay off the stuff if he cant handle it im not drunk i said i havent had a damn thing all i well drink something then get your mind off of gals for a while thats your trouble burwell thinkin about gals instead of drinkin worst thing in the world for a man please i begged if youll just listen to me sir no time boy no time now sober up and youll feel a hell of a lot better in the morning he hung up so did i baffled frustrated confused hardly knowing whether to bawl or laugh i came out of the booth and stood there in the night for a moment letting the cooling wind wash over my face darrow had had an answer for everything about higby the longs carol everything and all his answers were logical what hed said made a hell of a lot more sense than what id said it didnt actually but it seemed to how could anyone believe that longden hadnt been kidding that he wasnt just having some fun with a green kid how could anyone believe that hed tell me he was going to commit a robbery if he really intended to do it the fact was of course that hed told me because hed had to what id gotten out of carol had pointed me toward the truth higbys reaction to my payday hint had just about wrapped it up all i needed was to think on it a little and id be running to the sheriff so longden had done the only thing he could do and id walked right into the trap darrow was smart if id only told him what i suspected and why the odds were that he would have seen things as i did and the longs would have been jailed and carol would have been free but instead of just telling him what id suspected id told him what longden had told me and when darrow had laughed and teased me about it of course hed laughed who wouldnt i should have laughed with him agreed that it did sound crazy while pointing out just how smart that craziness was if id only done that behaving reasonably and sensibly instead of losing my temper and shouting and calling him a crook but i hadnt done that id acted like a fool id acted like one and hed treated me like one i winced remembering realizing that id washed myself up with the only people who could have helped i could never turn to them again no matter what happened no matter what the longs did id lost carol for all time and it was my own damned fault i felt so lowdown miserable and mad at myself that i groaned out loud dammit dammit to hell anyway how stupid can a guy get now dont you feel bad about it tommy boy longden ambled out of the shadows surrounding the booth cmon and ill give you a lift back to camp the car carols housecar was parked behind one of the towns abandoned buildings longden drove crosslots until he was out of town and had picked up the rutted trail into camp he kept the lights off the motor merely purring as it raced we slid through the night like phantoms the black car almost invisible virtually silent a real good wagon aint she tommy boy longden chuckled proudly what do you figure she cost us huh just make a guess i dont give a damn i said wheres carol why shes just fine tommy boy got some fellas keepin an eye on her while im out dryrunnin dont you ever worry about carol tommy there aint no time that we aint got someone lookin out for her how i said by giving her black eyes slapping her around aw naw o course not that aint hardly ever been necessary its a lot easier an nicer just to keep her broke and have her watched and we dont always have to do the watchin not as long as she knows that someone just might be doin it yeah sure i said youre real smart you are it wasnt any compliment the way i meant it but it was the truth when it came to thinking up new angles in crime the longs particularly longie were in a class by themselves the setup of the gang itself was unlike that of any other gang back in the beginning before theyd had a gang the longs had gotten themselves so wellknown that it was just about impossible for them to conceal their identity so they no longer made much of an effort to instead they made sure that no member of the gang was ever recognized or caught most gang bosses stayed safely in the background sometimes taking no part in a job except for the planning but the longs were out in front every step of the way keeping their gang members in the background and no one ever knew how many were in the gang because it wasnt always apparent who was in it a member of the gang might be in the place being robbed disguised as a workman or he might turn out to be a customer or a passerby the longs only pulled big jobs ones upward of fifty thousand dollars it would always be a bank job or the payroll of a big factory or something of the kind a place with a lot of people around one of those people almost any one of em might belong to the gang and hed have you dead at the first wrong move you made it had been a hell of a long time since anyone had made a move against the gang during a holdup for all anyone knew they might have given up their hiddenman technique but no one took the only way of finding out you dont have to convince people very often when you do it by killing the long brothers had gone to prison several times they could afford to just as quickly as they were in and out but the gang remained on the outside every man of them tremendously loyal to the brothers raising huge sums of money for them functioning like a welloiled machine through their years of working together and now at last the longs had blundered it wouldnt help carol but they had made one heck of a mistake in tackling the robbery of the pipeline payroll yeah tommy boy the car was slowing coming to a stop yeah longden turned in the seat and grinned at me got somethin troubling you youre going to have something troubling you i said you and everyone in your gang is gang what makes you think we got a gang tommy because im not stupid theres six hundred men in camp six hundred and theyre not the sort to sit and twiddle their thumbs while someone walks off with their pay itll take a dozen armed men to handle em and they wont have any gravy train doing it well now gee whiz by ding he drawled you seen right through me tommy boy but what about this trouble were supposed to get into wheres that supposed to come in i said the trouble was going to be in the getaway and he raised his brows putting on as though he was puzzled he said hed thought they had everything planned pretty perfect but maybe hed better run through it from the beginning we got this car now a car that can just about stand up on its hind legs and turn handsprings and we got me drivin it comes getaway time and you see how i drive tommy boy how i learn the area so well around a job that i can drive it in the dark with the lights off i always do that yknow tommy i do it even when i dont have to because a fella just never knows when havin to is he might have to without knowin that he does yknow but mainly its a test its a way of making sure that ive got the whole area laid out in my mind every little twist and turn and bump the only way if i can drive it in the dark i get your point i said go on well then theres carol we kept her out of things her whole life sent her away to school and all an treated her fine just savin her for something special like this so no one has ever bigeyed her no one knows that she aint just what she appears to be a hustler makin a pipeline shes been there all along and now everyones used to her an no one ever figures that shes totin guns and ammunition an go on i said get to something i dont know you pull the robbery and then what why we just take off thats what just like we always do but theres a big difference this time this time youll all be exposed the law will be looking for all of you instead of just you and your brothers when youre caught therell be no one on the outside to work for you and raise money he nodded solemnly too solemnly to mean it yeah tommy but you said wed have trouble gettin away thats the trouble in having to get away all of you i mean youll all have to leave the country or get caught so whats the problem this here car carry a dozen men as easy as apples an were sittin right on the doorstep of mexico he nodded again eyes twinkling looking as solemn as all getout i said he knew damned well what i meant so why pretend that he didnt now tommy boy he drawled now that aint nice tommy here you are practically a member of the family and youve sort of taken on the job of reportin us to the sheriff an why would i joke a fine upstanding young fella like you forget it to hell with you i said tell you what ill do tommy you square me away on what this problem is an ill let you see carol you can be alone with her for oh three or four hours okay knock it off i saidyou wouldnt dare let me go near her if she knew i was still here and intended to stay you wouldnt be able to kill me like youve threatened and that threat is the only hold you have over us he said it made him feel plumb bad to hear me talk that way danged if it didnt sound just like i didnt trust him or somethin cmon an tell me tommy boy he wheedled what have you got to lose anyway i figure you got somethin plenty important to say an im willing to pay the price to hear it well i hesitated studying him certain that he was lying but hoping that he wasnt wanting to see carol so bad that i would have believed anything im tellin the gods truth tommy he held up a hand as though swearing you just show me where the problem is an ill let you see carol i said yeah sure he would maybe hed let me start to see her but id get killed on the way he pointed out casually that hed hardly go through all that trouble when he could kill me right then and there if he wanted to not that i do want to tommy boy i would if i had to but it aint somethin im anxious for the sheriff knows youre stickin here no matter what so if he should come lookin for you he spread his hands expressively now cmon an tell me boy you do me a favor an ill do you one i told him what the problem was he waited watching me interestedly yeah tommy what do you mean yeah i said thats it whats it what i just told you dammit yeah maybe you better spell it out for me but all right i said its a big payroll one heck of a pile of money but it isnt much when it has to be your last job its not nearly enough for a dozen men who have to spend the rest of their lives in a foreign country yeah of course it isnt youd need twice that much anyway yeah to hell with you i said ive told you about umpteen times already and you just sit there saying yeah youre not deaf are you well whats the matter with you anyway just lonesome tommy just dyin for amusin company y know this is a plumb hard life i lead boy workin day and night you might say doin the same thing over and over so when a real amusin fella like you comes along whats the matter tommy you aint sore at me just because i cant see where the problem is i gritted my teeth i said all right id go through it one more time you longs and your men have to live in mexico the rest of your lives you cant operate down there and you cant come back here all right then the men will be paid for two weeks work plus overtime some draw very big pay some middling some most of em bottom scale averaging them all up it figures out to well call it a little better than a hundred a piece tommy maybe sixtyfive seventy thousand for the lot so whats the problem the problem i said slowly like i was talking to a fouryearold kid the problem is that its not enough money you need a minimum of twice that much now do you finally understand that have you finally got it through your thick skull weel he scratched his head well i understand that part tommy i can see that all right but theres one leetle thing i dont understand whats that i said what dont you understand what the problem is he was still whooping with laughter as i slammed out of the car and started walking toward camp as ive said that took place at the end of my first afternoon on the dope gang and two nights later as ive said four trey and i had our talk and patched things up between us wed gone out on the prairie to talk and i remained there a while after hed sauntered back to his tent it was nice there the wind came to me across hundreds of miles of unobstructed prairie so clean and sweet smelling after inhaling dope fumes all day i couldnt get enough of it the sun went down and duskydark came on i pushed myself up from the grass and went back to my tent i started thinking about carol again or still i should say because i never really stopped thinking about her i sat on the edge of my bunk the nighttime glooms settling over me wishing that i was to hell and gone from here and that carol was with me the tent was noisy it always was at this time of evening but with payday right on top of us the day after tomorrow it was worse than ever everyone seemed to be grabassing or talking at the top of his lungs everyone was full of piss and high spirits planning on how he was going to poop off his dough a stiff threw a handful of orange peelings at me i jumped up ready to poke him one then decided to let it go as he laughed and waved to me he wanted to know if id be dealing blackjack again i said what did he think and he laughed again and said he was all set to pin my ears back i took off my shoes and lay down on the bunk turning my back so that everyone would know i wanted to be left alone the guys nearest me took the hint and moved their racket up toward the front of the tent and i went back to thinking about carol there was only one thing to do as i saw it since no one would help me no one would get her away from the longs id have to do it myself how i didnt know i didnt have the faintest idea if i could get to see her to talk to her there was a good chance of getting her safely away we could just fade out into the prairie and if you really wanted to lose yourself in that prairie you were just as good as lost why hell you get could lost mighty easy without wanting to and people could look forever without finding you we could escape on foot or with luck we could make it in the car get to someplace where the law knew their business instead of being like darrow and wed have a happy ol time together from then on out anyway i was pretty sure wed be all right once i got to her but how in heck was i going to do that how could i get to see her with the longs watching all the time the way i figured id never get but one chance if i tried and ran into them that would wrap it up and put a button on it id disappear and no one would ever know but what id just decided to take off maybe thered be some tall wondering about it some questions asked but no one could prove anything and id still be dead so above the racket of the tent i heard the sudden roar of a flatbed then another and another from outside there was a rising clamor of voices with higbys crisp peremptory voice rising above them i rolled over on my bunk and sat up higby threw back the flap of the tent and looked in hard of face cold eyes sweeping from one man to another all right he began to point singling out one man after another and gesturing them curtly outside all right swarm out of here move goddammit leave your bags and grab your rags they got up uncertainly wonderingly there was a rumble of complaint of questions what the hell was up anyway higby said to swarm out and find out you back there he pointed what the frig are you waiting on and you and you and you by christ if i have to tell you again his eyes rested on me my burned and puffy face they passed over me and he turned and went back through the flap grumbling and cursing the men poured out of the tent i put on my shoes and moved up front stood looking out into the night men were loading up on the flatbeds as fast as one was loaded it pulled away from camp motor roaring and headed upline in all there were four of them four truckloads of men seated side by side on the last truck were the long brothers got out of it huh tommy it was wingy warfield well you ought to pal you ought to bad enough to burn a mans face off without working his ass off i asked him what the story was and he told me in his knowitall way hed warned them he said hed warned em that you couldnt make a deep ditch out here without shoring because any damned fool knew that wherever you found a lot of blackjack and scruboak you were going to find water not too far down yes by jesus thered be watersand which meant that your ditch would seep on you and if you didnt have shoring in it caved in moren a mile tommy them poor stiffs is going to be digging out til midnight or longer the way i figure i figured that the way he figured wouldnt be more than halfright but theyd be gone a long time the longs would be gone a long time and an hour was all i needed it was a good night for what i had to do dark enough for cover but light enough to let me move right along i headed across the prairie at a fast walk and the wind came up at my back seeming to want to help me along i could have done without the wind it made too much noise as it raked through the grass and scrub brush keeping my nerves on edge constantly looking this way and that perhaps smothering sounds that i needed to hear because of course the longs werent my only problem the longs would be tied up for several hours and possibly the members of their gang would be too possibly higby had told them to move out with the rest of the work party and they would have had no choice but to go or get the odds were that theyd been drafted along with the others if they had been in camp theyd be strong ablebodied men naturally and theyd hired on as unskilled labor so higby would have grabbed them if theyd been there to grab but if theyd been out here if they were out here well then i was in trouble and they were and i was how many there were i dont know but the first one suddenly rose up in front of me when i was less than a quartermile out of camp i whirled around and there was a guy there too hed come up behind me and now he was almost on top of me i darted right then left and still others rose up to head me off they closed in arms outspread a tightening circle of death there was no way of getting past them no way of getting around them my one hope a puny one was to break through them they came on silently confidently very sure of themselves a gang of professional killers against one overgrown kid a rattler couldnt have been surer of a fearfrozen rabbit than they were of me and i could almost hear their unvoiced laughter ever so slightly i bent my knees i drew my leg muscles tight levered my feet into the dirt and suddenly dived straight ahead my head slammed into the guys guts he went down and my momentum shot me over him in a wild somersault i came to my feet running the downed guy groaned and writhed getting in the way of the others and causing them to stumble and collide theyd been bunched up and it had cost them a big advantage they were no longer a circle of men just men and the way to camp was open i ran man did i ever run id been as good as dead a minute before but now i was free and running and i knew theyd never be able to catch me they knew it too and they didnt even try i dont know who threw it the rock or whatever it was but the dodgers could have used him he was throwing at a moving target in the dark a throw of almost a hundred feet but he nailed me like di wa didy my whole head seemed to explode i was out cold before i hit the ground during the next hour or so however long it was i moved briefly back into consciousness a couple of times a dim foggy halfconsciousness where everything was blurred and run together and everything that mattered seemed not to matter i came to the first time when i bumped into the bottom of some kind of declivity i couldnt see anyone probably i didnt even open my eyes but there was a murmur of voices blurred and runtogether like the rest of my halfconscious world longie warned him the girl stop em in the first place didnt think theyd tumble fr each other well get the sonofabitch buried something splashed into my face dirt then more dirt i began to struggle for breath to try to fight my way upward but kind of indifferently you know like you do in a dream i heard foggy faraway laughter i seemed to be laughing myself then abruptly i lost consciousness i came back into it or halfway into it laying out on the prairie my face was cleared of the strangling dirt the foggy murmur of voices had taken on a different note of argument and another voice had been added settle with longie hear me good aah now look you look take a good look this thirtythirty is the last thing youre going to see if you dont start making tracks i blanked out again i came back into full consciousness with a rush lunged to my feet looking wildly around me i was alone and little more than a hundred yards from the rear of my sleeping tent not far from the place where four trey and i had talked and shared whiskey only a few hours earlier i could almost have believed that i had fallen asleep and had a nightmare and i wished to god that i could have believed that but it just wasnt in the cards there was my throbbing head for one thing i hadnt gotten that from any dream then there was that voice id heard the voice of the man who had argued with the others and undoubtedly saved my life settle with longie hed said that and a number of other things things id forgotten but which clearly indicated one thing hed known the people he argued with not in the casual howyoudoin way you knew most people in camp but intimately almost the way he and i knew each other because of course we did know each other i had split a halfapint of whiskey with him that night and i had planned to tell him the terrible mess i was in with the long gang and he was a member of that gang but was he a member of the gang couldnt it just be that he knew them like he knew a lot of people without actually being mixed up with them hed been knocking around in outoftheway places a long time before i bumped into him he was a gambler and when you gamble you look at a guys money not the guy he minded his own business and kept his mouth shut so he got to know a lot of people who didnt ordinarily let themselves get known and some of those people could have been the longs thats the way it could have been whether it was or not i didnt know and i didnt know how to find out i mean how could you ask your best friend a thing like that i figured the best way was to kind of ease into the question come at it sort of sideways but i didnt know how to begin i was still trying to figure it out the next morning when we were back shooting powder together on the line and i guess i must have been frowning pretty hard looking like i was sore because he spoke to me kind of apologetically im afraid i havent been very thoughtful tommy ive kept you puzzling about some things that i should have explained to you well i shrugged i uh figured youd get around to it i knew you were going to be cleared of killing lassen because that girl carol told me you would she didnt say how but she was so positive of it that i passed the word to you i see i said a pipeline hustler tells you that im going to be cleared and well let it go i guess the important thing is that i was cleared not why he looked at me then looked back at the dynamite he was capping and fusing maybe she told you how she swung it or have you seen her since i said shed given me a pretty good idea of how she did it the one time id seen her ive only seen her once but i reckon you know that you know ive never had a second chance to see her it figures he nodded casually a man doesnt go calling after he works mormon board and dope i said i wasnt working mormon board and dope now so i guessed there wasnt anything to stop me from seeing her was there he spoke without looking at me slowly tamping down the charge of dynamite ill check it back to you tommy i certainly couldnt think of any reason that you cant now lets fire this powder we fired it and scampered for cover we came back to the ditch and i started to pick up the conversation but he shook his head firmly dynas a jealous girl tommy you give her all your attention or you wind up with half an ass but weve got to talk i said you know we have to mmm he cocked a brow at me exactly what about well i uh i mean i want to talk i said you know i think we ought to so do i he nodded but i think i can resist the temptation until lunchtime of course if you dont feel that you can i said i thought i could probably make it he said he was glad to hear it and we went on with the job i couldnt push him you see i didnt really have anything to push on and i guess i was probably afraid of finding out what i might so i let it ride and the morning passed and then it was lunchtime we filled our trays along with one of the main work gangs then carried them back upline to where we would be alone we began to eat with me fumbling for words trying to find the right kind of opening i was still hunting for it when he gave me one himself do any writing in jail tommy you know he went on before i could answer him i think you ought to try a novel some time maybe a crime story take this pipeline for example wouldnt it make a hell of a background for a payroll robbery it sure would i said but i dont know where youd get your story its too simple i mean you just appear in camp with a dozen armed men youve got them planted there ahead of time and grab the loot a dozen men against six hundred he shook his head you couldnt do it with six dozen theyd scatter on you spread all over hell and back and you couldnt protect yourself against them youd get our brains beat out before you could say fire in the hole but i hesitated i dont see that four trey youre armed and theyre not the moneys insured why should they risk getting killed for dough that theyll eventually get anyway eventually you mean in a month or two four trey grinned wryly you tell a pipeliner that hell get his pay eventually and see what happens to you but dammit i know damned well that i broke off swallowing the rest of the sentence all right i said you dont wait until the money is in camp you grab it before it gets there how wait now he held up a hand this is a truetolife story remember so you cant twist your facts you cant drag in an armored truck or have the money carried by a threecar caravan of deputy sheriffs of course not i said theyd be hanging a bulls eye on themselves the gang could just stake themselves out along the way almost a hundred lonely miles in this case and when the armored truck or whatever it was showed up theyd knock it over i dont claim that they wouldnt have some trouble but but it could be done four trey nodded so you dont use armored trucks or cop caravans in your story on a job as far out as this one the money would have to be brought in secretly in one of the company pickups or trucks thats not positive protection against holdups but its the best that anyones come up with i said yeah sure i know pickups and trucks are going back and forth all the time when theyre not in use here theyre going into town or over to matacora they keep the road hot all day hauling supplies and so on so the money is concealed in one of em and when it comes back which one is it concealed in there are maybe twentyfive or thirty vehicles involved how do you know which one is the money wagon easy i said the big boss is working with the gangsters he tips em off four trey laughed someone like higby you mean he tips em off and points the finger right at himself well well then the driver tips em off same deal hed be in the can before sundown if the gang didnt kill him first hed have it coming to him in my book if he was stupid enough to expect any split but a split skull but uh well how about this the companys field office is in matacora the bank is there so the pickup or the flatbed would have to go all the way over to matacora to get the payroll which means that it would have to get a darned early start out of camp to get back the same day id say it would probably leave late the night before wouldnt you to play it absolutely safe i mean you cant have that much money on the road after dark and it has to be here in plenty of time to pay the men all right i agreed it leaves the night before which means that itll be the first one back in camp oh no it doesnt mean that what about all the company vehicles that are only running between here and town they could get back a lot earlier than one coming all the way from matacora how about this i said the gang takes the license number of the truck or pickup when it leaves camp ah tommy four trey sighed tommy my friend dont you suppose the payroll insurers and the bankers and the pipeline big shots your gang is bucking would anticipate that dont you suppose they would take the very simple steps necessary to prevent identification by the license number or anything else they would of course i hesitated a moment then came up with a final idea the gang would have a man posted in matacora when the money was picked up hed phone the town here and a question four trey interrupted just where in matacora is your gang member going to be posted at the bank or the companys field office and what if the money driver didnt show up in either place he wouldnt have to you know the money could be taken to him at some previously arranged meeting place a hotel room say the work whistle blew four trey took a final swallow of coffee and emptied the rest onto the ground he got to his feet and i also stood up look i said hoarsely lets stop playing games youve proved that the payroll cant be robbed you tell me it cant in so many words but i happen to know that were on company time tommy he jerked his head upline lets start earning it but ive got to know whats going on why tell me just enough to get me more mixed up than i already am he sighed hesitated possibly because its all i can tell you i knew you were worried and i was trying to reassure you in the only way i could but thats all i can say now lets get back to work is there going to be a robbery or not whats going to happen when payday comes tomorrow you wont be here for it tommy not unless you get back on the job like i told you to he waited staring at me evenly we went back to work we had to work overtime that night and the chow flunky was late bringing grub to us it was pretty sorry chow too by pipeline standards and the flunky wasnt at all apologetic you boes are lucky to be getting anything at all youll be getting a hell of a lot less tomorrow for breakfast and lunch says who i said says the man thats who were jumping camp forty miles how you goin to fix chow when youre making a fortymile jump i looked from him to four trey he didnt seem at all surprised it makes sense he murmured pointing out that camp was more than twenty miles back of us now we can work both ways from the new camp and not have to jump so often if its so smart i said why didnt we work both ways from the beginning possibly because we have to learn from experience most of us do at least he lighted a cigarette and passed the package to me of course you occasionally find a bright young man who knows all the answers in advance the chow flunky packed up and drove away and i said i didnt pretend to know all the answers but id sure like to know some and i dont need any kidding i said i need help you know why i need it and ive got no one to turn to but you i am helping you i have helped you i know i said i uh well i was conscious part of the time last night four trey i oh he said softly i can see how that would throw you well i thought youd be better off not knowing certain things but he wasnt a member of the gang he said he knew none of its members although they all apparently knew him as for the men whod tried to kill me last night well it had been dark and it was doubtful that hed ever be able to identify them but i do know longie and his brothers indirectly through him ive known longden long for almost ten years we served time together im responsible for bringing him and his gang here he pinched the fire from his cigarette smashed it into the ground with his heel around us the silence deepened the unearthly silence of prairie twilight i gulped and my ears seemed to ring with the sound you i said at last youre a friend of that killer i didnt say that only that id known him for a long time i saw this setup coming up here and i got word to him about it he liked the looks of the deal so he moved in with his gang what about higby i figure you must have done a little fixing with him too tommy he hesitated troubledly forget higby im only putting the bug on my own back i brought longie and his gang here but i wouldnt have done it if id known there was going to be a girl involved in fact i didnt know that he was taking me up on the deal until i spotted him in camp i hadnt heard from him and i was kind of relieved that i hadnt tommy i was glad sort of and then he showed up and but why i said why did you ever mix yourself up in such a mess in the first place why did you ever start it you dont need the money you could have made a baby fortune between here and the gulf why how do you know what i need tommy he shook his head but never mind ive told you as much as i can and probably more than i should and now its about time to go dance with dyna he turned his hat brim up fore and back made motions of getting up i said i didnt believe he was working with the longs even if they did think so i know you too well four trey youre working for the law arent you you and the sheriff and everyone are out to trap the longs why sure i laughed that has to be it every member of the gang will be out in the open for the first time and im working for myself tommy strictly oh sure you are i grinned winking at him youd have to say you were you wouldnt dare admit the truth even to me particularly to you tommy if it was the truth what i said whats that supposed to mean now dont get your back up he drawled youve got a lot going for you my friend youre smart and youve got guts and youre hell on wheels when it comes to dealing blackjack to a bunch of hardnoses but id never let you play poker for me or chess a couple of games incidentally which longie long is damned good at i looked down at the ground my face reddening i mumbled that i was sorry that he thought i was so stupid and he sighed that he hadnt said anything of the kind but youd be bound to mix yourself up in this with the best of intentions of course and the worst possible results certainly youd feel impelled to pass the word to your girl fortunately or otherwise i told you the truth in the beginning im in this for myself for what it will do for me just me no one else now you wait a minute i jumped to my feet as he stood up what about my girl what about carol what about her shell be all right as long as she does what shes told but no more tommy he turned away drawing on his gloves time to go back to work please i said just answer one question for me just one and i wont ask you any more all right but make it fast its about tomorrow payday will i be dealing blackjack for you he hesitated grinned at me crookedly a cute question tommy but the answer is simple youll be dealing blackjack for me if theres a blackjack game breakfast was doughnuts coffee and dry cereal with each man getting a can of evaporated milk by ten in the morning the chow and kitchen tents the stoves cooking utensils and so on were loaded onto flatbeds they pulled out of camp for the new site with the cook and his staff riding the loads four trey and i blasted over the latrine and garbage pits then we turned to with the other men for the tearing down and loading everyone worked at it machine men welders everyone all six hundred men jumping a big camp was one hell of a big job and every hand was needed also the various jobs were interdependent and when you pulled a bunch of men out of one place you soon halted work in another we had fruit cookies and cold coffee for lunch afterwards higby assigned us a pickup and we packed and loaded our blasting materials twenty cases of dynamite went into the back each case wrapped in blankets and the whole load resting on bunk mattresses i rode in the rear with it kind of holding it down with my body four trey drove the supply of dynamite caps cradled in pillows on the seat beside him and i guess you know we didnt take any passengers it was quite a ride those forty miles not the kind id want to go through again but it had one advantage it sure took my mind off carol and the longs and all my other troubles my mind was strictly on the load i was riding and those little black caps on the front seat and i didnt have any trouble keeping it there there was no road after the endofline not even the truck ruts that passed for a road there were tracks across the prairie from the vehicles that had gone ahead of us but they were so twisty and crisscrossed from the drivers trying to feel their way that they were virtually more harm than help we had to go very slowly of course the big flatbeds and pickups loaded with men and materials kept passing us they swung wide around us giving us plenty of room then squared off to the south again and went jouncing and bouncing on their way until they faded into the rolling sunbaked wilderness and it was a wilderness in miles we were no great distance from our former camp but that had been the jumpingoff place you might say the end of somewhere and when you went beyond that you were alltheway gone now and then a flatbed or pickup would pass us coming from the new camp seeming to romp across the prairie as it burned daylight to make a final load one truck from town passed us with booms and chains holding down its cargo of ice the ice was melting fast marking a trail toward the new camp i might have wondered about it why a tightfisted outfit would pamper the men at such a busy time but the only thing i was wondering about that day was how to stay alive traveling so slowly we didnt reach the new camp until almost four that afternoon and it was nearly five by the time we had everything unloaded and stowed we got busy with the other men then wrapping up what remained of the work fortunately there wasnt a lot of it because the combination of scorching heat backbreaking labor and short rations had just about wrapped us up everyone was barely dragging tail barely able to put one foot in front of the other they lingered in the shade at every opportunity sometimes flopping down flat on the ground it was more like a wake than payday i sorted the longs out of the crowd and saw that they were in no better shape than anyone else longden long passed me once and tried to muscleup a grin but he just didnt have it in him a couple of times i took a long look at the tumbling terrain outside of camp carefully searching the landscape for some sign of carol or the housecar there wasnt any neither in nor out of camp was there anything to indicate that a holdup was about to take place in fact the way things stacked up it was ridiculous to think that there might be a holdup it was almost six oclock when higby climbed up on the long wash bench and shouted that that was all she wrote a few yells went up pretty weak and weary ones but enough to let him know that they were tickled to have it made someone shouted what about chow not money but food higby waved a pick handle motioning everybody to come in close as they did so depew climbed up on the wash bench with him and a couple of timekeepers passed up a large cardboard box that would be the payroll box i figured loaded with the mens two weeks earnings thats what it was too and what it wasnt but no one seemed much interested in it depew whispered in higbys ear higby frowned then shrugged and nodded banging the pick handle against the wash bench for attention now simmer down out there he stared sternly around the crowd mr depew has something to say to you depew stepped forward tried to glare around as higby had it got him a big laugh which he didnt like at all and when he opened his mouth and said now listen you men his voice came out in a highpitched squeak a roar of laughter went up he waited peevishly for it to die down then started in again you men all know im your friend that was too much even higby could hardly keep a straight face you could have heard the laughter and jeering five miles away and it got louder every time depew tried to speak he gave it up finally whirled around to leave but he was so mad he couldnt see i guess because he fell smack off the bench and what had happened before in the way of laughing wasnt anything to what happened then it was one great whooping and hollering wave after mounting wave of it a sound that went all the way through to your bones guys staggered around with tears in their eyes doubling up and gasping for breath and finally getting so weak they had to sit down before the laughter had died higby began to speak the pipeline company was a big outfit it had other jobs running besides this one and some of those jobs were paid by check so thered been a little mixup the company had sent checks here instead of cash now listen to me he shouted raising his voice above the angry rumbling ive got some questions how many of you want free cigarettes and cigars well theres all you want over there waving the pick handle toward the chow tent and thats not all thats there how many of you want to stuff your guts with icecold potato salad you heard me icecold and fried chicken and buttered rolls the biggest bygod feast you ever saw in your life well let me hear it he heard it cheers and yells of approval but there was also an angry sullen rumbling they were raging hungry and the word ice was magic to them but they wanted money too not checks where for gods sake could you cash a check but money so they were pulled two ways teetering they could swing one way as easily as another how many of you want some free hours higby was shouting againhow many of you want to sackin until nine tomorrow morning on company time how many of you want all the booze you can drink the anger the grumbling sullen rumble wasnt quite gone but it was weakening fast all but lost in the cheering shouting clamor for booze now youre talking higby grinned around at them by christ i almost believe youre pipeliners so lets get it wrapped up anyone that wants to can take his check and start walking right now because the rest of us are going to draw cashpay for four weeks come next payday the rest of us are going to have a party and were starting right now he jumped down from the bench and headed for the chow tent for a split second longer the mob continued to teeter weighing disappointment against desire then with a great happy roar they followed him even the welders and machine men who would as soon have had a check as cash went along with the others higby had done the impossible what i would have thought impossible also of course either innocently or otherwise he had arranged for the next payroll to be as large as the longs had to have it the booze was a punch made of jake and fruit juice it hit a man fast and hard and the camp was a howling riot inside of an hour fights broke out everywhere except for a corps of highpressure and strawbosses armed with pick handles many men would have been killed the highpressure and strawbosses had had drinks themselves enough to put plenty of zip into their pick handles when a guy got one of those hardash clubs against his head the fight usually went out of him fast usually it did but not always there were a couple of guys for example whod stolen butcher knives from the kitchen tent and they were chasing around claiming to be barbers and trying to give everyone shaves and haircuts they practically got their ears knocked off with pick handles and it just kind of acted like a tonic on em the more they were clubbed the worse they got so finally they had to be shot a little just a little you know not so bad that they couldnt be patched up in camp and go to work the next day one of them had his little toe shot off and the other got a bullet through the palm of his hand and they were pretty wellbehaved after that a wild bunch of drunks was going around with a blanket and tossing other guys in it they were making a nutty game out of it the idea being that they would all take a drink while the tossed guy was in the air and they never did make it so far as i could see but they acted like they had every time a guy would hit the ground which was every time they did it theyd all shake hands and congratulate each other then start looking for another guy they were headed toward me and i was waiting for them with a nice big tent stake when the pick handle squad moved in and knocked em all senseless some of the men had pipelined through the old osage indian nation in oklahoma where theyd picked up the game of indian ball even in those days the game had been outlawed for years but these pipeliners had run across one somewhere and theyd got a game going folks up in the nation used to say that you didnt have to be a crazy drunk killer to play it but it sure gave you a big edge the game didnt have any rules in the usual sense of the word a ball was simply tossed into the air and two groups of people struggled for it the groups could be of any size and anything and everything went kicking gouging biting slugging the game lasted until one side or the other was too bashedup to continue tonight a pillow was being used for a ball and the playing field was the long wash bench that added an extra hazard what with men being thrown off and knocked off so many men joined in the game a couple of hundred of them it looked like that the bench collapsed with their weight and they all went down on the ground in a fighting howling tangle that didnt stop the game of course in fact it made it worse clubs were ripped up out of the broken bench and the players moved in on each other swinging there were too many of them for the pickhandle boys to knock out and of course you couldnt shoot that many men even mildly so the game went on the bosses figuring i suppose that everyone was too drunk to get hurt very much i was standing back as far out of things as possible when wingy warfield sidled up to me id made one big mistake i guess in calling him my pal and acting friendly because hed been latching onto me ever since boasting and loudmouthing and putting on airs well tommy he said wagging his head and trying to look important they cant say i didnt warn em i told em you give booze to a stinkin bunch of jungle stiffs an theyre all right i said coldly youre one of em remember me he laughed like it was a joke no sir i dont have no part of that kind tommy ive boomed from ranger to smackover tseminole an when it comes to that kind of trash where you goin tommy to my bunk i said want me to come in and set with you for a while i can spare you a few minutes i reckon i mean there aint much i can do now anyways an tommy i kept on going without answering him my tent was empty as id figured it would be no one could have slept with the ruckus that was going on and it just wouldnt have been smart to sackin with so many drunks on the prowl i sat down on the edge of my bunk and lighted a cigarette i smoked it down and part of another taking an occasional sip from my jake bowl giving wingy plenty of time to lose himself id gotten a lousy headache from the noise i suppose and fretting over things i couldnt help it kept getting worse and the jake began to do queasy things to my stomach finally i jumped up and started back outside for some fresh air and bigger and doss long slid through the rear flap of the tent and brother longie came through the front they pinned me down pretty much as they had that day on the pipeline bigger and doss sitting on either side of me on my bunk and longie hunkering down on the bunk in front of me but there was one big difference between that day on the pipeline and now then wed been out in the open out in the daylight were everyone could see us and a shout would have brought help now with six hundred men around us we couldnt have been more alone and i could have yelled my lungs out without ever being heard now tommy boy longie apparently saw how i felt and grinned reassuringly just a friendly visit tommy how you gettin along anyway im alive i said no thanks to you so maybe youd just better mope off before i start thinkin about it and get sore it was a pretty silly thing to say under the circumstances and all three of them laughed in their place idve probably laughed too a real tiger aint he boys longie chuckled and doss and bigger agreed that i was but this is friendly tommy pure friendly we been out checkin the countryside gonna have us plenty of checkin to do yknow after such a long jump and we just thought wed drop in for a chat we figured youd be lonesome ysee an lets get it over with i said what do you want to talk about how smart you are how you knew there was going to be a double payday right from the beginning huhuh we want to talk about trouble tommy trouble i said trouble longie nodded youre a real smart young fella tommy boy oh i know i teased you a little but pokin fun is just a way of mine i actually got plenty o admiration for you an the boys here will tell you so we sure will bigger said solemnly its gods truth doss declared ol longie thinks you got a real head on you tommy boy and longie aint never wrong about a man right longie said now you talked pretty sharp tother night tommy pointed out quite a few things that could go wrong on this little job were plannin course it turned out that they aint goin to go wrong theyre not the problems you thought they was goin to be but just the same how do things look to you now tommy boy he was serious they all were they were convinced i knew something they hadnt foreseen i hesitated trying to think of a way to use the advantage and longie spoke again how about it tommy hmm you tell us an ill let you see carol sure you will i said like you did the other night huh i mean it tommy we had her out ridin with us an she aint moren a hundred yards from here right now maybe i said my pulse suddenly pounding maybe i go out to see her and thats the last anyone sees of me so dont go out longie shrugged we bring her in here you just give us the straight dope and well have her here in no moren a minute it was my turn to laugh i said i didnt doubt his word of course oh no but i was getting kind of dizzy from all the hot air you bring her in now i said just for a minute or two ill want to see her longer after i talk but im sure going to see her for a minute or two before i talk they scowled staring from one to the other bigger said that maybe tommyboy would talk without seem her at all but longie curtly gestured him to silence all right tommy you got a deal an if you dont keep your end of it he jerked his head and doss arose and moved up to the front flap of the tent bigger went out the rear and he did not return or at least he did not come back inside when the flap opened again carol came through it we had no chance to talk with longie standing by and we couldnt have said anything anyway in the time we had she was hardly in my arms barely long enough for a quick kiss and a hug before longie was pulling her away and shoving her back out through the rear flap then he and i and doss sat down again and i began to talk well in the first place you made a big mistake in coming here at all i said you dont know pipelines you couldnt know what you were getting into until after you were in it i went on from there building it up repeating myself stalling while i dreamed up ways that the robbery would give them trouble it wasnt to help them of course i guess you know what could happen to them for all i cared but if i could convince them that there shouldnt be a robbery then they would have no need for carol and she and i look tommy longie fidgeted impatiently we know all that we know we cant get the money after it hits the camp so we got to grab it on the way here what you cant get it on the way i said and i pointed out exactly why it looks easy to do but when you goddammit longie snarled knock off the stalling we made a bargain and by god you aint backin out on it whos trying to back out i said you asked me to tell you what i knew and im telling you now tommy boy he made his voice amiable again let me pin it down a little for you wed need a hundred men to take the dough after it reached camp but takin it on the way here well how many men do you need for that a different story aint it you shoot one man the guy thats drivin the money wagon an youre home free so heres what i want to know tommy he leaned forward on the bunk why did four trey tell us the job would take every man we had four trey whats he got to do with it i said ahh come on tommy you know his part in the picture youn him is best friends an he just naturally had to spill to you after he took you away from my boys now why did he tell us the job would take all our men when a blind idjit could see that it wont well i hesitated maybe he didnt tell you everything you see one way of pulling the robbery he had another one in mind uhhah longie exclaimed our way has some big holes in it and not knowin pipelines we cant see em but his why you reckon he didnt tell us what his was tommy boy to have an ace in the hole why else hes made it clear that you need all your men what you dont know is why and he can keep you walking damned straight until he tells you right tommy right but he aint told us an he obviously aint goin to so you just come clean like you promised look i said uneasily i just made a guess and youre taking it as fact youve had plenty of chances to question four trey why didnt you do it because we all of a sudden run out of chances a couple of weeks before we figured to there didnt seem to be no big hurry about it and there wasnt no reason to think yeah tommy boy i dont know what the hell youre getting at i said you seem to think four trey is pulling a double cross on you if he is hes got damned good reason to in my book but thats not my problem iron it out with him for gods sake go ask him your questions ask him did you say to ask him tommy boy what the hell do you think i said longie stared at me exchanged a curious glance with doss now tommy you can trust us what have you got to lose anyways now hear me i said listen good theres not a damned bit of use in coaxing or threatening me because theres nothing i can tell you i wouldnt tell you anything anyway if i thought it would help you but but you dont know longie said softly you dont know anything he sure dont doss said tommy boy dont know from nothin longie squinted at me thoughtfully on the point it seemed of saying something else then his eyes flickered and his mouth twisted in a sudden grin well what dya know he drawled right out in front of me an i didnt even see it he laughed slapped me on the thigh and stood up he jerked his head at doss and without another word they went out the back flap of the tent i looked after them uneasily wondering if i hadnt been a little outofline in talking to them about four trey offhand i couldnt think of anything id said that might hurt him but higby came in and gave me a curt nod as i stood up there was a dried streak of blood at one corner of his mouth and the pocket of his shirt was hanging by a thread he sagged against the tent pole for a moment then brought himself erect again putting you on powder in the morning burwell think you can handle it ive been doing it i said the head job i mean youre taking four treys place take his place i said what didnt know huh he gave me a wryly shrewd glance he draggedup a couple of hours ago rode out with the supply truck bbut why i said why did he his business burwell its mine when they work theirs when they quit the racket of the drunks roared suddenly to a deafening crescendo higby winced his eyes squeezing shut for a moment then turned savagely toward the entrance flap pipeliners it was like a cuss word and yet there was something more a kind of pride maybe a kind of affection a doubletough father discussing his likewise children the ornery bastards i wish every mothers son of em would die of the bleeding piles he went out gripping his pick handle like a ball bat i sagged down on my cot and buried my aching head in my hands baffled wondering the sickishness spreading from my stomach to my heart i didnt know what to make of things all that i could think of was that everything was getting to be too damned much it had been too damned much from the moment i set foot in camp hell even before that id been slugged id been jailed id been fired id almost been blown up and jackhammered loose from my guts and baked with pipedope and mormonboarded to death everything that could be done to a man had been dished out to me from trying to bury me alive on down and and and you showed em tommy burwell you took it all and laughed at em and asked em where their men folks were but enough is enough by god enough is a plain big plenty so if they try to hand you any more just one more thing heard about four trey huh well i could have warned you tommy wingy warfield sat down in front of me nodding his head wisely i been around since they spudded wells with rag line and a springpole an there aint nothin i couldnt tell you about four trey whitey r anyone else why i raised my head from my hands and looked at him wingy i said you better get longgone from me i know i know how you feel tommy you thought he was your friend an a fellas got to stick up for his friends but i could tell you he wasnt no friend to no one you know how i know well beat it i said wingy if you dont get out of here well ill tell you tommy ill tell you gods truth all the time you thought he was your friend he he uh his voice trailed away as i stood up and lifted the end of my cot i began unscrewing the heavy leg and he licked his lips nervously uh tommy what was you studyin to do you got a bray like a jackass i said so i figure maybe you are one an the only way you can get through to a mulejack is to hot his butt you hot his butt real good with a club an he stops brayin and starts listening an im going to have a firstrate hottingclub in just about a second that second was about an hour longer than he needed he whipped out of there so fast that the breeze almost blew the lantern out so i became head powder monkey of the big line maybe the last of the big lines from furthest far west texas to port arthur on the gulf we were just bending the third week of the job and i was the head shooter blasting a trail through a world where no man had gone before in the beginning i worked in behind the jackhammers or we worked together then we hit so much rock that it was better to have it cracked up a little for the hammers so i moved out in front cutting trail with rockdrill and dyna and that cute black hat she wore leading the long way to the gulf sometimes when the fire was in the hole and i was taking distance from the blast id look back down the line behind me and it seemed like as long as i looked i could never look enough there was so much to see so much that would never be seen again paso por aqui passed by here and then no more men and machines stretching endlessly into the distance men and machines only a thin almost invisible rivulet at first a tiny thing lost in the horizon it seemed to come up out of the ground like a puny spring back there at the start a nearnothingness amidst nothing and then slowly it grew larger the men and machines grew larger and the sound of them grew greater the rivulet became a river and its thunderous surging shook the earth the long thin line of burntblack men their shovels glinting as they caught the sun the yellowpainted generators peering down into the ditch periodically breaking into fits of chugging and coughing as though startled by their surroundings the mammoth ditchers rocking to and fro grunting and quavering like fat old ladies the jackhammers jouncing and jigging as they pounded the hard rock the razzledazzle of sparks raining upward where welders torches pencilled fire against the pipe throw out the lifeline here comes the pipeline somebodys going to drag up a lot of em would drag up i reckoned paid off with money or the ditch for a grave paso por aqui and then no more but it was something to see something to remember the men and the machines dying smashing up wearing out but always moving forward creeping through a wild and lonely world toward port arthur on the gulf i kid you not when i tell you the powder still scared hell out of me my grandparents the only parents id ever known had gone to heaven in little pieces and a thing like that you never get over but being scared doesnt need to paralyze a man unless he lets it being scared is about the best way i know of being healthy dyna was a touchy girl but she was absolutely predictable you knew how she had to be treated and as long as you treated her exactly that way you got along fine but never slight her or itd be the last time you did never let your mind wander when she demanded your attention dyna was a good girl but jealous and any twotiming would get you killed so i was scared of her and glad that i was we got along dyna and i did despite me having the worlds dumbest helper he was always making talk instead of keeping his mind on his job sometimes it looked like he didnt have any mind to keep on it a hundred times i told him how to tamp his shots down and hed do it the same damned way every time like he was tickling rattlesnakes with a short feather then when the shots got buried hed hang back and wait for me to dig em out finally he buried dyna for the second time in a morning and that was just one time too many so while he was hanging back and sort of scuffling his feet and mumbling that he was sorry i picked up a rock drill and motioned him over to me you got a choice i said you can either dig this drill out of your tail or you can dig those shots out of the ground he told me i could screw it hed set in on another job or dragup i told him he could go suck hind titty from a tumblebug but not until he got those shots out so we had a few more words and i had to bust him a couple of times but then he saw it my way i was sitting back out of range while he uncovered the shots when higby drove up and asked me what the trouble was i explained that there wasnt any trouble i was just trying to teach the guy a lesson higby said he guessed it was the only way want to get rid of him tommy say the word and ill give you another helper aw naw hell make it all right i said hes not a bad kid as kids go these days kid kids must have grown a lot older since the last time i looked thats it exactly i said they get older but they dont get any smarter why ill tell you mr higby i broke off because hed all of a sudden got a bad fit of coughing and had to turn his head after a moment or two he turned back around his face red from coughing uh yes tommy you were saying i was saying i dont know whats going to become of the world i said but by god i fear for it with this new generation of kids thats coming along now back in my day higby started coughing again he drove away coughing waving me solong over his shoulder instead of saying it id decided i liked higby i still didnt know whether he was a crook or not but i knew he was a man and i liked him somehow i found out that i didnt know a lot about a lot of things id once known all about not so long ago id felt that i had to know everything about everything and i was afraid to admit that i didnt but now it didnt seem to matter being ignorant isnt the same as being stupid and i knew i could learn when it was time to there was all the difference in the world between being head powder monkey and an assistant the difference of responsibility time and money and life itself was being bet on me on the belief that i would blow clean ditch with no costly delays and without endangering lives living up to that responsibility kept my days so crowded that they seemed more like weeks than days even though they rushed by living up to responsibility gave me confidence that i had never had before i knew that i was worthwhile knowing it i no longer had to try to keep proving it sometimes riding into camp at night i would stand up on the jolting flatbed and look off across the prairie to where carol was or where i thought she would be occasionally if i had gauged things correctly getting a glimpse of her and her camp down in a little hollow as it had been before i would stand there in the late afternoon sunlight rocking and swaying with the truck my hat brim cocked up front and back and my bare torso gleaming brown through the gray powder of rock dust and over the rolling expanse of sage and shortgrass i would send her a message telling her to sit tight and take it easy telling her that i would work things out some way and there wasnt a thing for her to worry about i knew that i would work them out too she was my responsibility so id do it no i didnt know how how was jumping the gun and before i could get to it i had to know something else at one time only a short time before i wouldnt have bothered with it but now at last i was thinking looking at a problem from all sides before i jumped in and tried to solve it now i was being responsible so i knew i had to know the why of things or id never live to get to the how there was no way that i could see that the long gang could pull their robbery rightly or wrongly however longie believed that there was a way but if there was he himself had practically admitted that it would require no more than one or two of his men it seemed to me that he should have been glad of this the fewer men required the easier the job but he wasnt glad he was alarmed why longie seemed virtually convinced that four trey had deliberately misled him into bringing his entire gang for the robbery instead of the one or two that were needed why what could four trey have gained by such a deception to move back a little bit what had been four treys motive in acting as fingerman for the gang why had he wanted the robbery any cut he could get from it would be far less than he would make by working and gambling so why why when he never needed money well you see the answer to one question was the answer to several if four treys motive wasnt money as it obviously wasnt then it could only be one other thing revenge that accounted for longies suspicions his alarm four trey had gotten the whole gang here because he meant to take revenge against them all he had no faith in texas justice with the pardonselling parkers in power so but wait a minute why did four trey have a grudge against everyone in the gang how could he have when he didnt know who they were and of course he didnt no one did outside the gang itself he would know who they were when they all came together for the robbery or their getaway but until then and how would that change anything to have a grudge against them all of them he would have had to know them beforehand so why since that wasnt possible night after night i lay in my bunk and puzzled over the riddle probing its contradictory parts until i was worn out and fell asleep repeatedly coming up with an answer that was no answer four trey hadnt been willing to let the law settle with the gang hed meant to do it himself and there was only one way he could do that by killing them killing a minimum of a dozen men practically all of them strangers to him it didnt make sense did it or if there was logic to it if he did hate them that much then why had he suddenly abandoned the plan as he had had to in draggingup and leaving camp or had he had to wasnt that merely a necessary part of the plan the longs had wanted to know why hed brought them all here for a job when no more than two would be needed he couldnt tell them why so hed had to leave and and i didnt know but i knew i was coming close to knowing the why of his grudge the why of his killing men he didnt know the why of his apparent dropping of a plan he had been determined to carry out i was thinking really thinking for the first time in my life and i could feel myself drawing closer to the answer and finally i reached it almost it was during my second week as headshooter id come in from work too dirty and sweaty for ordinary washing so after supper i walked down to the pecos for a bath the river roughly paralleled the line for much of its distance and it was only about a mile away at this point i worked my way through the scrubgrowth along the bank then paused at its edge to look down into the stream bed in this season the pecos was more a series of pools than a river ponds of various sizes with only a narrow film of water running over the stretches of gravel and sand between them now in the cool shade of evening animals and birds were clustered around the pools coming and going from them in a peaceful and orderly procession i saw a wolf two coyotes three of the big woodcats who considered the river their own happy home more rabbits and quail and pheasant then i could count sometimes there was just a little teethsnapping when a bathing bird wingsplashed water on a drinking animal but it was just a warning nothing more this was the end of the day and everyone had fought and fed enough and now was the time of truce up and down river as far as i could see they stood drinking side by side the natural enemies socalled and i watched and kind of wondered if there were any natural enemies or whether there was ever any enemy anywhere but hunger i hated to disturb them but i couldnt stay there indefinitely so i went on down the bank and began to bathe in the nearest pool some of the birds made a fuss about it screeching and batting at me with their wings the animals moved leisurely away to another watering place hardly looking at me after the first deceptively lazy glance apparently sizing me up as a party to the general truce i still reckon it as the nicest compliment ive ever had when i had washed good i sauntered naked up the sandy shore letting the sun dry my body it was nice to walk there with all the life around me and none of it afraid and i went further than i intended to so at last i saw it something up against the shelving bank of the river i hunkered down in front of it my pulse beginning to pound with excitement gray ashes the remnants of a tiny fire a recent one apparently since the ashes were unlumped with dew i sifted them through my hand and came up with something else a tiny shred of wood shaving and probing through the surrounding bushes i found what it had come from a piece of board the kind that boxes are made of just what kind i couldnt say since it had been pretty well shaved for fire i sniffed it and i still wasnt sure there was a very faint odor of dynamite but it was likely that it came from me i put the piece of wood back in the bushes and glanced around casually pecos river water was drinkable if you didnt mind a few wiggletails as for food well there was all that a man could want for the taking he could live here forever and as long as he kept his fire small and his eyes open no one would know it i went back downstream to where id left my clothes i dressed slowly wondering what my next step should be finally deciding that there was no next step to be taken here he didnt want to be found that being the case it wasnt likely that i could find him even if i tried and there would have been no point to it anyway he was too determined he wouldnt have gone to these lengths if he hadnt been deadset on going ahead yet i went back up the river bank and headed for camp yet it wasnt like him to do what he apparently intended to do he just didnt care enough you know he wouldnt let himself care and when a mans like that when he just doesnt give a damn how can he get sore enough to kill of course he hadnt always been that way hed cared so much possibly too much for his wife that when he lost her i stopped dead in my tracks lost her how he hadnt said but suddenly i knew i was almost positive to make absolutely sure i would have to talk to someone but not yet not until the very last the night before payday not until it was too late for him to talk meanwhile there were other things to be done i was wearing my shirt when i rode in from work the next night i kept it buttoned good and my shirttails tucked in tight and i was plenty careful how i moved around instead of heading right for the wash bench when i got in i made like i was going to the latrine then hustled on out of camp until i reached a certain clump of bushes i got rid of what i was carrying there caching it so it couldnt be seen the next night i brought in another load and another one the third night youll understand that they couldnt be very big loads not loads at all in the ordinary sense but i figured that the three loads would be enough for the job i had to do if i had one to do if i just wasnt acting nutty like four trey had hinted i did i reckoned a gun might have been better handier and safer and all but there was just no way i could come by one and i needed a weapon so i used what i had i had a couple of cigars and a supply of tying twine in the cache also two eightonce bottles of jake that id coaxed out of the cook that was it then and then it was the night before payday i sidled up to wingy warfield as he was setting out basins on the wash bench he scowled at me starting to tell me off with his jackass bray but i shut him up with a fivespot and began talking fast i sure owe you an apology i said i shouldnt ever have believed four trey when he said youd been dirtynaming me all over camp thats why i was sore see an why the dirty that just aint so tommy i sssh not so loud i said i know it isnt so wingy he just did it to make trouble between us because thats the kind of a guy he is now i know you dont like to talk about people it just isnt your way but i figure you know plenty of dirt about him damned right i do why i been on the boom since sure sure i said so if you could give me the word id spread it around with everyone and not here hes a dangerous man and hes probably still got friends in camp and if they saw us talking together uh yeah he wet his lips uneasily maybe we better make it outside of camp huh after dark i know just the place i said he hunkered down near me behind the clump of bushes jerking his head to an offer of a drink his voice shaky with fear uh i been thinkin tommy men four trey has always been good friends an i uh reckon i dont really know no dirt about him i sure wouldnt want to say anything that would hurt his feelins or uh make him sore at me so sure i said i kind of feel the same way wingy why dont we just have a drink and forget it i dont drink tommy you know that i sure wouldnt drink no jake if i did i said i sure wouldnt either id never done it in my life and i was too old to start in wingy frowned puzzledly staring at the bottle in my hand aint that what youre drinkin of course not i said its one hundred per cent pure jamaica ginger like it says on the label see its right there in plain sight uh yeah but its not jake until you foul it up with juice like the junglebums do catch me doing a thing like that no siree i just follow the doctors advice and mix it with pure water like this see that makes it into a medicine what they call an antiseptic it kills the deadly germs a guy picks up from handling dirty washbasins and so on he glanced uneasily at his hands scrubbed them nervously against his pants i said id probably be dead right now of syph or clap if it wasnt for dosing myself with good old per cent pure jamaica ginger like the doctors had advised me to theres an awful lot of dirty diseases going around a big camp you know and the guys that have em are always the ones that make messes for other people to clean up theyll filthy up a wash bench or a basin and leave it for some poor devil to uh well never mind i said what kind of germkiller do you use wingy i uh i sort of disremember wingy said you mind fixin me a drink of that per cent pure jamaica ginger he didnt have anything useful to say at first just lies mostly about how four trey cheated at dice and dirtynamed people whod never spoken anything but good of him then when he was near the end of his second bowl of jake and water he mentioned that four trey had been in the pen i said id heard that but id never found out why well ill just tell you then wingy took a big slurp of his drink damn thats good germkiller best i ever used hic an heres why four trey got sent up leastwise its why folks say he was sent up i wouldnt want you to say i said so because all im sayin is what was said tme an thats not the same as if i was sayin i said uh les see ics jus see oh yeah he served time for breakin and enterin thats it breakin and enterin aw come on wingy i laughed pretending not to believe him four treys too smart to do anything like that he sure as hell wouldnt get himself caught if he did an what if he was drunk huh what if hed been drinkin slong it was runnin out of his ears an his brains along with it what if hic hup gimme another drink of that per cent pure germaica killer i mixed it very slowly still pretending not to believe him wingy said it was so irregardless because hed got it straight from a guy who knew a guy who had a second cousin livin in four treys hometown it was on account of his wife see he went haywire after his wife got killed an he finally wound up breakin and enterm like i told you lay off i laughed now youre getting worse and worse theres not a woman in the world who could throw four trey whiteside wingy took the drink from my hands swallowed a sulky sip of it he didnt say anything for a minute or two and i was afraid i might have pushed him too far but then he belched the jake fumes tickling his nose and he laughed goodnaturedly is kind of stupid aint it but anyways thats the story four trey an her theyd knowed each other since they was kids wasnt much moren kids when they got married an when she got killed hic well yknow it just might be true i said its just wild enough to be true what was her name anyway whats the difference hown hells anyone gonna know stupid thing like that well i just supposed it was in the papers it usually is when someone gets killed and huhuh aw no it aint not unless its someone important because no one gives a damn right you r me r poor lil girl gets killed nnobody cacacares jus throw us all inna ditch you n me poor lil girl an an he began to cry i patted him on the back and comforted him and after a stiff drink he got squared away again four treys wife he said had worked in a factory or a bank or somethin like that it had been held up and there had been a hell of a big commotion and when the smoke cleared away and the holdup gang had cleared out she was dead yessir that poor lil girl was shot deadern dead an then four trey had started goin to pieces an a year or so later hed got sent up for breakin and enterin pretty rich aint it wingy glared angrily into his drink they cant catch the fellas that killed his wife least they never tried no one for it but they grab him right off fr breakin into a guys house when he was too drunk to know better hmm i said thoughtfully i wonder if he ever found out who did it i mean he might have been in prison at the same time some of the holdup guys were and they might have peeped to him without knowin who he was wha ya mean they wouldnt know the jake was making wingy cross knew his name didnt they but they didnt know hers it hadnt gotten any publicity and thered never been a trial or gdammit wouldnt have made no difference nohow couldnt find out somethin that nobody knows could he lotsa shootin goin on big gang o guys an all shootin sssoo hic couldn say which one did it ony way t make sure of gettin the guyd be to get em all the last sentence was the clincher for me it took the babbling drunken meanderings the gossip of the camp loudmouth a guy who would climb a tree to lie when he could stand on the ground and be truthful to tie them into fact ony way t make sure of gettin the guyd be to get em all which was just what four trey intended to do i had been reasonably sure of it before talking to wingy i a guy on the outside had seen it and if i had then longie had and four trey must have figured that he would so why he was going ahead anyway one man tying into a dozen all of them armed and waiting for him there was no time for puzzling out the riddle all hell was about to pop and carol and four trey would be caught right in the big middle of it and all i could do was be on hand to help them back in camp the motor of a flatbed roared to life then the engine of a pickup they pulled out of camp together both ostensibly heading for the long run to matacora either one could return with the payroll money and the gang had no way of knowing which but i reckoned that that wouldnt make any problem for longie long hed know just what to do about it wingy mumbled gimme nother drink o that at then he laughed tossed his bowl in the air with a whoopie and went over backwards i caught him eased him down to the ground and pulled his jumper around his shoulders he began to snore deeply dead to the world i left him there feeling a little guilty about it although there was no reason why i should have he was a boomer the longesttime boomer around hed boomed through every field from wyoming to west virginia from sweetwater to seminole hed done more sleeping on the ground than he had in bed and hed been bitten and chewed on by everything that walked or crawled and i doubted that anything could hurt him short of a twolegged animal with a gun the night wasnt dark and it wasnt light it was one of those middling nights the kind where you can see something if youre straining to if you know what youre looking for and where to look for it so careful as the guy was i saw him he was crawling under the row of flatbeds and pickups remaining only a minute or so under each one then moving on to the next one i dont know what he could do to them in so short a time but you could bet he knew exactly what he was doing whatever was necessary to knock them out of commission cars and trucks were put together a lot simpler in those days and it was easy to get to a vital spot in their innards he crawled out from under the rear of the last vehicle a flatbed and kept on crawling until he was well out on the prairie then he stood up and sauntered away in the darkness the rest of the gang had already gone ahead of him he had had to stay behind unable to do his job until the flatbed and pickup had pulled out for matacora and now he was gone to join the others i stood up on the point of trailing him then decided that the risk wasnt necessary the gang would collect at the place where carol had been camping they would want to be sure that four trey would find them and that was the only way they could be sure i went around the end of camp and headed across the prairie straight toward the place where the gang and carol would be and maybe four trey by this time and then again i had a change of mind because theyd probably be anticipating trouble from camp if trouble was going to come it would have to come from there so theyd be watching for it quite likely theyd be looking for me to blunder in on them because i sure hadnt been very smart in the past well anyway i thought it over for a minute or two then in place of going straight ahead i angled off moving south and a little east and slowly coming around in a wide arc i couldnt exactly pinpoint the spot where they were but i knew it was roughly east of camp and a little over a mile from it so by using the camp lights as a guide it was no great problem to keep my bearings the problem was moving fast enough i mean i was wearing a little tyingtwine harness around my chest up where i could watch it and get at it there were six sticks of dynamite in it all capped of course and with fuses as short as i could cut with a load like that tied onto you you dont hurry so good not over rough ground in the dark with a load like that the first time you stumble will be the last time and youll travel a lot further and faster than you counted on so i had to take it very easy and i had to take a long detour to where i was going i was short on time maybe a lot shorter than i thought but it was that or nothing and thats no choice i reached the end of the arc the point where i would cut sharply to the west i stooped down low behind a thick growth of sage and struck a match to my cigar lighting it so fast that there was the merest flicker of light on and gone before anyone could be sure he had seen it i took a deep puff or two shielding the glow with my hands i let the ash grow over the coal protecting and hiding it then i was ready for the backstretch or as ready as id ever be if the gang was only guarding the other side i had a chance and carol and four trey had one but if they had someone on this side the rear approach and they did it was lucky that i was forced to move so carefully kind of making a chore out of it each time i lifted a foot and set it down in front of the other one otherwise i might not have heard it the soft chuffchuff of a spade i crept forward guided by the sound getting in fairly close before i finally saw him i was moving in still closer when he stabbed the spade into the ground with a sharp chuff leaving it standing upright as he stooped he laughed a mean teasing laugh then his jeering voice drifted to me speaking to someone on the ground sorry honey but you just hadnt ought tove knowed little mexico job we pulled them spics ever we done it wouldnt like us atall there was a frantic smothered sound terrified choked suddenly i knew what it was what was going on carol carol bound and gagged and about to be buried alive he laughed again spoke to her with mock sympathy he was goin to tuck her in real nice he said real nice an cozy might be a mite lonesome at first but pretty soon all sorts of things would be cuddlin up to her fire ants an tumblebugs an snakes an a real funny guy you know he was laughing and having so much fun that i was right on top of him before he knew it which was just about the last thing he ever knew i swung with my razorsharp shooters knife just one sweeping slash across his throat he sagged backwards on his heels knees buckling and toppled into the grave hed dug for her and that was the end of his laughing and teasing the end of him i spoke to carol whispered to her rather letting her know who i was warning her not to cry out then i got her ungagged and cut her bonds and then well i sort of held her for a minute and she sort of held me and she cried a little bit but just out of happiness and relief so softly that it couldnt have been heard they had four trey she told me theyd caught him as he was approaching them he wasnt armed apparently hed ditched whatever weapons he had when he saw he was going to be caught but his story was that he hadnt been carrying any thats right tommy carol whispered he said hed been meaning to kill them all but hed changed his mind hed settle for having them give themselves up hed settle for it he would i reckoned theyd got a big laugh out of that why havent they killed him i whispered theyre going to as soon as longies through with him longie jokes a lot and he says theres plenty of time we whispered together a little longer then i told her to swing wide like i had and head for the pipeline camp she didnt want to she wanted to stay and try to help but i got kind of tough about it so finally she started away in the darkness and i moved forward again i came up on a little rise to see a faint glow ahead of me the dimmed light of a lantern which seemed to rise up out of the earth that would be where the car was parked the low dip in the prairie where the gang and four trey were a few yards further along and i could hear them longies drawled questions and the whoops of laughter as four trey answered them i paused running my hands over the dynamite harness making sure the sticks were all riding good i cupped my hands around my cigar and drew the coal alive with a long puff the gangs laughter tapered off into silence an ominous note came into longies amused drawl and then suddenly i was there as close as i could get to them not fifty feet away and looking down on them from above longie was sitting in the tailend of the housecar his legs dangling over the side four trey was standing a few feet in front of him and the others were kind of ringed around him in a halfcircle they were all crowded together which made my dynamite about as useless as so many sticks of candy i hesitated wondering what id better do as longie spoke again you think i didnt see through it four trey you think i didnt know it was all a setup right from the beginnin why hell i almost laughed in their faces a square john goin crooked just when a smart sheriff turns stupid a damn fool wouldve knowed it was a trap an i aint no fool youre not huh four trey made a pretense of yawning you figure its smart to walk into a trap with your eyes open longie said he sure as hell did because it wasnt a trap no more when a man had his eyes open the law had been tryin to trap him and his boys for years and theyd walked off with the bait every time only one thing i didnt know four trey i wasnt sure of it anyways that was where you fitted into the picture but when you skipped out and when i got to thinking back on all those questions you used to ask when we were doin time together forget it four trey cut in on him youre smart and everyone else is stupid but it still doesnt change anything ive tipped off the sheriff and there wont be any payroll coming through longie laughed angrily now i reckon thats not so ol friend four trey what you told the sheriff was that we wasnt goin to rob the payroll this time you told him thered been some kind of hitch car trouble probly and wed have to wait for the next time around thats what happened and dont tell me it aint neither because you figured to kill us yourself and you didnt want no law buttin in four trey hesitated nodded all right i changed my mind but that is what id planned but there still wont dont you say it you lyin sonofabitch they cant stall the men another payday an the sheriff dont see no reason to stall so the moneyll be comin through all right an itll be on one of the only two things thats left runnin all we got to do is knock out the only truck and the only pickup that comes down the trail and weve got the score made youll never swing it four trey didnt sound very convincing pipeline traffic is about all there is out here what do you think will happen when its chopped down to two vehicles some tall wonderin i reckon but theyll be practically here by then so longie slid down to the ground so thatll be the end of their wonderin and them too an speakin of ending things he jerked his head gesturing the gang began to close in on four trey and then a fist slammed into the back of my neck i stumbled and went down and there was a triumphant yell from doss got him longie i got the punk the stumble helped kept me from falling flat on my chest instinctively i thrust out my elbows catching some of my weight on them and that helped too so i didnt slam down on the ground like i might have i went down hard but with just a little less impact than dyna takes to explode and that little was as good as plenty like i say dynas a good girl as long as you dont crowd her which apparently was just what that damned doss was determined to do he was trying to grind me into the ground at any rate which worked out to the same thing hed come up on me from behind so he didnt know i was a walking bomb he hadnt seen the dyna and i couldnt tell him about it because he had his knees in my back and my mouth and nose crushed into the earth i struggled tried to yell he bore down all the harder and i strangled and began to lose consciousness and there was a burning in my chest and the smell of smoke and vaguely i wondered where my cigar was the weight suddenly went off of me doss yanked me to my feet gave me a shove down the slope i was dazed wobbly so after a step or two he grabbed my arm and started to hustle me along with him punk sonofabitch ill ill he saw it then the charred ring of fire on my shirt the sputtering fuses of the dynamite the others had been staring up at us and now they saw it too and he and the others all seemed to yell to move at the same time one moment they stood frozen speechless the next they were yelling scrambling to get the hell away from me yeow gangway how the hell wheres bobo where the car the car the car there was the craackcraack of a rifle and the lantern shattered and went out car doors slammed and the starter whirred i came alive suddenly began clawing at the dyna i hit the rear of the car with the first stick a pure lucky hit because i wasnt taking aim just trying to get it away from me the car rocked forward its windows shattering the scorched air of the backblast slapped me in the face and my eyes filled with pale smoke but i grabbed loose two more sticks and threw them one with each hand as they exploded in the air the car roared and rolled away i didnt have time to throw the last three sticks the fuses were almost burned into the caps and i knew id never make it and i didnt have to either four trey grabbed me he yanked the whole harness loose with a jerk threw it with one hand as he bore me down to the ground with the other i slapped my hands over my ears just as all three sticks went off together but i was almost stone deaf for the next couple minutes four trey and i sat up we looked at each other and grinned his lips moved in speech but of course i couldnt hear what he was saying then i spoke to him and neither of us could hear what i said we laughed so relieved you know just glad we werent dead he put a finger in his ear and wiggled it then spoke to me again his voice seeming to come to me from a thousand miles away didnt hear you tommy what did you say i just said i said carefullymouthing the words that it looks like were still alive well youd just better be carol sat down next to me ive got plans for you mr tommy burwell the smoke and fumes of the dynamite were gone and the air was sweet again it was good to be there with the peaceful night sounds all around us the three of us sitting in the night on the far west texas prairie and with all the excitement wed been through we needed to rest carol sighed and snuggled close to me four trey yawned and stretched then crimped up his hat brim front and back he kept looking away toward the trail to town as though he were expecting something from that direction and i finally asked him if he thought the gang would be back he drawled that he didnt think so in fact he was pretty sure that they wouldnt be its too bad they got away i said i guess i didnt handle things very well now dont you fault yourself tommy he said you did just fine and im proud of you i thanked him for his opinion adding that i still hated it that theyd got away maybe we could go over to camp and get one of the trucks or pickups started if we could make it into town to a phone wed never do it tommy he shook his head firmly those flatbeds and pickups are knocked out for the next twelve hours and you can bet money on it well i looked at him frowning thinking he was taking things pretty calmly it seems kind of strange that two men will be killed two drivers and that a months payroll will be stolen without us doing a thing to stop it he shrugged not saying anything and continued to stare into the distance toward the trail to town a moment or two passed and then he asked me if i thought hed made a mistake in not killing the longs and everyone in their gang they were right about that you know i had intended to kill em all but when it came time to do it he shook his head i just wasnt up to it tommy i felt that they had to be given a chance to turn themselves in well i said i guess i can understand that all right i know i couldnt just massacre a dozen men no matter who they were but exactly he cut in murder is murder and id be as bad as they were but if i gave them a chance and they didnt take it then whatever happened to them would be their own doing yeah i hesitated how do you mean whatever happened to them well his shoulders moved again in a lazy shrug i was thinking that they might have an accident accident why not people have em on a lot better roads than that trail over there and theyre not driving with their lights off like longie does well yeah but now suppose something got dropped over there on the trail maybe kind of buried so that it was almost impossible to see longie would smash right into it wouldnt he i guess so i said but that was all i said because the whole sky suddenly lit up for miles around a great blinding flash that turned the prairie night into day then came the explosion the blast and the ground trembled under us and i was deafened for the second time that night darkness returned the echoes of the explosion died away i rubbed my ears shooting a glance at four trey well i said i guess longie hit something all right i guess he did four trey said end
