 mark twains letters arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine volume iii xvi letters chiefly to w d howells literature and politics planning a play with bret harte the monday evening club of hartford was an association of most of the literary talent of that city and it included a number of very distinguished members the writers the editors the lawyers and the ministers of the gospel who composed it were more often than not men of national or international distinction there was but one paper at each meeting and it was likely to be a paper that would later find its way into some magazine naturally mark twain was one of its favorite members and his contributions never failed to arouse interest and discussion a mark twain night brought out every member in the next letter we find the first mention of one of his most memorable contributions a story of one of lifes moral aspects the tale now included in his collected works is for some reason little read today yet the curious allegory so vivid in its seeming reality is well worth consideration to w d howells in boston hartford jan my dear howells indeed we havent forgotten the howellses nor scored up a grudge of any kind against them but the fact is i was under the doctors hands for four weeks on a stretch and have been disabled from working for a week or so beside i thought i was well about ten days ago so i sent for a shorthand writer and dictated answers to a bushel or so of letters that had been accumulating during my illness getting everything shipshape and cleared up i went to work next day upon an atlantic article which ought to be worth per page which is the price they usually pay for my work i believe for although it is only pages ms less than two days work counting by bulk i have spent more days trimming altering and working at it i shall put in one more days polishing on it and then read it before our club which is to meet at our house monday evening the th inst i think it will bring out considerable discussion among the gentlemen of the club though the title of the article will not give them much notion of what is to follow this title being the facts concerning the recent carnival of crime in connecticut which reminds me that todays tribune says there will be a startling article in the current atlantic in which a being which is tangible bud invisible will figureexactly the case with the sketch of mine which i am talking about however mine can lie unpublished a year or two as well as not though i wish that contributor of yours had not interfered with his coincidence of heroes but what i am coming at is this wont you and mrs howells come down saturday the nd and remain to the club on monday night we always have a rattling good time at the club and we do want you to come ever so much will you now say you will mrs clemens and i are persuading ourselves that you twain will come my volume of sketches is doing very well considering the times received my quarterly statement today from bliss by which i perceive that copies have been sold or rather had been sold weeks ago a lot more by this time no doubt i am on the sick list again and was day before yesterday but on the whole i am getting along yrs ever mark howells wrote that he could not come down to the club meeting adding that sickness was quite out of character for mark twain and hardly fair on a man who had made so many other people feel well he closed by urging that bliss hurry out tom sawyer that boy is going to make a prodigious hit clemens answered to w d howells in boston hartford jan my dear howells thanks and ever so many for the good opinion of tom sawyer williams has made about rattling pictures for it some of them very dainty poor devil what a genius he has and how he does murder it with rum he takes a book of mine and without suggestion from anybody builds no end of pictures just from his reading of it there was never a man in the world so grateful to another as i was to you day before yesterday when i sat down in still rather wretched health to set myself to the dreary and hateful task of making final revision of tom sawyer and discovered upon opening the package of ms that your pencil marks were scattered all along this was splendid and swept away all labor instead of reading the ms i simply hunted out the pencil marks and made the emendations which they suggested i reduced the boy battle to a curt paragraph i finally concluded to cut the sunday school speech down to the first two sentences leaving no suggestion of satire since the book is to be for boys and girls i tamed the various obscenities until i judged that they no longer carried offense so at a single sitting i began and finished a revision which i had supposed would occupy or days and leave me mentally and physically fagged out at the end i was careful not to inflict the ms upon you until i had thoroughly and painstakingly revised it therefore the only faults left were those that would discover themselves to others not me and these you had pointed out there was one expression which perhaps you overlooked when huck is complaining to tom of the rigorous system in vogue at the widows he says the servants harass him with all manner of compulsory decencies and he winds up by saying and they comb me all to hell no exclamation point long ago when i read that to mrs clemens she made no comment another time i created occasion to read that chapter to her aunt and her mother both sensitive and loyal subjects of the kingdom of heaven so to speak and they let it pass i was glad for it was the most natural remark in the world for that boy to make and he had been allowed few privileges of speech in the book when i saw that you too had let it go without protest i was glad and afraid too afraid you hadnt observed it did you and did you question the propriety of it since the book is now professedly and confessedly a boys and girls hook that darn word bothers me some nights but it never did until i had ceased to regard the volume as being for adults dont bother to answer now for youve writing enough to do without allowing me to add to the burden but tell me when you see me again which we do hope will be next saturday or sunday or monday couldnt you come now and mull over the alterations which you are going to make in your ms and make them after you go back wouldnt it assist the work if you dropped out of harness and routine for a day or two and have that sort of revivification which comes of a holidayforgetfulness of the workshop i can always work after ive been to your house and if you will come to mine now and hear the club toot their various horns over the exasperating metaphysical question which i mean to lay before them in the disguise of a literary extravaganza it would just brace you up like a cordial i feel sort of mean trying to persuade a man to put down a critical piece of work at a critical time but yet i am honest in thinking it would not hurt the work nor impair your interest in it to come under the circumstances mrs clemens says maybe the howellses could come monday if they cannot come saturday ask them it is worth trying well hows that could you it would be splendid if you could drop me a postal card i should have a twinge of conscience if i forced you to write a letter i am honest about that and if you find you cant make out to come tell me that you bodies will come the next saturday if the thing is possible and stay over sunday yrs ever mark howells however did not come to the club meeting but promised to come soon when they could have a quiet time to themselves together as to hucks language he declared id have that swearing out in an instant i suppose i didnt notice it because the locution was so familiar to my western sense and so exactly the thing that huck would say clemens changed the phrase to they comb me all to thunder and so it stands today the carnival of crime having served its purpose at the club found quick acceptance by howells for the atlantic he was so pleased with it in fact that somewhat later he wrote urging that its author allow it to be printed in a dainty book by osgood who made a specialty of fine publishing meantime howells had written his atlantic notice of tom sawyer and now inclosed clemens a proof of it we may judge from the reply that it was satisfactory to w d howells in boston apl my dear howells it is a splendid notice and will embolden weakkneed journalistic admirers to speak out and will modify or shut up the unfriendly to fear god and dread the sunday school exactly described that old feeling which i used to have but i couldnt have formulated it i want to enclose one of the illustrations in this letter if i do not forget it of course the book is to be elaborately illustrated and i think that many of the pictures are considerably above the american average in conception if not in execution i do not reenclose your review to you for you have evidently read and corrected it and so i judge you do not need it about two days after the atlantic issues i mean to begin to send books to principal journals and magazines i read the carnival of crime proof in new york when worn and witless and so left some things unamended which i might possibly have altered had i been at home for instance i shall always address you in your own sniveling drawl baby i saw that you objected to something there but i did not understand what was it that it was too personal should the language be altered or the hyphens taken out wont you please fix it the way it ought to be altering the language as you choose only making it bitter and contemptuous deuced was not strong enough so i met you halfway with devilish mrs clemens has returned from new york with dreadful sore throat and bones racked with rheumatism she keeps her bed aloha nui as the kanakas say mark henry irving once said to mark twain you made a mistake by not adopting the stage as a profession you would have made even a greater actor than a writer mark twain would have made an actor certainly but not a very tractable one his appearance in hartford in the loan of a lover was a distinguished event and his success complete though he made so many extemporaneous improvements on the lines of thickheaded peter spuyk that he kept the other actors guessing as to their cues and nearly broke up the performance it was of course an amateur benefit though augustin daly promptly wrote offering to put it on for a long run the skeleton novelette mentioned in the next letter refers to a plan concocted by howells and clemens by which each of twelve authors was to write a story using the same plot blindfolded as to what the others had written it was a regular mark twain notion and it is hard today to imagine howellss continued enthusiasm in it neither he nor clemens gave up the idea for a long time it appears in their letters again and again though perhaps it was just as well for literature that it was never carried out to w d howells in boston apl my dear howells youll see per enclosed slip that i appear for the first time on the stage next wednesday you and mrs h come down and you shall skip in free i wrote my skeleton novelette yesterday and today it will make a little under pages please tell aldrich ive got a photographer engaged and triweekly issue is about to begin show him the canvassing specimens and beseech him to subscribe ever yours s l c in his next letter mark twain explains why tom sawyer is not to appear as soon as planned the reference to the literary nightmare refers to the punch conductor punch with care sketch which had recently appeared in the atlantic many other versifiers had had their turn at horsecar poetry and now a publisher was anxious to collect it in a book provided he could use the atlantic sketch clemens does not tell us here the nature of carltons insult forgiveness of which he was not yet qualified to grant but there are at least two stories about it or two halves of the same incident as related afterward by clemens and canton clemens said that when he took the jumping frog book to carlton in the latter pointing to his stock said rather scornfully books i dont want your book my shelves are full of books now though the reader may remember that it was carlton himself who had given the frog story to the saturday press and had seen it become famous carltons half of the story was that he did not accept mark twains book because the author looked so disreputable long afterward when the two men met in europe the publisher said to the now rich and famous author mr clemens my one claim on immortality is that i declined your first book to w d howells in boston hartford apl my dear howells thanks for giving me the place of honor bliss made a failure in the matter of getting tom sawyer ready on time the engravers assisting as usual i went down to see how much of a delay there was going to be and found that the man had not even put a canvasser on or issued an advertisement yet in fact that the electrotypes would not all be done for a month but of course the main fact was that no canvassing had been done because a subscription harvest is before publication not after when people have discovered how bad ones book is well yesterday i put in the courant an editorial paragraph stating that tam sawyer is ready to issue but publication is put off in order to secure english copyright by simultaneous publication there and here the english edition is unavoidably delayed you see part of that is true very well when i observed that my sketches had dropped from a sale of or a month down to a month i said this aint no time to be publishing books therefore let tom lie still till autumn mr bliss and make a holiday book of him to beguile the young people withal i shall print items occasionally still further delaying tom till i ease him down to autumn without shock to the waiting world as to that literary nightmare proposition im obliged to withhold consent for what seems a good reason to wit a single page of horsecar poetry is all that the average reader can stand without nausea now to stack together all of it that has been written and then add it to my article would be to enrage and disgust each and every reader and win the deathless enmity of the lot even if that reason were insufficient there would still be a sufficient reason left in the fact that mr carlton seems to be the publisher of the magazine in which it is proposed to publish this horsecar matter carlton insulted me in feb and so when the day arrives that sees me doing him a civility i shall feel that i am ready for paradise since my list of possible and impossible forgivenesses will then be complete mrs clemens says my version of the blindfold novelette a murder and a marriage is good pretty strong language for her the fieldses are coming down to the play tomorrow and they promise to get you and mrs howells to come too but i hope youll do nothing of the kind if it will inconvenience you for im not going to play either strikingly bad enough or well enough to make the journey pay you my wife and i think of going to boston may th to see anna dickinsons debut on the th if i find we can go ill try to get a stage box and then you and mrs howells must come to parkers and go with us to the crucifixion is that spelt right somehow it doesnt look right with our very kindest regards to the whole family yrs ever mark the mention of anna dickinson at the end of this letter recalls a prominent reformer and lecturer of the civil war period she had begun her crusades against temperance and slavery in when she was but fifteen years old when her success as a speaker had been immediate and extraordinary now in this later period at the age of thirtyfour she aspired to the stage unfortunately for her as her gifts lay elsewhere clemens and howells knew miss dickinson and were anxious for the success which they hardly dared hope for clemens arranged a box party to w d howells in boston may my dear howells i shall reach boston on monday the th either at pm or pm which is best and go straight to parkers if you and mrs howells cannot be there by half past ill not plan to arrive till the later traintime because i dont want to be there alone even a minute still joe twichell will doubtless go with me forgot that he is going to try hard to mrs clemens has given up going because susy is just recovering from about the savagest assault of diphtheria a child ever did recover from and therefore will not be entirely her healthy self again by the th would you and mrs howells like to invite mr and mrs aldrich i have a large proscenium box plenty of room use your own pleasure about it i mainly that is honest suggest it because i am seeking to make matters pleasant for you and mrs howells i invited twichell because i thought i knew youd like that i want you to fix it so that you and the madam can remain in boston all night for i leave next day and we cant have a talk otherwise i am going to get two rooms and a parlor and would like to know what you decide about the aldriches so as to know whether to apply for an additional bedroom or not dont dine that evening for i shall arrive dinnerless and need your help ill bring my blindfold novelette but shant exhibit it unless you exhibit yours you would simply go to work and write a novelette that would make mine sick because you would know all about where my weak points lay no sir im one of these old wary birds dont bother to write a letter lines on a postal card is all that i can permit from a busy man yrs ever mark p s good youll not have to feel any call to mention that debut in the atlantic theyve made me pay the grand cash for my box a thing which most managers would be too worldlywise to do with journalistic folks but im most honestly glad for id rather pay three prices any time than to have my tongue half paralyzed with a deadhead ticket hang that anna dickinson a body can never depend upon her debuts she has made five or six false starts already if she fails to debut this time i will never bet on her again in his book my mark twain howells refers to the tragedy of miss dickinsons appearance she was the author of numerous plays some of which were successful but her career as an actress was never brilliant at elmira that summer the clemenses heard from their good friend doctor brown of edinburgh and sent eager replies to dr john brown in edinburgh elmira new york u s june dear friend the doctor it was a perfect delight to see the wellknown handwriting again but we so grieve to know that you are feeling miserable it must not last it cannot last the regal summer is come and it will smile you into high good cheer it will charm away your pains it will banish your distresses i wish you were here to spend the summer with us we are perched on a hilltop that overlooks a little world of green valleys shining rivers sumptuous forests and billowy uplands veiled in the haze of distance we have no neighbors it is the quietest of all quiet places and we are hermits that eschew caves and live in the sun doctor if youd only come i will carry your letter to mrs c now and there will be a glad woman i tell you and she shall find one of those pictures to put in this for mrs barclays and if there isnt one here well send right away to hartford and get one come over doctor john and bring the barclays the nicolsons and the browns one and all affectionately saml l clemens from may until august no letters appear to have passed between clemens and howells the latter finally wrote complaining of the lack of news he was in the midst of campaign activities he said writing a life of hayes and gaily added you know i wrote the life of lincoln which elected him he further reported a comedy he had completed and gave clemens a general stirring up as to his own work mark twain in his hillside study was busy enough summer was his time for work and he had tried his hand in various directions his mention of huck finn in his reply to howells is interesting in that it shows the measure of his enthusiasm or lack of it as a gauge of his ultimate achievement to w d howells in boston elmira aug my dear howells i was just about to write you when your letter came and not one of those obscene postal cards either but reverently upon paper i shall read that biography though the letter of acceptance was amply sufficient to corral my vote without any further knowledge of the man which reminds me that a campaign club in jersey city wrote a few days ago and invited me to be present at the raising of a tilden and hendricks flag there and to take the stand and give them some counsel well i could not go but gave them counsel and advice by letter and in the kindliest terms as to the raising of the flag advised them not to raise it get your book out quick for this is a momentous time if tilden is elected i think the entire country will go pretty straight to mrs howellss bad place i am infringing on your patent i started a record of our childrens sayings last night which reminds me that last week i sent down and got susie a vast pair of shoes of a most villainous pattern for i discovered that her feet were being twisted and cramped out of shape by a smaller and prettier article she did not complain but looked degraded and injured at night her mamma gave her the usual admonition when she was about to say her prayers to wit now susie think about god mamma i cant with those shoes the farm is perfectly delightful this season it is as quiet and peaceful as a south sea island some of the sunsets which we have witnessed from this commanding eminence were marvelous one evening a rainbow spanned an entire range of hills with its mighty arch and from a black hub resting upon the hilltop in the exact centre black rays diverged upward in perfect regularity to the rainbows arch and created a very strongly defined and altogether the most majestic magnificent and startling halfsunk wagon wheel you can imagine after that a world of tumbling and prodigious clouds came drifting up out of the west and took to themselves a wonderfully rich and brilliant green color the decided green of new spring foliage close by them we saw the intense blue of the skies through rents in the cloudrack and away off in another quarter were drifting clouds of a delicate pink color in one place hung a pall of dense black clouds like compacted pitchsmoke and the stupendous wagon wheel was still in the supremacy of its unspeakable grandeur so you see the colors present in the sky at once and the same time were blue green pink black and the varicolored splendors of the rainbow all strong and decided colors too i dont know whether this weird and astounding spectacle most suggested heaven or hell the wonder with its constant stately and always surprising changes lasted upwards of two hours and we all stood on the top of the hill by my study till the final miracle was complete and the greatest day ended that we ever saw our farmer who is a grave man watched that spectacle to the end and then observed that it was dam funny the doublebarreled novel lies torpid i found i could not go on with it the chapters i had written were still too new and familiar to me i may take it up next winter but cannot tell yet i waited and waited to see if my interest in it would not revive but gave it up a month ago and began another boys book more to be at work than anything else i have written pages on it therefore it is very nearly half done it is huck finns autobiography i like it only tolerably well as far as i have got and may possibly pigeonhole or burn the ms when it is done so the comedy is done and with a fair degree of satisfaction that rejoices me and makes me mad too for i cant plan a comedy and what have you done that god should be so good to you i have racked myself baldheaded trying to plan a comedy harness for some promising characters of mine to work in and had to give it up it is a noble lot of blooded stock and worth no end of money but they must stand in the stable and be profitless i want to be present when the comedy is produced and help enjoy the success warners book is mighty readable i think love to yez yrs ever mark howells promptly wrote again urging him to enter the campaign for hayes there is not another man in this country he said who could help him so much as you the farce which clemens refers to in his reply was the parlor car which seems to have been about the first venture of howells in that field to w d howells in boston elmira august my dear howells i am glad you think i could do hayes any good for i have been wanting to write a letter or make a speech to that end ill be careful not to do either however until the opportunity comes in a natural justifiable and unlugged way and shall not then do anything unless ive got it all digested and worded just right in which case i might do some good in any other i should do harm when a humorist ventures upon the grave concerns of life he must do his job better than another man or he works harm to his cause the farce is wonderfully bright and delicious and must make a hit you read it to me and it was mighty good i read it last night and it was better i read it aloud to the household this morning and it was better than ever so it would be worth going a long way to see it well played for without any question an actor of genius always adds a subtle something to any mans work that none but the writer knew was there before even if he knew it i have heard of readers convulsing audiences with my aurelias unfortunate young man if there is anything really funny in the piece the author is not aware of it all right advertise me for the new volume i send you herewith a sketch which will make pages of the atlantic if you like it and accept it you should get it into the december no because i shall read it in public in boston the th and th of nov if it went in a month earlier it would be too old for me to read except as old matter and if it went in a month later it would be too old for the atlantic do you see and if you wish to use it will you set it up now and send me three proofs one to correct for atlantic one to send to temple bar shall i tell them to use it not earlier than their november no and one to use in practising for my boston readings we must get up a less elaborate and a much better skeletonplan for the blindfold novels and make a success of that idea david gray spent sunday here and said we could but little comprehend what a rattling stir that thing would make in the country he thought it would make a mighty strike so do i but with only pages to tell the tale in the plot must be less elaborate doubtless what do you think when we exchange visits ill show you an unfinished sketch of elizabeths time which shook david grays system up pretty exhaustively yrs ever mark the ms sketch mentioned in the foregoing letter was the canvassers tale later included in the volume tom sawyer abroad and other stories it is far from being mark twains best work but was accepted and printed in the atlantic david gray was an able journalist and editor whom mark twain had known in buffalo the sketch of elizabeths time is a brilliant piece of writing an imaginary record of conversation and court manners in the good old days of free speech and performance phrased in the language of the period gray john hay twichell and others who had a chance to see it thought highly of it and hay had it set in type and a few proofs taken for private circulation some years afterward a west point officer had a special font of antique type made for it and printed a hundred copies but the presentday reader would hardly be willing to include fireside conversation in the time of queen elizabeth in mark twains collected works clemens was a strong republican in those days as his letters of this period show his mention of the caves in the next is another reference to the canvassers tale to w d howells in boston sept my dear howells yes the collection of caves was the origin of it i changed it to echoes because these being invisible and intangible constituted a still more absurd species of property and yet a man could really own an echo and sell it too for a high figure such an echo as that at the villa siminetti two miles from milan for instance my first purpose was to have the man make a collection of caves and afterwards of echoes but perceived that the element of absurdity and impracticability was so nearly identical as to amount to a repetition of an idea i will not and do not believe that there is a possibility of hayess defeat but i want the victory to be sweeping it seems odd to find myself interested in an election i never was before and i cant seem to get over my repugnance to reading or thinking about politics yet but in truth i care little about any partys politics the man behind it is the important thing you may well know that mrs clemens liked the parlor car enjoyed it ever so much and was indignant at you all through and kept exploding into rages at you for pretending that such a woman ever existed closing each and every explosion with but it is just what such a woman would do it is just what such a woman would say they all voted the parlor car perfection except me i said they wouldnt have been allowed to court and quarrel there so long uninterrupted but at each critical moment the odious trainboy would come in and pile foul literature all over them four or five inches deep and the lover would turn his head aside and curse and presently that trainboy would be back again as on all those western roads to take up the literature and leave prize candy of course the thing is perfect in the magazine without the trainboy but i was thinking of the stage and the groundlings if the dainty touches went over their heads the trainboy and other possible interruptions would fetch them every time would it mar the flow of the thing too much to insert that devil i thought it over a couple of hours and concluded it wouldnt and that he ought to be in for the sake of the groundlings and to get new copyright on the piece and it seemed to me that now that the fourth act is so successfully written why not go ahead and write the preceding acts and then after it is finished let me put into it a lowcomedy character the girls or the lovers father or uncle and gobble a big pecuniary interest in your work for myself do not let this generous proposition disturb your rest but do write the other acts and then it will be valuable to managers and dont go and sell it to anybody like harte but keep it for yourself hartes play can be doctored till it will be entirely acceptable and then it will clear a great sum every year i am out of all patience with harte for selling it the play entertained me hugely even in its present crude state love to you all yrs ever mark following the sellers success clemens had made many attempts at dramatic writing such undertakings had uniformly failed but he had always been willing to try again in the next letter we get the beginning of what proved his first and last direct literary association that is to say collaboration with bret harte clemens had great admiration for hartes ability and believed that between them they could turn out a successful play whether or not this belief was justified will appear later howellss biography of hayes meanwhile had not gone well he reported that only two thousand copies had been sold in what was now the height of the campaign theres success for you he said it makes me despair of the republic clemens on his part had made a speech for hayes that howells declared had put civilservice reform in a nutshell he added you are the only republican orator quoted without distinction of party by all the newspapers to w d howells in boston hartford oct my dear howells this is a secret to be known to nobody but you of course i comprehend that mrs howells is part of you that bret harte came up here the other day and asked me to help him write a play and divide the swag and i agreed i am to put in scotty briggs see buck fanshaws funeral in roughing it and he is to put in a chinaman a wonderfully funny creature as bret presents him for minutes in his sandy bar play this chinaman is to be the character of the play and both of us will work on him and develop him bret is to draw a plot and i am to do the same we shall use the best of the two or gouge from both and build a third my plot is built finished it yesterday six days work or hours a day and has nearly killed me now the favor i ask of you is that you will have the words ah sin a drama printed in the middle of a notepaper page and send the same to me with bill we dont want anybody to know that we are building this play i cant get this title page printed here without having to lie so much that the thought of it is disagreeable to one reared as i have been and yet the title of the play must be printed the rest of the application for copyright is allowable in penmanship we have got the very best gang of servants in america now when george first came he was one of the most religious of men he had but one fault young george washingtons but i have trained him and now it fairly breaks mrs clemenss heart to hear george stand at that front door and lie to the unwelcome visitor but your time is valuable i must not dwell upon these thingsill ask warner and harte if theyll do blindfold novelettes some time ill simplify that plot all it needs is that the hanging and the marriage shall not be appointed for the same day i got over that difficulty but it required too much ms to reconcile the thing so the movement of the story was clogged i came near agreeing to make political speeches with our candidate for governor the th and inst but i had to give up the idea for harte and i will be here at work then yrs ever mark mark twain was writing few letters these days to any one but howells yet in november he sent one to an old friend of his youth burrough the literary chairmaker who had roomed with him in the days when he had been setting type for the st louis evening news to mr burrough of st louis hartford nov my dear burroughs as you describe me i can picture myself as i was years ago the portrait is correct you think i have grown some upon my word there was room for it you have described a callow fool a selfsufficient ass a mere human tumblebug imagining that he is remodeling the world and is entirely capable of doing it right ignorance intolerance egotism selfassertion opaque perception dense and pitiful chuckleheadedness and an almost pathetic unconsciousness of it all that is what i was at and and that is what the average southerner is at today northerners too of a certain grade it is of children like this that voters are made and such is the primal source of our government a man hardly knows whether to swear or cry over it i think i comprehend the position there perfect freedom to vote just as you choose provided you choose to vote as other people think social ostracism otherwise the same thing exists here among the irish an irish republican is a pariah among his people yet that race find fault with the same spirit in knownothingism fortunately a good deal of experience of men enabled me to choose my residence wisely i live in the freest corner of the country there are no social disabilities between me and my democratic personal friends we break the bread and eat the salt of hospitality freely together and never dream of such a thing as offering impertinent interference in each others political opinions dont you ever come to new york again and not run up here to see me i suppose we were away for the summer when you were east but no matter you could have telegraphed and found out we were at elmira n y and right on your road and could have given you a good time if you had allowed us the chance yes will bowen and i have exchanged letters now and then for several years but i suspect that i made him mad with my last shortly after you saw him in st louis i judge there is one thing which i cant stand and wont stand from many people that is sham sentimentality the kind a schoolgirl puts into her graduating composition the sort that makes up the original poetry column of a country newspaper the rot that deals in the happy days of yore the sweet yet melancholy past with its blighted hopes and its vanished dreams and all that sort of drivel wills were always of this stamp i stood it years when i get a letter like that from a grown man and he a widower with a family it gives me the stomach ache and i just told will bowen so last summer i told him to stop being at told him to stop drooling about the sweet yet melancholy past and take a pill i said there was but one solitary thing about the past worth remembering and that was the fact that it is the past cant be restored well i exaggerated some of these truths a little but only a little but my idea was to kill his sham sentimentality once and forever and so make a good fellow of him again i went to the unheardof trouble of rewriting the letter and saying the same harsh things softly so as to sugarcoat the anguish and make it a little more endurable and i asked him to write and thank me honestly for doing him the best and kindliest favor that any friend ever had done him but he hasnt done it yet maybe he will sometime i am grateful to god that i got that letter off before he was married i get that news from you else he would just have slobbered all over me and drowned me when that event happened i enclose photograph for the young ladies i will remark that i do not wear sealskin for grandeur but because i found when i used to lecture in the winter that nothing else was able to keep a man warm sometimes in these high latitudes i wish you had sent pictures of yourself and family ill trade picture for picture with you straight through if you are commercially inclined your old friend saml l clemens xvii letters to bermuda with twichell proposition to th nast the whittier dinner mark twain must have been too busy to write letters that winter those that have survived are few and unimportant as a matter of fact he was writing the play ah sin with bret harte and getting it ready for production harte was a guest in the clemens home while the play was being written and not always a pleasant one he was full of requirements critical as to the menage to the point of sarcasm the long friendship between clemens and harte weakened under the strain of collaboration and intimate daily intercourse never to renew its old fiber it was an unhappy outcome of an enterprise which in itself was to prove of little profit the play ah sin had many good features and with charles t parsloe in an amusing chinese part might have been made a success if the two authors could have harmoniously undertaken the needed repairs it opened in washington in may and a letter from parsloe written at the moment gives a hint of the situation from charles t parsloe to s l clemens washington d c may th mr clemens i forgot whether i acknowledged receipt of check by telegram harte has been here since monday last and done little or nothing yet but promises to have something fixed by tomorrow morning we have been making some improvements among ourselves the last act is weak at the end and i do hope mr harte will have something for a good finish to the piece the other acts i think are all right now hope you have entirely recovered i am not very well myself the excitement of a first night is bad enough but to have the annoyance with harte that i have is too much for a beginner i aint used to it the houses have been picking up since tuesday mr ford has worked well and hard for us yours in haste chas thos parsloe the play drew some good houses in washington but it could not hold them for a run never mind what was the matter with it perhaps a very small change at the right point would have turned it into a fine success we have seen in a former letter the obligation which mark twain confessed to harte a debt he had tried in many ways to repay obtaining for him a liberal book contract with bliss advancing him frequent and large sums of money which harte could not or did not repay seeking to advance his fortunes in many directions the mistake came when he introduced another genius into the intracacies of his daily life clemens went down to washington during the early rehearsals of ah sin meantime rutherford b hayes had been elected president and clemens one day called with a letter of introduction from howells thinking to meet the chief executive his own letter to howells later probably does not give the real reason of his failure but it will be amusing to those who recall the erratic personality of george francis train train and twain were sometimes confused by the very unlettered or pretendedly by mark twains friends to w d howells in boston baltimore may my dear howells found i was not absolutely needed in washington so i only staid hours and am on my way home now i called at the white house and got admission to col rodgers because i wanted to inquire what was the right hour to go and infest the president it was my luck to strike the place in the dead waste and middle of the day the very busiest time i perceived that mr rodgers took me for george francis train and had made up his mind not to let me get at the president so at the end of half an hour i took my letter of introduction from the table and went away it was a great pity all round and a great loss to the nation for i was brim full of the eastern question i didnt get to see the president or the chief magistrate either though i had sort of a glimpse of a lady at a window who resembled her portraits yrs ever mark howells condoled with him on his failure to see the president but he added if you and i had both been there our combined skill would have no doubt procured us to be expelled from the white house by fred douglass but the thing seems to be a complete failure as it was douglass at this time being the marshal of columbia gives special point to howellss suggestion later in may clemens took twichell for an excursion to bermuda he had begged howells to go with them but howells as usual was full of literary affairs twichell and clemens spent four glorious days tramping the length and breadth of the beautiful island and remembered it always as one of their happiest adventures put it down as an oasis wrote twichell on his return im afraid i shall not see as green a spot again soon and it was your invention and your gift and your company was the best of it indeed i never took more comfort in being with you than on this journey which my boy is saying a great deal to howells clemens triumphantly reported the success of the excursion to w d howells in boston farmington avenue hartford may confound you joe twichell and i roamed about bermuda day and night and never ceased to gabble and enjoy about half the talk was it is a burning shame that howells isnt here nobody could get at the very meat and marrow of this pervading charm and deliciousness like howells how howells would revel in the quaintness and the simplicity of this people and the sabbath repose of this land what an imperishable sketch howells would make of capt west the whaler and capt hope with the patient pathetic face wanderer in all the oceans for years lucky in none coming home defeated once more now minus his ship resigned uncomplaining being used to this what a rattling chapter howells would make out of the small boy alfred with his alert eye and military brevity and exactness of speech and out of the old landlady and her sacred onions and her daughter and the visiting clergyman and the ancient pianos of hamilton and the venerable music in vogue there and forty other things which we shall leave untouched or touched but lightly upon we not being worthy dam howells for not being here this usually from me not twichell o your insufferable pride which will have a fall some day if you had gone with us and let me pay the which the trip and the board and the various nicknacks and mementoes would cost i would have picked up enough droppings from your conversation to pay me per cent profit in the way of the several magazine articles which i could have written whereas i can now write only one or two and am therefore largely out of pocket by your proud ways ponder these things lord what a perfectly bewitching excursion it was i traveled under an assumed name and was never molested with a polite attention from anybody love to you all yrs ever mark aldrich meantime had invited the clemenses to ponkapog during the bermuda absence and clemens hastened to send him a line expressing regrets at the close he said to t b aldrich in ponkapog mass farmington avenue hartford june day after tomorrow we leave for the hills beyond elmira n y for the summer when i shall hope to write a book of some sort or other to beat the people with a work similar to your new one in the atlantic is what i mean though i have not heard what the nature of that one is immoral i suppose well you are right such books sell best howells says howells says he is going to make his next book indelicate he says he thinks there is money in it he says there is a large class of the young in schools and seminaries who but you let him tell you he has ciphered it all down to a demonstration with the warmest remembrances to the pair of you ever yours samuel l clemens clemens would naturally write something about bermuda and began at once random notes of an idle excursion and presently completed four papers which howells eagerly accepted for the atlantic then we find him plunging into another play this time alone to w d howells in boston elmira june my dear howells if you should not like the first chapters send them to me and begin with chapter or part i believe you call these things in the magazine i have finished no which closes the series and will mail it tomorrow if i think of it i like this one i liked the preceding one already mailed to you some time ago but i had my doubts about and do not hesitate to squelch them even with derision and insult today i am deep in a comedy which i began this morning principal character that old detective i skeletoned the first act and wrote the second today and am dogtired now fiftyfour close pages of ms in hours once i wrote pages at a sitting that was on the opening chapters of the gilded age novel when i cool down an hour from now i shall go to zero i judge yrs ever mark clemens had doubts as to the quality of the bermuda papers and with some reason they did not represent him at his best nevertheless they were pleasantly entertaining and howells expressed full approval of them for atlantic use the author remained troubled to w d howells in boston elmira july my dear howells it is splendid of you to say those pleasant things but i am still plagued with doubts about parts and if you have any dont print if otherwise please make some cold villain like lathrop read and pass sentence on them mind i thought they were good at first it was the second reading that accomplished its hellish purpose on me put them up for a new verdict part has lain in my pigeonhole a good while and when i put it there i had a christians confidence in aces in it and you can be sure it will skip toward connecticut tomorrow before any fatal fresh reading makes me draw my bet ive piled up ms pages on my comedy the first second and fourth acts are done and done to my satisfaction too tomorrow and next day will finish the rd act and the play i have not written less than pages any day since i began never had so much fun over anything in my lifenever such consuming interest and delight but lord bless you the second reading will fetch it and just think i had sol smith russell in my minds eye for the old detectives part and hang it he has gone off pottering with oliver optic or else the papers lie i read everything about the presidents doings there with exultation i wish that old ass of a private secretary hadnt taken me for george francis train if ignorance were a means of grace i wouldnt trade that gorillas chances for the archbishop of canterburys i shall call on the president again by and by i shall go in my war paint and if i am obstructed the nation will have the unusual spectacle of a private secretary with a pen over one ear a tomahawk over the other i read the entire atlantic this time wonderful number mrs rose terry cookes story was a tenstrike i wish she would write oldtime new england tales a year good times to you all mind if you dont run here for a few days you will go to hence without having had a foreglimpse of heaven mark the play ah sin that had done little enough in washington was that summer given another trial by augustin daly at the fifth avenue theater new york with a fine company clemens had undertaken to doctor the play and it would seem to have had an enthusiastic reception on the opening night but it was a summer audience unspoiled by many attractions ah sin was never a success in the new york season never a moneymaker on the road the reference in the first paragraph of the letter that follows is to the bermuda chapters which mark twain was publishing simultaneously in england and america elmira aug my dear howells i have mailed one set of the slips to london and told bentley you would print sept in october atlantic and he must not print earlier in temple bar have i got the dates and things right i am powerful glad to see that no reads a nation sight better in print than it did in ms i told bentley wed send him the slips each time weeks before day of publication we can do that cant we two months ahead would be still better i suppose but i dont know ah sin went abooming at the fifth avenue the reception of col sellers was calm compared to it the criticisms were just the criticisms of the great new york dailies are always just intelligent and square and honest notwithstanding by a blunder which nobody was seriously to blame for i was made to say exactly the opposite of this in a newspaper some time ago never said it at all and moreover i never thought it i could not publicly correct it before the play appeared in new york because that would look as if i had really said that thing and then was moved by fears for my pocket and my reputation to take it back but i can correct it now and shall do it for now my motives cannot be impugned when i began this letter it had not occurred to me to use you in this connection but it occurs to me now your opinion and mine uttered a year ago and repeated more than once since that the candor and ability of the new york critics were beyond question is a matter which makes it proper enough that i should speak through you at this time therefore if you will print this paragraph somewhere it may remove the impression that i say unjust things which i do not think merely for the pleasure of talking there now cant you say in a letter to mr howells of the atlantic monthly mark twain describes the reception of the new comedy ali sin and then goes on to say etc beginning at the star with the words the criticisms were just mrs clemens says dont ask that of mr howells it will be disagreeable to him i hadnt thought of it but i will bet two to one on the correctness of her instinct we shall see will you cut that paragraph out of this letter and precede it with the remarks suggested or with better ones and send it to the globe or some other paper you cant do me a bigger favor and yet if it is in the least disagreeable you mustnt think of it but let me know right away for i want to correct this thing before it grows stale again i explained myself to only one critic the world the consequence was a noble notice of the play this one called on me else i shouldnt have explained myself to him i have been putting in a deal of hard work on that play in new york but it is full of incurable defects my old plunkett family seemed wonderfully coarse and vulgar on the stage but it was because they were played in such an outrageously and inexcusably coarse way the chinaman is killingly funny i dont know when i have enjoyed anything as much as i did him the people say there isnt enough of him in the piece thats a triumph therell never be any more of him in it john brougham said read the list of things which the critics have condemned in the piece and you have unassailable proofs that the play contains all the requirements of success and a long life that is true nearly every time the audience roared i knew it was over something that would be condemned in the morning justly too but must be left in for low comedies are written for the drawingroom the kitchen and the stable and if you cut out the kitchen and the stable the drawingroom cant support the play by itself there was as much money in the house the first two nights as in the first ten of sellers havent heard from the third i came away yrs ever mark in a former letter we have seen how mark twain working on a story that was to stand as an example of his best work and become one of his surest claims to immortality the adventures of huckleberry finn displayed little enthusiasm in his undertaking in the following letter which relates the conclusion of his detective comedy we find him at the other extreme on very tiptoe with enthusiasm over something wholly without literary value or dramatic possibility one of the hallmarks of genius is the inability to discriminate as to the value of its output simon wheeler amateur detective was a dreary absurd impossible performance as wild and unconvincing in incident and dialogue as anything out of an asylum could well be the title which he first chose for it balaams ass was properly in keeping with the general scheme yet mark twain still warm with the creative fever had the fullest faith in it as a work of art and a winner of fortune it would never see the light of production of course we shall see presently that the distinguished playwright dion boucicault goodnaturedly complimented it as being better than ahi sin one must wonder what that skilled artist really thought and how he could do even this violence to his conscience to w d howells in boston elmira wednesday pm my dear howells its finished i was misled by hurried mispaging there were ten pages of notes and over pages of ms when the play was done did it in hours by the clock pages of the atlantic but then of course its very fat those are the figures but i dont believe them myself because the things impossible but let that pass all day long and every day since i finished in the rough i have been diligently altering amending rewriting cutting down i finished finally today cant think of anything else in the way of an improvement i thought i would stick to it while the interest was hot and i am mighty glad i did a week from now it will be frozen then revising would be drudgery you see i learned something from the fatal blunder of putting ah sin aside before it was finished shes all right now she reads in two hours and minutes and will play not longer than hours nineteen characters acts i bunched into tomorrow i will draw up an exhaustive synopsis to insert in the printed titlepage for copyrighting and then on friday or saturday i go to new york to remain a week or ten days and lay for an actor wish you could run down there and have a holiday twould be fun my wife wont have balaams ass therefore i call the piece capn simon wheeler the amateur detective yrs mark to w d howells in boston elmira aug my dear howells just got your letter last night no dern that article one of the bermuda chapters it made me cry when i read it in proof it was so oppressively and ostentatiously poor skim your eye over it again and you will think as i do if isaac and the prophets of baal can be doctored gently and made permissible it will redeem the thing but if it cant lets burn all of the articles except the tailend of it and use that as an introduction to the next article as i suggested in my letter to you of day before yesterday i had this proof from cambridge before yours came boucicault says my new play is ever so much better than ah sin says the amateur detective is a bully character too an actor is chawing over the play in new york to see if the old detective is suited to his abilities havent heard from him yet if youve got that paragraph by you yet and if in your judgment it would be good to publish it and if you absolutely would not mind doing it then i think id like to have you do it or else put some other words in my mouth that will be properer and publish them but mind dont think of it for a moment if it is distasteful and doubtless it is i value your judgment more than my own as to the wisdom of saying anything at all in this matter to say nothing leaves me in an injurious position and yet maybe i might do better to speak to the men themselves when i go to new york this was my latest idea and it looked wise we expect to leave here for home sept reaching there the th but we may be delayed a week curious thing i read passages from my play and a full synopsis to boucicault who was rewriting a play which he wrote and laid aside or years ago my detective is about that age you know then he read a passage from his play where a real detective does some things that are as idiotic as some of my old wheelers performances showed me the passages and behold his mans name is wheeler however his wheeler is not a prominent character so well not alter the names my wheelers name is taken from the old jumping frog sketch i am rereading ticknors diary and am charmed with it though i still say he refers to too many good things when he could just as well have told them think of the man traveling days in convoy and familiar intercourse with a band of outlaws through the mountain fastnesses of spain he the fourth stranger they had encountered in thirty years and compressing this priceless experience into a single colorless paragraph of his diary they spun yarns to this unworthy devil too i wrote you a very long letter a day or two ago but susy crane wanted to make a copy of it to keep so it has not gone yet it may go today possibly we unite in warm regards to you and yours yrs ever mark the ticknor referred to in a former letter was professor george ticknor of harvard college a historywriter of distinction on the margin of the diary mark twain once wrote ticknor is a millet who makes all men fall in love with him and adds millet was the cause of lovable qualities in people and then he admired and loved those persons for the very qualities which he without knowing it had created in them perhaps it would be strictly truer of these two men to say that they bore within them the divine something in whose presence the evil in people fled away and hid itself while all that was good in them came spontaneously forward out of the forgotten walls and comers in their systems where it was accustomed to hide it is frank millet the artist he is speaking of a knightly soul whom all the clemens household loved and who would one day meet his knightly end with those other brave men that found death together when the titanic went down the clemens family was still at quarry farm at the end of august and one afternoon there occurred a startling incident which mark twain thought worth setting down in practically duplicate letters to howells and to dr john brown it may be of interest to the reader to know that john t lewis the colored man mentioned lived to a good old age a pensioner of the clemens family and in the course of time of h h rogers howellss letter follows it is the very long letter referred to in the foregoing to w d howells and wife in boston elmira aug my dear howellses i thought i ought to make a sort of record of it for further reference the pleasantest way to do that would be to write it to somebody but that somebody would let it leak into print and that we wish to avoid the howellses would be safe so let us tell the howellses about it day before yesterday was a fine summer day away up here on the summit aunt marsh and cousin may marsh were here visiting susie crane and livy at our farmhouse by and by mother langdon came up the hill in the high carriage with nora the nurse and little jervis charley langdons little boy timothy the coachman driving behind these came charleys wife and little girl in the buggy with the new young spry gray horse a highstepper theodore crane arrived a little later the bay and susy were on hand with their nurse rosa i was on hand too susy cranes trio of colored servants ditto these being josie housemaid aunty cord cook aged turbaned very tall very broad very fine every way see her portrait in a true story just as i heard it in my sketches chocklate the laundress as the bay calls her she cant say charlotte still taller still more majestic of proportions turbaned very black straight as an indian age then there was the farmers wife colored and her little girl susy wasnt it a good audience to get up an excitement before good excitable inflammable material lewis was still down town three miles away with his twohorse wagon to get a load of manure lewis is the farmer colored he is of mighty frame and muscle stocky stooping ungainly has a good manly face and a clear eye age about and the most picturesque of men when he sits in his fluttering workday rags humped forward into a bunch with his aged slouch hat mashed down over his ears and neck it is a spectacle to make the brokenhearted smile lewis has worked mighty hard and remained mighty poor at the end of each whole years toil he cant show a gain of fifty dollars he had borrowed money of the cranes till he owed them and he being conscientious and honest imagine what it was to him to have to carry this stubborn helpless load year in and year out well sunset came and ida the young and comely charley langdons wife and her little julia and the nurse nora drove out at the gate behind the new gray horse and started down the long hill the high carriage receiving its load under the porte cochere ida was seen to turn her face toward us across the fence and intervening lawn theodore waved goodbye to her for he did not know that her sign was a speechless appeal for help the next moment livy said idas driving too fast down hill she followed it with a sort of scream her horse is running away we could see two hundred yards down that descent the buggy seemed to fly it would strike obstructions and apparently spring the height of a man from the ground theodore and i left the shrieking crowd behind and ran down the hill bareheaded and shouting a neighbor appeared at his gate a tenth of a second too late the buggy vanished past him like a thought my last glimpse showed it for one instant far down the descent springing high in the air out of a cloud of dust and then it disappeared as i flew down the road my impulse was to shut my eyes as i turned them to the right or left and so delay for a moment the ghastly spectacle of mutilation and death i was expecting i ran on and on still spared this spectacle but saying to myself i shall see it at the turn of the road they never can pass that turn alive when i came in sight of that turn i saw two wagons there bunched together one of them full of people i said just so they are staring petrified at the remains but when i got amongst that bunch there sat ida in her buggy and nobody hurt not even the horse or the vehicle ida was pale but serene as i came tearing down she smiled back over her shoulder at me and said well were alive yet arent we a miracle had been performed nothing else you see lewis the prodigious humped upon his front seat had been toiling up on his load of manure he saw the frantic horse plunging down the hill toward him on a full gallop throwing his heels as high as a mans head at every jump so lewis turned his team diagonally across the road just at the turn thus making a v with the fence the running horse could not escape that but must enter it then lewis sprang to the ground and stood in this v he gathered his vast strength and with a perfect creedmoor aim he seized the gray horses bit as he plunged by and fetched him up standing it was down hill mind you ten feet further down hill neither lewis nor any other man could have saved them for they would have been on the abrupt turn then but how this miracle was ever accomplished at all by human strength generalship and accuracy is clean beyond my comprehension and grows more so the more i go and examine the ground and try to believe it was actually done i know one thing well if lewis had missed his aim he would have been killed on the spot in the trap he had made for himself and we should have found the rest of the remains away down at the bottom of the steep ravine ten minutes later theodore and i arrived opposite the house with the servants straggling after us and shouted to the distracted group on the porch everybody safe believe it why how could they they knew the road perfectly we might as well have said it to people who had seen their friends go over niagara however we convinced them and then instead of saying something or going on crying they grew very still words could not express it i suppose nobody could do anything that night or sleep either but there was a deal of moving talk with long pauses between pictures of that flying carriage these pauses represented this picture intruded itself all the time and disjointed the talk but yesterday evening late when lewis arrived from down town he found his supper spread and some presents of books there with very complimentary writings on the flyleaves and certain very complimentary letters and more or less greenbacks of dignified denomination pinned to these letters and flyleaves and one said among other things signed by the cranes we cancel of your indebtedness to us c c the end thereof is not yet of course for charley langdon is west and will arrive ignorant of all these things today the supperroom had been kept locked and imposingly secret and mysterious until lewis should arrive but around that part of the house were gathered lewiss wife and child chocklate josie aunty cord and our rosa canvassing things and waiting impatiently they were all on hand when the curtain rose now aunty cord is a violent methodist and lewis an implacable dunker baptist those two are inveterate religious disputants the revealments having been made aunty cord said with effusion now let folks go on saying there aint no god lewis the lord sent you there to stop that horse says lewis then who sent the horse there in sich a shape but i want to call your attention to one thing when lewis arrived the other evening after saving those lives by a feat which i think is the most marvelous of any i can call to mind when he arrived hunched up on his manure wagon and as grotesquely picturesque as usual everybody wanted to go and see how he looked they came back and said he was beautiful it was so too and yet he would have photographed exactly as he would have done any day these past years that he has occupied this farm aug p s our little romance in real life is happily and satisfactorily completed charley has come listened acted and now john t lewis has ceased to consider himself as belonging to that class called the poor it has been known during some years that it was lewiss purpose to buy a thirty dollar silver watch some day if he ever got where he could afford it today ida has given him a new sumptuous gold swiss stemwinding stopwatch and if any scoffer shall say behold this thing is out of character there is an inscription within which will silence him for it will teach him that this wearer aggrandizes the watch not the watch the wearer i was asked beforehand if this would be a wise gift and i said yes the very wisest of all i know the colored race and i know that in lewiss eyes this fine toy will throw the other more valuable testimonials far away into the shade if he lived in england the humane society would give him a gold medal as costly as this watch and nobody would say it is out of character if lewis chose to wear a town clock who would become it better lewis has sound common sense and is not going to be spoiled the instant he found himself possessed of money he forgot himself in a plan to make his old father comfortable who is wretchedly poor and lives down in maryland his next act on the spot was the proffer to the cranes of the of his remaining indebtedness to them this was put off by them to the indefinite future for he is not going to be allowed to pay that at all though he doesnt know it a letter of acknowledgment from lewis contains a sentence which raises it to the dignity of literature but i beg to say humbly that inasmuch as divine providence saw fit to use me as a instrument for the saving of those presshious lives the honner conferd upon me was greater than the feat performed that is well said yrs ever mark howells was moved to use the story in the contributors club and warned clemens against letting it get into the newspapers he declared he thought it one of the most impressive things he had ever read but clemens seems never to have allowed it to be used in any form in its entirety therefore it is quite new matter to w d howells in boston hartford sept my dear howells i dont really see how the story of the runaway horse could read well with the little details of names and places and things left out they are the true life of all narrative it wouldnt quite do to print them at this time well talk about it when you come delicacy a sad sad false delicacy robs literature of the best two things among its belongings familycircle narrative and obscene stories but no matter in that better world which i trust we are all going to i have the hope and belief that they will not be denied us say twichell and i had an adventure at sea months ago which i did not put in my bermuda articles because there was not enough to it but the press dispatches bring the sequel today and now theres plenty to it a sailless wasteless chartless compassless grubless old condemned tub that has been drifting helpless about the ocean for months and a half begging bread and water like any other tramp flying a signal of distress permanently and with innocent marveling chuckleheaded bermuda niggers on board taking a pleasure excursion our ship fed the poor devils on the th of last may far out at sea and left them to bullyrag their way to new york and now they aint as near new york as they were then by miles they have drifted miles and are still drifting in the relentless gulf stream what a delicious magazine chapter it would make but i had to deny myself i had to come right out in the papers at once with my details so as to try to raise the governments sympathy sufficiently to have better succor sent them than the cutter colfax which went a little way in search of them the other day and then struck a fog and gave it up if the president were in washington i would telegraph him when i hear that the jonas smith has been found again i mean to send for one of those darkies to come to hartford and give me his adventures for an atlantic article likely you will see my todays article in the newspapers yrs ever mark the revenue cutter colfax went after the jonas smith thinking there was mutiny or other crime on board it occurs to me now that since there is only mere suffering and misery and nobody to punish it ceases to be a matter which a republican form of government will feel authorized to interfere in further dam a republican form of government clemens thought he had given up lecturing for good he was prosperous and he had no love for the platform but one day an idea popped into his head thomas nast the father of the american cartoon had delivered a successful series of illustrated lecturestalks for which he made the drawings as he went along mark twains idea was to make a combination with nast his letter gives us the plan in full to thomas nast morristown n j hartford conn my dear nast i did not think i should ever stand on a platform again until the time was come for me to say i die innocent but the same old offers keep arriving i have declined them all just as usual though sorely tempted as usual now i do not decline because i mind talking to an audience but because traveling alone is so heartbreakingly dreary and shouldering the whole show is such a cheerkilling responsibility therefore i now propose to you what you proposed to me in ten years ago when i was unknown viz that you stand on the platform and make pictures and i stand by you and blackguard the audience i should enormously enjoy meandering around to big towns dont want to go to the little ones with you for company my idea is not to fatten the lecture agents and lyceums on the spoils but put all the ducats religiously into two equal piles and say to the artist and lecturer absorb these for instance here follows a plan and a possible list of cities to be visited the letter continues call the gross receipts for four months and a half and the profit from to i try to make the figures large enough and leave it to the public to reduce them i did not put in philadelphia because pugh owns that town and last winter when i made a little readingtrip he only paid me and pretended his concert i read fifteen minutes in the midst of a concert cost him a vast sum and so he couldnt afford any more i could get up a better concert with a barrel of cats i have imagined two or three pictures and concocted the accompanying remarks to see how the thing would go i was charmed well you think it over nast and drop me a line we should have some fun yours truly samuel l clemens the plan came to nothing nast like clemens had no special taste for platforming and while undoubtedly there would have been large profits in the combination the promise of the venture did not compel his acceptance in spite of his distaste for the platform mark twain was always giving readings and lectures without charge for some worthy hartford cause he was ready to do what he could to help an entertainment along if he could do it in his own way an original way sometimes and not always gratifying to the committee whose plans were likely to be prearranged for one thing clemens supersensitive in the matter of putting himself forward in his own town often objected to any special exploitation of his name this always distressed the committee who saw a large profit to their venture in the prestige of his fame the following characteristic letter was written in selfdefense when on one such occasion a committee had become sufficiently peevish to abandon a worthy enterprise to an entertainment committee in hartford nov e s sykes esq dr sir mr burtons note puts upon me all the blame of the destruction of an enterprise which had for its object the succor of the hartford poor that is to say this enterprise has been dropped because of the dissatisfaction with mr clemenss stipulations therefore i must be allowed to say a word in my defense there were two stipulations exactly two i made one of them if the other was made at all it was a joint one from the choir and me my individual stipulation was that my name should be kept out of the newspapers the joint one was that sufficient tickets to insure a good sum should be sold before the date of the performance should be set understand we wanted a good sum i do not think any of us bothered about a good house it was money we were after now you perceive that my concern is simply with my individual stipulation did that break up the enterprise eugene burton said he would sell worth of the tickets himself mr smith said he would sell or worth himself my plan for asylum hill church would have ensured from that quarter all this in the face of my stipulation it was proposed to raise did my stipulation render the raising of or in a dozen churches impossible my stipulation is easily defensible when a mere reader or lecturer has appeared or times in a town of hartfords size he is a good deal more than likely to get a very unpleasant snub if he shoves himself forward about once or twice more therefore i long ago made up my mind that whenever i again appeared here it should be only in a minor capacity and not as a chief attraction now i placed that harmless and very justifiable stipulation before the committee the other day they carried it to headquarters and it was accepted there i am not informed that any objection was made to it or that it was regarded as an offense it seems late in the day now after a good deal of trouble has been taken and a good deal of thankless work done by the committees to suddenly tear up the contract and then turn and bowl me down from long range as being the destroyer of it if the enterprise has failed because of my individual stipulation here you have my proper and reasonable reasons for making that stipulation if it has failed because of the joint stipulation put the blame there and let us share it collectively i think our plan was a good one i do not doubt that mr burton still approves of it too i believe the objections come from other quarters and not from him mr twichell used the following words in last sundays sermon if i remember correctly my hearers the prophet deuteronomy says this wise thing though ye plan a goodly house for the poor and plan it with wisdom and do take off your coats and set to to build it with high courage yet shall the croaker presently come and lift up his voice having his coat on and say verily this plan is not well planned and he will go his way and the obstructionist will come and lift up his voice having his coat on and say behold this is but a sick plan and he will go his way and the man that knows it all will come and lift up his voice having his coat on and say lo call they this a plan then will he go his way and the places which knew him once shall know him no more forever because he was not for god took him now therefore i say unto you verily that house will not be budded and i say this also he that waiteth for all men to be satisfied with his plan let him seek eternal life for he shall need it this portion of mr twichells sermon made a great impression upon me and i was grieved that some one had not wakened me earlier so that i might have heard what went before s l clemens mr sykes of the firm of sykes newton the allen house pharmacy replied that he had read the letter to the committee and that it had set those gentlemen right who had not before understood the situation if others were as ready to do their part as yourself our poor would not want assistance he said in closing we come now to an incident which assumes the proportions of an episodeeven of a catastrophe in mark twains career the disaster was due to a condition noted a few pages earlier the inability of genius to judge its own efforts the story has now become history printed history it having been sympathetically told by howells in my mark twain and more exhaustively with a report of the speech that invited the lightning in a former work by the present writer the speech was made at john greenleaf whittiers seventieth birthday dinner given by the atlantic staff on the evening of december it was intended as a huge joke a joke that would shake the sides of these venerable boston deities longfellow emerson holmes and the rest of that venerated group clemens had been a favorite at the atlantic lunches and dinners a speech by him always an event this time he decided to outdo himself he did that but not in the way he had intended to use one of his own metaphors he stepped out to meet the rainbow and got struck by lightning his joke was not of the boston kind or size when its full nature burst upon the company when the ears of the assembled diners heard the sacred names of longfellow emerson and holmes lightly associated with human aspects removed oh very far removed from cambridge and concord a chill fell upon the diners that presently became amazement and then creeping paralysis nobody knew afterward whether the great speech that he had so gaily planned ever came to a natural end or not somebody the next on the program attempted to follow him but presently the company melted out of the doors and crept away into the night it seemed to mark twain that his career had come to an end back in hartford sweating and suffering through sleepless nights he wrote howells his anguish to w d howells in boston sunday night my dear howells my sense of disgrace does not abate it grows i see that it is going to add itself to my list of permanencies a list of humiliations that extends back to when i was seven years old and which keep on persecuting me regardless of my repentancies i feel that my misfortune has injured me all over the country therefore it will be best that i retire from before the public at present it will hurt the atlantic for me to appear in its pages now so it is my opinion and my wifes that the telephone story had better be suppressed will you return those proofs or revises to me so that i can use the same on some future occasion it seems as if i must have been insane when i wrote that speech and saw no harm in it no disrespect toward those men whom i reverenced so much and what shame i brought upon you after what you said in introducing me it burns me like fire to think of it the whole matter is a dreadful subject let me drop it here at least on paper penitently yrs mark howells sent back a comforting letter i have no idea of dropping you out of the atlantic he wrote and mr houghton has still less if possible you are going to help and not hurt us many a year yet if you will you are not going to be floored by it there is more justice than that even in this world howells added that charles elliot norton had expressed just the right feeling concerning the whole affair and that many who had not heard the speech but read the newspaper reports of it had found it without offense clemens wrote contrite letters to holmes emerson and longfellow and received most gracious acknowledgments emerson indeed had not heard the speech his faculties were already blurred by the mental mists that would eventually shut him in clemens wrote again to howells this time with less anguish to w d howells in boston hartford friday my dear howells your letter was a godsend and perhaps the welcomest part of it was your consent that i write to those gentlemen for you discouraged my hints in that direction that morning in boston rightly too for my offense was yet too new then warner has tried to hold up our hands like the good fellow he is but poor twichell could not say a word and confessed that he would rather take nearly any punishment than face livy and me he hasnt been here since it is curious but i pitched early upon mr norton as the very man who would think some generous thing about that matter whether he said it or not it is splendid to be a man like that but it is given to few to be i wrote a letter yesterday and sent a copy to each of the three i wanted to send a copy to mr whittier also since the offense was done also against him being committed in his presence and he the guest of the occasion besides holding the wellnigh sacred place he does in his peoples estimation but i didnt know whether to venture or not and so ended by doing nothing it seemed an intrusion to approach him and even livy seemed to have her doubts as to the best and properest way to do in the case i do not reverence mr emerson less but somehow i could approach him easier send me those proofs if you have got them handy i want to submit them to wylie he wont show them to anybody had a very pleasant and considerate letter from mr houghton today and was very glad to receive it you cant imagine how brilliant and beautiful that new brass fender is and how perfectly naturally it takes its place under the carved oak how they did scour it up before they sent it i lied a good deal about it when i came home so for once i kept a secret and surprised livy on a christmas morning i havent done a stroke of work since the atlantic dinner have only moped around but im going to try tomorrow how could i ever have ah well i am a great and sublime fool but then i am gods fool and all his works must be contemplated with respect livy and i join in the warmest regards to you and yours yrs ever mark longfellow in his reply said i do not believe anybody was much hurt certainly i was not and holmes tells me he was not so i think you may dismiss the matter from your mind without further remorse holmes wrote it never occurred to me for a moment to take offense or feel wounded by your playful use of my name miss ellen emerson replied for her father in a letter to mrs clemens that the speech had made no impression upon him giving at considerable length the impression it had made on herself and other members of the family clearly it was not the principals who were hurt but only those who held them in awe though one can realize that this would not make it much easier for mark twain xviii letters from europe tramping with twichell writing a new travel book life in munich whether the unhappy occurrence at the whittier dinner had anything to do with mark twains resolve to spend a year or two in europe cannot be known now there were other good reasons for going one in particular being a demand for another book of travel it was also true as he explains in a letter to his mother that his days were full of annoyances making it difficult for him to work he had a tendency to invest money in almost any glittering enterprise that came along and at this time he was involved in the promotion of a variety of patent rights that brought him no return other than assessment and vexation clemenss mother was by this time living with her son onion and his wife in iowa to mrs jane clemens in keokuk iowa hartford feb my dear mother i suppose i am the worst correspondent in the whole world and yet i grow worse and worse all the time my conscience blisters me for not writing you but it has ceased to abuse me for not writing other folks life has come to be a very serious matter with me i have a badgered harassed feeling a good part of my time it comes mainly of business responsibilities and annoyances and the persecution of kindly letters from well meaning strangers to whom i must be rudely silent or else put in the biggest half of my time bothering over answers there are other things also that help to consume my time and defeat my projects well the consequence is i cannot write a book at home this cuts my income down therefore i have about made up my mind to take my tribe and fly to some little corner of europe and budge no more until i shall have completed one of the half dozen books that lie begun up stairs please say nothing about this at present we propose to sail the th of april i shall go to fredonia to meet you but it will not be well for livy to make that trip i am afraid however we shall see i will hope she can go mr twichell has just come in so i must go to him we are all well and send love to you all affly sam he was writing few letters at this time and doing but little work there were always many social events during the winter and what with his european plans and a diligent study of the german language which the entire family undertook his days and evenings were full enough howells wrote protesting against the european travel and berating him for his silence i never was in berlin and dont know any family hotel there i should be glad i didnt if it would keep you from going you deserve to put up at the sign of the savage in vienna really its a great blow to me to hear of that prospected sojourn its a shame i must see you somehow before you go im in dreadfully low spirits about it i was afraid your silence meant something wicked clemens replied promptly urging a visit to hartford adding a postscript for mrs howells characteristic enough to warrant preservation p s to mrs howells in boston feb dear mrs howells mrs clemens wrote you a letter and handed it to me half an hour ago while i was folding mine to mr howells i laid that letter on this table before me while i added the paragraph about rs application since then i have been hunting and swearing and swearing and hunting but i cant find a sign of that letter it is the most astonishing disappearance i ever heard of mrs clemens has gone off driving so i will have to try and give you an idea of her communication from memory mainly it consisted of an urgent desire that you come to see us next week if you can possibly manage it for that will be a reposeful time the turmoil of breaking up beginning the week after she wants you to tell her about italy and advise her in that connection if you will then she spoke of her plans hers mind you for i never have anything quite so definite as a plan she proposes to stop a fortnight in confound the place ive forgotten what it was then go and live in dresden till sometime in the summer then retire to switzerland for the hottest season then stay a while in venice and put in the winter in munich this program subject to modifications according to circumstances she said something about some little bytrips here and there but they didnt stick in my memory because the idea didnt charm me they have just telephoned me from the courant office that bayard taylor and family have taken rooms in our ship the holsatia for the th april do come if you possibly can and remember and dont forget to avoid letting mrs clemens find out i lost her letter just answer her the same as if you had got it sincerely yours s l clemens the howellses came as invited for a final reunion before the breaking up this was in the early half of march the clemenses were to sail on the th of the following month orion clemens meantime had conceived a new literary idea and was piling in his ms as fast as possible to get his brothers judgment on it before the sailingdate it was not a very good time to send ms but mark twain seems to have read it and given it some consideration the journey in heaven of his own which he mentions was the story published so many years later under the title of captain stormfields visit to heaven he had began it in on his voyage to san francisco it having been suggested by conversations with capt ned wakeman of one of the pacific steamers wakeman also appears in roughing it chap l as capt ned blakely and again in one of the rambling notes of an idle excursion as captain hurricane jones to orion clemens in keokuk hartford mch my dear bro every man must learn his trade not pick it up god requires that he learn it by slow and painful processes the apprenticehand in blacksmithing in medicine in literature in everything is a thing that cant be hidden it always shows but happily there is a market for apprentice work else the innocents abroad would have had no sale happily too theres a wider market for some sorts of apprentice literature than there is for the very best of journeywork this work of yours is exceedingly crude but i am free to say it is less crude than i expected it to be and considerably better work than i believed you could do it is too crude to offer to any prominent periodical so i shall speak to the n y weekly people to publish it there will be to bury it why could not same good genius have sent me to the n y weekly with my apprentice sketches you should not publish it in book form at all for this reason it is only an imitation of verne it is not a burlesque but i think it may be regarded as proof that verne cannot be burlesqued in accompanying notes i have suggested that you vastly modify the first visit to hell and leave out the second visit altogether nobody would or ought to print those things you are not advanced enough in literature to venture upon a matter requiring so much practice let me show you what a man has got to go through nine years ago i mapped out my journey in heaven i discussed it with literary friends whom i could trust to keep it to themselves i gave it a deal of thought from time to time after a year or more i wrote it up it was not a success five years ago i wrote it again altering the plan that ms is at my elbow now it was a considerable improvement on the first attempt but still it wouldnt do last year and year before i talked frequently with howells about the subject and he kept urging me to do it again so i thought and thought at odd moments and at last i struck what i considered to be the right plan mind i have never altered the ideas from the first the plan was the difficulty when howells was here last i laid before him the whole story without referring to my ms and he said you have got it sure this time but drop the idea of making mere magazine stuff of it dont waste it print it by itself publish it first in england ask dean stanley to endorse it which will draw some of the teeth of the religious press and then reprint in america i doubt my ability to get dean stanley to do anything of the sort but i shall do the rest and this is all a secret which you must not divulge now look here i have tried all these years to think of some way of doing hell too and have always had to give it up hell in my book will not occupy five pages of ms i judge it will be only covert hints i suppose and quickly dropped i may end by not even referring to it and mind you in my opinion you will find that you cant write up hell so it will stand printing neither howells nor i believe in hell or the divinity of the savior but no matter the savior is none the less a sacred personage and a man should have no desire or disposition to refer to him lightly profanely or otherwise than with the profoundest reverence the only safe thing is not to introduce him or refer to him at all i suspect i have entirely rewritten one book perhaps times changing the plan every time pages of ms wasted and burned and shall tackle it again one of these years and maybe succeed at last therefore you need not expect to get your book right the first time go to work and revamp or rewrite it god only exhibits his thunder and lightning at intervals and so they always command attention these are gods adjectives you thunder and lightning too much the reader ceases to get under the bed by and by mr perkins will send you and ma your checks when we are gone but dont write him ever except a single line in case he forgets the checks for the man is driven to death with work i see you are half promising yourself a monthly return for your book in my experience previously counted chickens never do hatch how many of mine i have counted and never a one of them but failed it is much better to hedge disappointment by not counting unexpected money is a delight the same sum is a bitterness when you expected more my time in america is growing mighty short perhaps we can manage in this way imprimis if the n y weekly people know that you are my brother they will turn that fact into an advertisement a thing of value to them but not to you and me this must be prevented i will write them a note to say you have a friend near keokuk charles s miller who has a ms for sale which you think is a pretty clever travesty on verne and if they want it they might write to him in your care then if any correspondence ensues between you and them let mollie write for you and sign your name your own hand writing representing millers keep yourself out of sight till you make a strike on your own merits there is no other way to get a fair verdict upon your merits laterive written the note to smith and with nothing in it which he can use as an advertisement im called good byelove to you both we leave here next wednesday for elmira we leave there apl or and sail th yr bro sam in the letter that follows the mention of annie and sam refers of course to the children of mrs moffett who had been pamela clemens they were grown now and annie moffett was married to charles l webster who later was to become mark twains business partner the moffetts and websters were living in fredonia at this time and clemens had been to pay them a goodby visit the taylor dinner mentioned was a farewell banquet given to bayard taylor who had been appointed minister to germany and was to sail on the ship with mark twain mark twains mother was visiting in fredonia when this letter was written to mrs jane clemens in fredonia apr my dear mother i have told livy all about annies beautiful house and about sam and charley and about charleys ingenious manufactures and his strong manhood and good promise and how glad i am that he and annie married and i have told her about annies excellent housekeeping also about the great bacon conflict i told you it was a hundred to one that neither livy nor the european powers had heard of that desolating struggle and i have told her how beautiful you are in your age and how bright your mind is with its oldtime brightness and how she and the children would enjoy you and i have told her how singularly young pamela is looking and what a fine large fellow sam is and how ill the lingering syllable my to his name fits his port and figure well pamela after thinking it over for a day or so i came near inquiring about a stateroom in our ship for sam to please you but my wiser former resolution came back to me it is not for his good that he have friends in the ship his conduct in the bacon business shows that he will develop rapidly into a manly man as soon as he is cast loose from your apron strings you dont teach him to push ahead and do and dare things for himself but you do just the reverse you are assisted in your damaging work by the tyrannous ways of a village villagers watch each other and so make cowards of each other after sam shall have voyaged to europe by himself and rubbed against the world and taken and returned its cuffs do you think he will hesitate to escort a guest into any whiskymill in fredonia when he himself has no sinful business to transact there no he will smile at the idea if he avoids this courtesy now from principle of course i find no fault with it at all only if he thinks it is principle he may be mistaken a close examination may show it is only a bowing to the tyranny of public opinion i only say it may i cannot venture to say it will hartford is not a large place but it is broader than to have ways of that sort three or four weeks ago at a moody and sankey meeting the preacher read a letter from somebody exposing the fact that a prominent clergyman had gone from one of those meetings bought a bottle of lager beer and drank it on the premises a drug store a tempest of indignation swept the town our clergymen and everybody else said the culprit had not only done an innocent thing but had done it in an open manly way and it was nobodys right or business to find fault with it perhaps this dangerous latitude comes of the fact that we never have any temperance rot going on in hartford i find here a letter from orion submitting some new matter in his story for criticism when you write him please tell him to do the best he can and bang away i can do nothing further in this matter for i have but days left in which to settle a deal of important business and answer a bushel and a half of letters i am very nearly tired to death i was so jaded and worn at the taylor dinner that i found i could not remember sentences of the speech i had memorized and therefore got up and said so and excused myself from speaking i arrived here at oclock this morning i think the next days will finish me the idea of sitting down to a job of literary criticism is simply ludicrous a young lady passenger in our ship has been placed under livys charge livy couldnt easily get out of it and did not want to on her own account but fully expected i would make trouble when i heard of it but i didnt a girl cant well travel alone so i offered no objection she leaves us at hamburg so ive got people in my care now which is just too many for a man of my unexecutive capacity i expect nothing else but to lose some of them overboard we send our loving goodbyes to all the household and hope to see you again after a spell affly yrs sam there are no other american letters of this period the clemens party which included miss clara spaulding of elmira sailed as planned on the holsatia april as before stated bayard taylor was on the ship also murat halstead and family on the eve of departure clemens sent to howells this farewell word and that reminds me ungrateful dog that i am that i owe as much to your training as the rude country jobprinter owes to the city boss who takes him in hand and teaches him the right way to handle his art i was talking to mrs clemens about this the other day and grieving because i never mentioned it to you thereby seeming to ignore it or to be unaware of it nothing that has passed under your eye needs any revision before going into a volume while all my other stuff does need so much a characteristic tribute and from the heart the first european letter came from frankfort a rest on their way to heidelberg to w d howells in boston frankfort on the main may my dear howells i only propose to write a single line to say we are still around ah i have such a deep grateful unutterable sense of being out of it all i think i foretaste some of the advantages of being dead some of the joy of it i dont read any newspapers or care for them when people tell me england has declared war i drop the subject feeling that it is none of my business when they tell me mrs tilton has confessed and mr b denied i say both of them have done that before therefore let the worn stub of the plymouth whitewash brush be brought out once more and let the faithful spit on their hands and get to work again regardless of me for i am out of it all we had almost devilish weeks at sea and i tell you bayard taylor is a really lovable man which you already knew then we staid a week in the beautiful the very beautiful city of hamburg and since then we have been fooling along hours per day by rail with a courier spending the other in hotels whose enormous bedchambers and private parlors are an overpowering marvel to me day before yesterday in cassel we had a love of a bedroom feet long and a parlor with sofas chairs a writing desk and tables scattered around here and there in it made of red silk too by george the times and times i wish you were along you could throw some fun into the journey whereas i go on day by day in a smileless state of solemn admiration what a paradise this is what clean clothes what good faces what tranquil contentment what prosperity what genuine freedom what superb government and i am so happy for i am responsible for none of it i am only here to enjoy how charmed i am when i overhear a german word which i understand with love from us to you mark p s we are not taking six days to go from hamburg to heidelberg because we prefer it quite on the contrary mrs clemens picked up a dreadful cold and sore throat on board ship and still keeps them in stock so she could only travel hours a day she wanted to dive straight through but i had different notions about the wisdom of it i found that hours a day was the best she could do before i forget it our permanent address is care messrs koester co backers heidelberg we go there tomorrow poor susy from the day we reached german soil we have required rosa to speak german to the children which they hate with all their souls the other morning in hanover susy came to us from rosa in the nursery and said in halting syllables papa vie viel uhr ist es then turned with pathos in her big eyes and said mamma i wish rosa was made in english unfinished frankfort was a brief haltingplace their destination being heidelberg they were presently located there in the beautiful schloss hotel which overlooks the old castle with its forest setting the flowing neckar and the distant valley of the rhine clemens who had discovered the location and loved it toward the end of may reported to howells his felicities part of letter to w d howells in boston schlosshotel heidelberg sunday a m may my dear howells divinely located from this airy porch among the shining groves we look down upon heidelberg castle and upon the swift neckar and the town and out over the wide green level of the rhine valley a marvelous prospect we are in a culdesac formed of hillranges and river we are on the side of a steep mountain the river at our feet is walled on its other side yes on both sides by a steep and wooded mountainrange which rises abruptly aloft from the waters edge portions of these mountains are densely wooded the plain of the rhine seen through the mouth of this pocket has many and peculiar charms for the eye our bedroom has two great glass birdcages enclosed balconies one looking toward the rhine valley and sunset the other looking up the neckar culdesac and naturally we spend nearly all our time in thesewhen one is sunny the other is shady we have tables and chairs in them we do our reading writing studying smoking and suppering in them the view from these birdcages is my despair the pictures change from one enchanting aspect to another in ceaseless procession never keeping one form half an hour and never taking on an unlovely one and then heidelberg on a dark night it is massed away down there almost right under us you know and stretches off toward the valley its curved and interlacing streets are a cobweb beaded thick with lights a wonderful thing to see then the rows of lights on the arched bridges and their glinting reflections in the water and away at the far end the eisenbahnhof with its twenty solid acres of glittering gasjets a huge garden as one may say whose every plant is a flame these balconies are the darlingest things i have spent all the morning in this north one counting big and little it has panes of glass in it so one is in effect right out in the free sunshine and yet sheltered from wind and rain and likewise doored and curtained from whatever may be going on in the bedroom it must have been a noble genius who devised this hotel lord how blessed is the repose the tranquillity of this place only two sounds the happy clamor of the birds in the groves and the muffled music of the neckar tumbling over the opposing dykes it is no hardship to lie awake awhile nights for this subdued roar has exactly the sound of a steady rain beating upon a roof it is so healing to the spirit and it bears up the thread of ones imaginings as the accompaniment bears up a song while livy and miss spaulding have been writing at this table i have sat tilted back near by with a pipe and the last atlantic and read charley warners article with prodigious enjoyment i think it is exquisite i think it must be the roundest and broadest and completest short essay he has ever written it is clear and compact and charmingly done the hotel grounds join and communicate with the castle grounds so we and the children loaf in the winding paths of those leafy vastnesses a great deal and drink beer and listen to excellent music when we first came to this hotel a couple of weeks ago i pointed to a house across the river and said i meant to rent the centre room on the d floor for a workroom jokingly we got to speaking of it as my office and amused ourselves with watching my people daily in their small grounds and trying to make out what we could of their dress c without a glass well i loafed along there one day and found on that house the only sign of the kind on that side of the river moblirte wohnung zu vermiethen i went in and rented that very room which i had long ago selected there was only one other room in the whole doublehouse unrented it occurs to me that i made a great mistake in not thinking to deliver a very bad german speech every other sentence pieced out with english at the bayard taylor banquet in new york i think i could have made it one of the features of the occasion he used this plan at a gathering of the american students in heidelberg on july th with great effect so his idea was not wasted we left hartford before the end of march and i have been idle ever since i have waited for a call to go to work i knew it would come well it began to come a week ago my notebook comes out more and more frequently every day since days ago i concluded to move my manuscript over to my den now the call is loud and decided at last so tomorrow i shall begin regular steady work and stick to it till middle of july or st august when i look for twichell we will then walk about germany or weeks and then ill go to work again perhaps in munich we both send a power of love to the howellses and we do wish you were here are you in the new house tell us about it yrs ever mark there has been no former mention in the letters of the coming of twichell yet this had been a part of the european plan mark twain had invited his walking companion to make a tramp with him through europe as his guest material for the new book would grow faster with twichell as a companion and these two in spite of their widely opposed views concerning providence and the general scheme of creation were wholly congenial comrades twichell in hartford expecting to receive the final summons to start wrote oh my do you realize mark what a symposium it is to be i do to begin with i am thoroughly tired and the rest will be worth everything to walk with you and talk with you for weeks together why its my dream of luxury august st brought twichell and the friends set out without delay on a tramp through the black forest making short excursions at first but presently extending them in the direction of switzerland mrs clemens and the others remained in heidelberg to follow at their leisure to mrs clemens her husband sent frequent reports of their wanderings it will be seen that their tramp did not confine itself to pedestrianism though they did in fact walk a great deal and mark twain in a note to his mother declared i loathe all travel except on foot the reports to mrs clemens follow letters to mrs clemens in heidelberg allerheiligen aug pm livy darling we had a rattling good time today but we came very near being left at badenbaden for instead of waiting in the waitingroom we sat down on the platform to wait where the trains come in from the other direction we sat there full ten minutes and then all of a sudden it occurred to me that that was not the right place on the train the principal of the big english school at nauheim of which mr scheiding was a teacher introduced himself to me and then he mapped out our day for us for today and tomorrow and also drew a map and gave us directions how to proceed through switzerland he had his entire school with him taking them on a prodigious trip through switzerland tickets for the round trip ten dollars apiece he has done this annually for years we took a post carriage from aachen to otterhofen for marks stopped at the pflug to drink beer and saw that pretty girl again at a distance her father mother and two brothers received me like an ancient customer and sat down and talked as long as i had any german left the big room was full of redvested farmers the gemeindrath of the district with the burgermeister at the head drinking beer and talking public business they had held an election and chosen a new member and had been drinking beer at his expense for several hours it was intensely blackforesty there was an australian there a student from stuttgart or somewhere and joe told him who i was and he laid himself out to make our course plain for us so i am certain we cant get lost between here and heidelberg we walked the carriage road till we came to that place where one sees the foot path on the other side of the ravine then we crossed over and took that for a good while we were in a dense forest and judged we were lost but met a native women who said we were all right we fooled along and got there at pm ate supper then followed down the ravine to the foot of the falls then struck into a blind path to see where it would go and just about dark we fetched up at the devils pulpit on top of the hills then home and now to bed pretty sleepy joe sends love and i send a thousand times as much my darling s l c hotel gennin livy darling we had a lovely day jogged right along with a good horse and sensible driver the last two hours right behind an open carriage filled with a pleasant german family old gentleman and pretty daughters at table dhote tonight dishes were enough for me and then i bored along tediously through the bill of fare with a backache not daring to get up and bow to the german family and leave i meant to sit it through and make them get up and do the bowing but at last joe took pity on me and said he would get up and drop them a curtsy and put me out of my misery i was grateful he got up and delivered a succession of frank and hearty bows accompanying them with an atmosphere of goodfellowship which would have made even an english family surrender of course the germans responded then i got right up and they had to respond to my salaams too so that was done we walked up a gorge and saw a tumbling waterfall which was nothing to giessbach but it made me resolve to drop you a line and urge you to go and see giessbach illuminated dont fail but take a long days rest first i love you sweetheart saml over the gemmi pass pm saturday aug livy darling joe and i have had a most noble day started to climb on foot at this morning among the grandest peaks every half hour carried us back a month in the season we left them harvesting d crop of hay at we were in july and found ripe strawberries at we were in june and gathered flowers belonging to that month at we were in may and gathered a flower which appeared in heidelberg the th of that month also forgetmenots which disappeared from heidelberg about midmay at we were in april by the flowers at noon we had rain and hail mixed and wind and enveloping fogs and considered it march at we had snowbanks above us and snowbanks below us and considered it february not good february though because in the midst of the wild desolation the forgetmenot still bloomed lovely as ever what a flower garden the gemmi pass is after i had got my hands full joe made me a paper bag which i pinned to my lapel and filled with choice specimens i gathered no flowers which i had ever gathered before except or kinds we took it leisurely and i picked all i wanted to i mailed my harvest to you a while ago dont send it to mrs brooks until you have looked it over flower by flower it will pay among the clouds and everlasting snows i found a brave and bright little forgetmenot growing in the very midst of a smashed and tumbled stonedebris just as cheerful as if the barren and awful domes and ramparts that towered around were the blessed walls of heaven i thought how lilly warner would be touched by such a gracious surprise if she instead of i had seen it so i plucked it and have mailed it to her with a note our walk was hours the last down a path as steep as a ladder almost cut in the face of a mighty precipice people are not allowed to ride down it this part of the days work taxed our knees i tell you we have been loafing about this village leukerbad for an hour now we stay here over sunday not tired at all joes hat fell over the precipice so he came here bareheaded i love you my darling saml st nicholas aug th livy darling we came through awhooping today hours tramp up steep hills and down steep hills in mud and water shoedeep and in a steady pouring rain which never moderated a moment i was as chipper and fresh as a lark all the way and arrived without the slightest sense of fatigue but we were soaked and my shoes full of water so we ate at once stripped and went to bed for hours while our traps were thoroughly dried and our boots greased in addition then we put our clothes on hot and went to table dhote made some nice english friends and shall see them at zermatt tomorrow gathered a small bouquet of new flowers but they got spoiled i sent you a safetymatch box full of flowers last night from leukerbad i have just telegraphed you to wire the family news to me at riffel tomorrow i do hope you are all well and having as jolly a time as we are for i love you sweetheart and also in a measure the bays little susys word for babies give my love to clara spaulding and also to the cubs saml this as far as it goes is a truer and better account of the excursion than mark twain gave in the book that he wrote later a tramp abroad has a quality of burlesque in it which did not belong to the journey at all but was invented to satisfy the craving for what the public conceived to be mark twains humor the serious portions of the book are much more pleasing more like himself the entire journey as will be seen lasted one week more than a month twichell also made his reports home some of which give us interesting pictures of his walking partner in one place he wrote mark is a queer fellow there is nothing he so delights in as a swift strong stream you can hardly get him to leave one when once he is within the influence of its fascinations twichell tells how at kandersteg they were out together one evening where a brook comes plunging down from gasternthal and how he pushed in a drift to see it go racing along the current when i got back to the path mark was running down stream after it as hard as he could go throwing up his hands and shouting in the wildest ecstasy and when a piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam below he would jump up and down and yell he said afterward that he had not been so excited in three months in other places twichell refers to his companions consideration for the feeling of others and for animals when we are driving his concern is all about the horse he cant bear to see the whip used or to see a horse pull hard after the walk over gemmi pass he wrote mark today was immensely absorbed in flowers he scrambled around and gathered a great variety and manifested the intensest pleasure in them he crowded a pocket of his notebook with his specimens and wanted more room whereupon twichell got out his needle and thread and some stiff paper he had and contrived the little paper bag to hang to the front of his vest the tramp really ended at lausanne where clemens joined his party but a short excursion to chillon and chamonix followed the travelers finally separating at geneva twichell to set out for home by way of england clemens to remain and try to write the story of their travels he hurried a goodby letter after his comrade to rev j h twichell no date dear old joe it is actually all over i was so lowspirited at the station yesterday and this morning when i woke i couldnt seem to accept the dismal truth that you were really gone and the pleasant tramping and talking at an end ah my boy it has been such a rich holiday to me and i feel under such deep and honest obligations to you for coming i am putting out of my mind all memory of the times when i misbehaved toward you and hurt you i am resolved to consider it forgiven and to store up and remember only the charming hours of the journeys and the times when i was not unworthy to be with you and share a companionship which to me stands first after livys it is justifiable to do this for why should i let my small infirmities of disposition live and grovel among my mental pictures of the eternal sublimities of the alps livy cant accept or endure the fact that you are gone but you are and we cannot get around it so take our love with you and bear it also over the sea to harmony and god bless you both mark from switzerland the clemens party worked down into italy sightseeing a diversion in which mark twain found little enough of interest he had seen most of the sights ten years before when his mind was fresh he unburdened himself to twichell and to howells after a period of suffering to j h twichell in hartford rome nov dear joe i have received your several letters and we have prodigiously enjoyed them how i do admire a man who can sit down and whale away with a pen just the same as if it was fishing or something else as full of pleasure and as void of labor i cant do it else in common decency i would when i write to you joe if i can make a book out of the matter gathered in your company over here the book is safe but i dont think i have gathered any matter before or since your visit worth writing up i do wish you were in rome to do my sightseeing for me rome interests me as much as east hartford could and no more that is the rome which the average tourist feels an interest in but there are other things here which stir me enough to make life worth living livy and clara spaulding are having a royal time worshiping the old masters and i as good a time gritting my ineffectual teeth over them a friend waits for me a power of love to you all amen mark in his letter to howells he said i wish i could give those sharp satires on european life which you mention but of course a man cant write successful satire except he be in a calm judicial goodhumor whereas i hate travel and i hate hotels and i hate the opera and i hate the old masters in truth i dont ever seem to be in a goodenough humor with anything to satirize it no i want to stand up before it and curse it and foam at the mouth or take a club and pound it to rags and pulp i have got in two or three chapters about wagners operas and managed to do it without showing temper but the strain of another such effort would burst me from italy the clemens party went to munich where they had arranged in advance for winter quarters clemens claims in his report of the matter to howells that he took the party through without the aid of a courier though thirty years later in some comment which he set down on being shown the letter he wrote concerning this paragraph probably a lie he wrote also that they acquired a great affection for fraulein dahlweiner acquired it at once and it outlasted the winter we spent in her house to w d howells in boston no a karlstrasse e stock care fraulein dahlweiner munich nov my dear howells we arrived here night before last pretty well fagged an hour pull from rome to florence a rest there of a day and two nights then hours to bologna one nights rest then from noon to pm carried us to trent in the austrian tyrol where the confounded hotel had not received our message and so at that miserable hour in that snowy region the tribe had to shiver together in fireless rooms while beds were prepared and warmed then up at in the morning and a noble view of snowpeaks glittering in the rich light of a full moon while the hoteldevils lazily deranged a breakfast for us in the dreary gloom of blinking candles then a solid hours pull through the loveliest snow ranges and snowdraped forest and at pm we hauled up in drizzle and fog at the domicile which had been engaged for us ten months before munich did seem the horriblest place the most desolate place the most unendurable place and the rooms were so small the conveniences so meagre and the porcelain stoves so grim ghastly dismal intolerable so livy and clara spaulding sat down forlorn and cried and i retired to a private place to pray by and by we all retired to our narrow german beds and when livy and i finished talking across the room it was all decided that we would rest hours then pay whatever damages were required and straightway fly to the south of france but you see that was simply fatigue next morning the tribe fell in love with the rooms with the weather with munich and head over heels in love with fraulein dahlweiner we got a larger parlor an ample one threw two communicating bedrooms into one for the children and now we are entirely comfortable the only apprehension at present is that the climate may not be just right for the children in which case we shall have to go to france but it will be with the sincerest regret now i brought the tribe through from rome myself we never had so little trouble before the next time anybody has a courier to put out to nurse i shall not be in the market last night the forlornities had all disappeared so we gathered around the lamp after supper with our beer and my pipe and in a condition of grateful snugness tackled the new magazines i read your new story aloud amid thunders of applause and we all agreed that captain jenness and the old man with the accordionhat are lovely people and most skillfully drawn and that cabinboy too we like of course we are all glad the girl is gone to venice for there is no place like venice now i easily understand that the old man couldnt go because you have a purpose in sending lyddy by herself but you could send the old man over in another ship and we particularly want him along suppose you dont need him there what of that cant you let him feed the doves cant you let him fall in the canal occasionally cant you let his goodnatured purse be a daily prey to guides and beggarboys cant you let him find peace and rest and fellowship under pere jacopos kindly wing however you are writing the book not i still i am one of the people you are writing it for you understand i only want to insist in a friendly way that the old man shall shed his sweet influence frequently upon the page that is all the first time we called at the convent pere jacopo was absent the next just at this moment miss spaulding spoke up and said something about pere jacopo there is more in this acting of one mind upon another than people think time he was there and gave us preserved roseleaves to eat and talked about you and mrs howells and winnie and brought out his photographs and showed us a picture of the library of your new house but not so it was the study in your cambridge house he was very sweet and good he called on us next day the day after that we left venice after a pleasant sojourn of or weeks he expects to spend this winter in munich and will see us often he said pretty soon i am going to write something and when i finish it i shall know whether to put it to itself or in the contributors club that contributors club was a most happy idea by the way i think that the man who wrote the paragraph beginning at the bottom of page has said a mighty sound and sensible thing i wish his suggestion could be adopted it is lovely of you to keep that old pipe in such a place of honor while it occurs to me i must tell you susies last she is sorely badgered with dreams and her stock dream is that she is being eaten up by bears she is a grave and thoughtful child as you will remember last night she had the usual dream this morning she stood apart after telling it for some time looking vacantly at the floor and absorbed in meditation at last she looked up and with the pathos of one who feels he has not been dealt by with evenhanded fairness said but mamma the trouble is that i am never the bear but always the person it would not have occurred to me that there might be an advantage even in a dream in occasionally being the eater instead of always the party eaten but i easily perceived that her point was well taken im sending to heidelberg for your letter and winnies and i do hope they havent been lost my wife and i send love to you all yrs ever mark the howells story running at this time in the atlantic and so much enjoyed by the clemens party was the lady of the aroostook the suggestions made for enlarging the part of the old man are eminently characteristic mark twains fortythird birthday came in munich and in his letter conveying this fact to his mother we get a brief added outline of the daily life in that old bavarian city certainly it would seem to have been a quieter and more profitable existence than he had known amid the confusion of things left behind in america to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in america no a karlstrasse dec munich my dear mother and sister i broke the back of life yesterday and started downhill toward old age this fact has not produced any effect upon me that i can detect i suppose we are located here for the winter i have a pleasant workroom a mile from here where i do my writing the walk to and from that place gives me what exercise i need and all i take we staid three weeks in venice a week in florence a fortnight in rome and arrived here a couple of weeks ago livy and miss spaulding are studying drawing and german and the children have a german daygoverness i cannot see but that the children speak german as well as they do english susie often translates livys orders to the servants i cannot work and study german at the same time so i have dropped the latter and do not even read the language except in the morning paper to get the news we have all pretty good health latterly and have seldom had to call the doctor the children have been in the open air pretty constantly for months now in venice they were on the water in the gondola most of the time and were great friends with our gondolier and in rome and florence they had long daily tramps for rosa is a famous hand to smell out the sights of a strange place here they wander less extensively the family all join in love to you all and to orion and mollie affly your son sam xix letters return to america the great grant reunion life went on very well in munich each day the family fell more in love with fraulein dahlweiner and her house mark twain however did not settle down to his work readily his pleasant workroom provided exercise but no inspiration when he discovered he could not find his swiss notebook he was ready to give up his travelwriting altogether in the letter that follows we find him much less enthusiastic concerning his own performances than over the story by howells which he was following in the atlantic the detective chapter mentioned in this letter was not included in a tramp abroad it was published separately as the stolen white elephant in a volume bearing that title the play which he had now found dreadfully witless and flat was no other than simon wheeler detective which he had once regarded so highly the stewart referred to was the millionaire merchant a t stewart whose body was stolen in the expectation of reward to w d howells in boston munich jan my dear howells its no use your letter miscarried in some way and is lost the consul has made a thorough search and says he has not been able to trace it it is unaccountable for all the letters i did not want arrived without a single grateful failure well i have readup now as far as you have got that is to where theres a storm at sea approaching and we three think you are clear outhowellsing howells if your literature has not struck perfection now we are not able to see what is lacking it is all such truth truth to the life every where your pen falls it leaves a photograph i did imagine that everything had been said about life at sea that could be said but no matter it was all a failure and lies nothing but lies with a thin varnish of fact only you have stated it as it absolutely is and only you see people and their ways and their insides and outsides as they are and make them talk as they do talk i think you are the very greatest artist in these tremendous mysteries that ever lived there doesnt seem to be anything that can be concealed from your awful allseeing eye it must be a cheerful thing for one to live with you and be aware that you are going up and down in him like another conscience all the time possibly you will not be a fully accepted classic until you have been dead a hundred years it is the fate of the shakespeares and of all genuine prophets but then your books will be as common as bibles i believe youre not a weed but an oak not a summerhouse but a cathedral in that day i shall still be in the cyclopedias too thus mark twain history and occupation unknown but he was personally acquainted with howells there i could sing your praises all day and feel and believe every bit of it my book is half finished i wish to heaven it was done i have given up writing a detective novel cant write a novel for i lack the faculty but when the detectives were nosing around after stewarts loud remains i threw a chapter into my present book in which i have very extravagantly burlesqued the detective business if it is possible to burlesque that business extravagantly you know i was going to send you that detective play so that you could rewrite it well i didnt do it because i couldnt find a single idea in it that could be useful to you it was dreadfully witless and flat i knew it would sadden you and unfit you for work i have always been sorry we threw up that play embodying orion which you began it was a mistake to do that do keep that ms and tackle it again it will work out all right you will see i dont believe that that character exists in literature in so welldeveloped a condition as it exists in orions person now wont you put orion in a story then he will go handsomely into a play afterwards how deliciously you could paint him it would make fascinating reading the sort that makes a reader laugh and cry at the same time for orion is as good and ridiculous a soul as ever was ah to think of bayard taylor it is too sad to talk about i was so glad there was not a single sting and so many good praiseful words in the atlantics criticism of deukalion love to you all yrs ever mark we remain here till middle of march in a tramp abroad there is an incident in which the author describes himself as hunting for a lost sock in the dark in a vast hotel bedroom at heilbronn the account of the real incident as written to twichell seems even more amusing the yarn about the limburger cheese and the box of guns like the stolen white elephant did not find place in the travelbook but was published in the same volume with the elephant story added to the rambling notes of an idle excursion with the discovery of the swiss notebook work with mark twain was going better his letter reflects his enthusiasm to rev j h twichell in hartford munich jan dear old joe sunday your delicious letter arrived exactly at the right time it was laid by my plate as i was finishing breakfast at noon livy and clara spaulding arrived from church minutes later i took a pipe and spread myself out on the sofa and livy sat by and read and i warmed to that butcher the moment he began to swear there is more than one way of praying and i like the butchers way because the petitioner is so apt to be in earnest i was peculiarly alive to his performance just at this time for another reason to wit last night i awoke at this morning and after raging to my self for interminable hours i gave it up i rose assumed a catlike stealthiness to keep from waking livy and proceeded to dress in the pitch dark slowly but surely i got on garment after garment all down to one sock i had one slipper on and the other in my hand well on my hands and knees i crept softly around pawing and feeling and scooping along the carpet and among chairlegs for that missing sock i kept that up and still kept it up and kept it up at first i only said to myself blame that sock but that soon ceased to answer my expletives grew steadily stronger and stronger and at last when i found i was lost i had to sit flat down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with the profane explosion that was trying to get out of me i could see the dim blur of the window but of course it was in the wrong place and could give me no information as to where i was but i had one comfort i had not waked livy i believed i could find that sock in silence if the night lasted long enough so i started again and softly pawed all over the place and sure enough at the end of half an hour i laid my hand on the missing article i rose joyfully up and butted the washbowl and pitcher off the stand and simply raisedso to speak livy screamed then said who is that what is the matter i said there aint anything the matter im hunting for my sock she said are you hunting for it with a club i went in the parlor and lit the lamp and gradually the fury subsided and the ridiculous features of the thing began to suggest themselves so i lay on the sofa with notebook and pencil and transferred the adventure to our big room in the hotel at heilbronn and got it on paper a good deal to my satisfaction i found the swiss notebook some time ago when it was first lost i was glad of it for i was getting an idea that i had lost my faculty of writing sketches of travel therefore the loss of that notebook would render the writing of this one simply impossible and let me gracefully out i was about to write to bliss and propose some other book when the confounded thing turned up and down went my heart into my boots but there was now no excuse so i went solidly to work tore up a great part of the ms written in heidelberg wrote and tore up continued to write and tear up and at last reward of patient and noble persistence my pen got the old swing again since then im glad providence knew better what to do with the swiss notebook than i did for i like my work now exceedingly and often turn out over ms pages a day and then quit sorry that heaven makes the days so short one of my discouragements had been the belief that my interest in this tour had been so slender that i couldnt gouge matter enough out of it to make a book what a mistake ive got pages written not a word in it about the sea voyage yet i stepped my foot out of heidelberg for the first time yesterday and then only to take our party of four on our first pedestrian tour to heilbronn ive got them dressed elaborately in walking costume knapsacks canteens fieldglasses leather leggings patent walking shoes muslin folds around their hats with long tails hanging down behind sun umbrellas and alpenstocks they go all the way to wimpfen by railthence to heilbronn in a chance vegetable cart drawn by a donkey and a cow i shall fetch them home on a raft and if other people shall perceive that that was no pedestrian excursion they themselves shall not be conscious of it this trip will take pages or more oh goodness knows how many for the mood is everything not the material and i already seem to see pages rising before me on that trip then i propose to leave heidelberg for good dont you see the book ms pages may really be finished before i ever get to switzerland but theres one thing i want to tell frank bliss and his father to be charitable toward me in that is let me tear up all the ms i want to and give me time to write more i shant waste the time i havent the slightest desire to loaf but a consuming desire to work ever since i got back my swing and you see this book is either going to be compared with the innocents abroad or contrasted with it to my disadvantage i think i can make a book that will be no dead corpse of a thing and i mean to do my level best to accomplish that my crude plans are crystalizing as the thing stands now i went to europe for three purposes the first you know and must keep secret even from the blisses the second is to study art and the third to acquire a critical knowledge of the german language my ms already shows that the two latter objects are accomplished it shows that i am moving about as an artist and a philologist and unaware that there is any immodesty in assuming these titles having three definite objects has had the effect of seeming to enlarge my domain and give me the freedom of a loose costume it is three strings to my bow too well your butcher is magnificent he wont stay out of my mind i keep trying to think of some way of getting your account of him into my book without his being offended and yet confound him there isnt anything you have said which he would see any offense in im only thinking of his friends they are the parties who busy themselves with seeing things for people but im bound to have him in im putting in the yarn about the limburger cheese and the box of guns too mighty glad howells declined it it seems to gather richness and flavor with age i have very nearly killed several companies with that narrative the american artists club here for instance and smith and wife and miss griffith they were here in this house a week or two ive got other chapters that pretty nearly destroyed the same parties too o switzerland the further it recedes into the enriching haze of time the more intolerably delicious the charm of it and the cheer of it and the glory and majesty and solemnity and pathos of it grow those mountains had a soul they thought they spoke one couldnt hear it with the ears of the body but what a voice it was and how real deep down in my memory it is sounding yet alp calleth unto alp that stately old scriptural wording is the right one for gods alps and gods ocean how puny we were in that awful presence and how painless it was to be so how fitting and right it seemed and how stingless was the sense of our unspeakable insignificance and lord how pervading were the repose and peace and blessedness that poured out of the heart of the invisible great spirit of the mountains now what is it there are mountains and mountains and mountains in this world but only these take you by the heartstrings i wonder what the secret of it is well time and time again it has seemed to me that i must drop everything and flee to switzerland once more it is a longing a deep strong tugging longing that is the word we must go again joe october days let us get up at dawn and breakfast at the tower i should like that first rate livy and all of us send deluges of love to you and harmony and all the children i dreamed last night that i woke up in the library at home and your children were frolicing around me and julia was sitting in my lap you and harmony and both families of warners had finished their welcomes and were filing out through the conservatory door wrecking patricks flower pots with their dress skirts as they went peace and plenty abide with you all mark i want the blisses to know their part of this letter if possible they will see that my delay was not from choice following the life of mark twain whether through his letters or along the sequence of detailed occurrence we are never more than a little while or a little distance from his brother orion in one form or another orion is ever present his inquiries his proposals his suggestions his plans for improving his own fortunes command our attention he was one of the most human creatures that ever lived indeed his humanity excluded every form of artificiality everything that needs to be acquired talented trusting childlike carried away by the impulse of the moment despite a keen sense of humor he was never able to see that his latest plan or project was not bound to succeed mark twain loved him pitied him also enjoyed him especially with howells orions new plan to lecture in the interest of religion found its way to munich with the following result to w d howells in boston munich feb my dear howells i have just received this letter from orion take care of it for it is worth preserving i got as far as pages in my answer to it when mrs clemens shut down on it and said it was cruel and made me send the money and simply wish his lecture success i said i couldnt lose my pages so she said send them to you but i will acknowledge that i thought i was writing a very kind letter now just look at this letter of orions did you ever see the grotesquely absurd and the heartbreakingly pathetic more closely joined together mrs clemens said raise his monthly pension so i wrote to perkins to raise it a trifle now only think of it he still has pages to write on his lecture yet in one inking of his pen he has already swooped around the united states and invested the result you must put him in a book or a play right away you are the only man capable of doing it you might die at any moment and your very greatest work would be lost to the world i could write orions simple biography and make it effective too by merely stating the bald facts and this i will do if he dies before i do but you must put him into romance this was the understanding you and i had the day i sailed observe orions career that is a little of it he has belonged to as many as five different religious denominations last march he withdrew from the deaconship in a congregational church and the superintendency of its sunday school in a speech in which he said that for many months it runs in my mind that he said years he had been a confirmed infidel and so felt it to be his duty to retire from the flock after being a republican for years he wanted me to buy him a democratic newspaper a few days before the presidential election he came out in a speech and publicly went over to the democrats he prudently hedged by voting for state republicans also the new convert was made one of the secretaries of the democratic meeting and placed in the list of speakers he wrote me jubilantly of what a tenstrike he was going to make with that speech all right but think of his innocent and pathetic candor in writing me something like this a week later i was more diffident than i had expected to be and this was increased by the silence with which i was received when i came forward so i seemed unable to get the fire into my speech which i had calculated upon and presently they began to get up and go out and in a few minutes they all rose up and went away how could a man uncover such a sore as that and show it to another not a word of complaint you see only a patient sad surprise his next project was to write a burlesque upon paradise lost then learning that the times was paying harte a column for stories he concluded to write some for the same price i read his first one and persuaded him not to write any more then he read proof on the n y eve post at a week and meekly observed that the foreman swore at him and ordered him around like a steamboat mate being discharged from that post he wanted to try agriculture was sure he could make a fortune out of a chicken farm i gave him and he went to a tenhouse village a miles above keokuk on the river bank this place was a railway station he soon asked for money to buy a horse and light wagon because the trains did not run at church time on sunday and his wife found it rather far to walk for a long time i answered demands for loans and by next mail always received his check for the interest due me to date in the most guileless way he let it leak out that he did not underestimate the value of his custom to me since it was not likely that any other customer of mine paid his interest quarterly and this enabled me to use my capital twice in months instead of only once but alas when the debt at last reached or i have forgotten which the interest ate too formidably into his borrowings and so he quietly ceased to pay it or speak of it at the end of two years i found that the chicken farm had long ago been abandoned and he had moved into keokuk later in one of his casual moments he observed that there was no money in fattening a chicken on cents worth of corn and then selling it for finally if i would lend him a year for two years this was or years ago he knew he could make a success as a lawyer and would prove it this is the pension which we have just increased to the first year his legal business brought him it also brought him an unremunerative case where some villains were trying to chouse some negro orphans out of he still has this case he has waggled it around through various courts and made some booming speeches on it the negro children have grown up and married off now i believe and their litigated townlot has been dug up and carted off by somebody but orion still infests the courts with his documents and makes the welkin ring with his venerable case the second year he didnt make anything the third he made and i made bliss put a case in his hands about half an hours work orion charged for it bliss paid him thus four or five years of laving has brought him but this will doubtless be increased when he gets done lecturing and buys that law library meantime his office rent has been a year and he has stuck to that lair day by day as patiently as a spider then he by and by conceived the idea of lecturing around america as mark twains brother that to be on the bills subject of proposed lecture on the formation of character i protested and he got on his warpaint couched his lance and ran a bold tilt against total abstinence and the red ribbon fanatics it raised a fine row among the virtuous keokukians i wrote to encourage him in his good work but i had let a mail intervene so by the time my letter reached him he was already winning laurels as a red ribbon howler afterward he took a rabid part in a prayermeeting epidemic dropped that to travesty jules verne dropped that in the middle of the last chapter last march to digest the matter of an infidel book which he proposed to write and now he comes to the surface to rescue our noble and beautiful religion from the sacrilegious talons of bob ingersoll now come dont fool away this treasure which providence has laid at your feet but take it up and use it one can let his imagination run riot in portraying orion for there is nothing so extravagant as to be out of character with him wellgoodbye and a short life and a merry one be yours poor old methusaleh how did he manage to stand it so long yrs ever mark to orion clemens unsent and inclosed with the foregoing to w d howells munich feb my dear bro yours has just arrived i enclose a draft on hartford for you will have abandoned the project you wanted it for by the time it arrives but no matter apply it to your newer and present project whatever it is you see i have an ineradicable faith in your unsteadfastness but mind you i didnt invent that faith you conferred it on me yourself but fire away fire away i dont see why a changeable man shouldnt get as much enjoyment out of his changes and transformations and transfigurations as a steadfast man gets out of standing still and pegging at the same old monotonous thing all the time that is to say i dont see why a kaleidoscope shouldnt enjoy itself as much as a telescope nor a grindstone have as good a time as a whetstone nor a barometer as good a time as a yardstick i dont feel like girding at you any more about fickleness of purpose because i recognize and realize at last that it is incurable but before i learned to accept this truth each new weekly project of yours possessed the power of throwing me into the most exhausting and helpless convulsions of profanity but fire away now your magic has lost its might i am able to view your inspirations dispassionately and judicially now and say this one or that one or the other one is not up to your average flight or is above it or below it and so without passion or prejudice or bias of any kind i sit in judgment upon your lecture project and say it was up to your average it was indeed above it for it had possibilities in it and even practical ones while i was not sorry you abandoned it i should not be sorry if you had stuck to it and given it a trial but on the whole you did the wise thing to lay it aside i think because a lecture is a most easy thing to fail in and at your time of life and in your own town such a failure would make a deep and cruel wound in your heart and in your pride it was decidedly unwise in you to think for a moment of coming before a community who knew you with such a course of lectures because keokuk is not unaware that you have been a swedenborgian a presbyterian a congregationalist and a methodist on probation and that just a year ago you were an infidel if keokuk had gone to your lecture course it would have gone to be amused not instructed for when a man is known to have no settled convictions of his own he cant convince other people they would have gone to be amused and that would have been a deep humiliation to you it could have been safe for you to appear only where you were unknown then many of your hearers would think you were in earnest and they would be right you are in earnest while your convictions are new but taking it by and large you probably did best to discard that project altogether but i leave you to judge of that for you are the worst judge i know of unfinished that mark twain in many ways was hardly less childlike than his brother is now and again revealed in his letters he was of steadfast purpose and he possessed the driving power which orion clemens lacked but the importance to him of some of the smaller matters of life as shown in a letter like the following bespeaks a certain simplicity of nature which he never outgrew to rev j h twichell in hartford munich feb dear old joe it was a mighty good letter joe and that idea of yours is a rattling good one but i have not sot down here to answer your letter for it is down at my study but only to impart some information for a months i had not shaved without crying id spend of an hour whetting away on my hand no use couldnt get an edge tried a razor stropsame result so i sat down and put in an hour thinking out the mystery then it seemed plain to wit my hand cant give a razor an edge it can only smooth and refine an edge that has already been given i judge that a razor fresh from the hone is this shape v the long point being the continuation of the edge and that after much use the shape is this v the attenuated edge all worn off and gone by george i knew that was the explanation and i knew that a freshly honed and freshly strapped razor wont cut but after strapping on the hand as a final operation it will cut so i sent out for an oilstone none to be had but messenger brought back a little piece of rock the size of a safetymatch box it was bought in a shoemakers shop bad flaw in middle of it too but i put drops of fine olive oil on it picked out the razor marked thursday because it was never any account and would be no loss if i spoiled it gave it a brisk and reckless honing for minutes then tried it on a hair it wouldnt cut then i trotted it through a vigorous minute course on a razorstrap and tried it on a hairit wouldnt cut tried it on my face it made me cry gave it a minute stropping on my hand and my land what an edge she had we thought we knew what sharp razors were when we were tramping in switzerland but it was a mistake they were dull beside this old thursday razor of mine which i mean to name thursday october christian in gratitude i took my whetstone and in minutes i put two more of my razors in splendid condition but i leave them in the box i never use any but thursday o c and shant till its edge is gone and then ill know how to restore it without any delay we all go to paris next thursday address monroe co bankers with love ys ever mark in paris they found pleasant quarters at the hotel normandy but it was a chilly rainy spring and the travelers gained a rather poor impression of the french capital mark twains work did not go well at first because of the noises of the street but then he found a quieter corner in the hotel and made better progress in a brief note to aldrich he said i sleep like a lamb and write like a lion i mean the kind of a lion that writes if any such he expected to finish the book in six weeks that is to say before returning to america he was looking after its illustrations himself and a letter to frank bliss of the american publishing company refers to the frontpiece which from time to time has caused question as to its origin to bliss he says it is a thing which i manufactured by pasting a popular comic picture into the middle of a celebrated biblical one shall attribute it to titian it needs to be engraved by a master the weather continued bad in france and they left there in july to find it little better in england they had planned a journey to scotland to visit doctor brown whose health was not very good in after years mark twain blamed himself harshly for not making the trip which he declared would have meant so much to mrs clemens he had forgotten by that time the real reasons for not going the continued storms and uncertainty of trains which made it barely possible for them to reach liverpool in time for their sailingdate and with characteristic selfreproach vowed that only perversity and obstinacy on his part had prevented the journey to scotland from liverpool on the eve of sailing he sent doctor brown a goodby word to dr john brown in edinburgh washington hotel lime street liverpool aug my dear mr brown during all the months we have been spending on the continent we have been promising ourselves a sight of you as our latest and most prized delight in a foreign land but our hope has failed our plan has miscarried one obstruction after another intruded itself and our short sojourn of three or four weeks on english soil was thus frittered gradually away and we were at last obliged to give up the idea of seeing you at all it is a great disappointment for we wanted to show you how much megalopis has grown she is now and what a fine creature her sister is and how prettily they both speak german there are six persons in my party and they are as difficult to cart around as nearly any other menagerie would be my wife and miss spaulding are along and you may imagine how they take to heart this failure of our long promised edinburgh trip we never even wrote you because we were always so sure from day to day that our affairs would finally so shape themselves as to let us get to scotland but no everything went wrong we had only flying trips here and there in place of the leisurely ones which we had planned we arrived in liverpool an hour ago very tired and have halted at this hotel by the advice of misguided friends and if my instinct and experience are worth anything it is the very worst hotel on earth without any exception we shall move to another hotel early in the morning to spend tomorrow we sail for america next day in the gallic we all join in the sincerest love to you and in the kindest remembrance to jock son of doctor brown and your sister truly yours s l clemens it was september that mark twain returned to america by the steamer gallic in the seventeen months of his absence he had taken on a traveled look and had added gray hairs a new york paper said of his arrival that he looked older than when he went to germany and that his hair had turned quite gray mark twain had not finished his book of travel in paris in fact it seemed to him far from complete and he settled down rather grimly to work on it at quarry farm when after a few days no word of greeting came from howells clemens wrote to ask if he were dead or only sleeping howells hastily sent a line to say that he had been sleeping the sleep of a torpid conscience i will feign that i did not know where to write you but i love you and all of yours and i am tremendously glad that you are home again when and where shall we meet have you come home with your pockets full of atlantic papers clemens toiling away at his book was as usual not without the prospect of other plans orion as literary material never failed to excite him to w d howells in boston elmira sept my dear howells when and where here on the farm would be an elegant place to meet but of course you cannot come so far so we will say hartford or belmont about the beginning of november the date of our return to hartford is uncertain but will be three or four weeks hence i judge i hope to finish my book here before migrating i think maybe ive got some atlantic stuff in my head but theres none in ms i believe say a friend of mine wants to write a play with me i to furnish the broadcomedy cuss i dont know anything about his ability but his letter serves to remind me of our old projects if you havent used orion or old wakeman dont you think you and i can get together and grind out a play with one of those fellows in it orion is a field which grows richer and richer the more he mulches it with each new topdressing of religion or other guano drop me an immediate line about this wont you i imagine i see orion on the stage always gentle always melancholy always changing his politics and religion and trying to reform the world always inventing something and losing a limb by a new kind of explosion at the end of each of the four acts poor old chap he is good material i can imagine his wife or his sweetheart reluctantly adopting each of his new religious in turn just in time to see him waltz into the next one and leave her isolated once more mem orions wife has followed him into the outer darkness after years rabid membership in the presbyterian church well with the sincerest and most abounding love to you and yours from all this family i am yrs ever mark the idea of the play interested howells but he had twinges of conscience in the matter of using orion as material he wrote more than once i have taken the skeleton of that comedy of ours and viewed it with tears i really have a compunction or two about helping to put your brother into drama you can say that he is your brother to do what you like with him but the alien hand might inflict an incurable hurt on his tender heart as a matter of fact orion clemens had a keen appreciation of his own shortcomings and would have enjoyed himself in a play as much as any observer of it indeed it is more than likely that he would have been pleased at the thought of such distinguished dramatization from the next letter one might almost conclude that he had received a hint of this plan and was bent upon supplying rich material to w d howells in boston elmira oct my dear howells since my return the mail facilities have enabled orion to keep me informed as to his intentions twentyeight days ago it was his purpose to complete a work aimed at religion the preface to which he had already written afterward he began to sell off his furniture with the idea of hurrying to leadville and tackling silvermining threw up his law den and took in his sign then he wrote to chicago and st louis newspapers asking for a situation as paragrapher enclosing a taste of his quality in the shape of two stanzas of humorous rhymes by a later mail on the same day he applied to new york and hartford insurance companies for copying to do however it would take too long to detail all his projects they comprise a removal to southwest missouri application for a reporters berth on a keokuk paper application for a compositors berth on a st louis paper a rehanging of his attorneys sign though it only creaks and catches no flies but last nights letter informs me that he has retackled the religious question hired a distant den to write in applied to my mother for to rebuy his furniture which has advanced in value since the sale purposes buying worth of books necessary to his labors which he had previously been borrowing and his first chapter is already on its way to me for my decision as to whether it has enough ungodliness in it or not poor orion your letter struck me while i was meditating a project to beguile you and john hay and joe twichell into a descent upon chicago which i dream of making to witness the reunion of the great commanders of the western army corps on the th of next month my sluggish soul needs a fierce upstirring and if it would not get it when grant enters the meeting place i must doubtless lay for the final resurrection can you and hay go at the same time confound it i doubt if i can go myself for this book isnt done yet but i would give a heap to be there i mean to heave some holiness into the hartford primaries when i go back and if there was a solitary office in the land which majestic ignorance and incapacity coupled with purity of heart could fill i would run for it this naturally reminds me of bret harte but let him pass we propose to leave here for new york oct reaching hartford th or th if upon reflection you howellses find you can stop over here on your way i wish you would do it and telegraph me getting pretty hungry to see you i had an idea that this was your shortest way home but like as not my geography is crippled again it usually is yrs ever mark the reunion of the great commanders mentioned in the foregoing was a welcome to general grant after his journey around the world grants trip had been one continuous ovation a triumphal march in most of his old commanders were still alive and they had planned to assemble in chicago to do him honor a presidential year was coming on but if there was anything political in the project there were no surface indications mark twain once a confederate soldier had long since been completely desouthernized at least to the point where he felt that the sight of old comrades paying tribute to the union commander would stir his blood as perhaps it had not been stirred even in that earlier time when that same commander had chased him through the missouri swamps grant indeed had long since become a hero to mark twain though it is highly unlikely that clemens favored the idea of a third term some days following the preceding letter an invitation came for him to be present at the chicago reunion but by this time he had decided not to go the letter he wrote has been preserved to gen william e strong in chicago farmington avenue hartford oct gen wm e strong chm and gentlemen of the committee i have been hoping during several weeks that it might be my good fortune to receive an invitation to be present on that great occasion in chicago but now that my desire is accomplished my business matters have so shaped themselves as to bar me from being so far from home in the first half of november it is with supreme regret that i lost this chance for i have not had a thorough stirring up for some years and i judged that if i could be in the banqueting hall and see and hear the veterans of the army of the tennessee at the moment that their old commander entered the room or rose in his place to speak my system would get the kind of upheaval it needs general grants progress across the continent is of the marvelous nature of the returning napoleons progress from grenoble to paris and as the crowning spectacle in the one case was the meeting with the old guard so likewise the crowning spectacle in the other will be our great captains meeting with his old guard and that is the very climax which i wanted to witness besides i wanted to see the general again any way and renew the acquaintance he would remember me because i was the person who did not ask him for an office however i consume your time and also wander from the point which is to thank you for the courtesy of your invitation and yield up my seat at the table to some other guest who may possibly grace it better but will certainly not appreciate its privileges more than i should with great respect i am gentlemen very truly yours s l clemens private i beg to apologize for my delay gentlemen but the card of invitation went to elmira n y and hence has only just now reached me this letter was not sent he reconsidered and sent an acceptance agreeing to speak as the committee had requested certainly there was something picturesque in the idea of the missouri private who had been chased for a rainy fortnight through the swamps of ralls county being selected now to join in welcome to his ancient enemy the great reunion was to be something more than a mere banquet it would continue for several days with processions great assemblages and much oratory mark twain arrived in chicago in good season to see it all three letters to mrs clemens intimately present his experiences his enthusiastic enjoyment and his own personal triumph the first was probably written after the morning of his arrival the doctor jackson in it was dr a reeves jackson the guidedismaying doctor of innocents abroad to mrs clemens in hartford palmer house chicago nov livy darling i am getting a trifle legweary dr jackson called and dragged me out of bed at noon yesterday and then went off i went down stairs and was introduced to some scores of people and among them an elderly german gentleman named raster who said his wife owed her life to me hurt in chicago fire and lay menaced with death a long time but the innocents abroad kept her mind in a cheerful attitude and so with the doctors help for the body she pulled through they drove me to dr jacksons and i had an hours visit with mrs jackson started to walk down michigan avenue got a few steps on my way and met an erect soldierly looking young gentleman who offered his hand said mr clemens i believe i wish to introduce myself you were pointed out to me yesterday as i was driving down street my name is grant col fred grant yes my house is not ten steps away and i would like you to come and have a talk and a pipe and let me introduce my wife so we turned back and entered the house next to jacksons and talked something more than an hour and smoked many pipes and had a sociable good time his wife is very gentle and intelligent and pretty and they have a cunning little girl nearly as big as bay but only three years old they wanted me to come in and spend an evening after the banquet with them and gen grant after this grand powwow is over but i said i was going home friday then they asked me to come friday afternoon when they and the general will receive a few friends and i said i would col grant said he and gen sherman used the innocents abroad as their guide book when they were on their travels i stepped in next door and took dr jackson to the hotel and we played billiards from to pm and then went to a beermill to meet some twenty chicago journalists talked sang songs and made speeches till oclock this morning nobody got in the least degree under the influence and we had a pleasant time read awhile in bed slept till shaved went to breakfast at noon and by mistake got into the servants hall i remained there and breakfasted with twenty or thirty male and female servants though i had a table to myself a temporary structure clothed and canopied with flags has been erected at the hotel front and connected with the secondstory windows of a drawingroom it was for gen grant to stand on and review the procession sixteen persons besides reporters had tickets for this place and a seventeenth was issued for me i was there looking down on the packed and struggling crowd when gen grant came forward and was saluted by the cheers of the multitude and the waving of ladies handkerchiefs for the windows and roofs of all neighboring buildings were massed full of life gen grant bowed to the people two or three times then approached my side of the platform and the mayor pulled me forward and introduced me it was dreadfully conspicuous the general said a word or so i replied and then said but ill step back general i dont want to interrupt your speech but im not going to make any stay where you are ill get you to make it for me general sherman came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full general and you should have heard the cheers gen logan was going to introduce me but i didnt want any more conspicuousness when the head of the procession passed it was grand to see sheridan in his military cloak and his plumed chapeau sitting as erect and rigid as a statue on his immense black horse by far the most martial figure i ever saw and the crowd roared again it was chilly and gen deems lent me his overcoat until night he came a few minutes ago pm and got it but brought gen willard who lent me his for the rest of my stay and will get another for himself when he goes home to dinner mine is much too heavy for this warm weather i have a seat on the stage at haverleys theatre tonight where the army of the tennessee will receive gen grant and where gen sherman will make a speech at midnight i am to attend a meeting of the owl club i love you ever so much my darling and am hoping to get a word from you yet saml following the procession which he describes came the grand ceremonies of welcome at haverleys theatre the next letter is written the following morning or at least soiree time the following day after a night of ratification to mrs clemens in hartford chicago nov livy darling it was a great time there were perhaps thirty people on the stage of the theatre and i think i never sat elbowtoelbow with so many historic names before grant sherman sheridan schofield pope logan augur and so on what an iron man grant is he sat facing the house with his right leg crossed over his left and his right bootsole tilted up at an angle and his left hand and arm reposing on the arm of his chair you note that position well when glowing references were made to other grandees on the stage those grandees always showed a trifle of nervous consciousness and as these references came frequently the nervous change of position and attitude were also frequent but grant he was under a tremendous and ceaseless bombardment of praise and gratulation but as true as im sitting here he never moved a muscle of his body for a single instant during minutes you could have played him on a stranger for an effigy perhaps he never would have moved but at last a speaker made such a particularly ripping and bloodstirring remark about him that the audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped and clapped an entire minute grant sitting as serene as ever when gen sherman stepped to him laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder bent respectfully down and whispered in his ear gen grant got up and bowed and the storm of applause swelled into a hurricane he sat down took about the same position and froze to it till by and by there was another of those deafening and protracted roars when sherman made him get up and bow again he broke up his attitude once more the extent of something more than a hairs breadth to indicate me to sherman when the house was keeping up a determined and persistent call for me and poor bewildered sherman who did not know me was peering abroad over the packed audience for me not knowing i was only three feet from him and most conspicuously located gen sherman was chairman one of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was ole abe the historic war eagle he stood on his perch the old savageeyed rascal three or four feet behind gen sherman and as he had been in nearly every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was probably stirred pretty often though he was too proud to let on read logans bosh and try to imagine a burly and magnificent indian in generals uniform striking a heroic attitude and getting that stuff off in the style of a declaiming schoolboy please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and i will scrapbook them i only staid at the owl club till this morning and drank little or nothing went to sleep without whisky ich liebe dish saml but it is in the third letter that we get the climax on the same day he wrote a letter to howells which in part is very similar in substance and need not be included here a paragraph however must not be omitted imagine what it was like to see a bulletshredded old battleflag reverently unfolded to the gaze of a thousand middleaged soldiers most of whom hadnt seen it since they saw it advancing over victorious fields when they were in their prime and imagine what it was like when grant their first commander stepped into view while they were still going mad over the flag and then right in the midst of it all somebody struck up when we were marching through georgia well you should have heard the thousand voices lift that chorus and seen the tears stream down if i live a hundred years i shant ever forget these things nor be able to talk about them grand times my boy grand times at the great banquet mark twains speech had been put last on the program to hold the house he had been invited to respond to the toast of the ladies but had replied that he had already responded to that toast more than once there was one class of the community he said commonly overlooked on these occasions the babies he would respond to that toast in his letter to howells he had not been willing to speak freely of his personal triumph but to mrs clemens he must tell it all and with that childlike ingenuousness which never failed him to his last day to mrs clemens in hartford chicago nov a little after in the morning ive just come to my room livy darling i guess this was the memorable night of my life by george i never was so stirred since i was born i heard four speeches which i can never forget one by emory storrs one by gen vilas o wasnt it wonderful one by gen logan mighty stirring one by somebody whose name escapes me and one by that splendid old soul col bob ingersoll oh it was just the supremest combination of english words that was ever put together since the world began my soul how handsome he looked as he stood on that table in the midst of those shouting men and poured the molten silver from his lips lord what an organ is human speech when it is played by a master all these speeches may look dull in print but how the lightning glared around them when they were uttered and how the crowd roared in response it was a great night a memorable night i am so richly repaid for my journey and how i did wish with all my whole heart that you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm as i was the army songs the military music the crashing applause lord bless me it was unspeakable out of compliment they placed me last in the list no i was to hold the crowd and bless my life i was in awful terror when no rose at a oclock this morning and killed all the enthusiasm by delivering the flattest insipidest silliest of all responses to woman that ever a weary multitude listened to then gen sherman chairman announced my toast and the crowd gave me a good round of applause as i mounted on top of the dinner table but it was only on account of my name nothing more they were all tired and wretched they let my first sentence go in silence till i paused and added we stand on common ground then they burst forth like a hurricane and i saw that i had them from that time on i stopped at the end of each sentence and let the tornado of applause and laughter sweep around me and when i closed with and if the child is but the prophecy of the man there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded i say it who oughtnt to say it the house came down with a crash for two hours and a half now ive been shaking hands and listening to congratulations gen sherman said lord bless you my boy i dont know how you do it its a secret thats beyond me but it was great give me your hand again and do you know gen grant sat through fourteen speeches like a graven image but i fetched him i broke him up utterly he told me he laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached and do you know the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out of his iron serenity bless your soul twas immense i never was so proud in my life lots and lots of people hundreds i might say told me my speech was the triumph of the evening which was a lie ladies tom dick and harryeven the policemen captured me in the halls and shook hands and scores of army officers said we shall always be grateful to you for coming general pope came to bunt me up i was afraid to speak to him on that theatre stage last night thinking it might be presumptuous to tackle a man so high up in military history gen schofield and other historic men paid their compliments sheridan was ill and could not come but im to go with a general of his staff and see him before i go to col grants gen augur well ive talked with them all received invitations from them all from people living everywhere and as i said before its a memorable night i wouldnt have missed it for anything in the world but my sakes you should have heard ingersolls speech on that table half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his arms about me and said mark if i live a hundred years ill always be grateful for your speech lord what a supreme thing it was but i told him it wasnt any use to talk he had walked off with the honors of that occasion by something of a majority bully boy is ingersoll traveled with him in the cars the other day and you can make up your mind we had a good time of course i forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it but the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy they would go at once at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do their duty by me and said you dont need to request the army of the tennessee to do your desires you can command its services well i bummed around that banquet hall from in the evening till in the morning talking with people and listening to speeches and i never ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water so if i seem excited now it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm by george it was a grand night a historical night and now it is a quarter past am so good bye and god bless you and the bays family word for babies my darlings saml show it to joe if you want to i saw some of his friends here mark twains admiration for robert ingersoll was very great and we may believe that he was deeply impressed by the chicago speech when we find him a few days later writing to ingersoll for a perfect copy to read to a young girls club in hartford ingersoll sent the speech also some of his books and the next letter is mark twains acknowledgment to col robert g ingersoll hartford dec my dear ingersoll thank you most heartily for the books i am devouring them they have found a hungry place and they content it and satisfy it to a miracle i wish i could hear you speak these splendid chapters before a great audience to read them by myself and hear the boom of the applause only in the ear of my imagination leaves a something wanting and there is also a still greater lack your manner and voice and presence the chicago speech arrived an hour too late but i was all right anyway for i found that my memory had been able to correct all the errors i read it to the saturday club of young girls and told them to remember that it was doubtful if its superior existed in our language truly yours s l clemens the reader may remember mark twains whittier dinner speech of and its disastrous effects now in there was to be another atlantic gathering a breakfast to dr oliver wendell holmes to which clemens was invited he was not eager to accept it would naturally recall memories of two years before but being urged by both howells and warner he agreed to attend if they would permit him to speak mark twain never lacked courage and he wanted to redeem himself to howells he wrote to w d howells in boston hartford nov my dear howells if anybody talks there i shall claim the right to say a word myself and be heard among the very earliest else it would be confoundedly awkward for me and for the rest too but you may read what i say beforehand and strike out whatever you choose of course i thought it wisest not to be there at all but warner took the opposite view and most strenuously speaking of johnnys conclusion to become an outlaw reminds me of susies newest and very earnest longing to have crooked teeth and glasses like mamma i would like to look into a childs head once and see what its processes are yrs ever s l clemens the matter turned out well clemens once more introduced by howells this time conservatively it may be said delivered a delicate and fitting tribute to doctor holmes full of graceful humor and grateful acknowledgment the kind of speech he should have given at the whittier dinner of two years before no reference was made to his former disaster and this time he came away covered with glory and fully restored in his selfrespect xx letters of chiefly to howells the prince and the pauper mark twain mugwump society the book of travel a tramp abroad which mark twain had hoped to finish in paris and later in elmira for some reason would not come to an end in december in hartford he was still working on it and he would seem to have finished it at last rather by a decree than by any natural process of authorship this was early in january to howells he reports his difficulties and his drastic method of ending them to w d howells in boston hartford jan my dear howells am waiting for patrick to come with the carriage mrs clemens and i are starting without the children to stay indefinitely in elmira the wear and tear of settling the house broke her down and she has been growing weaker and weaker for a fortnight all that time in fact ever since i saw you i have been fighting a lifeanddeath battle with this infernal book and hoping to get done some day i required pages of ms and i have written near since i saw you and tore it all up except this i was about to tear up yesterday and begin again when mrs perkins came up to the billiard room and said you will never get any woman to do the thing necessary to save her life by mere persuasion you see you have wasted your words for three weeks it is time to use force she must have a change take her home and leave the children here i said if there is one death that is painfuller than another may i get it if i dont do that thing so i took the pages to bliss and told him that was the very last line i should ever write on this book a book which required pages of ms and i have written nearer four thousand first and last i am as soary and flighty as a rocket today with the unutterable joy of getting that old man of the sea off my back where he has been roosting for more than a year and a half next time i make a contract before writing the book may i suffer the righteous penalty and be burnt like the injudicious believer i am mighty glad you are done your book this is from a man who above all others feels how much that sentence means and am also mighty glad you have begun the next this is also from a man who knows the felicity of that and means straightway to enjoy it the undiscovered starts off delightfully i have read it aloud to mrs c and we vastly enjoyed it well times about up must drop a line to aldrich yrs ever mark in a letter which mark twain wrote to his brother orion at this period we get the first hint of a venture which was to play an increasingly important part in the hartford home and fortunes during the next ten or a dozen years this was the typesetting machine investment which in the end all but wrecked mark twains finances there is but a brief mention of it in the letter to orion and the letter itself is not worth preserving but as references to the machine appear with increasing frequency it seems proper to record here its first mention in the same letter he suggests to his brother that he undertake an absolutely truthful autobiography a confession in which nothing is to be withheld he cites the value of casanovas memories and the confessions of rousseau of course any literary suggestion from brother sam was gospel to orion who began at once piling up manuscript at a great rate meantime mark twain himself having got a tramp abroad on the presses was at work with enthusiasm on a story begun nearly three years before at quarry farma story for childrenits name as he called it then the little prince and the little pauper he was presently writing to howells his delight in the new work to w d howells in boston hartford mch my dear howells i take so much pleasure in my story that i am loth to hurry not wanting to get it done did i ever tell you the plot of it it begins at am jan seventeen and a half hours before henry viiis death by the swapping of clothes and place between the prince of wales and a pauper boy of the same age and countenance and half as much learning and still more genius and imagination and after that the rightful small king has a rough time among tramps and ruffians in the country parts of kent whilst the small bogus king has a gilded and worshipped and dreary and restrained and cussed time of it on the throne and this all goes on for three weeks till the midst of the coronation grandeurs in westminster abbey feb when the ragged true king forces his way in but cannot prove his genuineness until the bogus king by a remembered incident of the first day is able to prove it for him whereupon clothes are changed and the coronation proceeds under the new and rightful conditions my idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the king himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to others all of which is to account for certain mildnesses which distinguished edward vis reign from those that preceded and followed it imagine this fact i have even fascinated mrs clemens with this yarn for youth my stuff generally gets considerable damning with faint praise out of her but this time it is all the other way she is become the horseleechs daughter and my mill doesnt grind fast enough to suit her this is no mean triumph my dear sir last night for the first time in ages we went to the theatre to see yoricks love the magnificence of it is beyond praise the language is so beautiful the passion so fine the plot so ingenious the whole thing so stirring so charming so pathetic but i will clip from the courant it says it right and what a good company it is and how like live people they all acted the thees and the thous had a pleasant sound since it is the language of the prince and the pauper youve done the country a service in that admirable work yrs ever mark the play yoricks love mentioned in this letter was one which howells had done for lawrence barrett onion clemens meantime was forwarding his manuscript and for once seems to have won his brothers approval so much so that mark twain was willing indeed anxious that howells should run the autobiography in the atlantic we may imagine how onion prized the words of commendation which follow to orion clemens may my dear brother it is a model autobiography continue to develop your character in the same gradual inconspicuous and apparently unconscious way the reader up to this time may have his doubts perhaps but he cant say decidedly this writer is not such a simpleton as he has been letting on to be keep him in that state of mind if when you shall have finished the reader shall say the man is an ass but i really dont know whether he knows it or not your work will be a triumph stop rewriting i saw places in your last batch where rewriting had done formidable injury do not try to find those places else you will mar them further by trying to better them it is perilous to revise a book while it is under way all of us have injured our books in that foolish way keep in mind what i told you when you recollect something which belonged in an earlier chapter do not go back but jam it in where you are discursiveness does not hurt an autobiography in the least i have penciled the ms here and there but have not needed to make any criticisms or to knock out anything the elder bliss has heart disease badly and thenceforth his life hangs upon a thread yr bro sam but howells could not bring himself to print so frank a confession as orion had been willing to make it wrung my heart he said and i felt haggard after i had finished it the writers soul is laid bare it is shocking howells added that the best touches in it were those which made one acquainted with the writers brother that is to say mark twain and that these would prove valuable material hereafter a true prophecy for mark twains early biography would have lacked most of its vital incident and at least half of its background without those faithful chapters fortunately preserved had onion continued as he began the work might have proved an important contribution to literature but he went trailing off into bypaths of theology and discussion where the interest was lost there were perhaps as many as two thousand pages of it which few could undertake to read mark twains mind was always busy with plans and inventions many of them of serious intent some semiserious others of a purely whimsical character once he proposed a modest club of which the first and main qualification for membership was modesty at present he wrote i am the only member and as the modesty required must be of a quite aggravated type the enterprise did seem for a time doomed to stop dead still with myself for lack of further material but upon reflection i have come to the conclusion that you are eligible therefore i have held a meeting and voted to offer you the distinction of membership i do not know that we can find any others though i have had some thought of hay warner twichell aldrich osgood fields higginson and a few more together with mrs howells mrs clemens and certain others of the sex howells replied that the only reason he had for not joining the modest club was that he was too modest too modest to confess his modesty if i could get over this difficulty i should like to join for i approve highly of the club and its object it ought to be given an annual dinner at the public expense if you think i am not too modest you may put my name down and i will try to think the same of you mrs howells applauded the notion of the club from the very first she said that she knew one thing that she was modest enough anyway her manner of saying it implied that the other persons you had named were not and created a painful impression in my mind i have sent your letter and the rules to hay but i doubt his modesty he will think he has a right to belong to it as much as you or i whereas other people ought only to be admitted on sufferance our next letter to howells is in the main pure foolery but we get in it a hint what was to become in time one of mask twains strongest interests the matter of copyright he had both a personal and general interest in the subject his own books were constantly pirated in canada and the rights of foreign authors were not respected in america we have already seen how he had drawn a petition which holmes lowell longfellow and others were to sign and while nothing had come of this plan he had never ceased to formulate others yet he hesitated when he found that the proposed protection was likely to work a hardship to readers of the poorer class once he wrote my notions have mightily changed lately i can buy a lot of the copyright classics in paper at from three to thirty cents apiece these things must find their way into the very kitchens and hovels of the country and even if the treaty will kill canadian piracy and thus save me an average of a year i am down on it anyway and id like cussed well to write an article opposing the treaty to w d howells in belmont mass thursday june th my dear howells there you stick at belmont and now im going to washington for a few days and of course between you and providence that visit is going to get mixed and youll have been here and gone again just about the time i get back bother it all i wanted to astonish you with a chapter or two from orions latest book not the seventeen which he has begun in the last four months but the one which he began last week last night when i went to bed mrs clemens said george didnt take the cat down to the cellar rosa says he has left it shut up in the conservatory so i went down to attend to abner the cat about in the morning mrs c woke me and said i do believe i hear that cat in the drawingroom what did you do with him i answered up with the confidence of a man who has managed to do the right thing for once and said i opened the conservatory doors took the library off the alarm and spread everything open so that there wasnt any obstruction between him and the cellar language wasnt capable of conveying this womans disgust but the sense of what she said was he couldnt have done any harm in the conservatory so you must go and make the entire house free to him and the burglars imagining that he will prefer the coalbins to the drawingroom if you had had mr howells to help you i should have admired but not been astonished because i should know that together you would be equal to it but how you managed to contrive such a stately blunder all by yourself is what i cannot understand so you see even she knows how to appreciate our gifts brisk times here saturday these things happened our neighbor chas smith was stricken with heart disease and came near joining the majority my publisher bliss ditto ditto a neighbors child died neighbor whitmores sixth child added to his five other cases of measles neighbor niles sent for and responded susie warner down abed mrs george warner threatened with death during several hours her son frank whilst imitating the marvels in barnums circus bills thrown from his aged horse and brought home insensible warners friend max yortzburgh shot in the back by a locomotive and broken into distinct pieces and his life threatened and mrs clemens after writing all these cheerful things to clara spaulding taken at midnight and if the doctor had not been pretty prompt the contemplated clemens would have called before his apartments were ready however everybody is all right now except yortzburg and he is mending that is he is being mended i knocked off during these stirring times and dont intend to go to work again till we go away for the summer or weeks hence so i am writing to you not because i have anything to say but because you dont have to answer and i need something to do this afternoon i have a letter from a congressman this morning and he says congress couldnt be persuaded to bother about canadian pirates at a time like this when all legislation must have a political and presidential bearing else congress wont look at it so have changed my mind and my course i go north to kill a pirate i must procure repose some way else i cannot get down to work again pray offer my most sincere and respectful approval to the president is approval the proper word i find it is the one i most value here in the household and seldomest get with our affection to you both yrs ever mark it was always dangerous to send strangers with letters of introduction to mark twain they were so apt to arrive at the wrong time or to find him in the wrong mood howells was willing to risk it and that the result was only amusing instead of tragic is the best proof of their friendship to w d howells in belmont mass june well old practical joker the corpse of mr xhas been here and i have bedded it and fed it and put down my work during hours and tried my level best to make it do something or say something or appreciate something but no it was worse than lazarus a kindhearted wellmeaning corpse was the boston young man but lawsy bless me horribly dull company now old man unless you have great confidence in mr xs judgment you ought to make him submit his article to you before he prints it for only think how true i was to you every hour that he was here i was saying gloatingly o g d you when you are in bed and your light out i will fix you meaning to kill him but then the thought would follow no howells sent him he shall be spared he shall be respected he shall travel hellwards by his own route breakfast is frozen by this time and mrs clemens correspondingly hot good bye yrs ever mark i did not expect you to ask that man to live with you howells answered what i was afraid of was that you would turn him out of doors on sight and so i tried to put in a good word for him after this when i want you to board people ill ask you i am sorry for your suffering i suppose i have mostly lost my smell for bores but yours is preternaturally keen i shall begin to be afraid i bore you how does that make you feel in a letter to twichell a remarkable letter when baby jean clemens was about a month old we get a happy hint of conditions at quarry farm and in the background a glimpse of mark twains unfailing tragic reflection to rev twichell in hartford quarry farm aug dear old joe concerning jean clemens if anybody said he didnt see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog i should think he was convicting himself of being a pretty poor sort of observer i will not go into details it is not necessary you will soon be in hartford where i have already hired a hall the admission fee will be but a trifle it is curious to note the change in the stockquotation of the affection board brought about by throwing this new security on the market four weeks ago the children still put mamma at the head of the list right along where she had always been but now jean mamma motley a cat fraulein another papa that is the way it stands now mamma is become no i have dropped from no and am become no some time ago it used to be nip and tuck between me and the cats but after the cats developed i didnt stand any more show ive got a swollen ear so i take advantage of it to lie abed most of the day and read and smoke and scribble and have a good time last evening livy said with deep concern o dear i believe an abscess is forming in your ear i responded as the poet would have done if he had had a cold in the head tis said that abscess conquers love but o believe it not this made a coolness been reading daniel websters private correspondence have read a hundred of his diffuse conceited eloquent bathotic or bathostic letters written in that dim no vanished past when he was a student and lord to think that this boy who is so real to me now and so booming with fresh young blood and bountiful life and sappy cynicisms about girls has since climbed the alps of fame and stood against the sun one brief tremendous moment with the worlds eyes upon him and then fzt where is he why the only long thing the only real thing about the whole shadowy business is the sense of the lagging dull and hoary lapse of time that has drifted by since then a vast empty level it seems with a formless spectre glimpsed fitfully through the smoke and mist that lie along its remote verge well we are all getting along here firstrate livy gains strength daily and sits up a deal the baby is five weeks old and but no more of this somebody may be reading this letter years hence and so my friend you pitying snob i mean who are holding this yellow paper in your hand in save yourself the trouble of looking further i know how pathetically trivial our small concerns will seem to you and i will not let your eye profane them no i keep my news you keep your compassion suffice it you to know scoffer and ribald that the little child is old and blind now and once more toothless and the rest of us are shadows these many many years yes and your time cometh mark at the farm that year mark twain was working on the prince and the pauper and according to a letter to aldrich brought it to an end september th it is a pleasant letter worth preserving the book by aldrich here mentioned was the stillwater tragedy to t b aldrich in ponkapog mass elmira sept my dear aldrich thank you ever so much for the book i had already finished it and prodigiously enjoyed it in the periodical of the notorious howells but it hits mrs clemens just right for she is having a reading holiday now for the first time in same months so betweentimes when the new baby is asleep and strengthening up for another attempt to take possession of this place she is going to read it her strong friendship for you makes her think she is going to like it i finished a story yesterday myself i counted up and found it between sixty and eighty thousand words about the size of your book it is for boys and girls been at work at it several years off and on i hope howells is enjoying his journey to the pacific he wrote me that you and osgood were going also but i doubted it believing he was in liquor when he wrote it in my opinion this universal applause over his book is going to land that man in a retreat inside of two months i notice the papers say mighty fine things about your book too you ought to try to get into the same establishment with howells but applause does not affect me i am always calm this is because i am used to it well goodbye my boy and good luck to you mrs clemens asks me to send her warmest regards to you and mrs aldrich which i do and add those of yrs ever mark while mark twain was a journalist in san francisco there was a middleaged man named soule who had a desk near him on the morning call soule was in those days highly considered as a poet by his associates most of whom were younger and less gracefully poetic but soules gift had never been an important one now in his old age he found his fame still local and he yearned for wider recognition he wished to have a volume of poems issued by a publisher of recognized standing because mark twain had been one of soules admirers and a warm friend in the old days it was natural that soule should turn to him now and equally natural that clemens should turn to howells to w d howells in boston sunday oct my dear howells heres a letter which i wrote you to san francisco the second time you didnt go there i told soule he neednt write you but simply send the ms to you o dear dear it is dreadful to be an unrecognized poet how wise it was in charles warren stoddard to take in his sign and go for some other calling while still young im laying for that encyclopedical scotchman and hell need to lock the door behind him when he comes in otherwise when he hears my proposed tariff his skin will probably crawl away with him he is accustomed to seeing the publisher impoverish the author that spectacle must be getting stale to him if he contracts with the undersigned he will experience a change in that programme that will make the enamel peel off his teeth for very surprise and joy no that last is what mrs clemens thinks but its not so the proposed work is growing mightily in my estimation day by day and im not going to throw it away for any mere trifle if i make a contract with the canny scot i will then tell him the plan which you and i have devised that of taking in the humor of all countries otherwise ill keep it to myself i think why should we assist our fellowman for mere love of god yrs ever mark one wishes that howells might have found value enough in the verses of frank soule to recommend them to osgood to clemens he wrote you have touched me in regard to him and i will deal gently with his poetry poor old fellow i can imagine him and how he must have to struggle not to be hard or sour the verdict however was inevitable soules graceful verses proved to be not poetry at all no publisher of standing could afford to give them his imprint the encyclopedical scotchman mentioned in the preceding letter was the publisher gebbie who had a plan to engage howells and clemens to prepare some sort of anthology of the worlds literature the idea came to nothing though the other plan mentioned for a library of humor in time grew into a book mark twains contracts with bliss for the publication of his books on the subscription plan had been made on a royalty basis beginning with per cent on the innocents abroad increasing to р вђрв per cent on roughing it and to per cent on later books bliss had held that these later percentages fairly represented one half the profits clemens however had never been fully satisfied and his brother onion had more than once urged him to demand a specific contract on the halfprofit basis the agreement for the publication of a tramp abroad was made on these terms bliss died before clemens received his first statement of sales whatever may have been the facts under earlier conditions the statement proved to mark twains satisfaction at least that the halfprofit arrangement was to his advantage it produced another result it gave samuel clemens an excuse to place his brother onion in a position of independence to onion clemens in keokuk iowa sunday oct my dear bro bliss is dead the aspect of the balancesheet is enlightening it reveals the fact through my present contract which is for half the profits on the book above actual cost of paper printing and binding that i have lost considerably by all this nonsense sixty thousand dollars i should say and if bliss were alive i would stay with the concern and get it all back for on each new book i would require a portion of that back pay but as it is this in the very strictest confidence i shall probably go to a new publisher or months hence for i am afraid frank with his poor health will lack push and drive out of the suspicions you bred in me years ago has grown this result to wit that i shall within the twelvemonth get out of this tramp instead of twenty thousand dollars after taxes and other expenses are stripped away is worth to the investor about a month so i shall tell mr perkins to make your check that amount per month hereafter while our income is able to afford it this ends the loan business and hereafter you can reflect that you are living not on borrowed money but on money which you have squarely earned and which has no taint or savor of charity about it and you can also reflect that the money you have been receiving of me all these years is interest charged against the heavy bill which the next publisher will have to stand who gets a book of mine jean got the stockings and is much obliged mollie wants to know whom she most resembles but i cant tell she has blue eyes and brown hair and three chins and is very fat and happy and at one time or another she has resembled all the different clemenses and langdons in turn that have ever lived livy is too much beaten out with the baby nights to write these times and i dont know of anything urgent to say except that a basket full of letters has accumulated in the days that i have been whooping and cursing over a cold in the head and i must attack the pile this very minute with love from us y aff sam enclosed on the completion of the prince and pauper story clemens had naturally sent it to howells for consideration howells wrote i have read the two ps and i like it immensely it begins well and it ends well he pointed out some things that might be changed or omitted and added it is such a book as i would expect from you knowing what a bottom of fury there is to your fun clemens had thought somewhat of publishing the story anonymously in the fear that it would not be accepted seriously over his own signature the bull story referred to in the next letter is the one later used in the joan of arc book the story told joan by uncle laxart how he rode a bull to a funeral to w d howells in boston xmas eve my dear howells i was prodigiously delighted with what you said about the book so on the whole ive concluded to publish intrepidly instead of concealing the authorship i shall leave out that bull story i wish you had gone to new york the company was small and we had a firstrate time smiths an enjoyable fellow i liked barrett too and the oysters were as good as the rest of the company it was worth going there to learn how to cook them next day i attended to business which was to introduce twichell to gen grant and procure a private talk in the interest of the chinese educational mission here in the u s well it was very funny joe had been sitting up nights building facts and arguments together into a mighty and unassailable array and had studied them out and got them by heart all with the trembling halfhearted hope of getting grant to add his signature to a sort of petition to the viceroy of china but grant took in the whole situation in a jiffy and before joe had more than fairly got started the old man said ill write the viceroy a letter a separate letter and bring strong reasons to bear upon him i know him well and what i say will have weight with him i will attend to it right away no no thanks i shall be glad to do it it will be a labor of love so all joes laborious hours were for naught it was as if he had come to borrow a dollar and been offered a thousand before he could unfold his case but its getting dark merry christmas to all of you yrs ever mark the chinese educational mission mentioned in the foregoing was a thriving hartford institution projected eight years before by a yale graduate named yung wing the mission was now threatened and yung wing knowing the high honor in which general grant was held in china believed that through him it might be saved twichell of course was deeply concerned and naturally overjoyed at grants interest a day or two following the return to hartford clemens received a letter from general grant in which he wrote li hung chang is the most powerful and most influential chinaman in his country he professed great friendship for me when i was there and i have had assurances of the same thing since i hope if he is strong enough with his government that the decision to withdraw the chinese students from this country may be changed but perhaps li hung chang was experiencing one of his partial eclipses just then or possibly he was not interested for the hartford mission did not survive xxi letters to howells and others assisting a young sculptor literary plans with all of mark twains admiration for grant he had opposed him as a thirdterm president and approved of the nomination of garfield he had made speeches for garfield during the campaign just ended and had been otherwise active in his support upon garfields election however he felt himself entitled to no special favor and the single request which he preferred at length could hardly be classed as personal though made for a personal friend to presidentelect james a garfield in washington hartford jany gen garfield dear sir several times since your election persons wanting office have asked me to use my influence with you in their behalf to word it in that way was such a pleasant compliment to me that i never complied i could not without exposing the fact that i hadnt any influence with you and that was a thing i had no mind to do it seems to me that it is better to have a good mans flattering estimate of my influence and to keep it than to fool it away with trying to get him an office but when my brother on my wifes side mr charles j langdon late of the chicago convention desires me to speak a word for mr fred douglass i am not asked to use my influence consequently i am not risking anything so i am writing this as a simple citizen i am not drawing on my fund of influence at all a simple citizen may express a desire with all propriety in the matter of a recommendation to office and so i beg permission to hope that you will retain mr douglass in his present office of marshall of the district of columbia if such a course will not clash with your own preferences or with the expediencies and interest of your administration i offer this petition with peculiar pleasure and strong desire because i so honor this mans high and blemishless character and so admire his brave long crusade for the liberties and elevation of his race he is a personal friend of mine but that is nothing to the point his history would move me to say these things without that and i feel them too with great respect i am general yours truly s l clemens clemens would go out of his way any time to grant favor to the colored race his childhood associations were partly accountable for this but he also felt that the white man owed the negro a debt for generations of enforced bondage he would lecture any time in a colored church when he would as likely as not refuse pointblank to speak for a white congregation once in elmira he received a request poorly and none too politely phrased to speak for one of the churches he was annoyed and about to send a brief refusal when mrs clemens who was present said i think i know that church and if so this preacher is a colored man he does not know how to write a polished letter how should he her husbands manner changed so suddenly that she added i will give you a motto and it will be useful to you if you will adopt it consider every man colored until he is proved white to w d howells in boston hartford feb my dear howells i go to west point with twichell tomorrow but shall be back tuesday or wednesday and then just as soon thereafter as you and mrs howells and winny can come you will find us ready and most glad to see you and the longer you can stay the gladder we shall be i am not going to have a thing to do but you shall work if you want to on the evening of march th i am going to read to the colored folk in the african church here no whites admitted except such as i bring with me and a choir of colored folk will sing jubilee songs i count on a good time and shall hope to have you folks there and livy i read in twichells chapel friday night and had a most rattling high time but the thing that went best of all was uncle remuss tar baby i mean to try that on my dusky audience theyve all heard that tale from childhood at least the older members have i arrived home in time to make a most noble blunder invited charley warner here in livys name to dinner with the gerhardts and told him livy had invited his wife by letter and by word of mouth also i dont know where i got these impressions but i came home feeling as one does who realizes that he has done a neat thing for once and left no flaws or loopholes well livy said she had never told me to invite charley and she hadnt dreamed of inviting susy and moreover there wasnt any dinner but just one lean duck but susy warners intuitions were correct so she choked off charley and staid home herself we waited dinner an hour and you ought to have seen that duck when he was done drying in the oven mark clemens and his wife were always privately assisting worthy and ambitious young people along the way of achievement young actors were helped through dramatic schools young men and women were assisted through college and to travel abroad among others clemens paid the way of two colored students one through a southern institution and another through the yale law school the mention of the name of gerhardt in the preceding letter introduces the most important or at least the most extensive of these benefactions the following letter gives the beginning of the story to w d howells in boston private and confidential hartford feb my dear howells well here is our romance it happened in this way one morning a month ago no three weeks livy and clara spaulding and i were at breakfast at am and i was in an irritable mood for the barber was up stairs waiting and his hot water getting cold when the colored george returned from answering the bell and said theres a lady in the drawingroom wants to see you a book agent says i with heat i wont see her i will die in my tracks first then i got up with a soul full of rage and went in there and bent scowling over that person and began a succession of rude and raspy questions and without even offering to sit down not even the defendants youth and beauty and seeming timidity were able to modify my savagery for a time and meantime question and answer were going on she had risen to her feet with the first question and there she stood with her pretty face bent floorward whilst i inquired but always with her honest eyes looking me in the face when it came her turn to answer and this was her tale and her pleadiffidently stated but straightforwardly and bravely and most winningly simply and earnestly i put it in my own fashion for i do not remember her words mr karl gerhardt who works in pratt whitneys machine shops has made a statue in clay and would i be so kind as to come and look at it and tell him if there is any promise in it he has none to go to and he would be so glad o dear me i said i dont know anything about art theres nothing i could tell him but she went on just as earnestly and as simply as before with her plea and so she did after repeated rebuffs and dull as i am even i began by and by to admire this brave and gentle persistence and to perceive how her heart of hearts was in this thing and how she couldnt give it up but must carry her point so at last i wavered and promised in general terms that i would come down the first day that fell idle and as i conducted her to the door i tamed more and more and said i would come during the very next week we shall be so glad but but would you please come early in the week the statue is just finished and we are so anxious and and we did hope you could come this week and well i came down another peg and said i would come monday as sure as death and before i got to the dining room remorse was doing its work and i was saying to myself damnation how can a man be such a hound why didnt i go with her now yes and how mean i should have felt if i had known that out of her poverty she had hired a hack and brought it along to convey me but luckily for what was left of my peace of mind i didnt know that well it appears that from here she went to charley warners there was a better light there and the eloquence of her face had a better chance to do its office warner fought as i had done and he was in the midst of an article and very busy but no matter she won him completely he laid aside his ms and said come let us go and see your fathers statue that is is he your father no he is my husband so this child was married you see this was a saturday next day warner came to dinner and said go go tomorrow dont fail he was in love with the girl and with her husband too and said he believed there was merit in the statue pretty crude work maybe but merit in it patrick and i hunted up the place next day the girl saw us driving up and flew down the stairs and received me her quarters were the second story of a little wooden house another family on the ground floor the husband was at the machine shop the wife kept no servant she was there alone she had a little parlor with a chair or two and a sofa and the artisthusbands hand was visible in a couple of plaster busts one of the wife and another of a neighbors child visible also in a couple of water colors of flowers and birds an ambitious unfinished portrait of his wife in oils some paint decorations on the pine mantel and an excellent human ear done in some plastic material at then we went into the kitchen and the girl flew around with enthusiasm and snatched rag after rag from a tall something in the corner and presently there stood the clay statue life size a graceful girlish creature nude to the waist and holding up a single garment with one hand the expression attempted being a modified scare she was interrupted when about to enter the bath then this young wife posed herself alongside the image and so remained a thing i didnt understand but presently i did then i said o its you yes she said i was the model he has no model but me i have stood for this many and many an hour and you cant think how it does tire one but i dont mind it he works all day at the shop and then nights and sundays he works on his statue as long as i can keep up she got a big chisel to use as a lever and between us we managed to twist the pedestal round and round so as to afford a view of the statue from all points well sir it was perfectly charming this girls innocence and purity exhibiting her naked self as it were to a stranger and alone and never once dreaming that there was the slightest indelicacy about the matter and so there wasnt but it will be many along day before i run across another woman who can do the like and show no trace of selfconsciousness well then we sat down and i took a smoke and she told me all about her people in massachusetts her father is a physician and it is an old and respectable family i am able to believe anything she says and she told me how karl is years old and how he has had passionate longings all his life toward art but has always been poor and obliged to struggle for his daily bread and how he felt sure that if he could only have one or two lessons in lessons hasnt he had any lessons no he had never had a lesson and presently it was dinner time and karl arrived a slender young fellow with a marvelous head and a noble eye and he was as simple and natural and as beautiful in spirit as his wife was but she had to do the talking mainly there was too much thought behind his cavernous eyes for glib speech i went home enchanted told livy and clara spaulding all about the paradise down yonder where those two enthusiasts are happy with a yearly expense of livy and clara went there next day and came away enchanted a few nights later the gerhardts kept their promise and came here for the evening it was billiard night and i had company and so was not down but livy and clara became more charmed with these children than ever warner and i planned to get somebody to criticise the statue whose judgment would be worth something so i laid for champney and after two failures i captured him and took him around and he said this statue is full of faults but it has merits enough in it to make up for them whereat the young wife danced around as delighted as a child when we came away champney said i did not want to say too much there but the truth is it seems to me an extraordinary performance for an untrained hand you ask if there is promise enough there to justify the hartford folk in going to an expense of training this young man i should say yes decidedly but still to make everything safe you had better get the judgment of a sculptor warner was in new york i wrote him and he said he would fetch up ward which he did yesterday they went to the gerhardts and spent two hours and ward came away bewitched with those people and marveling at the winning innocence of the young wife who dropped naturally into modelattitude beside the statue which is stark naked from head to heel now g had removed the drapery fearing ward would think he was afraid to try legs and hips just as she has always done before livy and i had two long talks with ward yesterday evening he spoke strongly he said if any stranger had told me that this apprentice did not model that thing from plaster casts i would not have believed it he said it is full of crudities but it is full of genius too it is such a statue as the man of average talent would achieve after two years training in the schools and the boldness of the fellow in going straight to nature he is an apprentice his work shows that all over but the stuff is in him sure hartford must send him to paris two years then if the promise holds good keep him there three more and warn him to study study work work and keep his name out of the papers and neither ask for orders nor accept them when offered well you see thats all we wanted after ward was gone livy came out with the thing that was in her mind she said go privately and start the gerhardts off to paris and say nothing about it to any one else so i tramped down this morning in the snowstorm and there was a stirring time they will sail a week or ten days from now as i was starting out at the front door with gerhardt beside me and the young wife dancing and jubilating behind this latter cried out impulsively tell mrs clemens i want to hug her i want to hug you both i gave them my old french book and they were going to tackle the language straight off now this letter is a secret keep it quiet i dont think livy would mind my telling you these things but then she might you know for she is a queer girl yrs ever mark champney was j wells champney a portraitpainter of distinction ward was the sculptor j q a ward the gerhardts were presently off to paris well provided with means to make their dreams reality in due time the letters will report them again the uncle remus tales of joel chandler harris gave mark twain great pleasure he frequently read them aloud not only at home but in public finally he wrote harris expressing his warm appreciation and mentioning one of the negro stories of his own childhood the golden arm which he urged harris to look up and add to his collection you have pinned a proud feather in uncleremuss cap replied harris i do not know what higher honor he could have than to appear before the hartford public arm in arm with mark twain he disclaimed any originality for the stories adding i understand that my relations toward uncle remus are similar to those that exist between an almanac maker and the calendar he had not heard the golden arm story and asked for the outlines also for some publishing advice out of mark twains long experience to joel chandler harris in atlanta elmira ny aug my dear mr harris you can argue yourself into the delusion that the principle of life is in the stories themselves and not in their setting but you will save labor by stopping with that solitary convert for he is the only intelligent one you will bag in reality the stories are only alligator pears one merely eats them for the sake of the saladdressing uncle remus is most deftly drawn and is a lovable and delightful creation he and the little boy and their relations with each other are high and fine literature and worthy to live for their own sakes and certainly the stories are not to be credited with them but enough of this i seem to be proving to the man that made the multiplication table that twice one are two i have been thinking yesterday and today plenty of chance to think as i am abed with lumbago at our little summering farm among the solitudes of the mountaintops and i have concluded that i can answer one of your questions with full confidence thus make it a subscription book mighty few books that come strictly under the head of literature will sell by subscription but if uncle remus wont the gift of prophecy has departed out of me when a book will sell by subscription it will sell two or three times as many copies as it would in the trade and the profit is bulkier because the retail price is greater you didnt ask me for a subscriptionpublisher if you had i should have recommended osgood to you he inaugurates his subscription department with my new book in the fall now the doctor has been here and tried to interrupt my yarn about the golden arm but ive got through anyway of course i tell it in the negro dialect that is necessary but i have not written it so for i cant spell it in your matchless way it is marvelous the way you and cable spell the negro and creole dialects two grand features are lost in print the weird wailing the rising and falling cadences of the wind so easily mimicked with ones mouth and the impressive pauses and eloquent silences and subdued utterances toward the end of the yarn which chain the attention of the children hand and foot and they sit with parted lips and breathless to be wrenched limb from limb with the sudden and appalling you got it old uncle danl a slave of my uncles aged used to tell us children yarns every night by the kitchen fire no other light and the last yarn demanded every night was this one by this time there was but a ghastly blaze or two flickering about the backlog we would huddle close about the old man and begin to shudder with the first familiar words and under the spell of his impressive delivery we always fell a prey to that climax at the end when the rigid black shape in the twilight sprang at us with a shout when you come to glance at the tale you will recollect it it is as common and familiar as the tar baby work up the atmosphere with your customary skill and it will go in print lumbago seems to make a body garrulous but youll forgive it truly yours s l clemens the golden arm story was one that clemens often used in his public readings and was very effective as he gave it in his sketch how to tell a story it appears about as he used to tell it harris receiving the outlines of the old missouri tale presently announced that he had dug up its georgia relative an interesting variant as we gather from mark twains reply to joel chandler harris in atlanta hartford my dear mr harris i was very sure you would run across that story somewhere and am glad you have a drummond light no i mean a brush light is thrown upon the negro estimate of values by his willingness to risk his soul and his mighty peace forever for the sake of a silver sevmpunce and this form of the story seems rather nearer the true fieldhand standard than that achieved by my florida mo negroes with their sumptuous arm of solid gold i judge you havent received my new book yet however you will in a day or two meantime you must not take it ill if i drop osgood a hint about your proposed story of slave life when you come north i wish you would drop me a line and then follow it in person and give me a day or two at our house in hartford if you will i will snatch osgood down from boston and you wont have to go there at all unless you want to please to bear this strictly in mind and dont forget it sincerely yours s l clemens charles warren stoddard to whom the next letter is written was one of the old california literary crowd a graceful writer of verse and prose never quite arriving at the success believed by his friends to be his due he was a gentle irresponsible soul well loved by all who knew him and always by one or another provided against want the reader may remember that during mark twains great lecture engagement in london winter of stoddard lived with him acting as his secretary at a later period in his life he lived for several years with the great telephone magnate theodore n vail at the time of this letter stoddard had decided that in the warm light and comfort of the sandwich islands he could survive on his literary earnings to charles warren stoddard in the sandwich islands hartford oct my dear charlie now what have i ever done to you that you should not only slide off to heaven before you have earned a right to go but must add the gratuitous villainy of informing me of it the house is full of carpenters and decorators whereas what we really need here is an incendiary if the house would only burn down we would pack up the cubs and fly to the isles of the blest and shut ourselves up in the healing solitudes of the crater of haleakala and get a good rest for the mails do not intrude there nor yet the telephone and the telegraph and after resting we would come down the mountain a piece and board with a godly breechclouted native and eat poi and dirt and give thanks to whom all thanks belong for these privileges and never housekeep any more i think my wife would be twice as strong as she is but for this wearing and wearying slavery of housekeeping however she thinks she must submit to it for the sake of the children whereas i have always had a tenderness for parents too so for her sake and mine i sigh for the incendiary when the evening comes and the gas is lit and the wear and tear of life ceases we want to keep house always but next morning we wish once more that we were free and irresponsible boarders work one cant you know to any purpose i dont really get anything done worth speaking of except during the three or four months that we are away in the summer i wish the summer were seven years long i keep three or four books on the stocks all the time but i seldom add a satisfactory chapter to one of them at home yes and it is all because my time is taken up with answering the letters of strangers it cant be done through a short hand amanuensis ive tried that it wouldnt work i couldnt learn to dictate what does possess strangers to write so many letters i never could find that out however i suppose i did it myself when i was a stranger but i will never do it again maybe you think i am not happy the very thing that gravels me is that i am i dont want to be happy when i cant work i am resolved that hereafter i wont be what i have always longed for was the privilege of living forever away up on one of those mountains in the sandwich islands overlooking the sea yours ever mark that magazine article of yours was mighty good up to your very best i think i enclose a book review written by howells to w d howells in boston hartford oct my dear howells i am delighted with your review and so is mrs clemens what you have said there will convince anybody that reads it a body cannot help being convinced by it that is the kind of a review to have the doubtful man even the prejudiced man is persuaded and succumbs what a queer blunder that was about the baronet i cant quite see how i ever made it there was an opulent abundance of things i didnt know and consequently no need to trench upon the vestpocketful of things i did know to get material for a blunder charley warren stoddard has gone to the sandwich islands permanently lucky devil it is the only supremely delightful place on earth it does seem that the more advantage a body doesnt earn here the more of them god throws at his head this fellows postal card has set the vision of those gracious islands before my mind again with not a leaf withered nor a rainbow vanished nor a sunflash missing from the waves and now it will be months i reckon before i can drive it away again it is beautiful company but it makes one restless and dissatisfied with love and thanks yrs ever mark the review mentioned in this letter was of the prince and the pauper what the queer blunder about the baronet was the present writer confesses he does not know but perhaps a careful reader could find it at least in the early edition very likely it was corrected without loss of time clemens now and then found it necessary to pay a visit to canada in the effort to protect his copyright he usually had a grand time on these trips being lavishly entertained by the canadian literary fraternity in november he made one of these journeys in the interest of the prince and the pauper this time with osgood who was now his publisher in letters written home we get a hint of his diversions the monsieur frechette mentioned was a canadian poet of considerable distinction clara was miss clara spaulding of elmira who had accompanied mr and mrs clemens to europe in and again in later she became mrs john b staachfield of new york city her name has already appeared in these letters many times to mrs clemens in hartford montreal nov livy darling you and clara ought to have been at breakfast in the great dining room this morning english female faces distinctive english costumes strange and marvelous english gaits and yet such honest honorable cleansouled countenances just as these english women almost always have you know right away but theyve come to take me to the top of mount royal it being a cold dry sunny magnificent day going in a sleigh yours lovingly saml to mrs clemens in hartford montreal sunday november livy dear a mouse kept me awake last night till or oclock so i am lying abed this morning i would not give sixpence to be out yonder in the storm although it is only snow the above paragraph is written in the form of a rebus illustrated with various sketches there thats for the children was not sure that they could read writing especially jean who is strangely ignorant in some things i can not only look out upon the beautiful snowstorm past the vigorous blaze of my fire and upon the snowveiled buildings which i have sketched and upon the churchward drifting umbrellas and upon the buffaloclad cabmen stamping their feet and thrashing their arms on the corner yonder but i also look out upon the spot where the first white men stood in the neighborhood of four hundred years ago admiring the mighty stretch of leafy solitudes and being admired and marveled at by an eager multitude of naked savages the discoverer of this region and namer of it jacques cartier has a square named for him in the city i wish you were here you would enjoy your birthday i think i hoped for a letter and thought i had one when the mail was handed in a minute ago but it was only that note from sylvester baxter you must write do you hear or i will be remiss myself give my love and a kiss to the children and ask them to give you my love and a kiss from saml to mrs clemens in hartford quebec sunday livy darling i received a letter from monsieur frechette this morning in which certain citizens of montreal tendered me a public dinner next thursday and by osgoods advice i accepted it i would have accepted anyway and very cheerfully but for the delay of two days for i was purposing to go to boston tuesday and home wednesday whereas now i go to boston friday and home saturday i have to go by boston on account of business we drove about the steep hills and narrow crooked streets of this old town during three hours yesterday in a sleigh in a driving snowstorm the people here dont mind snow they were all out plodding around on their affairs especially the children who were wallowing around everywhere like snow images and having a mighty good time i wish i could describe the winter costume of the young girls but i cant it is grave and simple but graceful and pretty the top of it is a brimless fur cap maybe it is the costume that makes pretty girls seem so monotonously plenty here it was a kind of relief to strike a homely face occasionally you descend into some of the streets by long deep stairways and in the strong moonlight last night these were very picturesque i did wish you were here to see these things you couldnt by any possibility sleep in these beds though or enjoy the food good night sweetheart and give my respects to the cubs saml it had been hoped that w d howells would join the canadian excursion but howells was not very well that autumn he wrote that he had been in bed five weeks most of the time recovering so you see how bad i must have been to begin with but now i am out of any firstclass pain i have a good appetite and i am as abusive and peremptory as guiteau clemens returning to hartford wrote him a letter that explains itself to w d howells in boston hartford dec my dear howells it was a sharp disappointment your inability to connect on the canadian raid what a gaudy good time we should have had disappointed again when i got back to boston for i was promising myself half an hours look at you in belmont but your note to osgood showed that that could not be allowed out yet the atlantic arrived an hour ago and your faultless and delicious police report brought that blamed joe twichell powerfully before me theres a man who can tell such things himself by word of mouth and has as sure an eye for detecting a thing that is before his eyes as any man in the world perhaps then why in the nation doesnt he report himself with a pen one of those drenching days last week he slopped down town with his cubs and visited a poor little beggarly shed where were a dwarf a fat woman and a giant of honest eight feet on exhibition behind tawdry showcanvases but with nobody to exhibit to the giant had a broom and was cleaning up and fixing around diligently joe conceived the idea of getting some talk out of him now that never would have occurred to me so he dropped in under the mans elbow dogged him patiently around prodding him with questions and getting irritated snarls in return which would have finished me early but at last one of joes random shafts drove the centre of that giants sympathies somehow and fetched him the fountains of his great deep were broken up and he rained a flood of personal history that was unspeakably entertaining among other things it turned out that he had been a turkish native colonel and had fought all through the crimean war and so for the first time joe got a picture of the charge of the six hundred that made him see the living spectacle the flash of flag and tongueflame the rolling smoke and hear the booming of the guns and for the first time also he heard the reasons for that wild charge delivered from the mouth of a master and realized that nobody had blundered but that a cold logical military brain had perceived this one and sole way to win an already lost battle and so gave the command and did achieve the victory and mind you joe was able to come up here days afterwards and reproduce that giants picturesque and admirable history but dern him he cant write it which is all wrong and not as it should be and he has gone and raked up the ms autobiography written in of mrs phebe brown author of i love to steal a while away who educated yung wing in her family when he was a little boy and i came near not getting to bed at all last night on account of the lurid fascinations of it why in the nation it has never got into print i cant understand but by jings the postman will be here in a minute so congratulations upon your mending health and gratitude that it is mending and love to you all yrs ever mark dont answer i spare the sick xxii letters mainly to howells wasted fury old scenes revisited the mississippi book a man of mark twains profession and prominence must necessarily be the subject of much newspaper comment jest compliment criticism none of these things disturbed him as a rule he was pleased that his books should receive favorable notices by men whose opinion he respected but he was not grieved by adverse expressions jests at his expense if well written usually amused him cheap jokes only made him sad but sarcasms and innuendoes were likely to enrage him particularly if he believed them prompted by malice perhaps among all the letters he ever wrote there is none more characteristic than this confession of violence and eagerness for reprisal followed by his acknowledgment of error and a manifest appreciation of his own weakness it should be said that mark twain and whitelaw reid were generally very good friends and perhaps for the moment this fact seemed to magnify the offense to w d howells in boston hartford jan my dear howells nobody knows better than i that there are times when swearing cannot meet the emergency how sharply i feel that at this moment not a single profane word has issued from my lips this mornin i have not even had the impulse to swear so wholly ineffectual would swearing have manifestly been in the circumstances but i will tell you about it about three weeks ago a sensitive friend approaching his revelation cautiously intimated that the n y tribune was engaged in a kind of crusade against me this seemed a higher compliment than i deserved but no matter it made me very angry i asked many questions and gathered in substance this since reids return from europe the tribune had been flinging sneers and brutalities at me with such persistent frequency as to attract general remark i was an angered which is just as good an expression i take it as an hungered next i learned that osgood among the rest of the general was worrying over these constant and pitiless attacks next came the testimony of another friend that the attacks were not merely frequent but almost daily reflect upon that almost daily insults for two months on a stretch what would you have done as for me i did the thing which was the natural thing for me to do that is i set about contriving a plan to accomplish one or the other of two things force a peace or get revenge when i got my plan finished it pleased me marvelously it was in six or seven sections each section to be used in its turn and by itself the assault to begin at once with no and the rest to follow one after the other to keep the communication open while i wrote my biography of reid i meant to wind up with this latter great work and then dismiss the subject for good well ever since then i have worked day and night making notes and collecting and classifying material ive got collectors at work in england i went to new york and sat three hours taking evidence while a stenographer set it down as my labors grew so also grew my fascination malice and malignity faded out of me or maybe i drove them out of me knowing that a malignant book would hurt nobody but the fool who wrote it i got thoroughly in love with this work for i saw that i was going to write a book which the very devils and angels themselves would delight to read and which would draw disapproval from nobody but the hero of it and mrs clemens who was bitter against the whole thing one part of my plan was so delicious that i had to try my hand on it right away just for the luxury of it i set about it and sure enough it panned out to admiration i wrote that chapter most carefully and i couldnt find a fault with it it was not for the biography no it belonged to an immediate and deadlier project well five days ago this thought came into my mindfrom mrs clemenss wouldnt it be well to make sure that the attacks have been almost daily and to also make sure that their number and character will justify me in doing what i am proposing to do i at once set a man to work in new york to seek out and copy every unpleasant reference which had been made to me in the tribune from nov st to date on my own part i began to watch the current numbers for i had subscribed for the paper the result arrived from my new york man this morning o what a pitiable wreck of high hopes the almost daily assaults for two months consist of adverse criticism of p p from an enraged idiot in the london atheneum paragraph from some indignant englishman in the pall mall gazette who pays me the vast compliment of gravely rebuking some imaginary ass who has set me up in the neighborhood of rabelais a remark of the tribunes about the montreal dinner touched with an almost invisible satire a remark of the tribunes about refusal of canadian copyright not complimentary but not necessarily malicious and of course adverse criticism which is not malicious is a thing which none but fools irritate themselves about there that is the prodigious bugaboo in its entirety can you conceive of a mans getting himself into a sweat over so diminutive a provocation i am sure i cant what the devil can those friends of mine have been thinking about to spread these or harmless things out into two months of daily sneers and affronts the whole offense boiled down amounts to just this one uncourteous remark of the tribune about my book not me between nov and dec and a couple of foreign criticisms of my writings not me between nov and jan if i cant stand that amount of friction i certainly need reconstruction further boiled down this vast outpouring of malice amounts to simply this one jest from the tribune one can make nothing more serious than that out of it one jest and that is all for the foreign criticisms do not count they being matters of news and proper for publication in anybodys newspaper and to offset that one jest the tribune paid me one compliment dec by publishing my note declining the new york new england dinner while merely in the same breath mentioning that similar letters were read from general sherman and other men whom we all know to be persons of real consequence well my mountain has brought forth its mouse and a sufficiently small mouse it is god knows and my three weeks hard work have got to go into the ignominious pigeonhole confound it i could have earned ten thousand dollars with infinitely less trouble however i shouldnt have done it for i am too lazy now in my sere and yellow leaf to be willing to work for anything but love i kind of envy you people who are permitted for your righteousness sake to dwell in a boarding house not that i should always want to live in one but i should like the change occasionally from this housekeeping slavery to that wild independence a life of dontcareadamn in a boarding house is what i have asked for in many a secret prayer i shall come by and by and require of you what you have offered me there yours ever mark howells who had already known something of the gathering storm replied your letter was an immense relief to me for although i had an abiding faith that you would get sick of your enterprise i wasnt easy until i knew that you had given it up joel chandler harris appears again in the letters of this period twichell during a trip south about this time had called on harris with some sort of proposition or suggestion from clemens that harris appear with him in public and tell or read the remus stories from the platform but harris was abnormally diffident clemens later pronounced him the shyest fullgrown man he had ever met and the word which twichell brought home evidently did not encourage the platform idea to joel chandler harris in atlanta hartford apl private my dear mr harris jo twichell brought me your note and told me of his talk with you he said you didnt believe you would ever be able to muster a sufficiency of reckless daring to make you comfortable and at ease before an audience well i have thought out a device whereby i believe we can get around that difficulty i will explain when i see you jo says you want to go to canada within a month or six weeks i forget just exactly what he did say but he intimated the trip could be delayed a while if necessary if this is so suppose you meet osgood and me in new orleans early in may say somewhere between the st and th it will be well worth your while to do this because the author who goes to canada unposted will not know what course to pursue to secure copyright when he gets there he will find himself in a hopeless confusion as to what is the correct thing to do now osgood is the only man in america who can lay out your course for you and tell you exactly what to do therefore you just come to new orleans and have a talk with him our idea is to strike across lots and reach st louis the th of april thence we propose to drift southward stopping at some town a few hours or a night every day and making notes to escape the interviewers i shall follow my usual course and use a fictitious name c l samuel of new york i dont know what osgoods name will be but he cant use his own if you see your way to meet us in new orleans drop me a line now and as we approach that city i will telegraph you what day we shall arrive there i would go to atlanta if i could but shant be able we shall go back up the river to st paul and thence by rail xlots home i am making this letter so dreadfully private and confidential because my movements must be kept secret else i shant be able to pick up the kind of bookmaterial i want if you are diffident i suspect that you ought to let osgood be your magazineagent he makes those people pay three or four times as much as an article is worth whereas i never had the cheek to make them pay more than double yrs sincerely s l clemens my backwardness is an affliction wrote harris the ordeal of appearing on the stage would be a terrible one but my experience is that when a diffident man does become familiar with his surroundings he has more impudence than his neighbors extremes meet he was sorely tempted but his courage became as water at the thought of footlights and assembled listeners once in new york he appears to have been caught unawares at a tile club dinner and made to tell a story but his agony was such that at the prospect of a similar ordeal in boston he avoided that city and headed straight for georgia and safety the new orleans excursion with osgood as planned by clemens proved a great success the little party took the steamer gold dust from st louis down river toward new orleans clemens was quickly recognized of course and his assumed name laid aside the author of uncle remus made the trip to new orleans george w cable was there at the time and we may believe that in the company of mark twain and osgood those southern authors passed two or three delightful days clemens also met his old teacher bixby in new orleans and came back up the river with him spending most of his time in the pilothouse as in the old days it was a glorious trip and reaching st louis he continued it northward stopping off at hannibal and quincy to mrs clemens in hartford quincy ill may livy darling i am desperately homesick but i have promised osgood and must stick it out otherwise i would take the train at once and break for home i have spent three delightful days in hannibal loitering around all day long examining the old localities and talking with the greyheads who were boys and girls with me or years ago it has been a moving time i spent my nights with john and helen garth three miles from town in their spacious and beautiful house they were children with me and afterwards schoolmates now they have a daughter or years old spent an hour yesterday with a w lamb who was not married when i saw him last he married a young lady whom i knew and now i have been talking with their grownup sons and daughters lieutenant hickman the spruce young handsomelyuniformed volunteer of called on me a grisly elephantine patriarch of now his grace all vanished that world which i knew in its blossoming youth is old and bowed and melancholy now its soft cheeks are leathery and wrinkled the fire is gone out in its eyes and the spring from its step it will be dust and ashes when i come again i have been clasping hands with the moribundand usually they said it is for the last time now i am under way again upon this hideous trip to st paul with a heart brimming full of thoughts and images of you and susie and bay and the peerless jean and so good night my love saml clemenss trip had been saddened by learning in new orleans the news of the death of dr john brown of edinburgh to doctor browns son whom he had known as jock he wrote immediately on his return to hartford to mr john brown in edinburgh hartford june my dear mr brown i was three thousand miles from home at breakfast in new orleans when the damp morning paper revealed the sorrowful news among the cable dispatches there was no place in america however remote or however rich or poor or high or humble where words of mourning for your father were not uttered that morning for his works had made him known and loved all over the land to mrs clemens and me the loss is personal and our grief the grief one feels for one who was peculiarly near and dear mrs clemens has never ceased to express regret that we came away from england the last time without going to see him and often we have since projected a voyage across the atlantic for the sole purpose of taking him by the hand and looking into his kind eyes once more before he should be called to his rest we both thank you greatly for the edinburgh papers which you sent my wife and i join in affectionate remembrances and greetings to yourself and your aunt and in the sincere tender of our sympathies faithfully yours s l clemens our susie is still megalops he gave her that name can you spare a photograph of your father we have none but the one taken in a group with ourselves william dean howells at the age of fortyfive reached what many still regard his highest point of achievement in american realism his novel the rise of silas lapham which was running as a century serial during the summer of attracted wide attention and upon its issue in book form took first place among his published novels mark twain to the end of his life loved all that howells wrote once long afterward he said most authors give us glimpses of a radiant moon but howellss moon shines and sails all night long when the instalments of the rise of silas lapham began to appear he overflowed in adjectives the sincerity of which we need not doubt in view of his quite open criticisms of the authors reading delivery to w d howells in belmont mass my dear howells i am in a state of wild enthusiasm over this july instalment of your story its perfectly dazzling its masterly incomparable yet i heard you read it without losing my balance well the difference between your reading and your writing isremarkable i mean in the effects produced and the impression left behind why the one is to the other as is one of joe twichells yarns repeated by a somnambulist goodness gracious you read me a chapter and it is a gentle pearly dawn with a sprinkle of faint stars in it but by and by i strike it in print and shout to myself god bless us how has that pallid former spectacle been turned into these gorgeous sunset splendors well i dont care how much you read your truck to me you cant permanently damage it for me that way it is always perfectly fresh and dazzling when i come on it in the magazine of course i recognize the form of it as being familiar but that is all that is i remember it as pyrotechnic figures which you set up before me dead and cold but ready for the match and now i see them touched off and all ablaze with blinding fires you can read if you want to but you dont read worth a damn i know you can read because your readings of cable and your repeatings of the german doctors remarks prove that thats the best drunk scene because the truest that i ever read there are touches in it that i never saw any writer take note of before and they are set before the reader with amazing accuracy how very drunk and how recently drunk and how altogether admirably drunk you must have been to enable you to contrive that masterpiece why i didnt notice that that religious interview between marcia and mrs halleck was so deliciously humorous when you read it to me but dear me its just too lovely for anything wrote clark to collar it for the library hang it i know where the mystery is now when you are reading you glide right along and i dont get a chance to let the things soak home but when i catch it in the magazine i give a page or minutes in which to gently and thoroughly filter into me your humor is so very subtle and elusive well often its just a vanishing breath of perfume which a body isnt certain he smelt till he stops and takes another smell whereas you can smell other remainder obliterated among mark twains old schoolmates in hannibal was little helen kercheval for whom in those early days he had a very tender spot indeed but she married another schoolmate john garth who in time became a banker highly respected and a great influence john and helen garth have already been mentioned in the letter of may th to john garth in hannibal hartford july dear john your letter of june i arrived just one day after we ought to have been in elmira n y for the summer but at the last moment the baby was seized with scarlet fever i had to telegraph and countermand the order for special sleeping car and in fact we all had to fly around in a lively way and undo the patient preparations of weeks rehabilitate the dismantled house unpack the trunks and so on a couple of days later the eldest child was taken down with so fierce a fever that she was soon delirious not scarlet fever however next i myself was stretched on the bed with three diseases at once and all of them fatal but i never did care for fatal diseases if i could only have privacy and room to express myself concerning them we gave early warning and of course nobody has entered the house in all this time but one or two reckless old bachelors and they probably wanted to carry the disease to the children of former flames of theirs the house is still in quarantine and must remain so for a week or two yet at which time we are hoping to leave for elmira always your friend s l clemens by the end of summer howells was in europe and clemens in elmira was trying to finish his mississippi book which was giving him a great deal of trouble it was usually so with his nonfiction books his interest in them was not cumulative he was prone to grow weary of them while the menace of his publishers contract was maddening howellss letters meant to be comforting or at least entertaining did not always contribute to his peace of mind the library of american humor which they had planned was an added burden before sailing howells had written do you suppose you can do your share of the reading at elmira while you are writing at the mississippi book in a letter from london howells writes of the good times he is having over there with osgood hutton john hay aldrich and alma tadema excursioning to oxford feasting especially at the mitre tavern where they let you choose your dinner from the joints hanging from the rafter and have passages that you lose yourself in every time you try to go to your room couldnt you and mrs clemens step over for a little while we have seen lots of nice people and have been most pleasantly made of but i would rather have you smoke in my face and talk for half a day just for pleasure than to go to the best house or club in london the reader will gather that this could not be entirely soothing to a man shackled by a contract and a book that refused to come to an end to w d howells in london hartford conn oct my dear howells i do not expect to find you so i shant spend many words on you to wind up in the perdition of some european deadletter office i only just want to say that the closing installments of the story are prodigious all along i was afraid it would be impossible for you to keep up so splendidly to the end but you were only i see now striking eleven it is in these last chapters that you struck twelve go on and write you can write good books yet but you can never match this one and speaking of the book i inclose something which has been happening here lately we have only just arrived at home and i have not seen clark on our matters i cannot see him or any one else until i get my book finished the weather turned cold and we had to rush home while i still lacked thirty thousand words i had been sick and got delayed i am going to write all day and two thirds of the night until the thing is done or break down at it the spur and burden of the contract are intolerable to me i can endure the irritation of it no longer i went to work at nine oclock yesterday morning and went to bed an hour after midnight result of the day mainly stolen from books tho credit given words so i reduced my burden by one third in one day it was five days work in one i have nothing more to borrow or steal the rest must all be written it is ten days work and unless something breaks it will be finished in five we all send love to you and mrs howells and all the family yours as ever mark again from villeneuve on lake geneva howells wrote urging him this time to spend the winter with them in florence where they would write their great american comedy of ormes motor which is to enrich us beyond the dreams of avarice we could have a lot of fun writing it and you could go home with some of the good old etruscan malaria in your bones instead of the wretched pinchbeck hartford article that you are suffering from now its a great opportunity for you besides nobody over there likes you half as well as i do it should be added that ormes motor was the provisional title that clemens and howells had selected for their comedy which was to be built in some measure at least around the character or rather from the peculiarities of orion clemens the cable mentioned in mark twains reply is of course george w cable who only a little while before had come up from new orleans to conquer the north with his wonderful tales and readings to w d howells in switzerland hartford nov th my dear howells yes it would be profitable for me to do that because with your society to help me i should swiftly finish this now apparently interminable book but i cannot come because i am not boss here and nothing but dynamite can move mrs clemens away from home in the winter season i never had such a fight over a book in my life before and the foolishest part of the whole business is that i started osgood to editing it before i had finished writing it as a consequence large areas of it are condemned here and there and yonder and i have the burden of these unfilled gaps harassing me and the thought of the broken continuity of the work while i am at the same time trying to build the last quarter of the book however at last i have said with sufficient positiveness that i will finish the book at no particular date that i will not hurry it that i will not hurry myself that i will take things easy and comfortably write when i choose to write leave it alone when i so prefer the printers must wait the artists the canvassers and all the rest i have got everything at a dead standstill and that is where it ought to be and that is where it must remain to follow any other policy would be to make the book worse than it already is i ought to have finished it before showing to anybody and then sent it across the ocean to you to be edited as usual for you seem to be a great many shades happier than you deserve to be and if i had thought of this thing earlier i would have acted upon it and taken the tuck somewhat out of your joyousness in the same mail with your letter arrived the enclosed from orme the motor man you will observe that he has an office i will explain that this is a law office and i think it probably does him as much good to have a law office without anything to do in it as it would another man to have one with an active business attached you see he is on the electric light lay now going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if i want to and he will manage it free of charge it never would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me to hire him on a good salary not to manage it do you observe the same old eagerness the same old hurry springing from the fear that if he does not move with the utmost swiftness that colossal opportunity will escape him now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities going on week after week with this same man during fifty entire years and he has not yet learned in the slightest degree that there isnt any occasion to hurry that his vast opportunity will always wait and that whether it waits or flies he certainly will never catch it this immortal hopefulness fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment is the immortal feature of this character for a play and we will write that play we should be fools else that staccato postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent for it is slung on the paper telegraphically all the small words left out i am afraid something newer and bigger than the electric light is swinging across his orbit save this letter for an inspiration i have got a hundred more cable has been here creating worshipers on all hands he is a marvelous talker on a deep subject i do not see how even spencer could unwind a thought more smoothly or orderly and do it in a cleaner clearer crisper english he astounded twichell with his faculty you know when it comes down to moral honesty limpid innocence and utterly blemishless piety the apostles were mere policemen to cable so with this in mind you must imagine him at a midnight dinner in boston the other night where we gathered around the board of the summerset club osgood full boyle oreilly full fairchild responsively loaded and aldrich and myself possessing the floor and properly fortified cable told mrs clemens when he returned here that he seemed to have been entertaining himself with horses and had a dreamy idea that he must have gone to boston in a cattlecar it was a very large time he called it an orgy and no doubt it was viewed from his standpoint i wish i were in switzerland and i wish we could go to florence but we have to leave these delights to you there is no helping it we all join in love to you and all the family yours as ever mark xxiii letters to howells and others a guest of the marquis of lorne the history game a play by howells and mark twain mark twain in due season finished the mississippi book and placed it in osgoods hands for publication it was a sort of partnership arrangement in which clemens was to furnish the money to make the book and pay osgood a percentage for handling it it was in fact the beginning of mark twains adventures as a publisher howells was not as happy in florence as he had hoped to be the social life there overwhelmed him in february he wrote our two months in florence have been the most ridiculous time that ever even halfwitted people passed we have spent them in chasing round after people for whom we cared nothing and being chased by them my story isnt finished yet and what part of it is done bears the fatal marks of haste and distraction of course i havent put pen to paper yet on the play i wring my hands and beat my breast when i think of how these weeks have been wasted and how i have been forced to waste them by the infernal social circumstances from which i couldnt escape clemens now free from the burden of his own book was light of heart and full of ideas and news also of sympathy and appreciation howellss story of this time was a womans reason governor jewell of this letter was marshall jewell governor of connecticut from to later he was minister to russia and in was united states postmastergeneral to w d howells in florence hartford march st my dear howells we got ourselves ground up in that same mill once in london and another time in paris it is a kind of foretaste of hell there is no way to avoid it except by the method which you have now chosen one must live secretly and cut himself utterly off from the human race or life in europe becomes an unbearable burden and work an impossibility i learned something last night and maybe it may reconcile me to go to europe again sometime i attended one of the astonishingly popular lectures of a man by the name of stoddard who exhibits interesting stereopticon pictures and then knocks the interest all out of them with his comments upon them but all the world go there to look and listen and are apparently well satisfied and they ought to be fully satisfied if the lecturer would only keep still or die in the first act but he described how retired tradesmen and farmers in holland load a lazy scow with the family and the household effects and then loaf along the waterways of the low countries all the summer long paying no visits receiving none and just lazying a heavenly life out in their own private unpestered society and doing their literary work if they have any wholly uninterrupted if you had hired such a boat and sent for us we should have a couple of satisfactory books ready for the press now with no marks of interruption vexatious wearinesses and other hellishnesses visible upon them anywhere we shall have to do this another time we have lost an opportunity for the present do you forget that heaven is packed with a multitude of all nations and that these people are all on the most familiar howthehellareyou footing with talmage swinging around the circle to all eternity hugging the saints and patriarchs and archangels and forcing you to do the same unless you choose to make yourself an object of remark if you refrain then why do you try to get to heaven be warned in time we have all read your two opening numbers in the century and consider them almost beyond praise i hear no dissent from this verdict i did not know there was an untouched personage in american life but i had forgotten the auctioneer you have photographed him accurately i have been an utterly free person for a month or two and i do not believe i ever so greatly appreciated and enjoyed and realized the absence of the chains of slavery as i do this time usually my first waking thought in the morning is i have nothing to do today i belong to nobody i have ceased from being a slave of course the highest pleasure to be got out of freedom and having nothing to do is labor therefore i labor but i take my time about it i work one hour or four as happens to suit my mind and quit when i please and so these days are days of entire enjoyment i told clark the other day to jog along comfortable and not get in a sweat i said i believed you would not be able to enjoy editing that library over there where you have your own legitimate work to do and be pestered to death by society besides therefore i thought if he got it ready for you against your return that that would be best and pleasantest you remember governor jewell and the night he told about russia down in the library he was taken with a cold about three weeks ago and i stepped over one evening proposing to beguile an idle hour for him with a yarn or two but was received at the door with whispers and the information that he was dying his case had been dangerous during that day only and he died that night two hours after i left his taking off was a prodigious surprise and his death has been most widely and sincerely regretted win e dodge the fatherinlaw of one of jewells daughters dropped suddenly dead the day before jewell died but jewell died without knowing that jewells widow went down to new york to dodges house the day after jewells funeral and was to return here day before yesterday and she did in a coffin she fell dead of heart disease while her trunks were being packed for her return home florence strong one of jewells daughters who lives in detroit started east on an urgent telegram but missed a connection somewhere and did not arrive here in time to see her father alive she was his favorite child and they had always been like lovers together he always sent her a box of fresh flowers once a week to the day of his death a custom which he never suspended even when he was in russia mrs strong had only just reached her western home again when she was summoned to hartford to attend her mothers funeral i have had the impulse to write you several times i shall try to remember better henceforth with sincerest regards to all of you yours as ever mark mark twain made another trip to canada in the interest of copyrightthis time to protect the mississippi book when his journey was announced by the press the marquis of lorne telegraphed an invitation inviting him to be his guest at rideau hall in ottawa clemens accepted of course and was handsomely entertained by the daughter of queen victoria and her husband then governorgeneral of canada on his return to hartford he found that osgood had issued a curious little book for which clemens had prepared an introduction it was an absurd volume though originally issued with serious intent its title being the new guide of the conversation in portuguese and english the new guide of the conversation in portuguese and english by pedro caxolino with an introduction by mark twain osgood boston evidently the new guide was prepared by some simple portuguese soul with but slight knowledge of english beyond that which could be obtained from a dictionary and his literal translation of english idioms are often startling as for instance this one taken at random a little learneds are happies enough for to may to satisfy their fancies on the literature mark twain thought this quaint book might amuse his royal hostess and forwarded a copy in what he considered to be the safe and proper form to col de winton in ottawa canada hartford june dear colonel de winton i very much want to send a little book to her royal highness the famous portuguese phrase book but i do not know the etiquette of the matter and i would not wittingly infringe any rule of propriety it is a book which i perfectly well know will amuse her some at most if she has not seen it before and will still amuse her some at least even if she has inspected it a hundred times already so i will send the book to you and you who know all about the proper observances will protect me from indiscretion in case of need by putting the said book in the fire and remaining as dumb as i generally was when i was up there i do not rebind the thing because that would look as if i thought it worth keeping whereas it is only worth glancing at and casting aside will you please present my compliments to mrs de winton and mrs mackenzie and i beg to make my sincere compliments to you also for your infinite kindnesses to me i did have a delightful time up there most certainly truly yours s l clemens p s although the introduction dates a year back the book is only just now issued a good long delay s l c howells writing from venice in april manifested special interest in the play project something that would run like scheherazade for a thousand and one nights so perhaps his book was going better he proposed that they devote the month of october to the work and inclosed a letter from mallory who owned not only a religious paper the churchman but also the madison square theater and was anxious for a howells play twenty years before howells had been consul to venice and he wrote now the idea of my being here is benumbing and silencing i feel like the wandering jew or the ghost of the cardiff giant he returned to america in july clemens sent him word of welcome with glowing reports of his own undertakings the story on which he was piling up ms was the adventures of huckleberry finn begun seven years before at quarry farm he had no great faith in it then and though he had taken it up again in his interest had not lasted to its conclusion this time however he was in the proper spirit and the story would be finished to w d howells in boston elmira july my dear howells we are desperately glad you and your gang are home again may you never travel again till you go aloft or alow charley clark has gone to the other side for a run will be back in august he has been sick and needed the trip very much mrs clemens had a long and wasting spell of sickness last spring but she is pulling up now the children are booming and my health is ridiculous its so robust notwithstanding the newspaper misreports i havent piled up ms so in years as i have done since we came here to the farm three weeks and a half ago why its like old times to step right into the study damp from the breakfast table and sail right in and sail right on the whole day long without thought of running short of stuff or words i wrote words today and i touch and upwards pretty often and dont fall below any working day and when i get fagged out i lie abed a couple of days and read and smoke and then go it again for or days i have finished one small book and am away along in a big one that i halffinished two or three years ago i expect to complete it in a month or six weeks or two months more and i shall like it whether anybody else does or not its a kind of companion to tom sawyer theres a raft episode from it in second or third chapter of life on the mississippi im booming these days got health and spirits to waste got an overplus and if i were at home we would write a play but we must do it anyhow by and by we stay here till sep then maybe a week at indian neck for sea air then home we are powerful glad you are all back and send love according yrs ever mark to onion clemens and family in keokuk id elmira july private dear ma and orion and mollie i dont know that i have anything new to report except that livy is still gaining and all the rest of us flourishing i havent had such booming workingdays for many years i am piling up manuscript in a really astonishing way i believe i shall complete in two months a book which i have been fooling over for years this summer it is no more trouble to me to write than it is to lie day before yesterday i felt slightly warned to knock off work for one day so i did it and took the open air then i struck an idea for the instruction of the children and went to work and carried it out it took me all day i measured off feet of the roadway in our farm grounds with a footrule and then divided it up among the english reigns from the conqueror down to allowing one foot to the year i whittled out a basket of little pegs and drove one in the ground at the beginning of each reign and gave it that kings name thus i measured all the reigns exactly as many feet to the reign as there were years in it you can look out over the grounds and see the little pegs from the front door some of them close together like richard ii richard cromwell james ii c and some prodigiously wide apart like henry iii edward iii george iii c it gives the children a realizing sense of the length or brevity of a reign shall invent a violent game to go with it and in bed last night i invented a way to play it indoors in a far more voluminous way as to multiplicity of dates and events on a cribbage board hello suppers ready love to all good bye saml onion clemens would naturally get excited over the idea of the game and its commercial possibilities not more so than his brother however who presently employed him to arrange a quantity of historical data which the game was to teach for a season indeed interest in the game became a sort of midsummer madness which pervaded the two households at keokuk and at quarry farm howells wrote his approval of the idea of learning history by the running foot which was a pun even if unintentional for in its outdoor form it was a game of speed as well as knowledge howells adds that he has noticed that the newspapers are exploiting mark twains new invention of a history game and we shall presently see how this happened also in this letter howells speaks of an english nobleman to whom he has given a letter of introduction he seemed a simple quiet gentlemanly man with a good taste in literature which he evinced by going about with my books in his pockets and talking of yours to w d howells in boston my dear howells how odd it seems to sit down to write a letter with the feeling that youve got time to do it but im done work for this season and so have got time ive done two seasons work in one and havent anything left to do now but revise ive written eight or nine hundred ms pages in such a brief space of time that i mustnt name the number of days i shouldnt believe it myself and of course couldnt expect you to i used to restrict myself to or hours a day and days in the week but this time ive wrought from breakfast till pm six days in the week and once or twice i smouched a sunday when the boss wasnt looking nothing is half so good as literature hooked on sunday on the sly i wrote you and twichell on the same night about the game and was appalled to get a note from him saying he was going to print part of my letter and was going to do it before i could get a chance to forbid it i telegraphed him but was of course too late if you havent ever tried to invent an indoor historical game dont ive got the thing at last so it will work i guess but i dont want any more tasks of that kind when i wrote you i thought i had it whereas i was only merely entering upon the initiatory difficulties of it i might have known it wouldnt be an easy job or somebody would have invented a decent historical game long ago a thing which nobody had done i think ive got it in pretty fair shape so i have caveated it earl of onston is that it all right we shall be very glad to receive them and get acquainted with them and much obliged to you too theres plenty of worse people than the nobilities i went up and spent a week with the marquis and the princess louise and had as good a time as i want im powerful glad you are all back again and we will come up there if our little tribe will give us the necessary furlough and if we cant get it you folks must come to us and give us an extension of time we get home sept hello i think i see waring coming goodbyletter from clark which explains for him love to you all from the clemenses no it wasnt waring i wonder what the devil has become of that man he was to spend today with us and the days most gone now we are enjoying your story with our usual unspeakableness and im right glad you threw in the shipwreck and the mystery i like it mrs crane thinks its the best story youve written yet we but we always think the last one is the best and why shouldnt it be practice helps p s i thought i had sent all our loves to all of you but mrs clemens says i havent damn it a body cant think of everything but a woman thinks you can i better seal this now else therell be more criticism i perceive i havent got the love in yet well we do send the love of all the family to all the howellses s l c there had been some delay and postponement in the matter of the play which howells and clemens agreed to write they did not put in the entire month of october as they had planned but they did put in a portion of that month the latter half working out their old idea in the end it became a revival of colonel sellers or rather a caricature of that gentle hearted old visionary clemens had always complained that the actor raymond had never brought out the finer shades of colonel sellerss character but raymond in his worst performance never belied his original as did howells and clemens in his dramatic revival these two working together let their imaginations run riot with disastrous results the reader can judge something of this himself from the american claimant the book which mark twain would later build from the play but at this time they thought it a great triumph they had cracked their sides laughing over its construction as howells once said and they thought the world would do the same over its performance they decided to offer it to raymond but rather haughtily indifferently because any number of other actors would be waiting for it but this was a miscalculation raymond now turned the tables though favorable to the idea of a new play he declared this one did not present his old sellers at all but a lunatic in the end he returned the ms with a brief note attempts had already been made to interest other actors and would continue for some time xxiv letters to howells and others cables great april fool huck finn in press mark twain for cleveland clemens and cable mark twain had a lingering attack of the dramatic fever that winter he made a play of the prince and pauper which howells pronounced too thin and slight and not half long enough he made another of tom sawyer and probably destroyed it for no trace of the ms exists today howells could not join in these ventures for he was otherwise occupied and had sickness in his household to w d howells in boston jan my dear howells o my goodns as jean says you have now encountered at last the heaviest calamity that can befall an author the scarlet fever once domesticated is a permanent member of the family money may desert you friends forsake you enemies grow indifferent to you but the scarlet fever will be true to you through thick and thin till you be all saved or damned down to the last one i say these things to cheer you the bare suggestion of scarlet fever in the family makes me shudder i believe i would almost rather have osgood publish a book for me you folks have our most sincere sympathy oh the intrusion of this hideous disease is an unspeakable disaster my billiard table is stacked up with books relating to the sandwich islands the walls axe upholstered with scraps of paper penciled with notes drawn from them i have saturated myself with knowledge of that unimaginably beautiful land and that most strange and fascinating people and i have begun a story its hidden motive will illustrate a butlittle considered fact in human nature that the religious folly you are born in you will die in no matter what apparently reasonabler religious folly may seem to have taken its place meanwhile and abolished and obliterated it i start bill ragsdale at years of age and the heroine at in the midst of the ancient idolatrous system with its picturesque and amazing customs and superstitions months before the arrival of the missionaries and the erection of a shallow christianity upon the ruins of the old paganism then these two will become educated christians and highly civilized and then i will jump years and do ragsdales leper business when we came to dramatize we can draw a deal of matter from the story all ready to our hand yrs ever mark he never finished the sandwich islands story which he and howells were to dramatize later his head filled up with other projects such as publishing plans readingtours and the like the typesetting machine does not appear in the letters of this period but it was an important factor nevertheless it was costing several thousand dollars a month for construction and becoming a heavy drain on mark twains finances it was necessary to recuperate and the anxiety for a profitable play or some other adventure that would bring a quick and generous return grew out of this need clemens had established charles l webster his nephew by marriage in a new york office as selling agent for the mississippi book and for his plays he was also planning to let webster publish the new book huck finn george w cable had proven his ability as a reader and clemens saw possibilities in a reading combination which was first planned to include aldrich and howells and a private car but aldrich and howells did not warm to the idea and the car was eliminated from the plan cable came to visit clemens in hartford and was taken with the mumps so that the readingtrip was postponed the fortunes of the sellers play were most uncertain and becoming daily more doubtful in february howells wrote if you have got any comfort in regard to our play i wish you would heave it into my bosom cable recovered in time and out of gratitude planned a great aprilfool surprise for his host he was a systematic man and did it in his usual thorough way he sent a private and confidential suggestion to a hundred and fifty of mark twains friends and admirers nearly all distinguished literary men the suggestion was that each one of them should send a request for mark twains autograph timing it so that it would arrive on the st of april all seemed to have responded mark twains writingtable on april fool morning was heaped with letters asking in every ridiculous fashion for his valuable autograph the one from aldrich was a fair sample he wrote i am making a collection of autographs of our distinguished writers and having read one of your works gabriel convoy i would like to add your name to the list of course the joke in this was that gabriel convoy was by bret harte who by this time was thoroughly detested by mark twain the first one or two of the letters puzzled the victim then he comprehended the size and character of the joke and entered into it thoroughly one of the letters was from bloodgood h cutter the poet lariat of innocents abroad cutter of course wrote in poetry that is to say doggerel mark twains april fool was a most pleasant one rhymed letter by bloodgood h cutter to mark twain little neck long island long island farmer to his friend and pilgrim brother samuel l clemens esq friends suggest in each ones behalf to write and ask your autograph to refuse that i will not do after the long voyage had with you that was a memorable time you wrote in prose i wrote in rhyme to describe the wonders of each place and the queer customs of each race that is in my memory yet for while i live ill not forget i often think of that affair and the many that were with us there as your friends think it for the best i ask your autograph with the rest hoping you will it to me send twill please and cheer your dear old friend yours truly bloodgood h cutter to w d howells in boston hartford apl my dear howells it took my breath away and i havent recovered it yet entirely i mean the generosity of your proposal to read the proofs of huck finn now if you mean it old man if you are in earnest proceed in gods name and be by me forever blest i cannot conceive of a rational man deliberately piling such an atrocious job upon himself but if there is such a man and you be that man why then pile it on it will cost me a pang every time i think of it but this anguish will be eingebusst to me in the joy and comfort i shall get out of the not having to read the verfluchtete proofs myself but if you have repented of your augenblichlicher tobsucht and got back to calm cold reason again i wont hold you to it unless i find i have got you down in writing somewhere herr i would not read the proof of one of my books for any fair and reasonable sum whatever if i could get out of it the proofreading on the p p cost me the last rags of my religion m howells had written that he would be glad to help out in the reading of the proofs of huck finn which book webster by this time had in hand replying to clemenss eager and grateful acceptance now he wrote it is all perfectly true about the generosity unless i am going to read your proofs from one of the shabby motives which i always find at the bottom of my soul if i examine it a characteristic utterance though we may be permitted to believe that his shabby motives were fewer and less shabby than those of mankind in general the proofs which howells was reading pleased him mightily once during the summer he wrote if i had written half as good a book as huck finn i shouldnt ask anything better than to read the proofs even as it is i dont so send them on they will always find me somewhere this was the summer of the blainecleveland campaign mark twain in company with many other leading men had mugwumped and was supporting cleveland from the next letter we gather something of the aspects of that memorable campaign which was one of scandal and vituperation we learn too that the young sculptor karl gerhardt having completed a three years study in paris had returned to america a qualified artist to w d howells in boston elmira aug my dear howells this presidential campaign is too delicious for anything isnt human nature the most consummate sham and lie that was ever invented isnt man a creature to be ashamed of in pretty much all his aspects man know thyself and then thou wilt despise thyself to a dead moral certainty take three quite good specimens hawley warner and charley clark even i do not loathe blaine more than they do yet hawley is howling for blaine warner and clark are eating their daily crow in the paper for him and all three will vote for him o stultification where is thy sting o slave where is thy hickory i suppose you heard how a marble monument for which st gaudens was pecuniarily responsible burned down in hartford the other day uninsured for who in the world would ever think of insuring a marble shaft in a cemetery against a fire and left st gauden out of pocket it was a bad day for artists gerhardt finished my bust that day and the work was pronounced admirable by all the kin and friends but in putting it in plaster or rather taking it out next day it got ruined it was four or five weeks hard work gone to the dogs the news flew and everybody on the farm flocked to the arbor and grouped themselves about the wreck in a profound and moving silence the farmhelp the colored servants the german nurse the children everybody a silence interrupted at wide intervals by absentminded ejaculations wising from unconscious breasts as the whole size of the disaster gradually worked its way home to the realization of one spirit after another some burst out with one thing some another the german nurse put up her hands and said oh schade oh schrecklich but gerhardt said nothing or almost that he couldnt word it i suppose but he went to work and by dark had everything thoroughly well under way for a fresh start in the morning and in three days time had built a new bust which was a trifle better than the old one and tomorrow we shall put the finishing touches on it and it will be about as good a one as nearly anybody can make yrs ever mark if you run across anybody who wants a bust be sure and recommend gerhardt on my sayso but howells was determinedly for blaine i shall vote for blaine he replied i do not believe he is guilty of the things they accuse him of and i know they are not proved against him as for cleveland his private life may be no worse than that of most men but as an enemy of that contemptible hypocritical lopsided morality which says a woman shall suffer all the shame of unchastity and man none i want to see him destroyed politically by his past the men who defend him would take their wives to the white house if he were president but if he married his concubine made her an honest woman they would not go near him i cant stand that certainly this was sound logic in that day at least but it left clemens far from satisfied to w d howells in boston elmira sept my dear howells somehow i cant seem to rest quiet under the idea of your voting for blaine i believe you said something about the country and the party certainly allegiance to these is well but as certainly a mans first duty is to his own conscience and honor the party or the country come second to that and never first i dont ask you to vote at all i only urge you to not soil yourself by voting for blaine when you wrote before you were able to say the charges against him were not proven but you know now that they are proven and it seems to me that that bars you and all other honest and honorable men who are independently situated from voting for him it is not necessary to vote for cleveland the only necessary thing to do as i understand it is that a man shall keep himself clean by withholding his vote for an improper man even though the party and the country go to destruction in consequence it is not parties that make or save countries or that build them to greatness it is clean men clean ordinary citizens rank and file the masses clean masses are not made by individuals standing back till the rest become clean as i said before i think a mans first duty is to his own honor not to his country and not to his party dont be offended i mean no offence i am not so concerned about the rest of the nation but well goodbye ys ever mark there does not appear to be any further discussion of the matter between howells and clemens their letters for a time contained no suggestion of politics perhaps mark twains own political conscience was not entirely clear in his repudiation of his party at least we may believe from his next letter that his cleveland enthusiasm was qualified by a willingness to support a republican who would command his admiration and honor the idea of an eleventhhour nomination was rather startling whatever its motive to mr pierce in boston hartford oct my dear mr pierce you know as well as i do that the reason the majority of republicans are going to vote for blaine is because they feel that they cannot help themselves do not you believe that if mr edmunds would consent to run for president on the independent ticket even at this late day he might be elected well if he wouldnt consent but should even strenuously protest and say he wouldnt serve if elected isnt it still wise and fair to nominate him and vote for him since his protest would relieve him from all responsibility and he couldnt surely find fault with people for forcing a compliment upon him and do not you believe that his name thus compulsorily placed at the head of the independent column would work absolutely certain defeat to blain and save the countrys honor politicians often carry a victory by springing some disgraceful and rascally mine under the feet of the adversary at the eleventh hour would it not be wholesome to vary this thing for once and spring as formidable a mine of a better sort under the enemys works if edmundss name were put up i would vote for him in the teeth of all the protesting and blaspheming he could do in a month and there are lots of others who would do likewise if this notion is not a foolish and wicked one wont you just consult with some chief independents and see if they wont call a sudden convention and whoop the thing through to nominate edmunds the st of november would be soon enough wouldnt it with kindest regards to you and the aldriches yr truly s l clemens clemens and cable set out on their readingtour in november they were a curiouslyassorted pair cable was of orthodox religion exact as to habits neat prim all that clemens was not in the beginning cable undertook to read the bible aloud to clemens each evening but this part of the days program was presently omitted by request if they spent sunday in a town cable was up bright and early visiting the various churches and sundayschools while mark twain remained at the hotel in bed reading or asleep xxv the great year of clemens and cable publication of huck finn the grant memoirs mark twain at fifty the year was in some respects the most important certainly the most pleasantly exciting in mark twains life it was the year in which he entered fully into the publishing business and launched one of the most spectacular of all publishing adventures the personal memoirs of general u s grant clemens had not intended to do general publishing when he arranged with webster to become salesagent for the mississippi book and later general agent for huck finns adventures he had intended only to handle his own books because he was pretty thoroughly dissatisfied with other publishing arrangements even the library of humor which howells with clark of the courant had put together for him he left with osgood until that publisher failed during the spring of certainly he never dreamed of undertaking anything of the proportions of the grant book he had always believed that grant could make a book more than once when they had met he had urged the general to prepare his memoirs for publication howells in his my mark twain tells of going with clemens to see grant then a member of the illfated firm of grant and ward and how they lunched on beans bacon and coffee brought in from a nearby restaurant it was while they were eating this soldier fare that clemens very likely abetted by howells especially urged the great commander to prepare his memoirs but grant had become a financier as he believed and the prospect of literary earnings however large did not appeal to him furthermore he was convinced that he was without literary ability and that a book by him would prove a failure but then by and by came a failure more disastrous than anything he had foreseen the downfall of his firm through the napoleonic rascality of ward general grant was utterly ruined he was left without income and apparently without the means of earning one it was the period when the great war series was appeasing in the century magazine general grant hardpressed was induced by the editors to prepare one or more articles and finding that he could write them became interested in the idea of a book it is unnecessary to repeat here the story of how the publication of this important work passed into the hands of mark twain that is to say the firm of charles l webster co the details having been fully given elsewhere see mark twain a biography chap cliv we will now return for the moment to other matters as reported in order by the letters clemens and cable had continued their readingtour into canada and in february found themselves in montreal here they were invited by the toque bleue snowshoe club to join in one of their weekly excursions across mt royal they could not go and the reasons given by mark twain are not without interest the letter is to mr george iles author of flame electricity and the camera and many other useful works to george iles far the toque blew snowshoe club montreal detroit february midnight ps my dear iles i got your other telegram a while ago and answered it explaining that i get only a couple of hours in the middle of the day for social life i know it doesnt seem rational that a man should have to lie abed all day in order to be rested and equipped for talking an hour at night and yet in my case and cables it is so unless i get a great deal of rest a ghastly dulness settles down upon me on the platform and turns my performance into work and hard work whereas it ought always to be pastime recreation solid enjoyment usually it is just this latter but that is because i take my rest faithfully and prepare myself to do my duty by my audience i am the obliged and appreciative servant of my brethren of the snowshoe club and nothing in the world would delight me more than to come to their house without naming time or terms on my own part but you see how it is my cast iron duty is to my audience it leaves me no liberty and no option with kindest regards to the club and to you i am sincerely yours s l clemens in the next letter we reach the end of the clemenscable venture and get a characteristic summing up of mark twains general attitude toward the companion of his travels it must be read only in the clear realization of mark twains attitude toward orthodoxy and his habit of humor cable was as rigidly orthodox as mark twain was revolutionary the two were never anything but the best of friends to w d howells in boston philada feb my dear howells tonight in baltimore tomorrow afternoon and night in washington and my fourmonths platform campaign is ended at last it has been a curious experience it has taught me that cables gifts of mind are greater and higher than i had suspected but that but is pointing toward his religion you will never never know never divine guess imagine how loathsome a thing the christian religion can be made until you come to know and study cable daily and hourly mind you i like him he is pleasant company i rage and swear at him sometimes but we do not quarrel we get along mighty happily together but in him and his person i have learned to hate all religions he has taught me to abhor and detest the sabbathday and hunt up new and troublesome ways to dishonor it nat goodwin was on the train yesterday he plays in washington all the coming week he is very anxious to get our sellers play and play it under changed names i said the only thing i could do would be to write to you well ive done it ys ever mark clemens and webster were often at the house of general grant during these early days of and it must have been webster who was present with clemens on the great occasion described in the following telegram it was on the last day and hour of president arthurs administration that the bill was passed which placed ulysses s grant as full general with full pay on the retired list and it is said that the congressional clock was set back in order that this enactment might become a law before the administration changed general grant had by this time developed cancer and was already in feeble health telegram to mrs clemens in hartford new york mar to mrs s l clemens we were at general grants at noon and a telegram arrived that the last act of the expiring congress late this morning retired him with full generals rank and accompanying emoluments the effect upon him was like raising the dead we were present when the telegram was put in his hand s l clemens something has been mentioned before of mark twains investments and the generally unprofitable habit of them he had a trusting nature and was usually willing to invest money on any plausible recommendation he was one of thousands such and being a person of distinction he now and then received letters of inquiry complaint or condolence a minister wrote him that he had bought some stocks recommended by a hartford banker and advertised in a religious paper he added after i made that purchase they wrote me that you had just bought a hundred shares and that you were a shrewd man the writer closed by asking for further information he received it as follows to the rev j in baltimore washington mch my dear sir i take my earliest opportunity to answer your favor of feb b was premature in calling me a shrewd man i wasnt one at that time but am one now that is i am at least too shrewd to ever again invest in anything put on the market by b i know nothing whatever about the bank note co and never did know anything about it b sold me about or worth of the stock at and i own it yet he sold me worth of another rosetinted stock about the same time i have got that yet also i judge that a peculiarity of bs stocks is that they are of the staying kind i think you should have asked somebody else whether i was a shrewd man or not for two reasons the stock was advertised in a religious paper a circumstance which was very suspicious and the compliment came to you from a man who was interested to make a purchaser of you i am afraid you deserve your loss a financial scheme advertised in any religious paper is a thing which any living person ought to know enough to avoid and when the factor is added that m runs that religious paper a dead person ought to know enough to avoid it very truly yours s l clemens the story of huck finn was having a wide success webster handled it skillfully and the sales were large in almost every quarter its welcome was enthusiastic here and there however could be found an exception hucks morals were not always approved of by library readingcommittees the first instance of this kind was reported from concord and would seem not to have depressed the authorpublisher to chas l webster in new york mch dear charley the committee of the public library of concord mass have given us a rattling tiptop puff which will go into every paper in the country they have expelled huck from their library as trash and suitable only for the slums that will sell copies for us sure s l c perhaps the concord free trade club had some idea of making amends to mark twain for the slight put upon his book by their librarians for immediately after the huck finn incident they notified him of his election to honorary membership those were the days of authors readings and clemens and howells not infrequently assisted at these functions usually given as benefits of one kind or another from the next letter written following an entertainment given for the longfellow memorial we gather that mark twains opinion of howellss reading was steadily improving to w d howells in boston hartford may my dear howells who taught you to read observation and thought i guess and practice at the tavern club yes and that was the best teaching of all well you sent even your daintiest and most delicate and fleeting points home to that audience absolute proof of good reading but you couldnt read worth a damn a few years ago i do not say this to flatter it is true i looked around for you when i was leaving but you had already gone alas osgood has failed at last it was easy to see that he was on the very verge of it a year ago and it was also easy to see that he was still on the verge of it a month or two ago but i continued to hope but not expect that he would pull through the library of humor is at his dwelling house and he will hand it to you whenever you want it to save it from any possibility of getting mixed up in the failure perhaps you had better send down and get it i told him the other day that an order of any kind from you would be his sufficient warrant for its delivery to you in two days general grant has dictated pages of foolscap and thus the wilderness and appomattox stand for all time in his own words this makes the second volume of his book as valuable as the first he looks mighty well these latter days yrs ever mark i am exceedingly glad wrote howells that you approve of my reading for it gives me some hope that i may do something on the platform next winter but i would never read within a hundred miles of you if i could help it you simply straddled down to the footlights and took that house up in the hollow of your hand and tickled it to w d howells in boston elmira july my dear howells you are really my only author i am restricted to you i wouldnt give a damn for the rest i bored through middlemarch during the past week with its labored and tedious analyses of feelings and motives its paltry and tiresome people its unexciting and uninteresting story and its frequent blinding flashes of singlesentence poetry philosophy wit and what not and nearly died from the overwork i wouldnt read another of those books for a farm i did try to read one other daniel deronda i dragged through three chapters losing flesh all the time and then was honest enough to quit and confess to myself that i havent any romance literature appetite as far as i can see except for your books but what i started to say was that i have just read part ii of indian summer and to my mind there isnt a waste line in it or one that could be improved i read it yesterday ending with that opinion and read it again today ending with the same opinion emphasized i havent read part i yet because that number must have reached hartford after we left but we are going to send down town for a copy and when it comes i am to read both parts aloud to the family it is a beautiful story and makes a body laugh all the time and cry inside and feel so old and so forlorn and gives him gracious glimpses of his lost youth that fill him with a measureless regret and build up in him a cloudy sense of his having been a prince once in some enchanted faroff land and of being an exile now and desolate and lord no chance ever to get back there again that is the thing that hurts well you have done it with marvelous facility and you make all the motives and feelings perfectly clear without analyzing the guts out of them the way george eliot does i cant stand george eliot and hawthorne and those people i see what they are at a hundred years before they get to it and they just tire me to death and as for the bostonians i would rather be damned to john bunyans heaven than read that yrs ever mark it is as easy to understand mark twains enjoyment of indian summer as his revolt against daniel deronda and the bostonians he cared little for writing that did not convey its purpose in the simplest and most direct terms it is interesting to note that in thanking clemens for his compliment howells wrote what people cannot see is that i analyze as little as possible they go on talking about the analytical school which i am supposed to belong to and i want to thank you for using your eyes did you ever read de foes roxana if not then read it not merely for some of the deepest insights into the lying suffering sinning wellmeaning human soul but for the best and most natural english that a book was ever written in general grant worked steadily on his book dictating when he could making brief notes on slips of paper when he could no longer speak clemens visited him at mt mcgregor and brought the dying soldier the comforting news that enough of his books were already sold to provide generously for his family and that the sales would aggregate at least twice as much by the end of the year this was some time in july on the d of that month general grant died immediately there was a newspaper discussion as to the most suitable place for the great chieftain to lie mark twains contribution to this debate though in the form of an open letter seems worthy of preservation here to the new york sun on the proper place for grants tomb to the editor op the sun sir the newspaper atmosphere is charged with objections to new york as a place of sepulchre for general grant and the objectors are strenuous that washington is the right place they offer good reasons good temporary reasons for both of these positions but it seems to me that temporary reasons are not mete for the occasion we need to consider posterity rather than our own generation we should select a grave which will not merely be in the right place now but will still be in the right place years from now how does washington promise as to that you have only to hit it in one place to kill it some day the west will be numerically strong enough to move the seat of government her past attempts are a fair warning that when the day comes she will do it then the city of washington will lose its consequence and pass out of the public view and public talk it is quite within the possibilities that a century hence people would wonder and say how did your predecessors come to bury their great dead in this deserted place but as long as american civilisation lasts new york will last i cannot but think she has been well and wisely chosen as the guardian of a grave which is destined to become almost the most conspicuous in the worlds history twenty centuries from now new york will still be new york still a vast city and the most notable object in it will still be the tomb and monument of general grant i observe that the common and strongest objection to new york is that she is not national ground let us give ourselves no uneasiness about that wherever general grants body lies that is national ground s l clemens elmira july the letter that follows is very long but it seems too important and too interesting to be omitted in any part general grants early indulgence in liquors had long been a matter of wide though not very definite knowledge every one had heard how lincoln on being told that grant drank remarked something to the effect that he would like to know what kind of whisky grant used so that he might get some of it for his other generals henry ward beecher selected to deliver a eulogy on the dead soldier and doubtless wishing neither to ignore the matter nor to make too much of it naturally turned for information to the publisher of grants own memoirs hoping from an advance copy to obtain light to henry ward beecherbrooklyn elmira n y sept my dear mr beecher my nephew webster is in europe making contracts for the memoirs before he sailed he came to me with a writing directed to the printers and binders to this effect honor no order for a sight or copy of the memoirs while i am absent even though it be signed by mr clemens himself i gave my permission there were weighty reasons why i should not only give my permission but hold it a matter of honor to not dissolve the order or modify it at any time so i did all of that said the order should stand undisturbed to the end if a principal could dissolve his promise as innocently as he can dissolve his written order unguarded by his promise i would send you a copy of the memoirs instantly i did not foresee you or i would have made an exception my idea gained from army men is that the drunkenness and sometimes pretty reckless spreeing nights ceased before he came east to be lt general refer especially to gen wm b franklin if you could see franklin and talk with him then he would unbosom it was while grant was still in the west that mr lincoln said he wished he could find out what brand of whisky that fellow used so he could furnish it to some of the other generals franklin saw grant tumble from his horse drunk while reviewing troops in new orleans the fall gave him a good deal of a hurt he was then on the point of leaving for the chattanooga region i naturally put that and that together when i read gen o o howardss article in the christian union three or four weeks ago where he mentions that the new general arrived lame from a recent accident see that article and why not write howard franklin spoke positively of the frequent spreeing in camp in time of war captain grant was frequently threatened by the commandant of his oregon post with a report to the war department of his conduct unless he modified his intemperance the report would mean dismissal from the service at last the report had to be made out and then so greatly was the captain beloved that he was privately informed and was thus enabled to rush his resignation to washington ahead of the report did the report go nevertheless i dont know if it did it is in the war department now possibly and seeable i got all this from a regular army man but i cant name him to save me the only time general grant ever mentioned liquor to me was about last april or possibly may he said if i could only build up my strength the doctors urge whisky and champagne but i cant take them i cant abide the taste of any kind of liquor had he made a conquest so complete that even the taste of liquor was become an offense or was he so sore over what had been said about his habit that he wanted to persuade others and likewise himself that he hadnt even ever had any taste for it it sounded like the latter but thats no evidence he told me in the fall of that there was something the matter with his throat and that at the suggestion of his physicians he had reduced his smoking to one cigar a day then he added in a casual fashion that he didnt care for that one and seldom smoked it i could understand that feeling he had set out to conquer not the habit but the inclination the desire he had gone at the root not the trunk its the perfect way and the only true way i speak from experience how i do hate those enemies of the human race who go around enslaving gods free people with pledges to quit drinking instead of to quit wanting to drink but sherman and van vliet know everything concerning grant and if you tell them how you want to use the facts both of them will testify regular army men have no concealments about each other and yet they make their awful statements without shade or color or malice with a frankness and a childlike naivety indeed which is enchantingand stupefying west point seems to teach them that among other priceless things not to be got in any other college in this world if we talked about our guildmates as i have heard sherman grant van vliet and others talk about theirs mates with whom they were on the best possible terms we could never expect them to speak to us again i am reminded now of another matter the day of the funeral i sat an hour over a single drink and several cigars with van vliet and sherman and senator sherman and among other things gen sherman said with impatient scorn the idea of all this nonsense about grant not being able to stand rude language and indelicate stories why grant was full of humor and full of the appreciation of it i have sat with him by the hour listening to jim nyes yarns and i reckon you know the style of jim nyes histories clemens it makes me sick that newspaper nonsense grant was no nambypamby fool he was a man all over rounded and complete i wish i had thought of it i would have said to general grant put the drunkenness in the memoirs and the repentance and reform trust the people but i will wager there is not a hint in the book he was sore there as much of the book as i have read gives no hint as far as i recollect the sickroom brought out the points of gen grants character some of them particularly to wit his patience his indestructible equability of temper his exceeding gentleness kindness forbearance lovingness charity his loyalty to friends to convictions to promises halfpromises infinitesimal fractions and shadows of promises there was a requirement of him which i considered an atrocity an injustice an outrage i wanted to implore him to repudiate it fred grant said save your labor i know him he is in doubt as to whether he made that halfpromise or not and he will give the thing the benefit of the doubt he will fulfill that halfpromise or kill himself trying fred grant was right he did fulfill it his aggravatingly trustful nature his genuineness simplicity modesty diffidence selfdepreciation poverty in the quality of vanityand in no contradiction of this last his simple pleasure in the flowers and general ruck sent to him by tom dick and harry from everywhere a pleasure that suggested a perennial surprise that he should be the object of so much fine attention he was the most lovable great child in the world i mentioned his loyalty you remember harrison the colored bodyservant the whole family hated him but that did not make any difference the general always stood at his back wouldnt allow him to be scolded always excused his failures and deficiencies with the one unvarying formula we are responsible for these things in his race it is not fair to visit our fault upon them let him alone so they did let him alone under compulsion until the great heart that was his shield was taken away then well they simply couldnt stand him and so they were excusable for determining to discharge him a thing which they mortally hated to do and by lucky accident were saved from the necessity of doing his toughness as a bargainer when doing business for other people or for his country witness his terms at donelson vicksburg etc fred grant told me his father wound up an estate for the widow and orphans of a friend in st louis it took several years at the end every complication had been straightened out and the property put upon a prosperous basis great sums had passed through his hands and when he handed over the papers there were vouchers to show what had been done with every penny and his trusting easy unexacting fashion when doing business for himself at that same time he was paying out money in driblets to a man who was running his farm for him and in his first presidency he paid every one of those driblets again total f said for he hadnt a scrap of paper to show that he had ever paid them before in his dealings with me he would not listen to terms which would place my money at risk and leave him protected the thought plainly gave him pain and he put it from him waved it off with his hands as one does accounts of crushings and mutilations wouldnt listen changed the subject and his fortitude he was under sentence of death last spring he sat thinking musing several days nobody knows what about then he pulled himself together and set to work to finish that book a colossal task for a dying man presently his hand gave out fate seemed to have got him checkmated dictation was suggested no he never could do that had never tried it too old to learn now by and by if he could only do appomattoxwell so he sent for a stenographer and dictated words at a single sitting never pausing never hesitating for a word never repeating and in the writtenout copy he made hardly a correction he dictated again every two or three days the intervals were intervals of exhaustion and slow recuperation and at last he was able to tell me that he had written more matter than could be got into the book i then enlarged the book had to then he lost his voice he was not quite done yet however there was no end of little plums and spices to be stuck in here and there and this work he patiently continued a few lines a day with pad and pencil till far into july at mt mcgregor one day he put his pencil aside and said he was done there was nothing more to do if i had been there i could have foretold the shock that struck the world three days later well ive written all this and it doesnt seem to amount to anything but i do want to help if i only could i will enclose some scraps from my autobiography scraps about general grant they may be of some trifle of use and they may not they at least verify known traits of his character my autobiography is pretty freely dictated but my idea is to jackplane it a little before i die some day or other i mean the rude construction and rotten grammar it is the only dictating i ever did and it was most troublesome and awkward work you may return it to hartford sincerely yours s l clemens the old longdeferred library of humor came up again for discussion when in the fall of howells associated himself with harper brothers howellss contract provided that his name was not to appear on any book not published by the harper firm he wrote therefore offering to sell out his interest in the enterprise for two thousand dollars in addition to the five hundred which he had already received an amount considered to be less than he was to have received as joint author and compiler mark twains answer pretty fully covers the details of this undertaking to w d howells in boston hartford oct private my dear howells i reckon it would ruin the book that is make it necessary to pigeonhole it and leave it unpublished i couldnt publish it without a very responsible name to support my own on the title page because it has so much of my own matter in it i bought osgoods rights for cash i have paid clark and owe him more which must of course be paid whether i publish or not yet i fully recognize that i have no sort of moral right to let that ancient and procrastinated contract hamper you in any way and i most certainly wont so it is my decision after thinking over and rejecting the idea of trying to buy permission of the harpers for to use your name a proposition which they would hate to refuse to a man in a perplexed position and yet would naturally have to refuse it to pigeonhole the library not destroy it but merely pigeonhole it and wait a few years and see what new notion providence will take concerning it he will not desert us now after putting in four licks to our one on this book all this time it really seems in a sense discourteous not to call it providences library of humor now that deal is all settled the next question is do you need and must you require that now since last march you know i am carrying a mighty load solitary and alone general grants book and must carry it till the first volume is days old jan st before the relief money will begin to flow in from now till the first of january every dollar is as valuable to me as it could be to a famishing tramp if you can wait till then i mean without discomfort without inconvenience it will be a large accommodation to me but i will not allow you to do this favor if it will discommode you so speak right out frankly and if you need the money i will go out on the highway and get it using violence if necessary mind i am not in financial difficulties and am not going to be i am merely a starving beggar standing outside the door of plenty obstructed by a yale timelock which is set for jan st i can stand it and stand it perfectly well but the days do seem to fool along considerable slower than they used to i am mighty glad you are with the harpers i have noticed that good men in their employ go there to stay yours ever mark in the next letter we begin to get some idea of the size of mark twains first publishing venture and a brief summary of results may not be out of place here the grant life was issued in two volumes in the early months of the year when the agents canvass was just beginning mark twain with what seems now almost clairvoyant vision prophesied a sale of three hundred thousand sets the actual sales ran somewhat more than this number on february charles l webster co paid to mrs grant the largest single royalty check in the history of bookpublishing the amount of it was two hundred thousand dollars subsequent checks increased the aggregate return to considerably more than double this figure in a memorandum made by clemens in the midst of the canvass he wrote during consecutive days the sales i e subscriptions of general grants book averaged sets single volumes per day roughly stated mrs grants income during all that time was a day to w d howells in boston hotel normandie new york dec my dear howells i told webster this afternoon to send you that but he is in such a rush these first days of publication that he may possibly forget it so i write lest i forget it too remind me if he should forget when i postponed you lately i did it because i thought i should be cramped for money until january but that has turned out to be an error so i hasten to cut short the postponement i judge by the newspapers that you are in auburndale but i dont know it officially ive got the first volume launched safely consequently half of the suspense is over and i am that much nearer the goal weve bound and shipped books and by the th shall finish and ship the remaining of the first edition i got nervous and came down to help humpup the binderies and i mean to stay here pretty much all the time till the first days of march when the second volume will issue shant have so much trouble this time though if we get to press pretty soon because we can get more binderies then than are to be had in front of the holidays one lives and learns i find it takes binderies four months to bind books this is a good book to publish i heard a canvasser say yesterday that while delivering eleven books he took new subscriptions but we shall be in a hell of a fix if that goes on it will ball up the binderies again yrs ever mark november th that year was mark twains fiftieth birthday an event noticed by the newspapers generally and especially observed by many of his friends warner stockton and many others sent letters andrew lang contributed a fine poem also oliver wendell holmes the latter by special request of miss gilder for the critic these attentions came as a sort of crowning happiness at the end of a golden year at no time in his life were mark twains fortunes and prospects brighter he had a beautiful family and a perfect home also he had great prosperity the readingtour with cable had been a fine success his latest book the adventures of huckleberry finn had added largely to his fame and income the publication of the grant memoirs had been a dazzling triumph mark twain had become recognized not only as americas most distinguished author but as its most envied publisher and now with his fiftieth birthday had come this laurel from holmes last of the brahmins to add a touch of glory to all the rest we feel his exaltation in his note of acknowledgment to dr oliver wendell holmes in boston dear mr holmes i shall never be able to tell you the half of how proud you have made me if i could you would say you were nearly paid for the trouble you took and then the family if i can convey the electrical surprise and gratitude and exaltation of the wife and the children last night when they happened upon that critic where i had with artful artlessness spread it open and retired out of view to see what would happen well it was great and fine and beautiful to see and made me feel as the victor feels when the shouting hosts march by and if you also could have seen it you would have said the account was squared for i have brought them up in your company as in the company of a warm and friendly and beneficent but fardistant sun and so for you to do this thing was for the sun to send down out of the skies the miracle of a special ray and transfigure me before their faces i knew what that poem would be to them i knew it would raise me up to remote and shining heights in their eyes to very fellowship with the chambered nautilus itself and that from that fellowship they could never more dissociate me while they should live and so i made sure to be by when the surprise should come charles dudley warner is charmed with the poem for its own felicitous sake and so indeed am i but more because it has drawn the sting of my fiftieth year taken away the pain of it the grief of it the somehow shame of it and made me glad and proud it happened with reverence and affection sincerely yours s l clemens holmes wrote with his own hand did miss gilder tell you i had twentythree letters spread out for answer when her suggestion came about your anniversary i stopped my correspondence and made my letters wait until the lines were done
