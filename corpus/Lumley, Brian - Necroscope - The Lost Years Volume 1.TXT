chapter ii it begins epilogue c hristened snaith in edinburgh in the infant harry was the son of a psychic sensitive mother mary keogh and gerald snaith a banker harrys father died of a stroke a year later and in the winter of his mother remarried this time to a russian dissident viktor shukshin in the winter of shukshin murdered harrys mother by drowning her under the ice of a frozen river he escaped punishment by alleging that while skating shed crashed through the thin crust and been washed away shukshin inherited her isolated bonnyrig house and the not inconsiderable monies left to her by her first husband within six months the young harry keogh had gone to live with an uncle and his wife at harden on the northeast coast of england an arrangement that was more than satisfactory to viktor shukshin who could never stand the child harry commenced schooling with the roughneck kids of the colliery but a dreamy and introspective sort of boy he was a loner developed few friendships not with his fellow pupils anyway and thus fell easy prey to bullying later as he grew towards his teens harrys daydreaming spirit psychic insights and instincts led him into further conflict with his teachers his problem was that he had inherited his maternal forebears mediumistic talents which were developing in him to an extraordinary degree he had no requirement for real or physical companions as such because the many friends he already had were more than sufficient and willing to supply his every need as to who his friends were they were the myriad dead in their graves up against the school bully harry defeated him with the telepathically communicated skills of an ktexarmy physical training instructor an expert in unarmed combat punished with maths homework he received extra tuition from an exheadmaster of the school but here brian lumley he required only a little help for in fact he was something of a mathematician himself except harry leaned more towards the metaphysical his intuitive grasp of numbers was lateral to the point of sidereal his numeracy was as alien to mundane science as his telepathic intercourse with the dead was to speech in harry gained entry into a technical college and until the end of his formal education did his best to tone down the use of his extraordinary talentand be a normal average student aware that he must soon begin to support himself he began writing and by the time his schooling was at an end several short pieces of his fiction had seen print three years later he finished his first novel diary of a thcentury rake while the book fell short of the bestseller lists still it did well it wasnt so much a sensation for its storyline as for its historical authenticity hardly surprising considering the qualifications of harrys coauthor and collaborator namely a thcentury rake shot dead by an outraged husband in by the summer of harry had his own unassuming topfloor flat in an old threestorey house on the coast road out of hartlepool towards sunderland perhaps typically the house stood opposite one of the towns oldest graveyards harry was never short of friends to talk to but by then too his headmaster of a few years ago had discovered his grotesque secret and passed it on to others more secretive yet blithely ignorant of the fact that he was now under wary scrutiny harry let his talent develop he was the necroscope the only man who could talk to the dead and befriend them now that his weird talent was fully formed he could converse with exanimate persons even over great distances once introduced to a member of the great majority thereafter he could always contact him again with harry however it was a point of common decency that whenever possible he would physically attend them at their gravesides he wasnt one to shout at his friends in their turn harrys dead people loved him he was like a pharos among them the one shining light in an otherwise eternal darkness their observatory on a world theyd thought left behind and gone forever for contrary to the beliefs of the living death is not the end but a transition to incorporeality and immobility great artists when they die continue to visualize magnificent canvases they can never paint architects plan fantastic continentspanning cities that can never be built scientists follow up research they commenced in life but never had time to complete at his flat in hartlepool when he wasnt working harry entertained his childhood sweetheart brenda shortly finding herself pregnant she became his wife but a shadow out of the necroscopes past was rapidly becoming an obsession he brooded over dreams of his poor necroscope the lost years vol i drowned mother and in nightmares revisited the frozen river where mary keogh had died before her time finally harry resolved to take revenge on his evil stepfather in this as in all things he had the blessings of the dead for knowing only too well the horror of death coldblooded murder was a crime the teeming dead could never tolerate in the winter of harry tempted viktor shukshin out onto the ice of the frozen river to skate with him as once the murderer had skated with his mother but his plan backfired and they both crashed through the ice into the bitterly cold water the russian had the strength of a madman he would surely drown his stepson but no for at the last moment mary keogh or what remained of her rose from her watery grave to drag her murderer down and with that harry had discovered a new talent or rather he now knew how far the teeming dead would go in order to protect him knew that in fact they would rise from their graves for him the necroscopes weird abilities had not gone unnoticed a topsecret british intelligence organization known as ebranch and its soviet counterpart were both aware of his powers but he was no sooner approached to join ebranch than its head his contact was taken out with extreme prejudice by boris dragosani a romanian spy and necromancer dragosanis terrible talent lay in ripping open the bodies of dead enemy agents to steal their secrets right out of their violated brains blood and guts harry vowed to track dragosani down and even the score and the great majority offered him their help of course they did for even the dead werent safe from a man who violated corpses what harry and his friends couldnt know was that dragosani had been infected with vampirism what was more he had murdered a colleague the mongol max batu to learn the secret of his evil eye the necromancer could now kill at a glance time was short harry must follow the vampire back to the ussr to soviet ebranch headquarters at the chateau bronnitsy south of moscow and there put him down but how a british precog an esper whose talent enabled him to scan fragments of the future had foreseen the necroscopes involvement not only with vampires but also with the twisted figure or eternity symbol of the mobius strip in order to get to dragosani harry first must understand the mobius connection but here at least he was on familiar ground the astronomer and mathematician august ferdinand mobius had been dead since and the dead would do anything for harry keogh in leipzig harry visited mobiuss grave and discovered him at work on his spacetime equations what he had done in life he continued brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i undisturbed to do in death and in the course of a century he had reduced the physical universe to a set of mathematical symbols mobius knew how to bend spacetime teleportation an easy route into the chateau bronnitsy for days mobius instructed harry until the necroscope was sure that the answer lay right there in front of him just an inch beyond his grasp but the east german grepo were watching him and on the orders of dragosani tried to arrest him at mobiuss graveside where suddenly mobiuss equations transformed themselves into doorways into the strange immaterial universe of the mobius continuum using one of these doors to escape from the grepo finally harry was able to project himself into the grounds of soviet ebranch hq calling up from their graves an army of longdead crimean tartars the necroscope destroyed the chateaus defences then sought out and killed dragosani but in the fight he too was killed his body died but in the last moment his mind his will transferred to the metaphysical mobius continuum and riding the mobius strip into future time harrys identity was absorbed into the as yet unformed infant mentality of his own son august drawn to harry jrs allabsorbing mind like an iron filing to a magnet harry keoghs identity was in danger of being entirely subsumed and wiped clean his only avenue of freedom lay in the mobius continuum which he could only use when his infant son was asleep but while exploring the infinite future timestream harry had noted among the myriad blue lifethreads of mankind a scarlet thread another vampire worse than this in the near future hed seen that red thread crossing the innocent blue of young harrys the necroscope investigated he was incorporeal yes but so were the teeming dead he could still communicate with them and they were still in his debt in september of he spoke to the spirit of thibor ferenczy once a vampire at his tomb in the carpathian mountains also to thibors father faethor ferenczy who died in a world war ii bombing raid on ploiesti harry was cautious even when dead vampires are the worst possible liars devious beyond measure but the necroscope had nothing to lose and the vampires had much to gain harry was their last contact with a world they had once planned to rule thus by trial and error playing oh so dangerous catandmouse wordgames with the wamphyri he pieced together the terrible truth that in the late s thibor had infected a pregnant english woman georgina bodescu who later gave birth to a son and thibors spawn yulian bodescu was the source of the threatening red thread in romania alec kyle and felix krakovitch current heads of their respective espionage rings joined forces to destroy the remains of thibor in his carpathian mausoleum there they burned a monstrous remnant of the vampire but not before thibor sent yulian a dreammessage and a warning thibor had hoped to use his english son as a vessel in which to rise up again and resume his vampire existence but since his last physical vestiges were now destroyed instead he would use him to take revenge on the necroscope harry keogh as for killing keogh that should be the very simplest of things the necroscope was incorporeal a bodiless id his own infant sons sixth sense only remove the child and the father would go with him meanwhile in the ussr alec kyle stood falsely accused of murder russian espers were using a combination of high technology and esp to drain him of knowledge literally all knowledge this process would leave him raped of his mind braindead and physical death would soon follow and in england yulian bodescu was on the prowl intent on destroying harry jr he headed for hartlepool his trail was bloody and littered with dead men when finally he entered the house where brenda keogh lived and climbed the stairs to her garret flat the mother tried to protect her small child she was hurled aside harry jr was awake his mind contained harry keogh the monster was upon them powerful hands reaching harry could do nothing trapped in the infants whirlpool id he knew that they were both going to die but then go little harry told him through you ive learned what i had to learn i dont need you that way any longer but i do need you as a father so go on get out save yourself harry was free the mental attraction binding him to his sons mind had been relaxed he could now flee into the mobius continuum and what the father could do the son could do in spades he was a necroscope of enormous power and in the cemetery just across the road the dead answered harry jrs call they came up out of their graves shuffled and flopped from the graveyard into the house and up the stairs bodescu the vampire attempted his first and last metamorphosis adopting the shape of a great bat he flew from a window and took a crossbow bolt in his spine and as he crashed down within the grounds of the cemetery so the incorporeal necroscope instructed the dead in the methods of eradication the stake decapitation the cleansing fire harry keogh was free but free to do what he was a mind without a body except he now felt a different force an attraction other than his infant sons magnet id a vacuum seemingly eager to be filled exploring brian lumley it harry was sucked in irresistibly into the aching emptiness of alex kyles drained mind employing ultrahigh explosives to blow the chateau bronnitsy to hell and his powers as a necroscope to correct other anomalies at last harry could take the mobius route home his work for the moment was at an end it was the late autumn of and he had taken up permanent residence in another mans body indeed to all intents and purposes and to anyone who didnt know better he was that other man but he was also the natural father of a most unnatural child a child with awesome supernatural powers so now harry must face up to other more mundane duties those of a husband and father but how might he perform those duties with the face and form of a different man what of his poor wife brenda who had already suffered more than her fair share of strangeness and horror how could he ask her to share her life with a husband who wasnt the man she knew finally what of the child if harry jr could still be considered a child but perhaps the most difficult questions the necroscope must ask himself were these how much greater than his own talents were his sons how different were they and perhaps more importantly how did he intend to use them thus the world of harry keogh was a vastly complicated place which wasnt about to get any simpler the story that follows concerns itself mainly with certain episodes of the necroscopes life between the previously chronicled wamphyri and the source but it is not alone harry keoghs story for without that the wamphyri were there before him and despite the paradox of their springing from him it could even be said that harry himself would not have been necessary without a disease theres no need for a cure in short this story is also theirs part of the lost history of the wamphyri prologue t he powerful silvergrey stretch limo familiar in itself however unusual but less than unique on an island of ancient fiats and sputtering lambrettas bumped carefully over shifting cobbles under a baroque stone archway into the courtyard of julios cafe and restaurant in the eastern quarter of palermo the lone survivor of a world war ii bombing raid the walled enclosure was once the smallest of four gardens containing a middling villa the other three gardens were rubblestrewn craters only their outer walls had been repaired to create something of an acceptable fagade in the district of the via delia magione the courtyard was set out like a fanshaped checkerboard square tables decked with white covers standing on black flags of volcanic stone the whole split down the middle by a hinge of vehicles parked herringbonefashion on what was once a broad carriageway a palmfringed gap in the wall at the point of the quadrant marked the vehicular exit into the dusky evening some three dozen patrons sat eating drinking chattering though not too energetically a pair of sweating whiteaproned waiters ran to and fro between the tables the bar and kitchens each serving his own triangle of customers even for the third week in may the weather was unseasonably warm at eightthirty in the evening the temperature was up in the high seventies the eastfacing wall of the courtyard contained what was left of the old villa a twostoreyed wing three rooms wide and three deep with a balcony supported by doric columns that more than hinted of better times the central groundfloor room was fronted by a marble bar which spanned the gap between the pillars kitchens to the left of the bar stood open to the inspection of patrons amazingly in this bombedout relic of a place wide arches in the wall to the right displayed the sweep of the original grand marble staircase winding to brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i the upper rooms and balcony better times indeed on the balcony whose tables were reserved for persons of quality julio sclafani himself leaned out as far as his belly would allow to observe the arrival of these latest most elevated of all his customers anthony and francesco francezci come down from the high madonie especially to eat at julios it was wonderful that they came here these men of power ignoring the socalled class restaurants to dine on julios simple but worthy fare and theyd been doing it for six weeks now ever since the first signs of improvement in the weather or perhaps it was that one of them or even both of them had noticed julios julietta for sclafanis youngest still unmarried daughter was a stunner after all and the brothers francezci were eminently eligible men but what a shame that she wasnt at her best it must be the pollution of palermos air the fumes of all the cars and mopeds the stagnation of all the derelict places the breathing of dead air and the winter damp that came drifting in off the tyrrhenian sea but spring was here and summer on its way julietta would bloom again just as the island was blooming except it was worrying the way shed come down with well with whatever it was just four or five weeks ago since when all of the colour had seemed to go out of her all the joy and vitality everything that had made her the light of julios life to be back there on her couch all exhausted with an old biddy of a sicknurse sitting beside her in attendance as it were as at someones deathbed what julietta perish the thought as fof the old crow julio supposed he should consider himself lucky to have obtained her services so reasonably all thanks to the francezcis for she was one of theirs but here they came even now smiling up at him at him as they mounted the marble staircase such elegant such eligible men julio hastened to greet them at the head of the stairs and usher them to their table on the balcony almost exactly one hour earlier tony and francesco francezci had departed le manse madonie in the mountain heights over cefalu enroute for julios and the supposed gourmet pleasures of the cafes cuisine the quality of julio sclafanis food was ostensibly the sole reason for the francezcis weekly visit to the crumbling by no means decadent but decidedly decayed city ostensibly yes but in fact the brothers didnt much care for the food at sclafanis nor for the eating of common fare anywhere else for that matter they could just as easily dine at le manse madonie and do far better than at julios without the bother of having to get there for at the manse the brothers had their own servants their own cooks their own people and so as mario their chauffeur had driven the brothers down the often precipitous dusty hairpin track from the manse to the potholed road that joins petralia in the south to the spa town of termini imerese on the coast where according to legend the buried cyclops pisses in the baths of men to warm them so francesco had turned his mind and memory to the real reason for their interest in sclafanis piddling cafe the fat mans daughter julietta francescos interest anyway it had been six weeks ago to the day the brothers had been in palermo to attend a meeting of the dons the heads of the most powerful families in the world with the possible exception of certain branches of european royalty and nobility and other so called leaders of men or business politicians and industrialists mainly in the united states of america and elsewhere except theres power and theres power that of the francezcis was landed and giltedged and ancient and evil it lay in the earth in the wealth theyd been heir to for ohsomany many years plus the additional wealth which the principal and their unique talents had accumulated and augmented and not least in those peculiar talents themselves for in fact the francezcis were advisers advisers to the mafia still the main force and powerbase in italy and sicily and through the mafia advisers to the cia the kgb and others of the same ilk and through them advisers to those governments which allegedly controlled them and because their advice was invariably good invariably valuable they were revered as dons of dons as every francezci before them but to actually speak of them in such a connection that would be quite unpardonable it was understandable their social standing as to that last they had the reputations of the gentlest of gentlemen their presence had been requested even fought over for every major social event on the island for the last fifteen years ever since they came into their inheritance and possession of le manse madonie and their bloodline there had been francezci brothers for as long as men could remember the family was noted for its male twins also for a line that went back into the dimmest mists of history and into some of the darkest but that last was for the brothers alone to know thus the immemorial and ongoing connection of the francezcis with certain of the islands and indeed the worlds less savoury elements was unsuspected or if it was it wasnt mentioned in polite circles yet in their role of freelance intelligence agents for the mob or mobs as advisers in the field of international crime various kinds of espionage and terrorism the francezcis were an unparalleled success story where or how they gained their intelligence in these diverse yet connected fields that too was for the brothers alone to know and for others to guess at but to the dons it seemed obvious that they had brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i corrupted the incorruptible on a worldwide scale francescos thoughts had strayed from their course as the limo glided or occasionally bumped for the junction with the a motorway into palermo he redirected his mind to that evening six short weeks ago after their meeting with the dons whom they had advised on such problems as what or what not to do about aldo moro and his kidnappers the red brigade in italy and president leone who had become an embarrassment the hour had been late driving back through palermo and turned aside by a diversion where road works were in progress tony had noticed julios cafe and suggested they pause a while for refreshments indoors in the room of the marble staircase the brothers had ordered julios greek island specialities theyd picked at spicy sausages stuffed vineleaves and various dips prepared in olive oil but no garlic all washed down with tiny measures of mavrodaphne and a chaser the brackish vecchia romagna sipped from huge brandybowl glasses by ninethirty the kitchens had closed the brothers dined alone julio had excused himself a toothache hed called a dentist who even at this late hour had agreed to see him his daughter julietta would see the brothers off the premises when they were done perhaps francesco had drunk a little too much mavrodaphne too large a measure of brandy or it could be that in the gloom and draughty emptiness of the place with the pickedat food gone cold on their plates and the knowledge of lowering skies just beyond the arches the woman had looked more radiant more luminous more pure whatever francesco had looked at her in a certain way and she had looked back and anthony francezci had gone down to the limo on his own while his brother at which point the silver grey hearse of a car had swerved to avoid a dead animal in the road a goat mario thought and again francesco had been shaken from his reflections where he lolled in a corner of the back seat perhaps it was as well they had been passing close to bagheria in a moment theyd be making a sharp right turn oh yes for tony would surely want to park a while at a place he was fond of the villa palagonia what drawn to your monsters yet again francescos comment had been petulant almost angry he was irritated that his mood and memories had been broken into our monsters tony had answered immediately and sharply for it was true enough both of the brothers knew the inspiration behind the lunatic array of stone beasts that adorned the walls of the villa the carved dwarves and gargoyles the creatures with human hands and feet and other things that defied description some two hundred years ago the owner of the villa prince ferdinando gravina had insisted upon visiting le manse madonie home to the ferenczinis as their name was then rich as croesus he had been interested to discover why the equally wealthy ferenczinis were satisfied to dwell in such an outoftheway austere almost inhospitable sort of place and ferdinandos mania for grotesques or his mania in general had later emerged as a direct result of that visit but in any case francesco had shrugged saying according to swinburne these sculptures have their origin in diodoruss tale of the freakish creatures that came out of the niles sunbaked mud and before his brother could answer perhaps its better if that legend prevails it was a long time ago after all too long ago for such as you and i to remember at which tony had scowled and answered ferdinando looked into the pit brother the pit at le manse madonie and we both know it and then sneeringly lets be discreet by all means but in the privacy of our own car in a place like this who is there to eavesdrop then as at a signal mario had driven on for palermo and now they were there at the cafe julio and the fat little sod seating them at a table on his precious balcony and detailing his odious cuisine from which list they ordered this and that a few items to pick at a carafe of red wine all a sham a show the brothers moved the food about their plates waiting for sclafani to mention julietta and eventually returning upstairs from some small duty in the kitchens gentlemen im eternally in your debt julio bowed and scraped plucked nervously at the towel over his arm as he sidled up to their table er i mean with regard to your kindness in providing a a companion for my daughter i cannot bring myself to call the old lady a nurse cant admit to any real sickness in my girl but the woman is a godsend nevertheless she fetches and carries sees to my daughters needs and i am left free to attend my business julietta francesco contrived to look concerned your daughter is she no better then wed wondered why she wasnt around he looked down over the balcony into the courtyard casting here and there with his dark eyes as if searching julio turned his own eyes to the night sky and flapped his hands in an attitude of despair or supplication oh my lovely girl weak as water and pale as a cloud julietta will get better i am sure but for now she reclines upon her bed with shadows under her eyes and complains about the sunlight creeping in her room so that she must keep the curtains drawn some strange lethargy a malaise a weird photophobia the brothers looked at each other perhaps quizzically and francesco finally nodded and to julio sclafani we have business tonight a man of ours returns from an important trip out of the country brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i meanwhile were out for a drive passing a little time its a very pleasant evening after all alas we may be called away at any moment which is why we didnt order more extensively from your menu but this thing with julietta we find ourselves concerned for you indeed tony nodded we francezcis are delicate that way ourselves with regard to strong sunlight i mean which is why were not often out and about when the sun is up and francesco went on thoughtfully who can say perhaps we find ourselves in a position to be of further service qulio could have fainted what the francezci brothers of service to him and his of further service you see said tony in three days a man will fly from rome a doctor a specialist you are right there is a certain malaise or anaemia abroad servants of ours in le manse madonie are laid low by it we ourselves feel a definite lethargy our blood seems weak but at least in the heights we have the benefit of clean air while here in the city he shrugged openmouthed julio looked from one brother to the other but what do you propose i mean i scarcely dare presume that our doctor friend should take a look at julietta and perhaps keep her under observation a while francesco cut him short but why not hes our own private doctor and comes with the very highest recommendation moreover hes been paid in advance in such an arrangement surely there are no losers so its settled he nodded his head as in final confirmation settled we shall send our car for julietta three evenings from now saturday yes and the old woman shall stay with her at all times of course but that is to look on the gloomy side for in the event that she should recover between now and then which naturally we hope she will i am stunnedjulio choked out the words no need to be said tony delicately dabbing at his mouth take our card if your julietta shows signs of recovery call us otherwise look for our car saturday night after that you may inquire after her at your convenience but remember were private men our telephone number is restricted and rest assured julietta will be attended to in every circumstance it was done hardly believing his stroke of good fortune the fat man went about the nights business in a daze the brothers apparently unmoved continued to pick at their food until julio was observed busying himself at the tables in the courtyard below then watch the stairs francesco said if he comes up issue a warning or distract him but as he stood up and moved back a pace from the balcony now who is being indiscreet tony smiled up at him with eyeteeth that were white and needlesharp in a toowide mouth francesco leaned towards his brother leaned at a peculiar angle and answered through clenched teeth in a voice that was suddenly as black and bubbling as tar what but cant you smell that bitch back there in another moment he straightened up coughed to clear his throat and continued in a more normal tone of voice anyway we need to be certain the fat fool will accept our offer so drink your wine and watch the stairs he turned away two paces took him across the balcony and through a curtained archway into a corridor he passed a gentlemens toilet on his left a ladies on the right and entered a door marked private into julios office skirting the desk he passed through a second door into juliettas sick room and there she lay with the old biddy katerin eighty years old if she was a day in attendance the crone was nodding startled she glanced up at francesco through rheumy eyes who what then recognizing him she smiled nodded and made to rise no stay he told her best that youre here in case that oily little fat man should look in katerin nodded again and sat still in the dimness of the room the grandams eyes were yellow as a cats watching her master he sat halfway up the wide couch where julietta lay and his sudden weight woke her or perhaps shed already been awake waiting her eyes opened big as saucers her jaw fell open knowledge and horror painted themselves with rapid strokes upon her lovely oval oddly pallid face but in no way odd to francesco and before she could cry out if she would did you think i would desert you ah no he told her and his hand crept under her blanket under her nightgown to her thigh so that she could feel his fingers trembling there no for having loved you once i shall love you all the days of your life but he did not say my life as his hand climbed higher on her thigh so juliettas mouth closed and her fluttering breathing steadied she began to breathe more deeply of his breath his essence was in it as it was in her and his eyes were uniformly jet like moist black marbles in his face and unblinking or like the eyes of a snake before he strikes except he had already struck on that night six weeks ago and the poison had taken he smiled with his handsome devils face and the horror went out of her as she lifted her arms to embrace him but that could not be soon he told her soon at le manse madonie cant you wait a day or two my julietta just a day or two i promise her sigh and her breathing suddenly quickening the long lashes over her dark eyes fluttering as francescos cool hand discovered the inside of her hot thigh then her nod and a gasp of weird ecstasy as her head flopped to one side in sudden shame or defeat or surrender and her thighs lolled open brian lumley he held her lips open with his thumb and smallest finger and let the middle three elongate into her his hand was quite still but the three central fingers stretched with a caterpillars expansion throbbing with the effort of metamorphosis like a trio of sentient penises with pouting lips opening in their tips and into her body they crept while his thumb and smallest finger closed on her bud to gentle it like a nipple and with the old crone watching and knowing everything laughing silently through a gaptoothed mouth whose eyeteeth at least were still sharp and white so francesco found the artery he sought and used his fingers to pierce and sip at the soft centre of juliettas sex where the marks if he left any would never be found and the blood if any continued to flow would have its own explanation then in a few seconds a minute as the girl went ah ah ah and turned her head this way and that until her eyes rolled up slowly francescos jaws cracked open in a grin or a grimace allowing a trickle of saliva to slop from a corner of his writhing lips in that same moment his own eyes turned to flame and then to blood juliettas blood but brother it was anthony not a call as such but a warning definitely a tingling of nerves a premonition julio was coming a moment to withdraw from julietta and another to lean forward and kiss her clammy brow then he was out of the room flowing from sclafanis office into the corridor and the door marked men closing softly behind him and his penis steaming as he plied it in the privacy of a cubicle once twice three times before it spurted into the bowl and even his sperm was red where francesco pulled the chain on it in the corridor sclafani was waiting for him ah forgive me i supposed you would be in there your brother asked me to tell you your man has returned from england and your driver mario a radio message he fluttered his hands as if that were explanation enough which in fact it was francesco was cool now he smiled his gratitude and made for the balcony with julio hard on his heels its been such a pleasure to have you the fat man was babbling i cant possibly bill you what but im already too deeply in your debt at the table mario stood by in his uniform and cap while tony spoke into a portable radio telephone francesco wheeled on julio and almost knocked him over my friend he said hurriedly this is a private conversation you understand as for the bill the pleasure was all ours he pressed a wad of notes into the proprietors hand more than enough to cover what they had not eaten as julio waddled off tony was standing up eta in fortyfive minutes he said even if we go right now still the necroscope the lost years vol i chopper will beat us to the manse he shrugged francesco nodded and said til speak to luigi en route in the limo francesco sat up front beside mario outside palermo the static cleared up and he was able to make himself understood on the cars communication system your patient sedated came back a tinny almost casual voice threw up a little doesnt seem to travel too well the sedative i suppose from the back of the limo tony said well purging cant hurt theyll be seeing to that anyway at le manse francesco glanced back at him i left instruction yes and into the radio any problems at the other end none smooth as silk everything should be that easy good francesco was pleased and this end control theyve cleared me on to le manse madonie no problem of course not the francezcis man in air traffic control at catania had picked up more than a years wages for this our people at the manse will see to your patient francesco finished well be along later oh and well done thanks and out the unseen pilot answered there were no frills not on the air at le manse madonie the brothers looked on while their people saw to the girl from the helicopter still sedated shed been stripped and bathed by the time they got there the rest of it would take most of the night they watched for an hour or so the enemas the operation of the pumps and mechanically forced voiding the purification as it were but after that they lost interest the manicuring of nails the cleansing and polishing of teeth application of fastacting fungicides to her various openings all of that would go on and on clinical but less than beneficial health wasnt the object of the exercise only cleanliness and all wasted tony francezci shook his head in disgust as they made for their apartments about midnight they wouldnt sleep but merely rest time for sleeping when it was over wasted his brother answered not at all well the girl herself maybe but not the effort he likes them clean after all and she cant lie to him cant hide anything outside her mind we could merely prise for clues inside it he can lay everything bare down to the electrons of her brain and patterns of her past the memories in the mush of her grey matter poetic francescos brother seemed appreciative but his voice almost immediately turned sour ah but will he divulge what he discovers or will he obscure and obfuscate as hes so wont to do he gets more difficult all the time necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley hell tell us something of it at least the other nodded its been a while and hes hungry hell be grateful and shell make a rare tidbit why i could even fancy her myself tony gave a snort what but you could fancy old katerin if thats all there was and as they parted company at the top of a flight of stairs and made for their own rooms oh and on that same note did you have julietta in julios backroom something like that his brother leered back at him if youre asking will we be sending for her yes we will why would you perhaps like her for yourself not really tony told him for youve been there before me there was no malice in it nor in francescos answer it never stopped you before he said evenly in the hour before dawn the francezcis met again in the secret heart of le manse madonie beneath extensive cellars and ancient foundations at a place deep in the bedrock a place known only as the pit they came together to attend personally to the final stage of the operation the lowering of the girl into an old driedout well the mouth of the well was maybe fourteen feet across wall to wall the walls were three feet high and of massive blocks of old hewn masonry a lid of electrified wiremesh in a circular frame was hinged to the walls on opposite sides covering the opening like a grille but the pit was silent for now sullen and sinister even to the francescis down there somewhere at a depth of some eighty feet it opened into a cyst that had once contained water now it housed their father a mechanical hoist stood to one side its gantry reaching out over the pit suspended by chains a metal table slowly rotated the girl lay naked on the table with her hands folded on her stomach in her entire life she had only once been cleaner less toxic in the womb in the days preceding her birth before the first human hands were lain on her now mhuman hands would be lain on her but first the interrogation not of the girl but the old ferenczy the monstrously mutated francezci in his pit only the brothers were present it wasnt work for lesser more easily influenced or corrupted minds but then how might one corrupt the francezcis the cavern containing the pit was a natural place made unnatural only by its grotesque inhabitant rocky ledges swept back into darkness but the pit itself was illuminated a bank of powerful spotlights shone down on it from the nitrestreaked dripstone walls where the shadows crept stone steps had been cut back into a shaft that climbed in a spiral to the manse the aerie high overhead at the foot of the steps an electrified pneumatic door a grille of twoinch steel bars guarded the exit the doors control panel was set well back within the brightly lit shaft like the cover over the old well this door to the exit shaft wasnt designed to keep anyone or thing out yet the place wasnt specifically a prison but more properly a refuge a sanctuary an asylum and just this once perhaps the francezcis were of a single mind where they stood at the rim of the well and francesco quietly commented its as if the madin madonie were deliberate tony at once cautioned him always remember brother he can hear you even when youre sleeping or lost in your lust with some slut he can be there and hes here even now and the other knew it was true down here their fathers presence was everywhere it was in the echoes of their voices and despite the glaring lights or because of them it was in the movement of the blackest shadows back there where there should be no movement it permeated the very atmosphere as if the place were haunted but the old ferenczy was no ghost nor would he ever be so long as he was their oracle francesco looked at his brother well are you ready tony licked his fleshy lips and nodded he wouldnt ever be ready not really but what must be must be he had always been the old ones favourite spoiled by a father who had had time for him as for francesco he had been too precocious his father had never had time for him knowing something of the future indeed of most things perhaps the pitdweller had foreseen the time when francesco would relish his incapacity the electricity was off the grille safe father tony leaned over the rim of the old well and gazed down through the mesh on a receding funnel of massive blocks of masonry weve brought you something a small tribute a gift a girl a girl a girl a girl the well repeated an echo carried on the miasma but a miasma here a wisp of mist anyway rising from the pit the heat of the spotlights vaporized it turning it to stench the thing below might not be especially active but it was there it was breathing and listening said francesco who was sensitive to such things oh he hears you all right father tony leaned out more yet weve brought a gift for you but we have our needs too there are things we need to know for a moment there was nothing and then the well seemed to sigh it was physical in that a gust of foulness rushed up from below but it was also mental the old ferenczys telepathy which in the brothers case had skipped a generation and despite that they were not mentalists still their fathers power was such that finally they heard him only ask my son after you have sent me my tribute but if the message was simple its delivery was dramatic it reverberated in their heads like a shout and was accompanied by a necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley tumult of tittering crazed background voices that were all their fathers he had concentrated part of his mind on his answer but the rest of it was engaged in its own activity the way a madman might often seem calm on the outside while in fact he seethes within and the many personalities of the thing his diverse identities were like a bickering uncontrollable heckling audience to the efforts of the part which now attempted to communicate with the world outside itself in fact with the things son tony reeled at the rim of the pit his brother caught his shoulder to steady him the mental babble subsided along with the echoes of their fathers true or sane voice and dangerous tony muttered he isnt in control or is he simply playing with us francesco scowled his splitpersonalities multiidentities it wouldnt be the first time hed used them to confuse us tony nodded grimaced and called down father plainly you are not yourself the girl will keep and well try again later he made himself believe it in his mind in case his father was listening but then as they reached for the metal platform hanging over the pit as if to swing the girl aside no came that enormous mental grunt from below no wait and a moment later less forcefully almost pleadingly now as they paused does she come of her own free will is she pure is she clean and the brothers grinned at each other nodding in unison for this time there had been no background static no babble of crazed secondary voices when the thing in the pit desired it he could control himself and shut them out tony waited a moment then said she has no will as for purity its hard to find father in todays world but clean shes as clean as we can make her yes except yessss she knows things which we would know shes yours but before you use her will you not first examine her for us for a long moment there was silence until but why dont you examine her my son before you give her to me the old things mental voice was sly now wickedly intelligent he knows francesco grunted coldly furious he knows that we cant ask her that even the best drugs wont open her up because shes been forbidden to speak her minds been tampered with locked from inside and only he can get in and he knows that too the old devil wants us to beg and oh ha ha ha laughed the thing as the miasma his breath thickened oh but i hear and know you my son my francesco the laughter ceased and the mental voice turned cold as ice and still you have no respect hah francesco scowled he thinks hes a don he was tony reminded him a don of dons one of the first so dont annoy him dont even think but let me handle this and directing his thoughts and voice into the pit father it was you who gave word of a certain threat we acted on your word for two centuries we have acted on it and at last we have a lead this girl has secret knowledge buried in her mind nothing we do will give us access but you and in a moment when they could almost hear the brain below working and the body seething can do it yessss but will you yessss send her down she must not be wasted tony cautioned her knowledge cant be lost it was risky bringing her here we paid for her we may never see another opportunity like this and always remember father what threatens us threatens you understand yessss send her down but you are hungry we know and occasionally impatient and if send her down now there seemed nothing else for it francesco operated the gear to open one flap of the grille and together they manoeuvred the platform and girl into position over the open half of the pit finally tony broke an ampoule under her nose and she groaned and shook her head a little but before she could wake up more fully they sent her on her way to hell her weight was measured on a dial on the control console she sank skty seventy seventyfive feet and her weight became zero get it up tony croaked as francesco reversed the gears the platform came up empty but down below suddenly the mental emanations the blasts of raw terrible emotion were like a gale blowing in their heads the brothers reeled recovered quickly closed and activated the grille while in their minds despite that they were scarcely gifted in the art and that for once they were glad of it flesh bone and bloood the openingsss of her body her face the entrancesss to heaven to hell oh i am a monster yesss for a man could never do thisss but i am not a man i am wamphyri wamphyyyrrriii and above it all a scream just one but a shriek to end all shrieks as the girl came awake and felt what her cry of shock outrage disbelief was a sound to grate on the nerve endings forever it came and went as her mouth ears nostrils and head entire were crammed full of the thing filled to brimming with him as was her body and not only the hammerblows of the old ones thought processes brian lumley but pictures to accompany them of a creeping flowing foaming something never a human being but with hands oh a great many and mouths and eyes all converging on soaking into and expanding within the girl then the bloating the stretching the rending and the mist over the pit gradually turning pink stinking where its molecules came in contact with the grille a while later the francezcis were surprised to find themselves close touching trembling and slowly disengaged minutes had ticked by the cavern was quiet again or unquiet and the pit was just a pit an old well francesco looked at his brother quizzically but tony shook his head i wont couldnt talk to him right now so let him rest later maybe but as they made to pass out through the steelbarred door into the exit shaft hell be up he will be up he will be up it was almost a cry of triumph but quickly turning to sick terror hhhe will be up yes in just a few years three or four at most and then then hell seek me out seek us out seek us all out who will tony tried to ask but dazed as he was from the mental blast his voice was a croak it made no difference for he already knew and his father had heard him anyway who came a fading awed even frightened whisper in their minds who else butradu who but radu lykan eh and then a ringing cry like a soul in torment or one lost forever in outer immensities raaaddduuu and once again a whisper raaaddduuuuuu that shivered into a shuddering silence part one the necroscope harry keogh a devious thing getting up in the mornings was the worst of it when he was obliged to leave his dreams behind for in his dreams he was usually himself while in his real life the necroscope harry keogh had become someone else entirely or not entirely for on the inside he was still him but on the outside it was confusing dizzying frightening maddening especially maddening and not only for harry but for his wife too indeed more so for brenda for she could not and did not want to understand it she only wanted things back as they had been as for her baby son harry jr well who could say about that one who knew what he was thinking planning working on but then again who but a fool or a lunatic would believe that an infant of eighteen or so tender months was capable of working on anything oh he worked on getting fed or changed or attended to the same as any baby by screaming for it and he worked on collecting his audience of admirers the same way too by burping and farting and smiling in that gormlessinnocent way that defenceless infants have with their fat little faces seeming to slide off to one side and their eyes getting crossed and the drool dripping down off their wobbly little chins completely disarming and utterly charming of course at a year and a half most of that was over now but as for defenceless harry jr was an angel but one who had come face to face with the devil and won him and his father both but that had been only one battle the greater bloodier wars were still to come right now neither one of them knew that however which was just as well were it otherwise they might not want to go on the future has good cause to guard its secrets but as his father was more than just any man so harry jr was more than just any baby it was when he was being well the other thing when his expression was other than a babys and his thoughts more necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley than the groping fuddled demands or inquiries of an inchoate mind in an untrained body that the espers of ebranch were especially interested in him it was when they felt sensed experienced the awesome alien power washing out from him as he experimented or did whatever it was he did that they knew for sure he wasnt merely a baby and when those babyblue eyes of his lit with a faraway expression seen previously only in his fathers eyes and they knew that he conversed with a teeming majority no one else but he and harry keogh could hear and talk to getting up mornings the necroscope would think of these things and like brenda remember when it had been very different when the world was a different place and hed been a different person it was easy to remember for in his dreams he was still that other person hell he was that person even when he was awake but only on the inside which is to say inside his head for outside in harrys body and face and entire external appearance and especially in the mirror he was someone else a man called alec kyle which took some getting used to that was probably why he clung so tightly to his dreams and was reluctant to let them go because they were a form of wishfulfilment a place and a time when the world was a different world and the necroscope a different person himself this morning was the same or should be for some especially the young waking up to a new day is a renewal like being born all over again the first day of the rest of their lives despite that harry seemed to have done an awful lot of living he was still very young twentyone years old but his body or alec kyles body was ten years older and knowing that this was what he must always wake up to harry really didnt want to it wasnt that he was suicidal about it the fact that he now inhabited an older and alien body scarcely made him long for death not the necroscope harry keogh a man whod had it from the horses mouth more than once what it actually felt like to be dead who knew what it really meant to be incorporeal it merely made him reluctant toward life made it safer to be asleep and dreaming well sometimes it depended on what you were dreaming about currently he was given to dream a recurrent theme of life where like the proverbial drowning man he clung to the straws of his past existence only to feel them grow waterlogged and slip one by one from his straining fingers each straw was a scene from the times he had known and the life he had lived the chronological story of his ohsostrange adventures so that like a drowning man facing his imminent inescapable death the dreamdrowning necroscope saw it all skipping before his eyes like a scratched comically accelerated badly edited monochrome film his childhood in harden on the northeast coast of england where he had attended primary and secondary schools with the roughneck colliery kids his retreat from the mundane world of the living into the minds and lives of the great majority his secret being discovered by sir keenan gormley then head of ebranch and his subsequent return to the real world his acceptance of his condition the fact of his unique talent and his willingness to use that talent by taking sides against the monstrous evils rooted in the ussr and romania and superimposed on these accelerated glimpses out of the past his lifelong relationship with brenda a simple colliery girl whose love had formed the strongest single link between harry and the orthodox world one of the few things that kept his feet planted firmly on solid ground when often as not his mind was under it and superimposed even over this a glowing picture or memory of his mother radiant as any loving mother as visualized by her child her soap and rosepetal scent the sweet warmth of her sigh a golden aura all around her as if the sun had risen behind her to diffuse her brilliant silhouette all too soon snuffed out by a maniac who in his turn had been snuffed by harry which was always the point where the necroscopes blue poignant dreams turned a dark vengeful red for after viktor shukshin thered been thibor ferenczy dragosani yulian bodescu theo dolgikh ivan gerenko the list was a long one and what of faethor ferenczy that father or grandfather of vampires faethor had been dead for a long time now true but so had thibor before him and even a dead and buried vampire is a threat harry still couldnt be one hundred percent certain that the old ferenczy hadnt left other remnants to fester in the earth like thibor waiting out their time until a grand return coloured by his fears and anxieties the necroscopes dream was quickly becoming confused his mind was harry keoghs but the brain that housed it had once belonged to alec kyle a precog for ebranch harrys truths his thoughts memories and emotions dwelled now in those same vaults of complex convolute cerebrum once kyles where still the odd crevice or corner remained not yet conforming to harrys contours kyles weird talent had been governed by the shape of that brain his precognitive glimpses had used to come to him during those vague confused periods of mental hiatus between dream and waking proper at that point in time where the conscious and subconscious minds separate allowing a dreamer to surface to reality nothing was left of alec kyle now but the shape of his brain had not yet changed entirely perhaps some small part of his talent lingered on for on the point of waking suddenly harrys dreams underwent a rapid transformation mutating into sheerest nightmare and because precognition is the dubious art of seeing the future and the future is not a dream but a series of as yet unrealized events it was as if brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i everything that the necroscope experienced was real as life and the difference between these two dreamstates was electrifying most people including harry know that they are only dreaming but on this occasion he didnt as before it was a kaleidoscope of scenes fastfleeting over which he had no control but where before hed considered himself accustomed to strangeness he stood in a place that wasnt of this world at the rim of a desiccated plain of boulders that sprawled in one direction to an auroralit horizon and in the other merged with foothills climbing steeply into mountains close by a huge luminous dome was set in a walled crater like the eye of some fallen cyclops in its buried skull giving off a cold white light the dome was like an alien pharos but for what weird travellers on high the disc of a tumbling moon was lit half with the gold of an unseen sun half with blue starshine its surface pattern was in a state of flux caused by the eccentricity of its orbit and rotation clinging to what he knew of the geography of his own world harrys instinct told him that the aurora signalled north odd because that meant that the unseen sun lay far beyond the mountains in the south but this was after all an alien world to which hed been sent been sent by by faethor here his reasoning faltered to see the future is dangerous enough but to try to remember what is yet to be yet for a moment harry had known that faethor ferenczy had sent him here that his being here had at least been advised or guided by that father of vampires that lord of lies and also fry mobius but for what reason a quest obviously but why obviously and if a quest then for what for whom he looked all about the mountains on the one hand and the seemingly endless boulder plains on the other and between them the enigmatic gate its cold white light flooding outwards to silhouette the scattered menhirlike boulders casting unevenly concentric rings of shadow out into the starside night the gate starside but these words concepts were meaningless to him werent they now what the in the northeast he spied distantly rearing stacks fantastic rock formations crowned with turrets towers tessellate stonework battlements or was the effect simply the work of an alien nature harry thought not for there were lights up there smoke curled from tall chimneys motes moved with purpose in the dark air around the upper levels at this distance they were motes anyway suddenly harry was aware that someone watched him spinning on his heel he fell into a crouch on the boulder plain only a short distance away there stood a figure slim male with a face of gold burning in the reflected glare from the gate he held up a hand gestured said something but harry heard nothing he was allowed to see but not to know the future guarded its secrets harry knew instinctively that there was no danger here not from this one at least and filled with strange emotions he moved towards the other yet while he would have approached him anyway his motions were involuntary the flowing maddeningly ungovernable mechanics of dream or rather of precognition but the goldenfaced one had commenced to make urgent gestures pointing into the sky to the east harry looked and now there was danger here those motes circling the great stacks but no longer motes dark blots rapidly taking on grotesque outlines descending out of the sky from the direction of the aeries and aeries within his dreamself harry recoiled from the word but his futureself continued to move towards the dweller the dweller finally he accepted that he was not given to know everything and concentrated on reaching the one who waited for him but looking back he saw that the things in the sky were fast approaching and that they were like nothing he had ever seen or nightmared before one was winged shaped something like a manta the other was incredible monstrous gigantic it squirted through the sky like a squid in water and now harry could see that the first creature had a rider shaithis of the wamphyri and knew that the second was one of his constructs a warrior harry was close to the dweller now shaithis aboard his flyer was swooping down out of the sky the wind from the flyers mighty manta wings blasted dust and grit up from the plain into harrys and the dwellers faces the creatures shadow fell on them as it shut out the stars the dweller held up a wing of his cloak harry looked at him at his golden mask the scarlet eyes behind it the mind behind the eyes and knew that mind yet he couldnt possibly know it and for all the strangeness still he was unable to stop himself as he stepped or flowed forward into the shadow of the dwellers cloak and felt it wrap about him and the kaleidoscopic picture changed harry had known what would happen next except it didnt instead of finding himself in the dwellers garden alec kyles wild talent had snatched him into yet another possible future or the same one but further down the timestream now he was in the last great aerie of the wamphyri karenstack and furtive as a thief he pursued the lady karen as she descended to her larder sinister and silent as smoke karen flowed in through a dark brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i doorway following her harry kept to the shadows while she activated a trog and brought it out of its cocoon he watched her lead the shambling comatose neanderthal to a stone table where it lay down stretched itself prone and bent back its ugly prehistoric head for her then the ladys jaws opened opened gaped blood slopped from her crimson mouth scythe teeth sprouted poising over a sluggishly pulsing jugular her nose wrinkled flattening back on itself and her eyes burned as red as lanterns in the twilight room karen harry heard himself attempting to cry in the moment before the kaleidoscope scene changed taking him forward again in time but only a little way this time the necroscope sat absolutely still waiting for what he didnt know couldnt say only that he felt tense as never before in the deepest darkest shadows of the aerie and eventually it came karens vampire by what route it had left her body harry neither knew nor wanted to know sufficient that it was here where he where he wanted it it was a long leech corrugated cobra headed blindand it had pointed udders a great many swaying its head this way and that it inched forward then sensed him and commenced a hasty retreat curling back on itself it wriggled like a blindworm for now it must get back to safety return itself to karens undead flesh but the necroscope wasnt about to let that happen using his flamethrower he burned it dying it issued eggs dozens of them which spun and skittered vibrating over the stone flags towards him sweating but cold inside harry burned the eggs too every one of them and as if from a million miles away as if from someone elses dream he heard the awful screaming which he somehow knew was karens then abruptly leaving him dizzy disoriented the scene changed yet again to a high balcony where he leaned out and looked down and knew why he was dizzy the terrible height and way down there crumpled on the scree the ladys white gown no longer entirely white but red too karen was inside it and terribly achingly none of it made sense to him or fleeting sense at best there one minute and gone the next another jump cold liquid burned his face got into his throat and stung him caused him to cough it was alcohol certainly it was volatile it smoked shimmering into vapour all around him and he saw that he was lying in it he struggled to his hands and knees tried not to breathe the fumes which were rising up into some sort of flue directly overhead a blackened flue fireblackened harry kneeled in a basin or depression cut from solid rock kneeled there in this pool of volatile liquid impressions came quickly he must be in the very bowels of the castle down in the bedrock itself a huge cave and against the opposite wall where roughhewn steps climbed to unseen higher levels there stood janos ferenczy wamphyri watching him the monster held a burning brand aloft its fire reflecting in his scarlet eyes their eyes met lockedanass lips drew back from his unbelievable teeth in a hideous grin he spoke but the necroscope couldnt hear him could only sense the threat janoss gaze transferred to the torch in his taloned hand then to the floor harry looked too at a shallow trough or channel cut in the rock which ran from janoss feet across the floor to the lip of the basin where harry kneeled and janos was slowly lowering his torch jesus harry must use the mobius continuum but couldnt his power had been taken away from him he was no longer master of mobius spacetime again harry knew this without knowing how he knew his deadspeak was still available to him but deadspeak since when had it been called that but no he mustnt attempt to remember that which had not yet happened best if he simply accept it that while the mobius continuum was no longer a viable proposition still he had his deadspeak his ability to talk to the dead wherefore why not use it why not ask them the teeming dead the great majority what all of this was about too late janoss torch touched down and fire came racing in a blueglaring blaze searing heat gouted up in a whooshing tongue of shimmering flame roaring into the chimney overhead liquid fire singed the hair from harrys head and face and set his clothes ablaze leaping erect he cavorted like a human torch until yet again perhaps mercifully this time he felt himself snatched a little way into the future to where he stood in antique ruins as dark as night yet clear as daylight to him for while he was scarcely aware of it the necroscope was a changeling now an alien thing was inside him he waited warily patiently in the ruins of castle ferenczy waited there with with a dead man with the resurrected thracian warrior bodrogk briefly momentarily flickeringly harry knew why they were here his precognition told him that much at least and in a little while two women came up from below one was sofia bodrogks wife of centuries who flew into her husbands arms both sofia and bodrogk were dead they had been called up from their ashes but they were not as dead as the other woman she was sandra and was or had been harrys woman and later janos ferenczys the difference now was all too obvious brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i forsandra came ghosting in the way of vampire thralls her yellow eyes alive in the night but harry knew in his way that she was less than sandra now or more once she had loved or lusted after him for himself now she would lust after all men for their blood she flew into his arms sobbed into his neck and holding her tightly as much to steady himself as to steady her he looked over her sallow shoulder to where bodrogk and sofia embraced if only their embrace could be the same but of course it couldnt for sandras beautiful nearnaked body was cold as clay where it pressed against him and harry knew there was no way he could ever warm it she sensed his intention and drew back a little but not far enough his thin sharp stake a splinter of old oak drove up under her breast and into her heart she took a final gasping breath a staggering step away from him and fell bodrogk seeing harrys anguish did the rest and harry jumped again this time it was different for the dreamharry wasnt in it or he was but stood apart from it watching it happen to his futureself which was probably just as well for surely this had to be the end of him yet despite that in this instance he was merely an observer still he was given to understand something of what was happening and wished that he wasnt for in starside close to the glaring hemisphere gate the necroscope harry keogh was burning a vampire finally he paid a vampires price for a fatal mistake to have let himself get too close to the wamphri he burned inside and out fire on the outside and a burning consuming hatred within for shaithis who even now took the lady karen by force right there in front of harrys cross she seemed exhausted where shaithis savaged and ravaged her she resisted not at all as he tore at her the dreamharry would go to their assistance except he was rooted to the spot he was an observer forbidden to interfere and as the flames licked higher around the necroscopes funeral pyre so shaithis taunted him but all in silence like some hideous form of mime while the fire ate at harrys lower trunk it was perhaps the cruellest thing that the dreamharry had ever seen or could ever have imagined perhaps too cruel for even as an observer he was beginning to feel his own future agony events speeded up became a blur a fury of fear fire arid frenzied flesh and light blinding light the gate was its source a ball of silently expanding but allconsuming light it ate shaithis karen the necroscope the entire scene and it sent the dreamharry elsewhen again harry and his futureself the one a dreamer and the other a physical if future reality were in the metaphysical mobius continuum hurtling down a pasttimestream rushing back through times that were long gone and forgotten among the myriad blue green and red lifethreads of sunsidestarside into their remote beginnings and again the dreamharry was the observer who couldnt help but observe that his future self was dead neither asleep nor undead but dead truly dead and gone forever or going going where no one would ever be able to find him into the far past of an alien parallel vampire world but being the necroscope the dreamharry knew that it wasnt like that the body of his future self was dead yes but the mind would go on except this time well who could say where it would go to or perhaps this was the very end of the road albeit right back at the beginning a paradox but wasnt everything horrified because he knew that this was or would be him the dreamharry watched his own futurecorpse where it tumbled head over heels into past time fireblackened and smouldering with its arms flung wide and its steaming head thrown back in the final agony of death it was the one grim anomaly in a darkness shot through with the thin neon bars or ribbons of blue green and red lifethreads for where they sped forwards in time the dead harry fell back then an astonishing thing for as that burned caricature of himself fell away from him in the space it left behind as it tumbled from view a glorious bombburst of golden splinters like sentient spears of sunlight breaking up and speeding out of this place into into a hundred different worlds and times harry knew it without knowing how he knew that while the necroscope was gone still he had gone on knew that he the dreamharry himself would go on but as for now still plunging headlong down the timestream a dreamer incorporeal he went only into the past but the futureharrys past which of course could only lead to his own present even by a dreams standards it was confusing the present the now his now or if not now then the immediate future for of course his dream was precognitive and this time harry was himself not merely part of or an observer of himself but actually himself and the action was happening to him the immediacy of the thing stood his hair on end caused a cold sweat to break out on his face and neck this was real and he was the victim so far in almost everything he had been allowed to see in each phase of it there had been a victim and harry suspected that the same general theme would apply here too or more than suspected it was just the feel of brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i everything enough in itself to bring on these symptoms of extreme anxiety very well a victim probably but of what he could only wait and see as to his location it was subterranean a great cave but not too far underground beams or curtains of light however dim filtered down from several diverse sources setting disturbed clouds of dust glowing like small silver galaxies in their faint searchlight rays harry was in motion he moved with purpose if a little uncertainly through the gloom of the cavern to a spot where the light was stronger looking up he saw a roughcontoured ceiling of unusual stratification as if the pressured bedrock had been tilted almost on end up there like rows of jagged teeth set in the closed jaws of the ceiling several harder impervious layers projected downwards where softer strata had fallen away higher still where even more loose stone had weathered out narrow uneven gaps reached up to daylight or as harry now saw to starlight these crevasses filled with mainly unwinking stars on a backdrop of diamondsprinkled sky were the lightsource the lack of scintillation could be caused by the necroscopes subterranean viewpoint or by a thin atmosphere or both he was loath to hazard a guess still sweating harry looked around on his own level and now that his eyes were more accustomed to the smoky gloom he could make out massively slanting columns walls and chimneys of rock that climbed from floor to ceiling and slabs of fallen rock tumbled into tiers and tangles in every direction the cave was a veritable labyrinth of upended mainly fractured strata a geological freak whose ceiling seemed held aloft only by those mighty columns formed of harder layers while around and through this giants causeway of natural angular supports glooming over the rubble of shattered rock like empty stony eyesockets a network of fissures leaning lintels and gaping crevices formed doorways to uninviting unknown routes through a forbidding and probably treacherous maze of doubtful extent in a nutshell it would be an easy place to get lost in except harry seemed to know where he was going certainly he did for if this was a precognitive glimpse then he had already been here but in some neardistant future time not so strange for time as the necroscope was well aware is relative but in any event he had no time to ponder it for he was moving on on through the jumble seeming to drift in his dreamstate over the debris of fallen ceiling stones which had been deliberately rearranged laid in a roughandready crazypaving style to form a pathway or ways through the great maze and because it seemed the safest way to go harry followed the main pathway and suddenly he was there at his destination his rendezvous a place where the tiers of fallen slabs and columns of rock formed a natural if jumbled stairway up the inwardscurving wall of the cavern to a level area some eighteen feet wide by twelve deep where stood a table an altar some kind of neolithic sarcophagus but harry knew that his last guess was right and that it hadnt been a guess knew that he had been here before and that indeed this solidseeming block of stone standing central in the levelled paved area under the alcove in the rough rock wall was a massive stone coffin now his sweat ran colder still it stood out in droplets on his brow and stuck his shirt to his back between his shoulderblades he paused to look around to hold his breath listen absorb something of the atmosphere of the place he had a feeling that he wasnt alone and was offered evidence to confirm his suspicion evidence at least that someone else had been here and recently as dreams are wont to do this one was unfolding itself sequentially adding details along the way now harry saw the torches or became aware of them in their brackets in the walls and especially at the base of the great stone coffin oil or resinsoaked faggots bedded in gaps in the flags of the floor and burning so close to the sarcophagus that their flames were blackening its base and there was this sweet smell in the air a scent remembered from zante or samos from the greek islands definitely it was in the smoke a smell of pine forests well at least the torches accounted for the smoky atmosphere as to who had set them burning that would soon be made clear harry was certain they would be back those worshippers those acolytes anyway back to witness the great return what a great return the necroscope grimaced and felt a strengthening of his resolve hah the reanimation of an alien abomination more like the resurgence of an ancient evil and that was why he was here to prevent it moving more naturally now but sweating still and anxious he commenced climbing the jumble of stone to the dais and sarcophagus and was arrested by a mournful sound echoing in the confines of the great cave mournful yes a sobbing ululation a howling at which he felt the short hairs at the back of his neck stiffening in spontaneous recognition time was short and harry forced himself to climb faster the steps leaned this way and that some of them almost as tall as himself so that he must actually and physically climb them and at each level adjust his stance and balance but forty feet up the log jam of fallen blocks and toppled columns finally he stood at the corner of the ominous mausoleum where the high dais backed up to the side of the cave the wall was formed of a series of black nearvertical stacks compressed together into the almost crystalline forms of hexagonal columns a horizontal fault had caused weak sections to topple creating zigzagging chimneys and deeper still cracks or windows passing right through the rock to the open air of the outside world the rims of these vents or fissures were lined in pallid starlight so that harry imagined the entire cavern complex as located at necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley the edge of a crumbling ravine except he more than merely imagined it he knew that he was in fact in scotland somewhere in the high grampians the cairngorms east ofkingussie the knowledge came and was gone again as quickly as that but the necroscopes urgency those sensations of nameless anxiety remained the same and as a second bout of howling sounded he gave a start ran his tongue over dry lips and approached the great stone coffin the heady smell of resin was much stronger here curling up in the smoke from the torches at the base of the sarcophagus it was then for the first time that harry noticed the decorations of twoinch diameter holes bored through the bottom edges of the four slabs that made up the coffins sides he saw them and at once recognized their function not merely as a crude decoration but as outlets for the contents of the sarcophagus there were six of them along the ninefootlong coffins front edge and three along each of its almost fivefootlong end panels warmed to a thick fluidity by the heat of the torches a glutinous yellow substance was oozing from the rows of holes dripping down the base of the sarcophagus gradually filling the cracks in the paving and forming gluey puddles on the floor of the dais and this substance was the true source of the evocative scent warm resin of course the sarcophagus was almost five feet high the necroscope took up one of the central torches from its niche at the front of the great box and leaned over to look inside what with the gloom the smoke the heady reek and all his eyes were watering badly it was hard to make out the contents of the coffin but the very terms hed applied sarcophagus and coffin had in themselves been sufficient of a clue or forewarning for what else would one expect to find in a tomb but a corpse or corpses except and as harry keogh was only too well aware there are corpses and corpses the scattering of torches in the walls cast their flickering light down the brand in harrys hand set the surface of the translucent semisolid resin in the coffin glowing like burnished bronze the vague outline of of something but something grotesque almost beyond belief suddenly became visible which was when what had started as a dream a precognitive glimpse turned into sheerest nightmare the figure trapped in the resin was at least seven feet long two and a half broad at the shoulders and narrow at the waist and hip still only halfdiscernible but obviously a huge man still there was that about it that smacked of the un the inhuman it lay on its back arms folded across its chest and despite its dimensions harry felt that it was somehow shrivelled reduced as if time had taken its toll on it as to the precise nature of the thing quite apart from the earlier phases of his dream harry was acquainted with the wamphyri indeed the necroscope knew more about vampires real vampires than any other man in the world he had seen dragosani at the end of their bloodfeud in the fullness of his wamphyri change and hed also been face to face with yulian bodescu in the very flux of metamorphosis he knew exactly what a fullyfledged vampire looked like that in fact it looked something like like this and yet this was like nothing hed ever seen before but one thing for certain it exuded evil as surely as its great sarcophagus exuded pungent resin and now it seemed the precognitive nature of the necroscopes dream was over and that purest nightmare was taking full sway at least he hoped so for if the rest of it was a glimpse into his future then he wanted none of it suddenly aware that shadows were creeping where no shadow had been harry stepped back from the sarcophagus fell into a crouch and looked all about there had been furtive movement he was sure there on the paved causeway where it passed under crazily tilting lintels and in the shadows along the walls and among the countless jumbles of fallen rock grey shadows flowing fleetfooted and a renewed burst of howling neardistant at first but then answered from close at hand very close at hand harrys left hand held up the flaring torch his right was on the rim of the sarcophagus and even as he looked again into the coffin at the barely discernible yet unmistakable outline there something came bubbling up out of the gluey mess to grab his wrist it wasnt a hand or barely clawed black trembling and shrivelled yet strong with some inner fever it was halfhand halfpaw all horror and it drew on harry with an irresistible strength until in a moment he found himself halfover the stone side of the coffin and into the resin but at the last his wits were returned to him and drawing back with every ounce of his strength finally he broke free of the thing that held him or rather it broke free of its arm how harry danced then with the alien hand still clasped around his wrist as he tried to disengage free himself from that unearthly grip but hed hauled so hard that hed dragged the owner of the shrivelled claw erect in its great coffin and god help him the triangular eyes in its resindripping halfmummified head were slowly opening and its dogs jaws were splitting apart in a monstrous grin jesus jesus harry yelped as the thing reached for him and jesus it replied its awful voice a surprised cough a snarl a bubblingup of centuriestrapped phlegm and mucus and tilting its head sardonically on one side ah no not jesus it told him if you would call me anything call me lykan lord lykan of the wamphyri or perhaps in your caseits great arms were folding him in while its eyes blazed like yellow lanterns branding his soul as it growled in your case i shall make an exception aye for it were best if you call me father harry did no such thing starting awake he called out for his ma all brian luraley mud and bones and weeds in her watery grave nearly four hundred miles away in scotland for cold and terrible as she might seem she was the warmest safest thing in harrys world but as has often been stated the future is a most devious difficult thing and not much given to displaying itself to common curiosity even the necroscope the least common of men could not be allowed to know or remember too much and as is frequently the way of it with dreams this one was already fading from the eye of memory in a moment all that remained of it was the fear of it whatever it had been that and the cold sweat and harrys tumbled bedclothes and his sweet mothers anxious query sighing in his metaphysical mind across all the miles between what is it son harry stopped panting took a deep breath and let it out slowly and told her nothing ma just a dream thats all a nightmare and well she said after a little while and isnt it to be expected he could picture her troubled frown after all youve known some strange times harry oh yes she was right there and there were also times when the necroscopes ma was the very master of understatement but strange times yes harry answered quietly wryly then in a moment seeing her son was all right she was lighter at heart when will you come to see me harry youve always a home here with me you know her words might easily have chilled another man to the bone but harry felt only her warmth soon i think he told her pretty soon but right now he sighed and shivered a little for the sweat of fear was beginning to dry on him oh you know there are problems he sensed her nod of understanding there always will be problems harry among the living and as you know well enough even among the dead but whenever ill be waiting here knowing that soon youll be close tome her incorporeal voice faded slowly away problems among the living and among the great majority and all too often their problems were harrys his nightmare had disappeared completely now forgotten sunk back into the depths of his subconscious mind but however briefly his mothers words had struck a chord there problems among the living and the dead and the undead ii but where is harry keogh er harry darcy clarke stuck his head round the door of the necroscopes ebranch suite a long narrow room really fitted out like a small hotel room for harrys convenience until he could find the time and opportunity to look round for a place for himself and his family in london if he could convince his wife to stay right now though the way it was going with brenda and all clarke considered it a hell of a big if in fact in years gone by when this entire topfloor complex had belonged to the hotel below harrys apartment had been one of the rooms in front it was simply an overnight bedroom some four or five paces square at the rear partitioned behind a sliding door there was a washbasin a shower and wc the floor space of the main room was occupied along one wall by a computer console with a swivelchair and space beneath for the operators feet it was of little or no use to the necroscope who had his own unique ways of solving problems in a corner a wardrobe stood open some items of harrys clothing were hanging there others lay folded on shelving to one side harry had been about to shave he wore a towel round his waist and foam on his face and was leaning over the washbasin with a plastic shaver in his hand and he looked just a little sick pale and sick and tired well darcy thought hes looked pale ever since ive known him ever since ive known him as harry anyway because of course that had only been for seventeen months but hed once known him a lot longer than that as someone else it was that previous person whom darcy was looking at now on the outside at least harry was only twentyone but his body was ten years older the necroscopes hair was russetbrown plentiful and naturally wavy but even in the last few months a lot of the lustre had disappeared and the odd strand of grey hair had appeared among the necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley brown in the temples his eyes too were honeybrown very wide very intelligent and strange beyond words very innocent even now for all theyd seen for all that hed experienced and learned they were innocent darcy knew it could be argued however that certain murderers have the same look but in harry the innocence was mainly genuine he hadnt asked to be what he was or to be called upon to do the things hed done but he had done them his teeth were strong not quite white a little uneven they were set in a mouth that was unusually sensitive but could also be cruel caustic he had a high brow a straight nose cheeks that seemed just a fraction sunken not surprising that last for the necroscope had lost weight alec kyle had been perhaps too wellfleshed once with his height it hadnt mattered much not to alec whose work in ebranch had been in large part sedentary but it mattered to harry keogh it had been bad enough carrying around those extra years let alone the extra weight he was trying to find time to get his new body in training bring it to its best possible condition hed be better off clarke thought if he got his mind sorted out first he suspected harrys mind must feel something like a nervous cat in a new house prowling around and trying to get used to the layout but it was already more than a year what is it darcy the necroscope asked his voice listless as his looks listless but not lost the man might be little more than a boy but still he carried a lot of mileage and his tone of voice the depth of his penetrating gaze his obvious intelligence carried a whole world of authority but his looks harry keoghs looks they were the stumbling block and not only for clarke but for every esper in the branch the fact that each time they spoke to harry or even thought of him it was on the tip of every tongue to call him alec just as clarke had barely avoided doing a moment ago and this despite that hed been deliberately rehearsing to himself harry harry harry all the way down the corridor clarke forced himself back to earth its late he said and well one or two of the gang just happened to mention you mightnt be you know feeling too good he came in closed the door behind him and sat on harrys tumbled bed the necroscope gave a shrug of his shoulders and offered a mirthless huh they just happened to mention it right i mean its not that these espers of yours have been into my mind or anything hell no but they just kind of suspected i might be a bit down this morning he frowned and gave a snort of derision christ give it a rest cant you darcy i mean surely you know ive been feeling them groping away in my head morning noon and night every day for well over a year now clarke flopped his hands uselessly but theyre well espers harry he said making it sound like an apology and they do manage to keep their talents pretty much to themselves i mean we have our code you know but we cant help worrying about you or thinking about you and about alec wondering what kind of a freak you are how you feel about it and what about that poor girl downstairs how she feels because we told her you were dead and now youre alive but no longer you and as for alec hes gone forever we know how it was youve told us how it was and ben trask has corroborated it but we wonder anyway the ben trask of clarkes silent reflections was another branch operative a human liedetector the necroscope looked at clarke and he looked back at a man hed known as the precog alec kyle or rather he looked at the shape of kyle with harrys mind in it and so back to that again a complete fuckup of a situation and clarke thinking but if it can fuck me up like this what must it be doing to him and his family clarke continued to look at harry where hed scraped the first tentative swath through the foam and where hed immediately stopped shaving and was now staring at his reflection in the mirror over the bowl clarke couldnt possibly know what the necroscope was thinking telepathy wasnt darcys talent but he could take a stab at it looking at himself and wondering who he was and where he was knowing that in fact the russians would have cut the real him up long ago to study his guts and brains and that theyd have done a far more thorough job of it and certainly a more clinical one than the necromancer boris dragosani had ever done on one of his victims trying to concentrate on what he was doing harry crooked his mouth and said you know sometimes when i cut myself im surprised it hurts its true im having to learn to be a lot more careful with myself its like when you borrow a book out of a library you dont much care how you handle it because it isnt yours except this time it isnt like that because now it is mine and i have to look after it and im not just talking about a book but a body my body now and not even a snowball in hells chance that ill ever get another so i have to take care of it despite that i dont much care for the damn thing he finished shaving a patchy job but he hadnt actually cut himself tossing the shaver into the basin he splashed his face patted it dry and stepped into the bedroom and letting the towel fall paradoxically wwselfconsciously from around his waist as he started to dress he asked so what do you think how do we look darcy darcy knew it wasnt a socalled royal we the necroscope was asking about the two of him well of course the recently elected head of branch could lie but he chose not to how do you look he shook his head in unfeigned concern not too good harry in fact you look like shit and finally harry had to grin he looked like shit this from darcy necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley clarke not that darcy looked like shit no but then again he didnt look like much of anything for darcy was possibly the worlds most nondescript man nature had made up for this physical anonymity however by equipping him with an almost unique talent he was a deflector the opposite of accidentprone only let him stray too close to danger and something some parapsychological guardian angel would intervene on his behalf he had no control over the thing indeed he was only ever aware of it if he stared deliberately in the face of danger or occasionally when danger came creeping up on him the talents of the others telepathy scrying precognition oneiromancy liedetecting were more pliable applicable obedient but not darcys it just did its own thing which was to look after him it had no other use but because it ensured darcys longevity it made him the perfect man for the job continuity was important in ebranch the anomaly was this that he himself didnt quite believe in it until he felt it working he still switched off the current before he would even change a light bulb but maybe that was just another example of the thing at work to look at darcy clarke then no one would ever suspect he could be the boss of anything let alone head of the most secret branch of the british secret services a job that darcy hoped against hope hed soon be able to hand over to harry of middleheight mousyhaired showing early signs of a slight stoop and a small paunch he was middling in just about every way he had sort of neutralhazel eyes in a face not much given to laughter and an intense mouth which you just might remember if you remembered nothing else but other than that there was a general facelessness about him which made darcy instantly forgettable even the way he dressed was conservative and indeed looking at him harry thought hes a very ordinary extraordinary man and however much the necroscope might dislike the situation it was a very difficult thing to dislike someone like darcy clarke so whats on the menu for today he asked him glancing at his watch it was and darcy was right it was late by now the rest of ebranch would be buzzing but before darcy could reply to harrys first question he followed it up with and what about brenda did you see her yet this morning we had breakfast together downstairs darcy answered shes well fine but he didnt seem too sure about it and more hurriedly eager to change the subject the baby is just beautiful i mean hes really coming along harry stared hard at him right now he wasnt interested in the baby she still doesnt want to see me right darcy flapped his hands harry its only been a year and a half the necroscope cut him off and he was right time had flown okay darcy nodded but give brenda give yourself a little more time i mean if you we arent used to this yet how can you expect her to be shes just a girl and she went through a hell of a lot the necroscope continued to stare hard at him for a long time then nodded shrugged gave a deep sigh darcy was right he knew life had to go on and harrys life for the moment was here at e branch he had to involve himself become part of it hed be okay as long as there was something to do well apart from these endless fucking debriefings it was as if darcy had read his thoughts we think there may be work for you harry he said beginning to breathe easier as he sensed the necroscopes spring winding down a little work that should suit you right down to the ground but harry only wondered and below it much in accord with harrys own deliberations it was the general consensus of opinion in the branch that if they could keep the necroscope busy it would be best for him and everyone else concerned they had a telepath trevor jordan who despite the mainly unspoken branch code occasionally came into contact with harrys jumbled anxious thoughts a locator ken layard whose talent drew him to the necroscope like a moth to a lantern so that his mind kept bumping into him and an empath ray betts who couldnt help but sense the necroscopes overwrought emotions but these were only the special cases every ebranch member was affected by harrys presence one way or another for to a man or woman and in their own ways all branch operatives were talented and all must feel for a fellow psychic they knew what the necroscope was they were aware of his awesome even frightening powers but they also knew what harry had done for them for the world and how he was paying for it if they could keep him with them keep him working it could be hed eventually get over the multiple traumas of past and present certainly he was the type who worked best under pressure making use of a case that only the necroscope could possibly handle darcy clarke was about to apply just such pressure in his office at the end of the corridor the recentlyappointed head of branch waved harry into a chair and told him this could be a nasty one harry nodded and said drily my kind of work right he waited for darcy to get on with it but before he could begin the intercom came cracklingly alive and blurted an urgent sir simultaneously an alert button on darcys console began flashing red keying allpoints connections with the duty officer he said what is it one for us i think the dos voice was tense necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley put it on screen darcy answered and a moment later his desk screen displayed a communication from the minister responsible harry seated opposite saw darcys jaw drop as his face almost visibly paled christ darcy hissed the necroscope stood up paced to darcys side of the desk glanced at the screen origination minres destination director intesp duty officer intesp all agents intesp ira alert a few minutes ago the metropolitan police received anonymous advance warning that a device will be planted in oxford st set to detonate at today any chance you can do something mr clarke sorry for short notice no reply required action will suffice your minister responsible has a sense of humour harrys tone was dry then the necroscope blinked staggered and grabbed the edge of the desk to steady himself darcy scarcely noticed made breathless by haste he was already getting back to the do is trevor jordan in hes on it came the immediate answer i caught him on his way to the office and diverted him im on it too darcy snapped but no one else get me a car then get in here and take over theres a car waiting out back as darcy left his chair and headed for the door the necroscope said how about me darcy skidded to a halt whirled around no way theres only one you harry and this is dangerous harry was himself again he grinned however coldly ive seen a lot worse places than oxford street darcy darcy shook his head speaking rapidly but precisely he said you can be hurt harry you can be killed but with me its not very likely my talent wont even let me get close to that bomb which means i can help the police find it where my legs wont take me thats ground zero as for trevor jordan he knows the risks but he also knows the mind of just about every ira bomber working in england if this blokes still out there on the street trev can probably find him but you he might have gone on but harry held up a hand youve made your point dont let me hold you up in the next moment darcy had wheeled and disappeared out into the corridor in his wake he left an oldfashioned wooden coatstand teetering where hed grabbed his overcoat it swayed first one way then the other it might even have toppled but coming from nowhere a sudden swirl of air straightened it up the door hadnt yet slammed shut behind darcys back his running footsteps were still echoing in the corridor his communications screen still carried the minister responsibles cry for help but already his office was quite empty against darcy clarkes orders against all logic and definitely against commonsense the necroscope had taken a mobius shortcut to oxford street for to harry it didnt feel like he was putting himself at risk at all and he could hardly be putting alec kyle at risk now could he for kyle was already dead wasnt he and his talent too but if so then what was it harry had seen experienced in the moment after reading the minister responsibles message on the viewscreen how to explain what had come and gone in the briefest possible time like a crack of lightning illuminating some secret part of his brain and causing him to stagger for hed seen a mobius door but horizontal a mobius door shimmering hovering lengthwise in midair superimposed on reality then as quickly as it had come the extraordinary vision had disappeared but in its splitsecond existence the necroscope had seen the door shaken had seen it writhing like a ring of smoke in a sudden draft and hed seen what it vomited like some monstrous volcano high into the suddenly darkening sky harry scarcely knew london at all despite that the necroscope was much far and extremely strangely travelled london hadnt been an extensive part of his itinerary he had visited oxford street however and so knew several coordinates enough that he wouldnt emerge in the middle of the road in heavy traffic anyway not that that ever happened in doubt he could always look out through his exit door before stepping through it but as for the street itself its junctions idiosyncrasies its personality he really didnt know one end from the other he emerged in the entrance of a shoe store perhaps midway along the street an extremely tall man in spectacles leaving the shop in a hurry bumped into him looked surprised and at once apologized but harry was already looking around getting the feel of things it was midweek but there were plenty of people about up and down the street he saw policemen already they were thick on the ground and somewhere out there would be trevor jordan probably in the company of a couple of plainclothes officers as for darcy clarke he wouldnt even have reached his car yet but once at the driving wheel necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley hed be here before you could say boo and hed very probably be mad at harry who couldnt even say why hed come here against good advice a sign said hyde park to the west oxford circus holborn and central to the east looking along the street towards hyde park harry saw that police activity was hotting up there was no panic as yet but things were happening barriers appearing as if from nowhere being dragged across the road traffic being diverted stopped from coming this way wherefore the suspect area must lie to the east towards the city centre sure enough in the direction of holborn traffic and pedestrians alike were being diverted off the main road down side streets and several of the police down there were using loudhailers a great many of the people on the street seemed used to it all they began to move a little faster but were still mainly unhurried most of them looked irritated by the disruption of their everyday routines but were nevertheless obedient to the law as police activity grew in proportion to the number of officers arriving on the scene on the other hand some paid little or no attention to it all but went about their business as if there were no interference whatsoever a string of six redrobed hari krishna types with shaved bowed heads beads galore and their arms folded up their wide sleeves went singlefile in an almost mechanical pitterpatter shuffle along the pavement with their heads down like that the way they seemed intent upon their own feet and moving with that rapid rhythmic apparently blind locomotion it astonished harry that they somehow managed to avoid collision with anyone or thing in their way their leader and the one bringing up the rear carried tiny golden bells that chimed in time to their precise almost clockwork motion except harry wasnt here as an observer of life but as a foil against death fine but how to go about it so he stood there undecided until a young policeman of about his own age approached and said best to get well away from the barriers sir well be clearing the whole street in a little while harry looked him in the eye and said look some friends of mine ebranch people trevor jordan and darcy clarke are helping you blokes out now its possible you never heard of these people but your seniors very definitely have since i fancy my friends are a lot closer to the action than i am right now thats where i need to be so id be obliged if you would well direct me wheres it all happening listening to harry the policeman had at first looked surprised then his eyes had taken on a blank expression now they went hard and his eyebrows came together in a frown ebranch sorry pal but youre right i never heard of it press dyou mean but in any case and since it isnt in my orders i have to ask you to move on the pavement was still alive with people harry pointed at them saying what just me i mean cant you get this lot moving first what about the hari krishna types now the young officer was really ruffled his lips tightened and he said look chummy we have to start somewhere and youre it so just leave out all the lip and move your backside out of here harry refused to display his annoyance he simply nodded conjured a mobius door and stepped through it he wasnt there any more the young officer started to say and if i can give you a word of advice and stopped short he wasnt speaking to anyone and people were starting to look at him he turned a couple of stifflegged complete circles looked for harry and failed to find him finally shuffled sideways into a shop doorway and out of sight the necroscope emerged from the mobius continuum at the junction of oxford street and regent street and knew that he must be pretty close to the venue policemen in uniform were everywhere working frantically to clear the street glancing at his watch harry saw the reason why it was if indeed a bomb had been planted it was due to explode in something less than nine minutes time caught in a crush of people being shepherded down regent street he stepped to one side and looked about then just as he was about to be caught up again he spotted trevor jordan on a traffic island in urgent conversation with two uniformed senior policemen sidestepping the cordon he ran towards jordan shouting trevor can i be of help jordan saw him and quickly spoke to the inspectors one of them waved off a policeman who was hot on harrys heels and as he skidded to a halt harry was apologetic i just thought it might be a good idea to be in on this he gulped jordan shrugged and said right now i dont see what you can do but since youre here he shrugged again jordan was the easygoing sort generally but it was obvious from his tone of voice that in the current situation he saw the necroscope as an encumbrance there werent any dead people to talk to here not just yet anyway a seasoned if occasionally variable telepath jordan was thirtytwo years old his looks fitted his character precisely he was usually transparent open as a favourite book it was as if he personally would like to be as readable to others as they were to him as if he were trying to make some sort of physical compensation for his metaphysical talent his face reflected this attitude oval fresh open and almost boyish he had lank mousy hair falling forward above grey eyes and a crooked mouth that straightened out whenever he was worried or annoyed mostly people liked him having the advantage of knowing it if someone didnt like him jordan would simply avoid that person but rangy and athletic it was a mistake to misread his necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley obvious sensitivity there was plenty of determination in him too harry asked him is this where it will happen he scanned all about trying to work out what was going on in his time the necroscope had been the author of a considerable amount of bombing of his own but he told himself that that had been different and even necessary or was it all in the eye of the beholder well maybe except this wasnt a nest of mindspy thugs and megalomaniacs in some nightmareriddled chateau in the ussr but a busy thoroughfare in the heart of london the people who could get involved hurt killed here were innocent of any crime other than being here and there were still far too many of them a flood of shoppers was even now issuing from stores both east and west adding to the crushes down regent portland and new bond streets and police activity had grown even more urgent there were doghandlers with sniffers straining at their leads loudhailers boomed to left and right issuing raucous instructions motorists were leaving their blockedin cars and hurrying on foot in what they hoped was the safest direction chaos harry said guessing that jordan hadnt answered his question because he didnt know the name of the game sir one of the police inspectors harshly answered the three ds to cause as much disruption death and destruction as inhumanly possible chaos yes but if youre with mr clarkes branch and if this is new to you whereve you been oh places harry looked at him in a certain way of his and was glad that alec kyle had been the sort who kept himself to himself and turning to jordan there are only six minutes left and people all over the place but trevor jordan wasnt listening he was halfcollapsed in the back of a squad car parked on the traffic island with a pained expression on his face and his hands to the sides of his head the policemen looked at each other went to question him harry stopped them saying hes at work leave him the police cordon in regent street had let a car through the crush it slewed across the road bumped up onto the traffic island alongside the squad car and darcy clarke got out he saw harry at once and began to protest jesus harry but the necroscope had gone down on one knee beside jordan who was muttering its it has to be sean scan harry gripped his shoulder stared hard into his squeezedup face sean milligan darcy hissed in harrys ear hes one of their best or worst armed jordan gasped and with more than just a bomb he he hasnt primed it yet too many police around sean knows hell be spotted knows theyll get him hes thinking of of creating a diversion yes thats it a diversion jordans eyes blazed open oh fuck now hes primed it primed darcy snapped at the two officers who at once turned away and began speaking into walkietalkies up on the roof of a building harry caught the glint of metal as a marksman took his position behind a parapet primed yes jordans eyes were squeezed tightly shut again and sweat rivered his face and hes set the timer for just one and a half minutes god darcy was trembling he looked like he might make a run for it which told him and harry keogh a lot trevor the necroscope spoke softly with only ninety seconds left sean has to be on the move which ways he heading but darcy clarke babbled oh i can tell you that and harry continued to speak to jordan has he still got the bomb yesjordans gasped answer as he squeezed his temples more yet but he knows he must get rid of it and now jesus fifteen pounds of semtex christ darcy suddenly yelped let me in the car ive got to get out of here he made to scramble for his car tripped and went sprawling across the back of the police vehicle and it happened a tall thin man with a pale badly pockmarked face wearing a loosely flapping overcoat and carrying a sausageshaped holdall came at a run down the middle of the road jordan looked up saw him yelped sean and the recognition was mutual not that milligan recognized trevor jordan but seeing the squad car the senior policemen and three civilians all grouped on the traffic island and all staring at him he did know that hed been made the righthand side of his coat went back and the snout of an ugly shortbarrelled machinepistol swung into view harry sensed hasty movement on a roof the realignment of a weapon milligan sensed it too and the gun in his hand swept up his thin lips drew back and both he and his machinepistol snarled their abuse bullets chewed the high parapet of the building causing the marksman up there to duck down out of sight and over the chatter of milligans gun harry heard jordan cry out getaway hes looking for the getaway car milligan was maybe forty feet away pointing his gun here there everywhere trying to choose a main target a secondary crowd of people had come bursting out of a large store onto the street but they werent a threat to the ira man on the other hand the sausageshaped holdall in his hand was definitely a threat to them and it was rapidly becoming one to sean milligan too as the necroscope glanced again at his watch and saw that there was brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i something less than a minute to go two things happened darcy clarke had finally got into his car started the motor and was making to drive away his car had just lurched off the traffic island onto the street when a second car low dark fast and mean came careening through a traffic barrier in a tangle of twisted metal the two vehicles collided darcys car was thrown back onto the traffic island and the rogue car glanced off smashed through a pair of bollards mounted the kerb and nosedived through a store window scan milligan wouldnt be making his getaway after all he knew it and it was time to apply the crazed logic of the total terrorist the sniper on the roof couldnt get off a shot at sean because of the people on the street sean had to get rid of his holdall in the next twenty seconds and then make one hell of a run for it but first he had to get these people out of his fucking way and he couldnt shoot them all he aimed his gun at the parapet hiding the sniper pulled the trigger and stitched the wall of the building with a tracery of bullets then as the milling people scrambled for cover sean chose his target not so difficult for there was only one target after all the city centre itself and what could only be a bunch of topranking officials and police officers by now he should have been shot dead and he knew that too which meant there were no armed policemen on the ground in the immediate vicinity so maybe he stood a slight chance after all there was still time panting sweating cursing he ran towards the group on the traffic island and pivoting like a discusthrower whirled the holdall which was when he saw harry keogh harry had come forward onto the road putting himself between his friends and sean milligan still pivoting preparing to release his deadly missile sean let rip with a burst of wild fire from his gun harry had guessed how the other would react hed already conjured a mobius door between himself and milligan stray bullets ripped past him but scans arc of fire was restricted by the door which no one else but the necroscope could see the main stream of bullets crossed the threshold and passed right out of this universe while up on the roof the sniper finally had milligan in his sights and fired one hurried shot hit in the hip the ira man tripped and went flying him and his holdall both flying right in through harrys door and the necroscope knew what he must do if he simply collapsed the door thered be questions because people just dont vanish into thin air like that but harry had a picture in his mind that he couldnt shift which told him how it must be and with only three seconds to go he tilted the door on its side his mind wrestled with the alien metaphysical math of the thing and won and as if the invisible doors top edge were hinged it swung upwards through ninety degrees into the horizontal and the necroscope hurled himself backwards away from it as it blew fifteen pounds of semtex in the mobius continuum a place where even thoughts have weight and a spoken word can be deafening and only the frail however savage shell of a human body to take the blast with one exception it was exactly as it had been during that splitsecond of precognition in darcys clarkes office the exception was sound for even though the continuum acted as a baffle still there came the subdued roar of the explosion as the immaterial frame of the door buckled and warped and finally blinked out of existence but not before the continuum had rid itself of a hideous contamination and a jet of wet red stinking human debris had erupted like a volcano flinging the guts and brains and shit and shattered bones of a man up and outwards against the high walls and windows of the street and then the slimy spattering rain that smelled of cordite and copper and many a crime corrected it was over but as yet the street was still and strangely silent streetcleaning vehicles had been orderedup and were on their way somewhere in the neardistance police and ambulance sirens wailed their unmistakable dirges a handful of unfortunate uniformed officers were picking up whatever pieces were large enough to be gathered off the street a man staggering and bloody was being led away from a shattered store window where the rear of his car stuck up at an odd angle you one of the police inspectors said to harry with a hand on his shoulder are a hell of a lucky man you were the closest to it when that bomb went off but suddenly his voice was very quiet what did you see i mean exactly what was it that happened there carefully he dabbed specks of blood and other matter from his forehead darcy clarke was fully recovered breaking into the conversation with what he hoped would be a useful lie he said i saw everything when sean was shot he fell on top of his holdall then there came the explosion his body muffled the sound but took the full force of the blast he just flew apart harry nodded something like that he said actually i was looking away from it as luck would have it most of them had been looking away from it but behind the parapet wall of a tall building whitefaced and wondering a police marksman examined his weapon and thought what the hell for it was one thing to shoot at a man but quite another to hit him and see him fall and then watch him disappear right out of this world not fifty feet away from the group on the traffic island harrys brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i krishna types huddled in a shop doorway for once immobilized they stared at the scene of what could have been an enormous disaster harry saw them looking their sandals might have been stilled for once but their slanted eyes were still full of the action that had been and that theyd seen one of them their leader was lowering a camera harry couldnt help wondering what hed been photographing and why amazingly darcys car looked like it might still drive however dangerously the senior lawmen seemed uncertain about it but before they could advise darcy against it hed bundled the necroscope and trevor jordan inside and driven off on the way to ebranch hq he said it seems we should never underestimate you harry i dont know what you did or how you did it but i do know it was you and jordan said my telepathy seems like a toy by comparison we all played our parts harry shrugged weve worked together before and its starting to look like we make a good team but before they could misinterpret that and perhaps his future intentions he added well this time it worked out at least darcy made a derisory noise in his nose but sometimes i feel like such a such a bloody coward thats all i shouldnt if i were you jordan told him oh it was harry who saved the day right enough but was it all him how do you know he wasnt prompted by that guardian angel of yours darcy taking care of you as always which gave them all something to think about on their way home back in darcys office after he and harry had cleaned up and things were quieter the head of e branch took up the conversation with harry where it had been interrupted by the minister responsibles call for help harry we know that we cant overload you by that i mean we know you could give us the solution to every unsolved murder theres ever been certainly to the ones where the victims knew their murderer except where they know their murderers you mean harry cut in correcting him and darcy knew he was right for harry was the necroscope and talked to dead men to him when a man died he didnt just stop his body stopped yes but his mind went on and harrys talent gave him access to such incorporeal minds any ordinary policeman must find clues discover evidence to bring a killer to justice but harry could have it straight from the horses mouth as it were to him the dead werent well departed not all the way but moved aside as if they were in another room where he could speak to them across the threshold of his amazing talent he could simply ask a victim who had done it or perhaps not so simply no definitely not simply this thing he had was almost unique it would still be unique if harry jr hadnt come along which was the problem in a nutshell how do you use a unique talent to best effect for example you surely wouldnt employ albert einstein as an accountant and what of the necroscope harry keogh in a world where brutal murders and terrorist atrocities were now commonplace crimes harry might easily find them his lifes work was that why he had been born into this world and time his only reason for being was that all darcy thought not what im saying he continued is that you we the branch cant be expected to do the work of the police well not all of their work we do some a lot of bigtime crime or the occasional case thats so abhorrent someone has to be made to pay for it or sometimes an urgent job like todays thing in oxford street but in the main were spies mindspies it isnt so much individuals we protect as the country our way of life western civilization if you like from forces that oppose it but i know youve heard all of this before and from someone far more eloquent harry nodded knowing that darcy meant sir keenan gormley first head of ebranch who had recruited him into the service by coincidence that had been just such a case abhorrent yes to say the least for boris dragosani had butchered him but without sir keenan without having spoken to his remains harry might never have gone on to his discovery of the mobius continuum and to his rediscovery of life in the braindead body of alec kyle except he must stop thinking of it in that way because kyle was no more while he harry keogh was so currently youre worried i might think that this job of yours whatever it is is beneath me too mundane he said you think i might reckon its just a red herring to divert my mind from other more personal problems and thats probably exactly what it is but you and i are on the same side in more ways than you think darcy the fact is i need this job whatever it turns out to be thats why i got myself involved down in oxford street today yes i know against your best advice because it was a diversion well and maybe for a couple of other reasons too okay so this other job youre talking about is no big deal at least it will keep me busy thats my reasoning anyway and its yours too i fancy so why dont we just get on with it darcy nodded seemed relieved okay but it isnt just a coincidence that i mentioned the police this time theyve actually asked us for our help oh we get requests from them fine like today when they know we have someone who can help im talking about jordan whom theyve used frequently enough in the past but even to the top brass in brian lumley the police hes just someone with a weird knack a lucky guesser thats how they view us as a pack of fortunetellers literally psychics in the popular or worst possible meaning of the word as if they see us sitting around a table holding seances or something which isnt too far from the truth i suppose anyway were always their last resort but not this time harry nodded because this time is it something that involves the police directly darcy looked him straight in the eye right its because theyre getting murdered harry by a madman and i mean literally a genuine dyedinthewool lunatic a serial killer with a grudge against policemen the necroscope thought about it and finally said there must be a lot of people holding grudges against the police just about every criminal in the book darcy answered thats what makes it so hard to catch the bastard the files are crammed with people this could be suspects everyone who ever committed a violent crime and thirteen thousand reported in the last twelve months so you see this could be the break weve been looking for with the police we already have a good record of cooperation with special branch and the other secret services but we were never on a surefooting with the commonorgarden bobby on the beat if we can show them that weve really got something here not just an old lady called madame zaza with a crystal ball in a gypsy caravan i mean there could be all sorts of weird stuff the police bump into and we never get to hear about it this could be a breakthrough weird stuff i thought you said this was mundane no you did if you want to call grotesque bloody murder mundane then yes it is except it just could be something else if i sound hesitant its because were not quite ready to believe that this is what its made out to be harry frowned then youd better tell me what its made out to be why are you holding back darcy answered frown for frown finally glanced away oh i dont know he answered at last but his voice was much quieter now darker even a little shaky but maybe just maybe you understand this really is your sort of thing after all iii dead reckoning it always happens at the full moon darcy said what does and now harry was quiet too the murders said darcy they happen at the full moon and after each murder a bout of howling and the bodies of the victims are found torn torn darcy nodded as by an animal a big dog or maybe a a wolf the necroscope finished it for him yet could never have said what had prompted him to cut in just that darcys mention of howling and a big dog had seemed to set something in motion it could be something hed dreamed but if so it was gone now and only its echo left to trouble him taking a deep breath he tuttutted perhaps significantly he didnt grin what are we talking about here darcy a werewolf someone who thinks hes a werewolf darcy shrugged or wants us to think it he relaxed a little feeling pleasantly surprised that the necroscope had got straight to the heart of the matter harry keogh had always been precocious of course but there was a lot more than that to him there was his history too his knowledge of the darker side of life and we dont believe in werewolves right was there a touch of sarcasm in the necroscopes voice were ebranch darcy went on the defensive anyway we cant afford to simply disregard or disbelieve anything not after what weve seen and what we know but in this case its more that wed like that youd like some proof that youve simply got to know one way or the other because if this is the unthinkable you cant let it go on again darcys shrug a little nervous but in no way careless two years ago we wouldnt have turned a hair but since then he let it brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i tail off and of course harry knew why for since then thered been the necroscope and everything that went with him namely vampires upon a time people hadnt believed in them either but a werewolf is something else harry was thoughtful now his gaze sharper less soulful and staring at darcy you said you think these murders are the work of someone who thinks hes a werewolf but as you also pointed out this is ebranch so what do you think now darcys face was grim even gauntlooking his eyes suddenly vacant seemed to scan the past it feels like only yesterday he answered i can hardly believe it was what eighteen months ago again harry knew what darcy was talking about the bodescu affair i was in on most of it down there in devon darcy went on i saw saw what became of poor peter keen hell i was the one who found him or what was left of him but you know we never did make up our minds just what did that to him yulian bodescu well maybe or was it that godawful dog of his that thing that was more than just a dog i dont mind admitting i still have nightmares about it harry and i suppose i always will we thought we had harkley house contained huh how wrong can you be yulian escaped and his bloody dog very nearly got out too but that was only at the end the finale and what ive been asking myself ever since is i know the necroscope cut him off again you know how hard it is to kill such things youre wondering if something something like that dog maybe might have escaped before you moved in for the kill before you razed harkley to the ground the other nodded then changed his mind and said well not really we were fairly well satisfied that we nailed down everything that could be nailed down but the dragosani thing then the bodescu affair and all the whole chain of events seemed designed to make us aware that we espers arent the only different things in creation were one side of the coin yes but for white theres black and for good there has to be evil we knew that of course but we werent aware of the different bands of evil i mean we didnt know just how dark they could get so now that you know what do you think about this socalled werewolf i mean personally its like i said i think i hope that hes a man but only a man a lunatic affected by the moon at its full trying to murder as many policemen as he can before they get him but why policemen why should a werewolf discriminate in that way when his blood and the moon are up surely a victim is a victim that is if our understanding of the legend of the beast is correct but thats why i think its a man darcy nodded its one of my reasons at least i mean quite apart from logic and commonsense telling me its a man this is someone who reasons and discriminates someone who knows the police will hunt him down so if he must kill who better to take out than the ones who are looking for him threatening him harry found himself interested and no longer just because it was something to keep him occupied for of all men the necroscope had experience of the strange things of the world and knew that some of them shouldnt be allowed to continue finally okay im convinced he said convinced that something needs sorting out anyway so how about the details we dont have any darcy shook his head just a set of utterly senseless murders on the one hand a couple of police officers already down in the ground and a third in the morgue waiting to go and on the other hand their friends colleagues and families mourning them griefstricken and deadcentre a yawning great gap called motive and evidence i mean its an old cliche i know harry but this time its also a fact we just dont have a clue but we do have somewhere to start said the necroscope grimly and in fact he had three somewheres sometimes i can take it jim banks told harry tend to sleep a lot like im emotionally exhausted you know but its when im awake that its rough they try to comfort me i have that at least but even so its hard oh i know i had a long way to go and a tough road ahead my life wasnt easy and it wasnt about to get any easier but it was a life banks had been one hard copper the necroscope could sense the sob behind his unbodied voice but banks never once let it break through to the surface harry supposed hed done most of his crying and cursing earlier on when finally the dead and his situation had got through to him the they he had mentioned were the teeming dead of course the great majority of mankind who were there before him laid to rest in the cold cold earth or gone up in smoke into the sky banks was of the former variety buried in a northlondon cemetery under a marker that gave his name dates and a motto and a sad farewell from his family the motto was in latin and said exemplo ducemus harry wondered about that i was an mp a military policeman for twelve years banks explained sib special investigation branch thats the corps motto exemplo ducemus by example we lead now in this place im just another follower following all the poor bastards who beat me to it maybe i should have stuck to a simple requiescat in pace eh except as harry knew well enough the dead dont rest all that easy but find ways to occupy their incorporeal minds jim bankss way would be to keep on doing what hed done in life a cop currently he might easily be investigating his own murder if only in his incorporeal mind he would be investigating it certainly or at least trying to think it through but just like his colleagues in the world of the living he didnt brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i have much to go on only the fact that hed been very close to something too close by far but youll tell me as much as you know not much to tell harry a month ago i was the detective in charge of investigating a ring of car thieves i got as far as a pub in the east end one night and that was where my lead petered out but after that until he got me whoever he isi dont know it was weird had this feeling id been made that someone had cottoned on to me yet i had no reason to feel like that i hadnt even known i was that close to anything scanning the ranks of old headstones some leaning harry looked around his gaze followed the tracks of wandering white gravel pathways between dreary rows of markers to a high stone boundary wall beyond the wall a distant hill stood silhouetted against the smoky evening sky where lights were just beginning to come on in a clump of darklyhuddled houses the cemetery was located in a quiet backwater well in keeping distant traffic sounds hung faint as ghosts on the greasy air it was a late february night damp and miserable as only london ever gets to be on the other hand harry had to admit that it was peaceful here well to anyone else but there was pain in the earth the necroscope knew and in some of its inhabitants banks was one of them and already harry had made up his mind that jim banks must be avenged for only the teeming dead and the one man privileged to talk to them knew how truly precious was life and how terrible the act of stealing it away harrys thoughts except when he shielded them were just as audible to the dead as his spoken words banks had overheard him and was quick to point out this mad bastard didnt simply steal it away harry if you mean he was stealthy well yes there was that in it but there was a lot more than that something strong and fast and furious something that slid into my chest like the tines of a pitchfork to puncture my heart and stop it and me dead do you want to show it to me the necroscope knew that it could be easier that way if you dont want to talk about it you can just let it happen that way i get more of the flavour of it flavour banks incorporeal voice was suddenly sour it wasnt icecream harry bad choice of words harry said by way of an apology and he cursed himself roundly but it was okay banks would do anything he could to help bring his killer to justice you want to feel something of it right you want to get the mood of it just the night in question the start of it harry told him he had forgotten for the moment that he was talking to an expoliceman but banks was quick to straighten him out youd better have what led to it too he said and harry gave a nod which he knew the dead man long gone into corruption six feet deep in his grave would sense because i have this feeling it all sprang from that night in the pub where my lead gave out on me my lead ended there yes but i think thats where he must have picked me up looking back on it i reckon my mistake was a simple one the thing is i wasnt looking for violence you know i was hunting carthieves not some crazy vicious murdering bastard so maybe i was a little loose with my enquiries you gave yourself away the necroscope sensed a sigh from the immaterial mind of the man in the grave yes probably no better than that i know i gave myself away how i mean im not a policeman jim if i know what it was you did to attract attention to yourself maybe i can duplicate it and swing a little action my way the other was at once alarmed what youd use yourself as bait no way harry jesus i had the training i knew what to expect but i never expected this sod all right so youre the necroscope but youve just admitted youre no james bond and youre certainly not muhammad ah no but i do have a lot of friends you know what i mean im never alone jim and im not above accepting a few tips from those who went before believe me i can look after myself really well so could i or so i thought banks had settled down again but he was bitter and angry with himself not with harry harry was only the trigger a reminder of what had been lost the fact that there was still a decent world up there with some decent people in it at least up there beyond the final darkness yes and so okay this is how it started a nightclub owners porsche had been stolen banks hadnt felt too bad about the theft because hed known that the owner one geordie king had a lot of previous himself hed been a right old jack thelad in his time a gangland hoodlum from the good old days that was a long time ago however now he was a businessman and going straight but still having contacts in the underworld geordie king had done a bit of investigating of his own what hed managed to turn up wasnt much but it was better than nothing an informant who owed geordie a favour had told him he should watch out for a man called skippy who could be identified from the spider or something tattooed on the back of his right hand a spider with five legs and a sting whats more this skippy was from up north geordies old patch in newcastle where the used car business was all the rage his thick northern accent would give him away at once especially to a fellow geordie so king had put it about that he was interested in having a chat with a certain skippy bloke from up north various contacts in the pubs and clubs had kept an eye out for the spider tattoo soon the reports had brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i started to come in in the form of ominous warnings skippy was only one member of the gang and they werent the sort to mess with in other words collect on your insurance geordie and let it go at that at the same time however king had heard on the grapevine that skippy was known to frequent a boozer not far from his own east end club well despite kings chequered history he was well past his sellby date so hed taken good advice and from there on kept his nose out but it hadnt stopped him passing on the information to the old bill namely jim banks it was a matter of principle so to speak honour among thieves and all that which was how banks had happened to drop in on the pub in question that night just a month ago but you hadnt told anyone about your lead harry found it a bit odd banks incorporeal shrug rivalry it was my case maybe i was out of line out to prove something out of touch but this is england not the usa and there was a time when policemen didnt get killed too often in the line of duty you know and as far as i was concerned i was still investigating a gang of carthieves maybe i should have taken a leaf out of geordie kings book and stepped a bit more cautious you think theres more to it then more than just auto theft no i think theyre carthieves plain and simple mainly young and crazy and probably into drugs too and fairly obviously at least one of them doesnt give a kissmyarse about human life especially the lives of policemen tell me about the night in question said harry thought you wanted to see it can we save that until later like the end and after a pause my murder if its not too oh shit he sensed bankss grin however grim hey dont sweat on it harry lets face it i dont choose my words any too carefully either then quickly sobering he continued it was a civvies job which goes without saying i mean i havent worn a uniform in a long time nothing fancy though because this pub had a rep as a bit of a roughhouse the night was miserable rain sleet and all sorts of shit hammering down out of the sky it was a friday and the bar was packed with all kinds of subhuman specimens i had a rum to warm up and bought one for the barman then asked him if skippy was in good question bad timing a bloke just three stools away straightened up like someone had stabbed him in the back id already checked him out in the bar mirror about twentysix or so pale and pimply white and ugly longjawed looselipped and shiftyeyed and a crewcut like the bristles on a shaving brush hardly inconspicuous put it this way you wouldnt want your sister dating this one but his hand stayed wrapped round a beer on the bar and thats what settled it and it dawned on me skippy was probably a foreshortened version of a nickname that must have sounded a bit overthetop a bit too hollywood for this blokes newcastle chums so theyd cut the scorpion down to skippy thats what was on the back of his hand not a spider but a scorpion five legs what artistic licence stretched their hairy joints down his four fingers and thumb the beady eyes of the beast were located on his indexand thirdfinger knuckles to make them stand out when he clenched his fist its sting was at the end of a segmented body stretching four inches along his wrist and some other stuff skippy was in paint and oilstained overalls his hands were dirty and there was fresh paint under his fingernails but from the moment i mentioned his name hed been looking at me glaring at me in the mirror suddenly the hand disappeared and skippy with it he was out of there well like i said the bar was crowded i couldnt really take off after him like kojak one it would give me away completely two the bloke was young and fast probably a sight faster than me and he would know where he was going three i was sure hed have some previous i could find out all about him from police records in newcastle or new scotland yard so i had another drink hung about for fifteen minutes or so finally went back out into that lousy night and i think that was my second mistake i should have got straight out of there see these new gangs are more audacious than the old crowd in geordie kings day ifaperp thought the filth had lockedon hed head for the hills and keep right on going but nowadays id made him so he would make me as banks paused harry turned up his collar against a sudden squall of wind and drizzle it had occurred to him that if anyone should see him sitting here on this slab and talking to himself theyd think he was out of his mind and probably call the police am the police banks reminded him with an entirely immaterial totally humourless grin that harry sensed rather than saw and you probably are out of your mind why didnt you come to see me in daylight because i wanted to get on with this the necroscope answered see ive got problems of my own and this should help me to forget about them for a while anyway so talking to dead people is therapeutic is it but in the next moment in a far more conciliatory tone what sort of problems are we talking about harry bad ones not desperate harry told him not as bad as being dead anyway even though that last thought was full of his usual compassion still it necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley might sound flippant and so harry kept it to himself and go on with what you were telling me he said when i left the pub i had a tail banks went on wasnt sure about it then but am now i mean ive had lots of time to think things out you know and that was when it all started to go weird on me it was like i dont know in a way it was pretty much like this like talking to you it felt like how can i explain it like i wasnt alone inside inside inside my head you were talking to someone in your mind no not talking listening and not me someone else as if someone a stranger was in there sitting there grinning to himself in a comer of my mind listening to me think and watching me thats what it felt like harry i just knew was being observed it was a feeling that grew on me from then until well right to the bitter end weird eh in his time harry had come across weirder things for the moment he would keep those to himself too but having listened carefully to all banks had told him so far it struck him that darcy clarke was probably right and on both counts for one he was already engrossed with the case to such an extent he was sure it would divert his mind from the psychological pitfalls of constantly querying who or what or where he was and two it looked like this really was something he would have to follow through to the end a job that only the necroscope himself was qualified to handle and the more he listened to jim banks and felt of his shock his horror the more convinced he would become that was how it started and pretty much how it stayed banks continued in a while it wasnt with me all the time only when i was actually working on the case but the closer i got the more i was aware of its presence except it wasnt an if it was a him someone as real as you are harry and as real as i was youre talking about a telepath harry told him a mentalist someone who can get into a mans mind like that has got to be a figment of his own imagination yeah i know banks stopped him short or i thought i did but not necessarily said harry thoughtfully for the necroscope remembered boris dragosanis story how the vampire thibor ferenczy the old thing in the ground had invaded his mind in order to sway dragosani to its will also he knew the mindspies of ebranch were capable of just such mental eavesdropping telepathy was real not just an idea out of fantasy or a figment of wild imagination why his own thoughts on the subject on this occasion were a form of the selfsame talent which was something else that banks overheard of course so i was right he said in a while call it by some other fancy name if you like but what youre doing right now is the same sort of thing well not exactly harry answered with a shake of his head as far as i know there are only two of us who can talk to the dead the other one is my son the talent seems to have passed down to him from me and plainly we are not spying on you you know im here and youre not obliged to talk to me or even suffer my presence true telepathy on the other hand is mental communication between the living and sometimes the undead which was a thought he also kept back pointless to further complicate matters also he went on telepathy doesnt have to be intrusive it can provide genuine twoway communication i have certain friends who mindspy yes for the protection of society our way of life just as you through your work protected those same ideals but the way these friends of mine describe their skills they arent in any way this sinister thing that you experienced no because that was intrusive banks declared emphatically and more than that it was also frightening if it hadnt finished when it did the way it did dont know think i might well have gone crazy hah instead i went dead but at first really was starting to believe that i was suffering from some sort of persecution complex i thought it was all in my head i mean literally it was only afterwards recently that i saw it as something else as what then as a distraction banks answered someone was deliberately crowding your mind in order to distract you from your investigations is that what youre saying like an irritating smokescreen yes banks was convinced but i fought it pushed on kept coming and since he couldnt frighten me off finally he he killed you off yes but even at the end he was helped by this telepathic trick of his i mean he knew when i was going to come for him and where from and so he beat me to it so what did you find out about him this fellow with the scorpion tattoo i mean harry sensed bankss nod as id suspected he had lots of previous but all petty stuff hed done time up north plenty of it all short term but i did get something useful skippy was on a years probation but theyd let him move down to london to take a job in his cousins garage in the east end some sort of cockeyed rehabilitation programme see if giving him a decent job would straighten him out i mean jesus harry this shifs therapy was to do facelifts on stolen cars necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley the paint under his fingernails harry lifted a querying eyebrow it was all coming together for you too true so what next next have a look inside that garage what else it was the bottom floor of a condemned municipal car park the upper storeys had been made safe reduced to a towering metal skeleton but the ground floor and basement had been converted into workshops inspection pits paint bays and what have you all the gear your typical autorepairs garage on a grand scale i figured most of the work would be legitimate a front for the real earner the conversion of stolen cars but it would have to be a superfast turnaround tealeaf a posh motor give it a quick facelift and ship it out ten to twelve hours maximum most of it at night after hours and did you check it out and is that what got you no i didnt have time just thinking about doing it and getting ready to set the thing up is what got me killed because he the gangs what mindspy wasnt about to let it go that far he was on me all the way and it happened the night before i would have taken out a search warrant and before you could let anyone else in on it harry was quiet but couldnt keep a tone of censure and of anger at the waste of jim banks out of his voice banks accepted it was out of line i just wanted this one for myself thats all rivalry like i told you it would have been a feather in my cap but instead it was something that felt like a pitchfork in my heart and thats why there were no clues to your death well other than the ones youve given me because you chose to play it close to your chest right banks was downcast it was in his immaterial voice and harry could sense it wasnt just because hed paid the ultimate price for his errors banks was privy to his thoughts of course and at last released a sob that no one in the world but the necroscope harry keogh could ever hear you pays your money and takes your chance harry but the voice in harrys mind was racked with what guilt jim dont torture yourself harry told him you didnt do anything wrong and my family my wife and kids were they guilty of something but still theyre paying harry and and the others and their families what about them but no i had to play the loner ahvays the loner i wouldnt feel so bad if id paid for it the same way on my own but those poor guys had to pay for it too because of me because of you i dont see it jim you were only doing your job and when youd gone someone picked it up where youd left off you had nothing to do with but i did and now i ask myself over and over again if theyd had the whole story would it have been different the necroscope shook his head i dont understand what do you mean if theyd had the whole story your colleagues but they didnt have any of it did they do the names stevens and jakes mean anything to you the dead man was somehow managing to keep himself under a semblance of control but his anguish was lying just beneath the surface the other victims bankss incorporeal nod those two were the closest i had to friends on the force i mean i had friends you understand but those two were close i asked them if theyd like to be in on it when i closed down the biggest autotheft gang in london and like a fool i told derek stevens who was closest of all about the garage and all the time that bastard thing was in my head listening to everything now harry understood bankss storedup grief not for himself but his friends and he sensed the dead mans nod of confirmation told them too little too late just enough theyd be sure to try to square it for me after after i but for the moment he couldnt go on so harry finished it for him after youd been murdered yes theyd investigate the garage without knowing how dangerous it was and so put themselves in the firing line yes god yes and they wouldnt know a thing about this mentalist his telepathic trick because you yourself hadnt known you said it yourself jim that you thought you were going crazy dont look for excuses for me harry im not because you dont need any you were only trying to uphold the law and so were they and so will i he was in now like it or not okay jim youve given me enough to go on a starting point anyway but now i need to feel it your pain your anger i need to feel angry enough to want to put it right call it incentive for want of a better word the night it happened how it happened what i saw all of it yes give me a moment banks told him and in a little while in direct contact with the necroscopes metaphysical mind he began to think it through relive it exactly as hed experienced it that night and harry was with him all the way bankss place was a stones throw from peckham high street it was nothing special a tall terraced house with a yard at the front a balcony on the first floor a small round window spying out from an attic room and a vegetable patch at the back crushed between neighbouring necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley gardens all of the houses in the terrace looked the same with only slight variations of exterior decor but the rooms were big and highceilinged and there was plenty of space for the kids no space for bankss car though his garage was one of a dozen in a low asbestosroofed block of badly constructed concrete boxes at the end of the terrace this made for a walk or a run when it was raining of a hundred yards after hed locked up and when the weather was really bad as tonight it pissed him off to have to go rushing into the house spraying droplets ike a hoseddown dog these were some of the thoughts that occupied his mind as he switched off the motor snatched his keys from the ignition rammed the door open with his elbow and made a dash for the upandover garage door and this was another fuck it why cant i ever remember to take the garage key off the fucking keyring now hed have to start up the car again to drive inside standing under the leaky garage guttering he finally fumbled the correct key into the release handle and turned it only to discover when he yanked on the handle that hed locked the damned thing but even as warning bells commenced their mental clamour as suddenly and as sinisterly as that he was there again that ominous presence watching and waiting his silent snigger grown to a snarl now in the back of bankss mind god banks thought in a moment of panic must really be losing it and bastard bastard bastard as he concentrated on what he was doing turned the key the other way and hauled on the handle to swing the door into its upandover position inside the garage it was nightdark cluttered with household junk at the back and the light switch wasnt working shit and damnation but it was okay the cars headlights would give him all the light he needed to park up but was that movement back there a pair of dark figures moving forward silhouetted against the greater darkness behind them and banks frozen to the spot transfixed by the utterly unexpected but in that single moment he put the whole thing together and the warning clamour in his mind and the sniggering went up several decibels the garage door he always checked twice that hed locked it but you could buy these fucking cheap keys in any hardware store and the light hed replaced that bulb just a week ago and that sniggering in his mind it wasnt in his mind anymore but but right here in front of him first the sniggering and then a low warning growl banks unfroze but too late the figures coming toward him out of the darkness of the garage converged with him fastened on him one of them briefly illumined in the rainlashed glint of a street lamp was skippy banks would swear but in the next moment an arm went round his throat and the scorpiontattooed hand swept a glittering knife on high then no said the second figure hes mine this piece of filth is mine but the voice itself was filth full of bile and phlegm and hatred and banks knew that this was the nameless mental intruder no longer a bodiless spying sniggering spectre but a living breathing reality and to corroborate it coming to him in his mind again but audibly now your balls are mine you stinking cop scumbag then skippys knee in bankss back thrusting him forward onto something that ripped him open like a paper bag pain unbelievable pain and the slash slash slash of silverflashing steel as sharp as razors the hot surging wetness of bankss blood from his face chest belly and genitals as he went down in just a couple of seconds he lost pints of blood that alone would suffice to stop him the shock alone of feeling his face torn open to the bone his belly in ribbons his manhood shorn from him in a tearing of upwardswinging scythes and the slashes not stopping but continuing to rain down on him where he slumped then crawled then collapsed but the pain miraculously the pain was going away like a dull ache receding so that only the tearing of shuddering but no longer protesting flesh remained to remind him of his murder because banks knew that that was what it was the end of him with all his blood leaking out onto the floor to mix with the rain and the oilclogged dirt he lay just inside the garage looking out after a while it might have been hours but could only have been seconds his eyes focused one last time on the rainblurred street lamp it was either that a focusing or the mucus of his eyes drying on the nerveless eyeballs to sharpen his dying vision but as his brain prepared to switch off someone or thing a face anyway leaned down and looked him in his own torn and bloodied face but god that the last thing he would ever see should be that face it wasnt skippy it wasnt human it wasnt anything banks might ever have believed in but it was as monstrous as the death it had delivered so that he didnt just die but went out screaming however silently and as if in mocking answer the last thing he ever heard seemed to be a distant howling banks was still doing it silently screaming but in the eye of memory now a scream of rage and frustration as well as horror as that rabid wolf visage gradually faded from his mind and the drizzle worked its way inside harrys collar and banks sobbing from beyond lit a fire in the necroscopes guts that he knew couldnt be extinguished as long as this went unresolved unpunished until hed seen the face of the wolf for himself harry had almost necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley forgotten what darcy clarke had told him the werewolf theory having seen it his senses were as shocked as the dead minds that transmitted the pictures as stunned as banks had been on the night of his murder he couldnt help but wonder if he would have fared any better probably not not then but he would now it was all a matter of knowing what you were up against gathering his composure and his thoughts he finally said two of them then skippy and that whatever it was his voice was colder than the grave itself so that jim banks knew harry wouldnt let him down even if his own life were forfeit and well what do you think the dead man was able to ask him at last mean was i crazy harry or what youre as sane as i am harry told him and to himself which right now isnt saying much but what do you reckon banks shook off the last remnants of his own horror and answered what do i reckon dead reckoning eh harry but his words contained little or no humour all right i think it was a bloke dressed up as a wolf see a wolf or big dog goes on all fours but this bloke was leaning over me so why the disguise i mean if id survived they were goners anyway i had already identified skippy so why that crazy horror mask work on crazy harry told him a lunatic jim someone influenced by the full moon who thinks hes a werewolf really the single word sounded like a sigh of relief to the necroscope even dead banks was pleased to know that his mind hadnt been cracking up harry squared his shoulders tucked his collar in more yet and prepared to leave i have some people waiting for me he was apologetic but before i go i want to thank you jim for what youve told me it wasnt easy for you i know i mean i really do know its okay the other told him just dont forget to let me know how it turns out right it might make all of this a little easier to get used to be sure ill let you know harry told him one way or the other ill let you know beyond the gates of the cemetery darcy clarke and the locator ken layard were waiting in a branch car darcy was at the wheel and layard sat slumped in the back seat half asleep his mouth lolling open as the figure of the necroscope loomed out of the wreathing mist darcy opened the front passenger door for him he got in looked at darcy said you know theres really no need transport is the last thing i require you could find a lot better things to do with your time darcy gave a shrug and started up the motor harry the way we see it youre our most valuable asset we cant be sure how or even if it will work out but eventually if its feasible wed like you to take over as head of branch except as you know weve already lost two heads in the last two years so so you intend to keep your beady eyes on me yes i know as they pulled away from the curb layard jerked awake in the back said huh and oh alec harry felt darcy cringe down in his seat beside him and turned his pale face to glower at layard where the locator was already biting his lip but whatever the necroscope might have said darcy beat him to it ken were you just born stupid or does it take a lot of practice i layard said glancing at darcy then looking into harrys face finally he shrugged and sighed i guess i was asleep what can i say im sorry harry following which he tried to change the subject anyway how did things go i mean did you get to weu speak to him the necroscope hadnt been in a good mood to start with now he wasnt in any sort of mood at all yes i well got to speak to him he mimicked the others hesitancy id never met jim banks in life but we got on pretty well funny thing but for a total stranger he knew my name right from the word go and hed only had a few minutes which is a lot less than eighteen fucking months it was perhaps unfair of him but that was the way he felt in any case nothing more was said until they reached their second destination nothing that darcy or layard were privy to anyway necroscope the lost years vol i keenan gormley and other victims banks had been the first man to die or rather hed been the first policeman to die but on the way to the second graveyard this time in the muswell hill district as the necroscope tried to relax in the front passenger seat closed his tired eyes and settled down into the worn leather upholstery harry the dead voice was one he would know anywhere any time it was that of sir keenan gormley first head of ebranch harry harry my boy i cant tell you how good it is to know youre alive and well again word has reached me about what youre working on youre the necroscope and your thoughts are very strong sometimes we cant help but overhear them and of course weve been you know holding our breath as it were since discovering that you were back in the land of the living in fact ive held back oh for a long time from contacting you for i knew youd be busy but as of now i want you to know that if theres anything we can do sir keenan the necroscope spoke under his breath the merest whisper of sound drowned out by the cars motor its good to know youre still around too what does one say to someone who was cremated more than two years ago i suppose you know that im what not the man i used to be conversing with the dead could be complicated we know about it yes sir keenans incorporeal voice was sorrowful for alec kyle and also something of your problems harry your discomfort but you know alecs case was one in a million he was totally lost to the living and the dead alike but without him we wouldnt have you so you see your problem is our blessing where would we ever have been what could we ever have done without the necroscope and for that matter what can you do now the way harry said it it wasnt a thoughtless question the great majority were his friends and very important to him he simply referred to their incorporeal condition or rather their usual condition without that they were engaged in any activity on his behalf but as well as having certain conversational difficulties communication with the teeming dead frequently conveys more than is actually said and sir keenan understood that the necroscope was only showing his customary concern and humility well for one thing we can tell you that the deaths youre currently investigating werent the first of this maniacs murders there have been a dozen here in london all occurring near the time of the full moon maybe a day or so before during or after but it must be said that the victims were no great loss to humanity nor of any special benefit to us in fact and to be frank about it they are mainly of the criminal element ganglanders harry wasnt surprised there had always been gang wars in london and there always would be mainly for territory from the east end in almost every instance yes but what a closemouthed bunch harry honour among thieves and all that rubbish and of course there was nothing they could do about their lot anyway ah but thats all changed now that you are on the case youre the necroscope which is to say youre not filth not the law with you they dont consider themselves informants its not like grassing in the normal sense of the word how good is their information harry was eager now for the fact was that he didnt have a lot to go on im afraid theres not that much i can tell you the dead man answered and most of it is conjectural anyway but surely anything is better than nothing harry gave a mental nod tell me then he said and let me be the judge of it the murders had all happened during the last three years all of them around the time of the full moon but not so many that the police would necessarily make the connection thered been a good many killings in that timeframe indeed the only thing that might have connected them lay in their uniformly unsolved status in that and in the fact that the last three murders prior to those of the police officers had been committed by a thing halfman halfwolf or by someone in the guise of such a creature which would seem to indicate that the maniac had only recently adopted his werewolf role this last however the use of the wolf mask was something that other living investigators couldnt possibly know only the victims had seen their attackers face the victims and now harry keogh necroscope it was the horrific nature of these last three murders their modus operandi along with those of jim banks stevens and jakes of course that had finally alerted the authorities to what they now erroneously categorized as a series of serial killings that these atrocities were the necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley work of a lunatic was hardly in question but serial killings sir keenan gormley and the great majority doubted it harry had been right the initial series of seemingly unconnected murders had been territorial a homicidal member of a gang of carthieves had begun taking out members of encroaching gangs one by one almost systematically but after a while following his first halfdozen killings maybe hed started to enjoy it maybe hed sensed his power the advantage that his weird talent gave him his ability to get into an enemys mind and preempt his every move a grudge against the police well maybe the urge to permanently remove any persistent adversary very definitely an esoteric talent plus a diseased and generally criminal mind equals gruesome murder lycanthropy not merely a concept of fantastic fiction but a mania a recognized and accepted psychiatric phenomenon the madmans need to tear his victims to pieces like a wild animal and his bloodlust at the full of the moon when the lunar orb tugs at the fluid of his brain no less insistently than it lures the great oceans his anguished howling when innermost passions are finally vented in acts of furious mayhem the madness of a rabid animal then in combination with the warped cunning of an habitual criminal that was what the necroscope was up against and as yet he was still no closer to learning the murderers identity so what do you suggest he asked sir keenan gormley as the car sped him ever closer to the muswell hill cemetery and his second liaison eh darcy clarke glanced at harry out of the corner of his eye did you say something harry gave a slight start and muttered er just talking to myself he knew how the espers of e branch looked upon his talent that even with their knowledge of parapsychology still they found it disquieting settling deeper into his seat and switching to a mental mode he said sir and keenan gormley chuckling in his mind what do i suggest well for one thing if i were you i wouldnt let myself stray too far from that one darcy clarke has to be just about the safest man i know or knew but quite apart from darcys talent he was also a good friend and better to have him as a friend than a foe harry what with that guardian angel of his and all you certainly wouldnt want to go up against him in a duel now would you so if darcy wants to keep his eye on you dont complain about it ill try to remember that harry told him but thats not what i meant i wasnt talking about darcy no of course you werent but i thought it worth mentioning thafsall im just so glad to see that youre still with ebranch he fell silent for a moment mulling the real question over in his incorporeal mind then think that i would probably try to fight fire with fire for talking to you about darcy and the branch brings back to mind some of the amazing talents you have at your command quite literally yours to command if you so desire them oh harry waited and shortly your quarry appears to be some kind oftelepath which so far has given him an advantage but you ham all the fully developed talents of ebranch so why not give him a taste of his own medicine harry from what i know of you thafs your way isnt it an eye for an eye and all that harry was interested should use an ebranch telepath now that you know what youre up against youd be a fool not to and sir keenan explained what he meant harry thought about it a while and said maybe if thats what it comes down to but right now i have to be saying goodbye for shortly ill be speaking to derek stevens the second of this lunatics three policemen victims but keenan gormley had already drawn back harry felt him shrinking away as from a scowl or a slap and he felt obliged to ask is there something i should know he sensed the others nod and eventually hesitantly his answer sometimes some people just arent ready for it harry some people dont get used to death so readily and some well they dont get used to it at all ever when i found out youd be handling this i tried speaking to stevens myself just as ive spoken to others of the victims in order to save a little time you know im sorry my boy but derek stevens hasnt got used to it yet harry felt darcy clarkes elbow giving him a gentle nudge looking up he saw that the car was at a standstill outside the muswell hill cemetery and since they were here it seemed only right that he should give it a try well if you must i suppose you must sir keenan gormley told him his ghostly echo of a voice fading to a distant whisper in the necroscopes metaphysical mind but better you than me harry far better you than me from this side of muswell hill the fact that the district was elevated was obvious southwards the nighted streets of london sprawled like some giant shimmering cobweb woven on the curve of the world it had done raining for now but in harry keoghs fertile imagination the cold glitter of distant street lamps in the moistureladen air was the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i reflection of a myriad jewels of dew on the blacktop strands of the great web and the vehicles crawling on the roads were mama spiders children learning the skills of the silken tightrope but evocative though the vista was it wasnt the necroscopes reason for being here as he penetrated the graveyard the concerned concerted everburgeoning clamour of incorporeal voices sounding in his metaphysical mind brought him back down to earth and below it in a moment their concerned clamour yes full of concern for stevens they werent talking to harry not yet for they didnt know he was here but to each other and to stevens trying to talk to him anyway discovering the dead mans plot wasnt difficult it lay dead centre of the physically silent but psychically noisy babble which as harry approached grew louder by the moment the brandnew marker clean gravel chips and fresh flowers provided all the corroboration he needed these things and stevenss name his dates and his epitaph of course a man of law order a fighter to the last struck down by the lawless in the pursuit of his duty sorely missed but alive in our memories always a very sad thing but the babbling creature in its grave was sadder by far it was just as simple as sir keenan gormley had tried to forewarn the dead couldnt console him derek stevens couldnt come to terms with his demise wouldnt accept it wasnt going to lie still for it and despite that he knew in his innermost being that he was dead still he fought against it and cried his horror of it until his plot and the entire graveyard reverberated with his silent shrieking and his coffin wasnt merely a box but a cell in a subterranean asylum an asylum in the worst possible sense of the word that of the madhouse a madman harry asked of the dead moaning in their graves driven mad by grief frustration and horror necroscope a shuddering voice answered for the living arent alone in their capacity for grief we also mourn for the absence of all the loved ones we left behind who dont know that were still down here and must never know else theyd sit by our graves all day and their brief sojourn in the land of the living would be wasted no less than ours in the darkness of death so taken aback by the sheer soulfullness of it the doomfraught feeling in the voice for a little while the necroscope said nothing but then excuse me sir for i dont know you harry respectfully shielded his thoughts from the rest of the cemeterys dwellers in order to speak to this one alone but i do know that while you are in the majority still you are of a minority a defeatist among optimists for while ive spoken to a great many dead men i honestly cant say i ever before heard the condition or the lot of the teeming dead expressed so mournfully so hopelessly as you express it even vampires who have lost not only life but undeath and immortality too seem a deal more accepting of their station than you are of yours which isnt so much to put you down as to inquire well what is it thats made you this way for a moment the other was silent perhaps shocked could this really be the necroscope whose compassion was universally acclaimed harry sensed the stiffness in the unquiet night and to his relief felt its gradual easing until eventually youre right of course said the unknown voice but without its hopeless tremor now stoic in the modern sense yet submissive when faced with the truth you must forgive me my doubts and my regrets harry my lack of conviction ah but it comes hard for a preacher to be preached to for a man of the faith to discover himself faithless made to discover it and by one so young at that and yet youre so persuasive you put it so very well perhaps you should have taken the cloth and been a preacher or maybe youd make a better philosopher have you studied philosophy harry some the necroscope answered which was at least in part the truth or rather ive played a few wordgames in my time and with experts too i know how to argue if thats what you mean he explained no further than that but on the other hand what the dead man had said to him explained a great deal all of his life this man had preached of a god and a life after death but now in death where was he why had he not taken these souls to his bosom neither necroscope nor preacher could answer that question but in fact he had claimed them or would eventually except harry had always had his doubts which this apparent delay in the promised deliverance only served to exacerbate the whole truth of the matter was something he was yet to discover albeit in another world another time harrys thoughts on the preachers predicament were like spoken words which the dead man answered again you are right for if i thought it hard to convince my flock in life how much harder in death when the anticipated resurrection is not harry nodded it must be difficult yes but you do still talk like a priest i still think like one deep down inside its just that now well my words seem so futile so empty even to me sometimes and the worst thing is i cant put a time on it cant advise them of the hour of their salvation but talking to such as you and feeling your living warmth i brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i do believe of course i do for if there is nothing left but this darkness this purgatory of sorts then why have you come to remind us of the past if not to provide evidence of a glorious future for he was he is and he shall always be gods messenger harry didnt feel like one but you are the preacher was insistent you bring light in the eternal darkness harry and hope where no hope existed you rekindle the flame yes and i think i know what brings you here the souldestroying cries of this demented one taken before his time you are here to comfort him tell me that im right not quite harry shook his head and knew the other would sense it can comfort him well and good but in fact im here to question him i want to know who killed him so that i can right the wrong revenge the voice of the preacher was far quieter now an eye for an eye harry growled you cant find it in you to turn the other cheek so that the murderer goes free to kill again its not my way harry nor mine not really but ill do what i must and in doing so lower yourself to the killers level tell that to the dozen or more hes lowered six feet under the sod i cant give you my blessing the preacher shook an incorporeal head give me access thats all i ask call off the others for theyre doing no good and crowding me out it was true derek stevens had them all in a state every single inhabitant of the place brought to the brink of what among the dead could only pass for nervous collapse they knew no peace with him they could neither converse nor hear themselves think for his noise they flocked to him with gentle words and the hardest of them with threats but nothing they did brought surcease for he was inconsolable to the world outside the world of the living the muswell hill graveyard would seem a hallowed place of peace and rest but to the ones interred here it was now a bedlam well harry thought to himself sir keenan did try to warn me after all but as he seated himself on a nearby slab the tumult fell off a little and as the teeming dead felt his presence they drew back and made way for him then gradually the incorporeal babble tailed off to a hiss of whispers and finally a welcome silence as they waited or almost a silence for down there in the earth unheard except by the dead and the necroscope harry keogh there was a sobbing a heart not yet melted in corruption lay broken there a soul with nowhere to flee suffered all the undeserved grief of the grave and a mind bereft of control cut off from mans five earthly senses teetered on the brink of total insanity to the eye of memory fleetingly the necroscope pictured an illustration from some old book of a man lying in a foetal position on a bed of filthy vermininfested straw over broken flagstones with gaunt drooling holloweyed figures shambling to and fro aimlessly all around add to that scene all the protests and the pleading and even the threats of the great majority and harry couldnt help wondering is that what its like for derek stevens to the teeming dead the unguarded thoughts of the necroscope were perfectly audible and yessss stevens sobbed and huddled to harry in his mind crushing to him for his living warmth any other man would have recoiled at once to be embraced even in ones mind by a corpse isnt a thought to dwell upon but harry was the necroscope and the dead were his friends he could no more shrink from stevens in his grave than from a sick friend in a hospital ward and so he instinctively wrapped the dead man in his warmth and let him leech on it a while but briefly for something warned him not to let himself succumb to the others incurable chill but as he drew away no dont go who are you what are you a nurse a doctor youre alive i know that because youre warm i can feeljyowr warmth but the others in this place theyre cold so tell me tell me tell me youve got to tell me theyre lying i have to know that i that im aliiiive right at the end it turned to a wail a sobbing shriek that sank down as if into the earth from which it issued im alive yes harry spoke out loud however quietly now which was easier for him and made no difference at all to the great majority but this isnt a hospital derek im harry keogh the one they call the necroscope and sometimes i wish i wasnt this is one of those times there was no other way to do it his words spoke volumes told far more than hed said but even in his ears they sounded like a betrayal nooooo the dead mans wail denied it my parents wife family friends my whole wooooorld gone but this time the final word was a whisper not gone harrys face was wet with his own tears and his voice rang with his own agony theyre still there derek everything everyone they have accepted what you cant accept because they saw felt touched you and knew that they had to give you up their living senses made them to know that yours dont work any more the sobbing had stopped now and for long moments there was only a stunned breathless silence it was as if the dead held their breath waiting for derek stevens to gather his a renewal of his crazed raving the necroscope sensed it coming and stopped it short i can tell them youre okay now he said your family your friends brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i jim banks and george jakes im the only one who can tell them i can make it easy for them reassure them give them strength to carry on even those last two who like yourself cant carry on and have accepted it or i can say nothing at all or i can tell them youre like this but id really hate to do that and leave them in the same sort of hell going mad with worry over you there couldnt be a same sort of hell not remotely the dead man answered at last but now there was that in his incorporeal voice that hadnt been there before so that harry felt like an inquisitor as if hed issued a threat or attempted to coerce the other but you did stevens told him with something of a sneer you threatened a dead man so much for the mercy of the necroscope and if that was a lie what about the rest of the bullshit theyve been feeding me at which harry relaxed a little and perhaps even smiled to himself through his tears the word game he was playing was going his way at last and youre not crazy derek he told the other not if you can still reason as well as all that crazy the other seemed surprised was i supposed to be his voice was still bitter but harry sensed that he had definitely turned back from the brink mad with grief sure just as the preacher had said tortured by frustration naturally but i wasnt crazy bullheaded thats all a bad loser and unwilling to give up on a lost cause or argument well hell ive always been that way of course and how hed always been in life was how hed be in death but even the worst loser must accept the verdict when hes finally down and out harry felt the soft sighing of the dead for this was an argument that was definitely going his way now except as the necroscope was well aware it wouldnt go down well if he stuck the boot into an underdog one should always leave a bolthole so that the gallant loser may retire with grace and so well and youll win this one too in the end he said however casually eh hows that stevens was back on his feet again the sob gone from his voice forever it was the prospect of winning when all had seemed lost but how could everything be lost when he was still here still fighting what i can still win can and will harry assured him because in the end why well all be in the same hole everyone eventually what death is a hell of a long time harry explained youve lost nothing derek or at worst your situation is a temporary one but everything and everyone youve said goodbye to youll be saying hello to in some distant future except by then why you may not want to not want to wont want to be reunited with youll get old derek and so will they youll be old in the ways of death and them old in the physical sense which is something you wont have to suffer theyll have new friends and be different and so will you but who knows who can say maybe theyll be like you as rebellious as you have been and need you to show them the way when finally finally they get here just as the dead will show you the way if youll let them can have new friends even old ones jim banks isnt that far away you should be able to talk to him if youll just reach out have i been selfish no just scared and you scared the dead too because now and then they lose someone like you now and then someone will retreat so far into his misery that hes permanently lost they thought you were going that way too derek and so they called you in harry shook his head i didnt come to help you but to ask for your help just as jim banks has helped me and george jakes too i hope jim george and me now the dead man knew what it was all about what it had to be about and harry felt his excitement now that really would be a way to finish a fight right to hit back from the grave so what do you want to know harry told him and what little there was he got from a seat in the front row as usual afterwards when the necroscope had said goodbye to derek stevens and was leaving the cemetery harry said the preacher that was just marvellous and you really do know how to argue dont you told you so said harry but in fact i had an advantage over you i knew something you couldnt know oh it was something i saw written on his gravestone something that had been put there by people who knew derek better than either one of us it said he was a fighter to the last except as weve seen the fight isnt over yet the necroscope had to make one more visit and this time it was a venue and a meeting that he wasnt looking forward to at all the police mortuary in fulham where george jakes lay gutted on a slab waiting for him for its one thing to talk to the dead but something else to converse with a mangled mess that simply isnt recognizable any more and smells of the blood guts and shit that used to lie under the skin harry steeled himself to it however and on the way told his esper friends what derek stevens had told him brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i less than banks im afraid when banks was hit stevens didnt automatically tie it in to what banks had been investigating banks had been onto a gang of carthieves yes but he had been killed by some maniac who was perhaps responsible for a whole string of previous murders maybe banks had been doing some work on those too the only thing stevens was certain of was that banks had a lead on this east end garage and he knew it was a job he had been keen to finish so stevens waited and watched and got together and made plans with george jakes and because stevens and jakes had had close friendships with banks the investigation of bankss murder was passed to another more impartial team not that there was any real impartiality a policeman had been murdered and the police are clannish about that kind of thing anyway stevens and jakes were out of it but if there was some connection between bankss murder and his theory about the garage and his autotheft case stevens reckoned business would fall off a bit now the gang would keep a low profile until they saw which way the wind blew in which case it would be pointless to raid the garage right now for the place would be clean and in fact over the next three weeks to a month there was a noticeable falloff in reported cartheft but that could be coincidental and stevens still couldnt tie bankss murder to the suspect garage in a month however the moon had waned and waxed anew toward the end of that period the incidence of vehicle theft had risen again the taking of a couple of porsches clinched it and a raid on the garage was on and the moon was nearing its full meanwhile stevens and jakes had looked the place over a rundown multistorey exmunicipal car park the garage was huge and decrepit a concrete skeleton upstairs it was a gutted ruin only the ground floor and basement were still viable and housed the garage proper access however was by no means easy there were no windows on the ground floor and one of the two old entranceexits had been blocked off the remaining entranceway onto the disused ramps was controlled by a manned barrier and a motorized steelribbed retractable overhead door there was no natural light in the work areas only electrical and the only visitors allowed inside were clients whose vehicles were in process of repair a searchwarrant was vital but in the course of looking the place over stevens and jakes had experienced the same kind of invasion suffered by jim banks something or one had got into their minds but a feeling so strange unnatural weird that neither one of them more than mentioned it to the other maybe they suspected they might be cracking up a little certainly stevens felt shaky about it but neither one of them made too much of it not to his partner anyway in fact derek stevens put it down to an attack of nerves and to the loss of jim banks but ive spoken to both of them now and i know that their symptoms were exactly the same this wolfthing a selfdesignated lycanthrope was into their minds maybe hed been alerted by their giving the garage the onceor twiceover in preparation for their raid whatever it never got that far five nights ago a day before the full moon stevens was driving home from work on wet roads through a thin drizzle he stopped at a red light controlling roadworks at a bridge over a railway but the truck following right behind him didnt the only warning he got was that thing in his mind an obscene chuckle and a gurgling mental voice that told him kiss your asshole goodbye fuckhead followed by a howling like a madman trying to imitate a wolf struck in the righthand rear his car spun left smashed through a makeshift safety barrier and fell thirty feet onto electrified tracks darcy clarke nodded we read about it in the papers that would probably have been enough falling like that and crashing down on that live rail but the commuter train that piled into him two minutes later left no doubt it was a miracle the train wasnt derailed and there were no other injuries harry nodded that was the extent of what derek stevens could tell me and now im left with george jakes or rather with whatever is left of him harry darcy was very quiet i know youve seen some stuff but the police have told us that this one is you know ugly jakes didnt have any family so they didnt pretty him up much hes just as our mad friend left him three nights ago but the police are finished with him now and he burns the day after tomorrow jakes was a green and thats how he wanted to go cremated he reckoned were short enough of space as it is without filling the ground with dead meat his words harry not mine so his boss told me anyway harry thought about it a moment and said youre right darcy ive seen some stuff the chateau bronnitsy was full of it but thanks for the warning anyway i could probably contact jakes from here or from my room at ebranch hq but that isnt my way see in my book respect works both ways if you want it youve got to give it so ill go to see him anyway and in a little while they were there no two dead people are alike harry knew that jim banks had been hard but not really derek stevens had been hardheaded he hadnt wanted to admit defeat wasnt nearly ready to quit even when the chips were all the way down with them maybe it was like a suit of clothes you wear to impress they were just people underneath brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i wearing policemen on the outside well and that was them but george jakes was something else george had been hard hard and he still was and he was soft too in places or as soft as his rigor mortis would allow but on occasions like this the necroscope was adept at keeping his thoughts to himself harry and his friends had been taken down into the unnatural or suspect deaths room by a police pathologist in a white surgical smock rather it had started out white but their guide had just finished an autopsy in another room chatting to them in a friendly enough fashion he cleaned his hands on the smock as he led the way then stripped off his thin rubber gloves to let the trio into the locked refrigerated morgue and leaving them he told them drop the key into my room when youre finished which was the only thing they actually heard the rest of his patter had been drowned out blurred to a mumble by the morbid aura of the place clarke and layard followed quietly behind harry where he went from sliding drawer to drawer examining labels but when he stopped at a drawer marked george jakes they stepped back a little darcy admitted to still being queasy from the mess in oxford street and layard didnt want to see stuff just for the sake of seeing it but if harry really needed them he shook his head and let them leave then slid open the drawer and whats new necroscope said george jakes with a grin of horror on his face that hed wear forever or at least untilit rotted off and before harry could answer but in a far quieter mode as jakes scanned his visitors stunned thoughts hey is it that bad funny cos i cant feel a thing but i can remember it and how and seeing it in technicolor doesnt really help so what say you switch it off now necroscope i mean i wjas never a one or watching myself on home videos either you know what i mean by which time the humorous touch had disappeared entirely from jakess voice and harry realized that the dead man had been looking at himself through his eyes he quickly slid the drawer shut groped for a steel chair to steady himself sat down heavily in it and said george i what can i say im sorry it didnt seem much but what else could he say tespixfcxaafe ta ex ms sa yisrry com stsi seeas contents they were printed on his minds eye in all their gory details but darcy had been wrong someone had done something of a job on the corpse if only to make it bearable the stitches were less than cosmetic like a slipshod job on a torn hessian sack jakess corpse seemed to have been sewn together mainly to keep it together to stop him falling open or even apart harry deliberately put the picture out of mind to keep it from jakess mind and took a deep breath then remembering what jim banks had told him but at least you didnt feel all of it george he said you couldnt possibly have felt all of it felt enough jakes answered more than enough to put me down among the dead men obviously he wanted to forget it but knew that he couldnt not for a little while so lets get on with it harry i know what you want so lets get started i had no family qakes commenced his story the only real friends i had and few of them at that were on the force id been a cop man and boy since i was eighteen until a couple of weeks ago when i turned forty and much like you harry i was the one who always got the nasty cases it just seemed to turn out that way rapists and murderers and arsonists pimps perverts and all the slime that walks the streets they all seemed to head my way hence my reluctance to make more than a handful of friends take a wife and raise a family being that close to all of the shit i didnt like the idea of contaminating others or maybe it was a matter of trust so many people out there seem bent on making it even over the bodies of the rest of us that i wasnt willing to put myself in the firing line i mean id be the best sort of cop i knew how sure but id get along just fine on my own and not rely on anyone else and i did and people even other cops unless they were close to me didnt mess with me i had this reputation i smoked too many cigarettes and drank too much cheap whisky maybe but i got the job done especially if it was a job no one else wanted and i was hard for despite all my bad habits i kept my body in good nick it would have to be one rough son of a bitch who put me down and it was normally i wouldnt have fallen for it but these werent normal times i was feeling for derek stevens i mean one day there were two of us and the next he was gone a lousy hit and run traffic accident of all if only because he leaves no one to mourn after him when hes gone i suppose i was bitter you know and no way i could tie dereks or jim bankss deaths together or connect them to jims work on the stolen car rackets but one thing for sure warrant or no warrant tomorrow i was into that east end garage and nothing and no one was going to stop me the trouble was i thought these things while walking the street with my hands in my pockets and my fortieth cigarette sticking out of a corner of my mouth right there outside the garage which i was looking at one last time before busting the place and of course he was listening to me i knew he was there in my head but figured it was just another symptom of the blues well you live and you learn and then you die before i left the place i saw a van rolling down the exit lane onto the road there were two guys inside and the van was giving out a blast of raw junglemusic i mean like that calypso stuff that your namesake harry belafonte used to sing but a hell of a lot wilder hey i never got necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley past bill haley little richard and fats domino so dont ask me to be specific but it was caribbean island stuff jamaica or somewhere like that for sure and so was the front seat passenger he was rasta as they come greasy dreadlocks and all and his eyes were black as his plaited hair where they stared at me as the van shot by those dark eyes seemed to be saying well be seein ya gain honky and they sure enough did the guy driving was younger by three or four years he was white well a dirty pale pimply sort of loose around the mouth like some kind of idiot and wore a crewcut yeah harry i know what do you think ive been lying here doing nothing ive had a word or two with jim banks sure and this guy would have to be skippy but i didnt know that then these guys were what just a couple of yobs employed by the garage as far as i was concerned yeah a couple of yobs who were waiting for me in my flat when i got home like i said if i hadnt been so down i might have sensed it i might have known something didnt smell right but by the time i did smell it it was too late my flat is on the ground floor and the other two tenants upstairs always work late so the rest of the house was empty it was dont know somethingtoseven by the time i got home outside the street lights were already on but as i turned my key opened the door stepped inside and tried to switch on the lights suddenly i knew but it was already too late there was a little light from a street lamp right outside the main door of the house which shone in through chinks in my curtained windows but i hadnt been in there a minute before i knew they were there just a feeling or a taste or smell the fact that my lights were on the blink and shadows where there shouldnt be any i dont know who or what hit me on the head but the carpet was wet with my blood when i came to and a spot behind my ear felt soft i could only have been down a second or so but as i stirred and tried to drag myself into a sitting position i heard this ugly voice say tough bastard isnt he in a broad geordie accent and another voice deep and brown and guttural and yet a voice in my head saying yeah but you ii be softer on the inside wont ya boy and when i opened my eyes to catch a glimpse of that face which i knew went with the voice it was jim bankss wolfface of course but the mad eyes staring out of the sockets were black and glinty as coal and human and inhuman then i was kicked over onto my back and the thing seated itself astride my upper thighs and showed me its claw five surgical knives set in a swarfglove that he wore over his hand it was dark in my flat as ive said the only light came in through chinks in the curtains from the street lamp outside but it wasnt so dark i couldnt see this skippy character over the crazy mans shoulder how pale his face looked and how he couldnt bear to look but must turn away and then the pain as that thing ripped into me and didnt stop ripping but youre right harry jakes sighed after a while didnt feel all of it you can only take so much you know and funny the last thing i remember thinking before i passed out and woke up here was jesus my flats going to look a real mess then he was quiet again maybe turning it all over in his own mind but as the necroscope was about to say thanks jakes said oh and theres one other thing it probably isnt worth mentioning but ill let you decide there was this girl girl harry repeated him she was outside the garage just walking up and down the street i saw her there twice and again on the night that this happened he shrugged the last off was finally done with it she was a real looker tall slim slinky yet natural with it maybe eurasian could be from the shape of her eyes like almonds and very slightly tilted and her hair bouncing on her shoulders seeming black as jet but grey in its sheen with the light glancing off it she was the ageless type harry i mean anything from nineteen to thirtyfive but a looker oh yes he pictured her for the necroscope who agreed with him yes she was definitely a looker a customer waiting for her car to be fixed could be jakes shrugged again and fell silent the interview was over necroscope the lost years vol i v rl stevenson jamieson and his brother back at ebranch hq it should have been time to call it a day or a night but darcy had mentioned some paperwork he must see to before going home likewise ken layard he also had work to attend to and so they had ridden up together with harry in the elevator and accompanied him to his door or perhaps the paperwork was just an excuse because they had sensed that the night wasnt quite over yet where the necroscope was concerned the place was quiet with the majority of esper personnel already checked out the main corridor might easily be mistaken for any corridor in any betterclass london hotel but the duty officer had met the three out of the elevator and as the necroscope entered his room and made to close the door suddenly it seemed he heard someone breathe his name he immediately boiled over and stepping back into the corridor shouted hey look if im involved why not simply involve me i mean dont talk about me talk to me what am i a social leper layard had already entered his office but darcy and the duty officer an esper by the name of john grieve a bespectacled balding twig of a man in rolled up shirtsleeves grey slacks and slippers with a clipped precise military or oldschooltie sort of voice that harry supposed might easily get him typecast as an inland revenue inspector which he was anything but were standing with their heads almost conspiratorially close together well he snapped as they turned puzzled faces towards him well what darcy was plainly annoyed we werent talking about you harry er but we were about to john grieve was less certain and fidgeted with the lobe of his right ear or if not about you about your wife and youre perfectly correct i should have included you but i wanted darcys opinion first now darcy was looking at grieve in the same puzzled fashion what whats going on thats what i was trying to tell you its about brenda and quickly before darcy and the necroscope could break into a bout of angry questioning we seem to have lost her and the baby in the necroscopes mind grieves dry official almost emotionless voice seemed to ring like an echo chamber darcys too perhaps it was an irritating effect of the empty corridor and rooms he thought and put it aside if only for the moment but brenda and little harry missing that was something else lost them he repeated grieve my wife and child what do you mean lost them the phrase seemed too wellchosen too final harrys tired eyes were wide awake now unblinking have they come to any harm he grabbed the dos elbow grieve looked him straight in the eyes and said no not that we know of now do you want to let go of my arm so i can talk to you in whats left of comfort harry gritted his teeth but released him and waiting for grieve to speak he reevaluated what he knew of the man grieve had two talents one of them dodgy branch parlance for an as yet undeveloped esp ability and the other very remarkable and possibly unique his first gift was that of farseeing he was a human crystal ball the only trouble was he had to know exactly where and what he was looking for otherwise he could see nothing his talent didnt work at random but had to be directed he had to have a definite target his second string made him doubly valuable it could well prove to be a reflection of his first talent but occasionally it was a godsend grieve was a telepath but a mindreader with a difference yet again he had to aim his talent he could only read a persons mind when he was talking to him but if he knew the person in question that included when they were talking on the telephone using john grieve there was no need for mechanical scrambler devices it was one reason why darcy used him as frequently as possible in the role of duty officer but had it been something of grieves talent that the necroscope had experienced just a moment ago was it even possible you werent talking about me harry frowned and licked his dry lips his mind returning to that peculiar sensation he had felt when hed entered his room the feeling that his name had been whispered and then there was the echo chamber effect which was still present as if his head were hollow or as if it were what occupied by someone else someone who was spying on his thoughts were you thinking about me then and if so would i be able to hear you thinking suddenly brenda and the child had taken a back seat in harrys order of priorities or if not that exactly then hed seen the possibility of a connection with their disappearance and this new brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i problem a remote one but a possibility again harry gripped grieves arm then both of them as he read the others negative stare no he wouldnt have been able to hear grieve thinking about him and so john i want you to read my mind he snapped go on in there and see what you can find see who you can find do it now as quickly as you can almost instinctively grieve looked and recoiled at once he wrenched himself free of harry took a stumbling step backwards said what well harry caught up with him and held him against the wall of the corridor what did you see perhaps not surprisingly the echo had vanished now the voices of everyone involved were remarkably clear and ordinary there was no whisperer in the necroscopes mind darcy was looking worriedly from harry to grieve and back again what on earth he began to say but grieve cut him short with two of you a moment ago two of you but now only one only you again harry released him and turned tremblingly away he had been invaded his mind broken into just like banks stevens and jakes before him for long moments there was an electric tension in the air until finally well is someone going to explain darcy shouted at which harry took them into his room and listened while grieve reported the details of brendas and little harrys disappearance grieve didnt waste any time but the necroscope was now sensitive to every second ticking by and as he listened to grieve he also found himself listening to or for something in his head but it didnt return or not yet anyway she was shopping in knightsbridge grieve started she had the baby with her we had men on her of course three of the best the same people who have watched out for her all the time shes been here special branch and good at their job not espers but the next best thing he shook his head if it were anyone else id suspect their report was a whitewash but not these blokes they know what theyre doing and if they say she disappeared she disappeared but not into the crowd you understand though certainly there were plenty of people on the streets but she took young harry into a baby outfitters and left the minders waiting outside where they waited and waited and finally went in to see what was wrong well there was no exit from the rear but brenda and the kid were gone harry sounded much calmer now yes i get the picture but what time was this fivethirty or thereabouts you two had already left the hq with ken layard i didnt want to cause a panic or divert you from what you were doing there seemed every chance that we would pick brenda up again i mean were not looking after her because shes under threat or anything but mainly because well because because sometimes she doesnt seem capable of looking after herself harry cut in again its okay go ahead and say it she has problems i know and to himself problems brenda thats saying the very least all those weeks months of debriefing following the bodescu case and harrys subsequent metempsychosis his rehabitation of anothers body indeed his very being when brenda had thought him dead wouldnt that be enough to unnerve anyone and gradually during the course of all that debriefing and harrys rehabilitation it had become increasingly apparent that brenda was in real trouble but surely that was only to be expected and might even have been anticipated for after all brenda had only recently become a mother shed still been recovering from an uncomfortable confinement and problematic birth when for a while her doctor had thought he might lose her add to this the fact of her husbands weird talent that he conversed with dead people which brenda had known about and which had preyed on her mind for months and then the fact that her infant child seemed possessed of similar or even more frightening powers so that even among the espers of ebranch he was looked upon as something of a freak and the fact that harry was now a different person one who was harry with all of his past his memory and mannerisms but living in a strangers body the fact of the absolute terror brenda had endured on the night when she came face to face with the monster yulian bodescu whose like she couldnt possibly have imagined even in her worst nightmares little wonder her mind had started to give way under the strain on top of which she hated london and couldnt possibly return to hartlepool in the northeast her old flat would be poison to her and full of monstrous memories for it was there that the bodescu creature had attacked her attempting to destroy both herself and her child thus as her mental connections with the real world were eroded brendas visits to various specialists and psychiatric clinics had increased until now what had happened here had she decided that enough was enough or was it the work of some outside agency or could it be that the baby himself anyway grieve continued glad to be off the hook it didnt work out like i thought it would and theyre still missing we have as many branch agents on it as we can spare theyre out there in the city right now doing whatever they can his words drew the necroscope back to earth the address of the store the look on harrys face was now entirely grim grieve took darcy and harry to the ops room punched up a street necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley map of london onto the big screen he showed the necroscope the exact location of the store harry said okay now i have something to do then to john grieve i wont be gone long but in the meantime darcy might like to tell you about the case were on and to darcy i hope this thing with brenda has nothing to do with our werewolf but ever since we got back here dont know i cant be sure but i think ive been experiencing the same sort of mental invasion that banks and the others described christ darcy gasped as the meaning or a possible meaning of what the necroscope had said sank in but if he knows youre on to him do you think hed take hostages harry held up his hands in a helpless gesture but a moment later gave a grim shake of his head no i dont think my son would let him lets hope its just a coincidence but one thing for sure i darent waste tonight so while im gone perhaps youd like to call in trevor jordan better still let me have his address and tell him to wait there for me its something sir keenan gormley recommended using several coordinates that he knew the necroscope went to the store in knightsbridge where he entered the premises using the mobius continuum his arrival at once set off the stores alarms but that didnt bother him in the event that his plan worked he wasnt going to be here very long in harrys incorporeal days before his repossession of alec kyle he had been able to travel into the past and immaterialize there hed been able to manifest a ghostly semblance of himself on any bygone event horizon now embodied and fully corporeal once more this was no longer possible it would create unthinkable paradoxes and perhaps even damage the temporal flux itself he could still travel in time but while doing so must never attempt to leave the mobius continuum for the real world transferring back to the continuum he found a pasttime door and floated for a moment on the threshold gazing on time past this was a sight that never failed to awe him the myriad blue lifethreads of mankind twisting and twining in the metaphysical vacuum of a previously conjectural fourth dimension those neon filaments that might best be likened to the retinal memories of time the trails of human lives that had travelled here or if not here in the mundane world on the other side of the mobius continuum and way back there in the past the blue haze of mans origins that supernova of human life from which these streamers had hurled themselves into the everexpanding future it seemed to harry that he heard an orchestrated sighing ahhhhhhh sound like a single pure note from some otherworldly instrument or the massed voices of a magnificent chorus in a sounding cathedral but in fact he knew that all was silence that it was only the effect of his stunned mind for if any man were to actually hear the tumult of the past that would be a sound to blast his brain and deafen him forever almost reluctantly the necroscope brought himself back to the task in hand this was the place where his wife and son had disappeared just a few hours ago well he had his own theories about what had happened to them and now one way or the other he intended to prove them and without further ado he launched himself down the past timestream but here a curious and paradoxical thing because he had never existed in this particular spacetime harry had no past lifethread to follow but must simply let himself plummet and because this region of the past was now his present his true lifeline extended behind him and seemed to unwind from him like cotton from a bobbin back to the pasttime door and harry found the knowledge that he could return to his point of entry via that thread very reassuring in a little while he had reached his destination arriving at a point in past time where it would be proved eventually that his son the infant harry had contrived to bring about an amazing almost unique occurrence but that was for the future not the past he knew the lifethreads of brenda and her baby at once he seemed drawn to them sucked at by their rush as they emerged like bright blue meteors out of the past and hurtled by him on course for the true future the one a mature blue nucleus at the head of a trailing thread its pathway through all the alternatives of time and the other smaller but brilliant with new life this was them or their temporal echoes after entering the store but what the necroscope desired to discover was their course from here on quickly reversing his direction of travel harry followed behind and gained on them for he had the advantage of knowing that time is relative and that in the metaphysical mobius continuum will is the single cause that brings effect and indeed he willed himself to catch up with them just in time speeding behind them intent on following wherever young harry might take his mother the necroscope was witness to an effect that would baffle even him and continue to do so for a period of seven long years or lost years as much of that time would come to seem to him for harry had forgotten a very simple fact that what he could do with the continuum his son could do in spades it was simply this that in the space of a single moment of time brenda and the infant harrys lifethreads had come to an abrupt totally unexpected apparently violent end blinded by the sudden flash of twin bombbursts harry closed his eyes and sped on through what must surely be the debris of his family scattered atoms of light occupying the space where they had been but then looking back he saw that their necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley termination had been too complete too utter that in fact nothing remained of them not in this world anyway or rather not in this place and so perhaps harry could be forgiven for believing that his son had simply moved his mother to some other safer place in the mundane world and that he would experience little difficulty in finding them and going to them later but later can be a long time as the necroscope would discover soon enough and in his case it might even be years back at the baby outfitters the alarms were still going off as harry paused there to get his co ordinates so the telephone started ringing for a moment he ignored it then gave it some thought for who would be trying to call a baby store at this time of night the answer seemed obvious moving to the front of the store harry found the office desk and telephone and lifted the latter from its cradle at the other end of the line darcy clarke said harry yes good im glad i caught you look dont go to trevors place i spoke to him on the phone and by now hes on his way in but er he told me to tell you that he wouldnt i mean not under any circumstances accompany you anywhere via your mode of travel is that understood harry grinned to himself however coldly and nodded yes understood he said and can you reach him in his car yes then tell him to go to this address and meet me there he passed on the address of the east end garage and tell him to keep a low profile harry is this wise darcys concern came over loud and clear do you think you should be following this up i mean tonight probably not but i didnt start it what about police or ebranch backup definitely not just jordan no backup in fact i want you to back off for a moment there was silence then darcy asked can i hear alarms ringing probably in more ways than one harry answered and put the phone down and to himself sirens too outside the shop visible through the plate glass a police car had screeched to a halt its siren was blaring and blue light rotating a young policeman came to the window held a hand over the peak of his cap and scanned the interior he saw harry walk out of the office shrank to one side began talking excitedly into his handset harry waved cheerily at him then walked into the back of the store where it was still dark conjured a mobius door and took his departure lawmen had irritated the necroscope more than enough for one day time to let them do some explaining and especially after theyd broken into the store for no apparent reason harry took the mobius route to the east end and stepped from his door into a thin penetrating drizzle that filled the night with its misery and turned the cobbles to gleaming jet turning up his collar harry walked a quartermile to the rundown district where the garage was located and from a nearby street looked the place over the garage was pretty much as harry had heard it described its supports and upper floors formed a concrete skeleton six storeys high the sections making up the outer safety walls had been knocked out so that the floors were like vast lintels supported on giant steel and concrete stanchions in silhouette against the night sky the place might be a towering th century stonehenge or some surrealist sculptors ziggurat below at ground level the ramps at harrys end of the mainly derelict building had been removed the entrance bricked up but enclosed behind an eightfoothigh brick wall a maintenance yard extended a further sixty feet or so beyond the end of the main structure ensuring that he wasnt observed harry made a quick mobius jump into the yard to have a look and retreated in double quick time when he discovered warehouse doors standing open at the end of the main building emitting a blaze of electric light and the sounds of human and mechanized activity also the yard was full of quality motors hed seen a handful of porsches even a lotus obviously the people in the garage were working overtime and the necroscope knew what they were working on he only hoped they wouldnt be working too late and that trevor jordan wasnt going to take all night getting here for if the werewolf were on duty sooner or later hed be bound to discover harry lurking out here which could only result in complications but sir keenan gormley had advised to fight fire with fire and harrys answer to his unknown adversarys telepathy was trevor jordans maybe jordan could block the other out giving the necroscope the edge he needed which wasnt to say that harry didnt already have an edge he had a good many edges and sharp ones at that but hed seen through the eyes of dead men what he was up against his plan was a simple one get into the garage check out some plates engine block numbers and what have you get out again and report the entire operation to the police the branch could pass on the information about the crazy wolfman the murders hed committed and if there wasnt enough real living evidence against that one maybe harry could think up some necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley other way to settle the score maybe even to the point where hed offer himself up as bait but the law is the law despite that the necroscope might occasionally seem scathing of redtape officialdom he wouldnt be playing the part of executioner just for the sake of it he knew that the murdered men especially jim banks and the other policemen wouldnt want it that way well not if it could be avoided but if it couldnt in that case if there were no other way then sir keenan gormleys law would apply then it would have to be harrys way an eye for an eye right now however deciding that his lone figure was too obvious standing there in the blurry watereddown light of the street lamps harry made his way to an alley on the far side of the road and stepped into its shadows no sooner had he done so than he realized that he hadnt been alone in what hed thought was an empty street looking out into the night he saw a figure female walking in his direction but on the other side of the road in the lee of the garage wall despite that she wore flat black shoes she looked tall and lithe her gloves were black too as was her trousersuit her hair was tied back in a ponytail and her manner was carefree as she swung a fancy black shopping bag for all the world as if she were just returning from a jaunt to some fashionable outfitters for that special little item and to hell with the rain harry couldnt quite make out her features but found himself wishing that he could for he felt sure shed be a looker at which he remembered what george jakes had told him could this be the same girl she fitted jakess picture definitely but if so what would she be doing here now some sort of fancy lookout for the garage it seemed likely but then catching a glimpse of her dark slanted almond eyes in a pale heartshaped face as the girl reached the wall of the maintenance yard and glanced across the street in his direction the necroscope drew back into the alleys shadows and as his back met the wall at that precise moment of time a wellknown voice spoke suddenly sharply in his mind harry thank goodness ive found you my boy you move so fast its hard keeping track of you sir keenan had spoken to him at a moment of maximum concentration when his nerves were at full stretch so that there in the darkness harry gasped and gave an involuntary start the dead man felt it and said oh and what are you up to now why are you so jumpy harry took a chance and glanced quickly round the corner but the girl was gone but how there were no other alleyways close by and the street was a long one yet from what he could see it was deserted end to end even an olympic sprinter couldnt have disappeared at that speed and it wasnt likely shed gone over that wall was it well sir keenan pressed him whats going on putting the problem of the girl aside to explain the more important details harry whispered so you see while i was halfexpecting some kind of mental intruder i wasnt expecting you on the other hand while he engaged in incorporeal conversation with keenan gormley he wasnt likely to be overheard and intruded upon by any living mind even a telepathic werewolf cant intercept the thoughts of the dead sir keenan however could hear his thoughts well enough and told him harry you know that normally i wouldnt bother you but i believe this to be important indeed i think its what youve been looking for the identity of the murderer harry stiffened at once and said i think i already have it or if not an actual identity a description at least but it would be good to have confirmation yes it happened after you visited banks stevens and jakes sir keenan told him someone came forward a dead someone oh yes a victim no less than the others yet if possible a worse crime than the others for this was the murderers own brother the necroscope sensed what would be the sad shake of sir keenans head then harry now id like to introduce you to rl stevenson jamieson and let him take it from there harry had become adept at discerning good from bad almost from the initial sound of a dead voice and when this one spoke to him at first tremulously and then with growing confidence he knew its owner for a good and honest man i reckon i was yeah the other agreed but not without a degree of modesty as best i knew how anyways but my brother wasnt like i means he isnt you want to hear our story necroscope see i think things is gone far enough i has heard you talking to others bout this thing and even though i was a ways off and it werent me you talked to still i felt how warm you was so i know why the dead uns love you so and god knows that should anything happen to you my name and bones is cursed forever well i dont want that no way so does you have the time to hear me out necroscope and of course harry nodded his confirmation keep it short we were born in haiti portauprince by we i means me and my brother a c doyle jamieson and before you asks yes our poppy was a hell of a reading man we had a older sister too shelley orm w as we sometimes called her cos wollstonecraft is a mite longwinded i was bom in and arthur conan came seven years later so you see he was my little brother but out there in the antilles it was much the same necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley as here in england or anywhere else in the world i reckon theres a hell of a difference in sevenyears what i mean is i was brungup respectful to folks just like shelley before me but by the time arthur conan came along things was changing for one thing poppy was getting old he werent much good at correcting anymore ma died when arthur conan was born and three years later shelley got herself married and moved across to jamaica which left just me ten years old poppy and a c that didnt help a lot neither cos there was no womenfolk to teach a c his manners and put him right when he did wrong just me and poppy to do our best at spoiling him which we did by then poppy was really old a c had been his last spurt so to speak if you take my meaning about poppy he had obeah blood in him me too a little and a c a lot you know the obi harry shoot a course you does why this thing youre doing right now is well its obeah right black magic obi those islands is still full of it i hear whole regimes has risen and fallen on it but more of it when a c and me was kids it came with the black folks out of africa you know the preacher used to say that obi was born in sin and bred in ignorance and didnt have no place in a godfearing world but i always figured he was more afeared of obi than god except poppys obi was gentle stuff for protection more than anything else i mean poppy wouldnt a harmed a soul he was just happy with his charms and lovepotions and never once messed with poisons or dead folksi mean the zombies harry begging your pardon protection yeah but poppy did have something more than the simple stuff and he coulda used it to make himself a big man why whole governments have balanced on such as this in haiti and the indies yeah for poppy had the power to look into a enemys mind and so know his every move why it was even better than that he simply knew it when he came up against a bad one this thing of his would kick in right away hed be reading any bad or dangerous thoughts aimed in his direction and hed know who was aiming them not that it happened too often you understand cos poppy didnt have no enemies there was special times when poppy would practise his obi and the full of the moon was one of them we had a little house and garden sheltered by the cliffs in a corner of a shingle bay near port depaix on the south coast we kept a few chickens a pig or two and there was plenty offish in the straits between haiti and tortue island what with green stuff out of the woods and the garden we didnt do too badly at all but as poppy got older and a c grew up id keep getting this feeling that my little brother wasnt satisfied there was a whole wide world to play in and our garden by the beach wasnt big enough wed creep on up poppy at full moon time he had what he called his obeah house it was just a wooden shack at the end of the garden where mostly hed sit on a old rocker and tilt a jug but sometimes hed burn herbs mutter a spell or two turn in a circle and scan all around to feel what was going on in the world and the next day wed have chicken for dinner cos hed a used a bird in his practice but if hed catch us spying on him my how hed fly into a rage then obi was something he didnt want us having nothing to do with and hed get me on my own and say you has a good aura robert you is chocolate which is to say yous a natural thing as a forest is green and a fish is silver you is chocolate like a log is brown and the skys blue and the seas deep green down under you is the colour of your soul too but son i tell you your brother is dark and i mean darker than just his skin but arthurs young and that can change better had too else theres no good ending for him except i knows i wont be here to look out for him so i got to leave all that to you you is his brother after all and that was me stuck with it not that i minded much not then but come the time a c was seventeen i was a fulltime working man and didnt have a lot of spare time for him poppy was on his very last legs in fact i couldnt see how the old boy was still hanging in there and my brother well he be just a handful there was this girl in trouble in port de paix not that that meant a hell of a lot cos she had something of a reputation anyways and ac was smoking a lot of the wrong stuff also i suspected he was big in a gang on the wrong side of the law and you got to remember harry the law out there in them days wasnt the same as here in england no sir men was dying for their political beliefs or just disappearing off the face of the earth which amounted to much the same thing but worse than these things i also figured ac was doing some obeah or trying to do it anyways i spoke to poppybout it and he said son its what i feared the blood will out obeahs in my blood and in you and your brothers blood too except i knows that if a c gets it hell use it wrong but i also knows that you is there to block him so long as you is alive my obeahs split two ways between you and your brother so wherever he goes whatever he does be there to square it with the powers that be i mean the powers that govern obi just be there and arthur wont have full command of his skills but son i feel i has to tell you this your brother is strong in obeah i has known it for oh many a long year i reckon its why i hangs on cos i know he doesnt come fully into his own till i is passed on now harry thats a night ill remember always cos when i was leaving the old boy be in his obeah house i saw a shadow sneaking away along the garden and that shadow was shaped like my brother well poppy died a few days later all curled up like an old leaf and clutching his belly as if he ate something that didnt agree i had my suspicions but god i couldnt see ac doing that i just couldnt a couple years went by and poppy was right his obi came down to me and ac but as i said before i got a little and my brother got a lot and all of what he got bad brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i ac was nineteen and wanted by the law not for any thing you could specify mainly for being against the socalled authorities if theyd got him he was a goner for sure and ac knew it that alone was enough to turn him against any kind of genuine authority from that time on he wanted to smuggle himself out of the country and he had the contacts to do it all he needed was papers which werent hard come by to someone who could do a few favours some obi tricks for folks to get them and he got papers for me too see i minded my promise to poppy that would go along with a c wherever he went and watch him whatever he did he was my little brother after all so we came to england i suppose we was illegal immigrants since our papers were faked and all anyway they never did catch us luck and obeah were with us and theres a lot of island folk over here you know theres always someone who be ready willing and able to protect an obi man i suppose i was looked after cos people liked me and ac cos cos they feared him but trouble follows trouble harry and here in uk a c just couldnt keep his nose out of it same as back home black gangs and what all pilfering drugs he was just a bad lot he was into everything i would a given up on him for sure but for my promise to poppy and i knew that hed be a lot worse if i wasnt there to keep a balance but it seemed myobi balanced his and kept him out of trouble well out of the worst kind of trouble anyways ventually we fell apart i had me a job a good one too and there was a girl but never mind bout that one night a c came around to my place and hed had too much to drink said he wanted to talk well you know how drunks ramble but theres rambling and rambling my brother was looking at me sort of strange and breathing slow and heavy and you know necroscope i couldnt help but remember that night when poppy told me about the balance between our obis and how a c doyle jamieson wouldnt come into his own while poppy was still alive and how even then there d be me to steer a path for him and i admit i thought well looks like acs about ready to start steering his own path and i thought this boy wants my obi too anyways i asked him what was the trouble and he told me the leader of another gang was after his skin but ac could only catch a glimpse of this boy every now and then i mean an obeah glimpse you know like when poppy knew that a enemy was after him but this was serious stuff and ac needed to know this guys every move but he couldnt cos my obeah was blocking his and i had heard bout this boy and knowed he was real bad stuff well like a fool i told ac id rein back on it and i did just that i hadnt given my obi hardly a thought since my talk with poppy but now i concentrated on clearing the way for ac it werent nothing physical all in the mind i just quit from giving off obi figure you knows what im talking bout necroscope cos you be like that but oh i had bad dreams for a couple nights til ac came to see me again and by then its been the time of the full moon obi time and i has seen in the papers how this other guy is dead and all tore up and heres my brother ac doyle jamieson on top of the world not like when i last saw him cept just like before i couldnt believe that of him not of my brother but just in case i lets my obi flow again i send it out of me not just to guide but to counter arthur and he knows done it o course how cos he picked up ona enemy me well a month went by it was full moon time again and after that i mean it was then that harry i was out of it but dont ask me to tell you bout it cos i wont andyou already had it from the others and its because you had it from them that i knows it were arthur see the way it happened to them is how it happened to me just exactly so in the end i has to face up to it but like i always tells myself a c was my brother after all you will know of course harry told rl stevenson jamieson in a while that the best your brother can expect is to be put away probably for the rest of his days and i do mean the very best he can expect and the worst he thinks hes a werewolf r l and to my way of thinking he wont be safe even behind bars or in a padded cell but the worst is death if he puts up a fight well he just has to lose because if he doesnt other people will theyll lose their lives he sensed r l s nod suppose i knowed that deep down inside sure i did cos if i hadnt i wouldnt a come toyou but i figured if he got to go best at your hands necroscope not if i can help it rl harry shook his head not now ive spoken to you but if it comes down to it understand r l told him and harry if i can be of any help well perhaps you can at that for out of the blue the necroscope had an idea and hows your obi rl eh why it be gone down into the earth with me oh really for harry knew it wasnt like that he knew that whatever a man is or does in life hell usually continue to be and do afterwards why it could well be that rls obeah had helped keep his brothers identity secret even among the great majority you think so rl obviously hadnt given it any thought oh my you means i was still looking out for ac even after he killed me it could very well be harry told him in a way youve kept right on protecting him or his good name at least huh said r l his good name indeed brian lumley yours then harry answered and now well maybe you can protect me too eh hows that harry explained and rl quickly got the picture he was dead and his obi with him or maybe not through the necroscope he could use it again for the necroscope and in doing so deny its use to his brother but only if it comes down to it harry told him and in the next moment gave a massive start there in the deep black shadows of the alley he had been so caught up in his conversation with the dead man that hed failed to hear the pad of soft furtive footfalls as they approached him too late he had heard them at the same time as a hand came down on his shoulder harry trevor jordan said as the necroscope gasped and lurched away from him did i startle you jesus christ harry whispered falling back against the wall trevor trevor what do you think youre doing what i was told to do the other answered with a shrug and looked perplexed im keeping a low profile what else vi and one other freed of his conversation with rl harrys mind became a possible target again as did the telepath trevor jordans for of course he too was an enemy of ac doyle jamieson the extrasensory presence of both of them was too much their combined espauras undetectable to the great mass of mundane mankind radiated out from them into the rainy night in every direction one direction would have been more than sufficient that of the garage across the road there came an intrusion which the necroscope felt at once but instead of avoiding it or flinching from it he answered back and tried to get into the mind that was getting into his trevor jordan felt it too the blunt groping of a strange and strangely gifted mind and said wha but harry held up a hand to still jordans inquiry husking listen in if you want but be sure not to open your mind to it for now ill let you know when and huh the intruder grunted like a pig in harrys mind no longer a mere whisperer but a sentience surprised that the necroscope had recognized his presence and was reacting to it but not in the way that the intruder had anticipated then because he knew hed been discovered you again there could be no mistaking the phlegmy threatening quality of that voice or the megalomaniac superiority of its owner any other man but a telepath born and a practised one who had come into contact with deranged minds such as this before must surely recoil from the stench the mental slime of it like a poison seeping in his mind a telepath yes or the necroscope harry keogh for he had spoken with vampires and not all of them dead ones by comparison and strictly by comparison this mind was almost sweet but as for the rest of it the actual contact in fact this mindtomind contact with a living person wasnt unlike brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i speaking to the dead except harry wasnt a true telepath he couldnt send but only receive incoming information any answers he might originate would only be heard by virtue of the others telepathy which in this case amounted to the same thing and this time the other none other but ac doyle jamieson had indeed heard the necroscopes thoughts but they were scarcely the thoughts of a frightened man and definitely not those of one who doubted his own sanity and who are you there was anger in that voice now and perhaps something of uncertainty if not downright fear what are you what the fuck are you im the end of the road arthur harry told him im a big dose of your own brand of obeah bouncing right back at you im a silver bullet heading for your heart im the justice of all the lives youve taken held back way too long pent up and now about to burst out and enact itself on you but in harrys metaphysical mind irrepressible if not deliberately expressed there was one other thought and im the one they call the necroscope ac got all of it but especially the last bit and even though he didnt know what a necroscope was it sounded threatening and he didnt like it huh necroscope the scope ending had stuck in his mind finally made sense to him albeit mistakenly scope a spy a police spy a raid oh really ac was trying to sneer but in fact he was panicking now and far more dangerous for it finally he broke and snarled well fuck your ass bro his presence vanished abruptly from harrys mind the seconds ticked by then down the street at the other end of the garage the overhead door began clattering up on itself its long metal leaves concertinaing into the housing it was easily sixty yards away but in the quiet of the midnight street even at that distance harry and trevor jordan could hear hoarse angry shouting and as the darkness was suddenly slashed by headlight beams a veritable convoy of vehicles came roaring down the exit ramp one after the other onto the road white and blue sparks lit the night where wings hit the walls of the ramp and chassis jarred down onto the shining tarmac as the cars and vans turned viciously squealingly into the road some heading in the one direction and others coming harrys way he and jordan ducked down shrank against the wall of the alley watched two cars and a van howl by their drivers palefaced where they crouched over their steering wheels like a pack of rats deserting a sinking shit jordan said in harrys ear glancing at him harry saw that his eyes were narrowed to slits and his face creased in concentration but the shit who ordered them out of there is still inside what harry frowned youre in contact with him but i asked you to stay out of it were not sure what were dealing with here were dealing with one powerful telepath that much ill grant you jordan answered also a frightened one something is interfering with his talent hes trying to locate you again but something is getting in his way not me or you but oh i dont know something else and anyway i didnt deliberately ignore your warning harry but with a talent as strong as this one hes hard to avoid rl stevenson harry offered a grim nod thats whats bothering him most his brothers obeah i can almost feel it flowing through me which made little or no sense to jordan he couldnt get the meaning of it because he was busy not reading the necroscopes mind but at that precise moment the intruder had chosen to return and he was reading it and what rl but hes dead listen you white fuck whatever you are my brother is dead did you get that hes dead know cos i killed him for that matter so are you dead or good as and the two you got out there with you two and harry wondered what can he feel rl too not just his obeah but rl himself who you trying to shit fuckscope there aint no feeling rl cos rl s dead i mean your two friends out there enemies all three of you but only three of you so come and get it if you got the guts i mean three against one what are you waiting for but remember this i got the moon on my side his fading mental laughter was like the barking of a wild dog hes not scared any more jordan hissed hes just madangry and mad as a hatter too of course hes picked up three enemies but there are only the two of us harry was puzzled if hes also reading rls talent that makes him something of a necroscope in his own right whatever he is he craves blood namely yours jordan answered but also mine if ive read him right we should stop this right here and now and call in the law cowardly bastards the thing in harrys head roared fuck you then we fight another day and harry got a vivid mental picture of the intruder inside the garage making for his vehicle but the necroscope had been challenged worse hed been scorned called a coward and deep inside there was still this feeling that he wasnt at risk not the harry keogh hed used to be anyway meanwhile jordan had locked on again deliberately this time and said theres more than just him in there he has a friend with him or friends skippy harry answered jumping to the wrong conclusion or one that was only halfright theyre both in there and if they get away this time who knows when well be able to bring them to book jordan saw what was coming next and said harry i brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i are you coming the necroscope held out his arms jordan backed off your way not likely ive seen inside your head harry i know a little of what your mobius continuum is like ill go over the wall allowing no time for argument he left the cover of the alley and made to run across the road only pausing to turn and toss something back it glinted bluedsteel harry caught it a mm browning since youll be there first jordan quietly called you may need it reaching the wall he looked back and saw that he was right harry was no longer there but he was inside the garage and ac doyle jamieson knew it the madmans astonishment was like triple exclamation marks in the necroscopes mind followed by a ripple of terror and a barrage of inwardlydirected questions what where how who and finally a renewed flaring of anger his was a mind full of moon and murder and harry was his target for tonight there came silence physical and mental someone switched the lights off harry heard the switches trip and now there was darkness only one small electric bulb fifty or so feet away in the middle of a massive concrete ceiling gave any light at all and it cast shadows moving shadows harry saw or sensed movement a metal object clattered as someone stumbled over it or kicked it aside that was to the left but to the right a slithering of shadows just a flicker but enough to bring the short hairs at the back of harrys neck erect like a cats brush his eyes flickered this way and that glanced upwards overhead a system of gantries supported rails and a motorized cabin and crane heavy chains were still swinging a little on their pulleys or maybe theyd only just been set swinging a c and skippy and who else harry remembered what trevor jordan had said only a moment ago he has a friend with him or friends well great but how many of them jordan was right skippy didnt have to be the only one three said a voice from the blue or rather from the metaphysical darkness behind the necroscopes eyes and he at once knew its owner for rl stevenson jamieson three enemies but whose enemies is harder to say two of them is against you for sure as for the third harry sensed the dead mans shrug rl harry whispered youd best be using your obi to damp down your brothers i mean you should save your efforts for that dont waste them talking to me you is there to put things right necroscope and ill do whatever i can to help you rl told him dont you be worrying bout my obi it is working believe me and i just read in your mind my own brother boasting how he killed me so i wont be holding you to no promises harry dont be holding off for my sake you go get that son of a harrys eyes were now more accustomed to the gloom of the place the shells of cars lay in various stages of repair conversion and reconstruction in twin rows of bays equipped with inspection pits overhead hoists and various hand tools jacks and other wheeled machines stood abandoned in the central aisle and chains dangled everywhere the garage had been evacuated in a hurry and was now a mantrap even to someone well acquainted with the layout any abrupt or hasty motion could prove dangerous to say the least harry was shielded by one of the massive steel stanchions supporting the high ceiling he was located just inside a repair bay where hed stepped out of the mobius continuum some forty or so feet to his left the warehouse doors that he knew opened on the maintenance yard had been closed by now jordan would be stranded on the other side of them and that meant that harry was on his own and he knew that even if he took the mobius route into the yard still the telepath wasnt going to let himself be transported that way but in any case what good would it do to get jordan inside none it would only place him in greater danger of course harry could simply wash his hands of the whole mess and take himself out of here but that wasnt his way and the trouble was that here in the dark and the danger he was starting to feel more nearly himself he was more surely aware of the jeopardy in which he had placed himself the harry keogh mind if not the original body but what the hell it was all the same wasnt it it had now been brought forcefully home to him that this was him and he really was on his own not necessarily necroscope said the neardistant voice of george jakes causing him to start a little harry use the what mobius continuum jakes was excited uncertain of what hed heard harry thinking by all means use it but not just to cut and run you need real backup harry and it just might be that ive got the answer then quickly he outlined his plan and because george jakes was a dead man whom only the necroscope could hear and speak to no other prying intruding mind was privy to it harry listened liked what he heard acted upon it the idea of placing an ally like jordan in jeopardy had been sufficient to give him pause true but harry was no fool he knew he could use george jakes without worrying about the consequences and this way he would be keeping his promise both to r l stevenson and to the teeming dead in general he made a mobius jump to the police mortuary in fulham and in a matter of seconds returned to the east end garage but coming back he wasnt alone got him rl was triumphant his incorporeal voice greeting the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i necroscope even as he stepped from his door you was right harry my obeah has come back to me drawn back through you it gives me strength and depletes ac hell have a hard time finding you now the balance is maintained you is equals at least as long as can hold him my thanks rl harry whispered but in the empty echoing garage his words were plainly audible almost immediately there were furtive movements both left and right and overhead harry wasnt much disturbed by the movement on the right which wasnt so much furtive as deliberate purposeful he knew the sounds he heard were the shuffling scrape of george jakess feet where he headed off alone on his mission of vengeance but jakess shape and shadow were grotesque things made even more grotesque by the glowing nucleus of the single dim light bulb which silhouetted his lumpish figure in a pale aura and cast his long freakish shadow on the angular machinery and dangling festoons of chains like that of some nightmarish spider on its web but the movement to the left the door to the maintenance yard was that way had trevor jordan somehow managed to force an entry or was someone waiting for him to do so there in the darkness harry conjured a mobius door and jumped to the warehouse doors standing in the nearabsolute darkness scarcely breathing he could hear nothing inside but outside harry it was jordans telepathic whisper the result of a gigantic effort on the part of the telepath can you let me in no harry thought his denial just stay in touch with me then if anything happens get the hell away from here and call the police youve got it and he sensed the relief in jordans mind but they had also given themselves and their situation away hey you fuckscope in his mind harry saw a hulking menacing outline moving in the mechanical labyrinth of the garage know where you are shithead youre locked in and one other mothers locked out and im coming for you fuckscope the maniac bayed like a hound but all in silence trevor did you get that harry spoke out loud through a knothole in a wicket gate set in the main door can you pinpoint him yes jordans anxious whisper came back hes down in the basement where they keep their personal vehicles but hes moving in your direction he is coming for you harry yes but ac isnt a necroscope and he hasnt got the foggiest idea whats coming for him neither had jordan known it until he saw it in harrys mind and then he recoiled as if slapped in the face however harry went on if a c doyle knows where i am then its probably a good idea not to be here going on foot this time using the repair bays as cover he made his way back along the central aisle into the heart of the garage but halfway back to the single source of electric light suddenly it was snuffed there came the soft tinkle of fragile glass breaking harry froze whoever had smashed the light it wouldnt be george jakes because light or dark it would make no difference to him jakes was governed by whatever he was governed by love of the necroscope mainly or harrys power over the dead whichever way one chose to think of it so it could only have been ac or skippy or one other one other jordan told him but i cant read him or her this one has a funny mind ive met the like before you cant scan them any too easily they sort of deflect telepathic probes like mindsmog you know i dont think its a conscious thing but i get the idea harry cut him off and made to release the safety on his mm browning but even as he did so chains rattled almost directly overhead the necroscopes gaze jerked upwards he saw eyes glaring down on him from the gloom of the gantry walkway and sliding down the greasy chains a lithe blackclad male figure kicked the gun from his hand not only disarming him but numbing his arm at the same time shocked caught completely off guard harrys thoughts flew in every direction fumbling he made to conjure a mobius door tripped and went sprawling over an open box of tools into a pile of fresh swarf he felt a leg of his trousers rip felt his hands sliced as he scrambled to untangle himself but suddenly the blackclad figure was standing over him eyes burning in a black stockingmask and a dark gash grimacing where the mouth would be then the mouth formed words and snarled just one more motherfucking copper who wont come snooping anymore a geordie voice skippy and the necroscope could picture the writhing of the scorpion tattoo on his wrist as he drew back his arm for the killing stroke but no need to imagine his weapon harry could see that well enough the long ugly curve of a silverglinting machete the blade went up commenced its arcing sweep forward and down and something struck out of the darkness making first a vibrating thrum then the vicious whuuup sound of cleft air but it didnt cleave the necroscope the machete flew out of skippys hand his black silhouette was straightened forcefully from its killing feetapart stance jerked upright and tossed back like a carelessly discarded puppet he tugged at something sticking out of his chest coughed a spray of black that harry knew must be red and went down into darkness without another sound and stayed down a shadow moved sinuously close by harry heard a straining sound like something being stretched under pressure and the sharp click as a brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i catch engaged and being no stranger to crossbows he knew what had hit skippy a moment later the bright beam of a pocket torch shone directly into his eyes he was still tangled in cutting swarf and dripped blood where he put up a hand to shield his eyes but before the light snapped off he saw the browning lying in the swarf and reached for it this time before freeing himself he prepared the gun for firing as he did so he saw the shadow a female shape surely and one that hed seen before but he couldnt be sure because his eyes were still dazzled slipping away along the central aisle think straight cant you trevor jordan snapped in his mind and as harry finally got to his feet in a softer more anxious tone how bad is it are you okay ill live the necroscope answered hoping jordan would hear him but things are getting nasty now and i cant rightly say whats going on get back over the wall and call for backup lets have the police in on it hq has been tracking us jordan answered called for backup the moment you what went into shock i thought it was all over for you harry no not quite not yet harry answered now for christs sake leave me be i need to concentrate and as jordan cleared the telepathic ether so harry took over he spoke to rl stevenson jamieson rl i hope youve got your obi going full blast ac s going to be pretty mad when he finds out hes lost a bosom pal fraid not necroscope rl came back at once you is on your own my obi maintains the balance thats all but now the balance is all in your favour and in case you is interested i wants you to know we just welcomed a stranger into the ranks of the great majority or we will eventually when he quits fussing and screaming and if he be worth it skippy harry scowled and knew that rl would feel the depth of his loathing the way he shuddered in his soul well he isnt worth it but in the moment of speaking harry sensed that the shuddering wasnt his alone the intruder ac doyle jamieson was back except now he was whimpering like a whipped dog where he crouched in harrys metaphysical mind almost as if he were trying to hide there get out of there ac harry quietly coldly told him dont want to share your pain with you when finally you die let me show you something fuckscope the others terror was transformed on the instant replaced by rage and madness now he no longer panted his fear but his hatred and bloodlust let me show you how it was for the rest of those bastards who tried to bring the werewolf to heel but before he could begin no the necroscope refused him pointblank ive already seen how it was ac i know exactly how it was so instead id like to show you something a mental picture of skippy transfixed by a crossbow bolt stopped dead literally in his tracks and sprawled in the bloody swarf where hed fallen but because that didnt seem enough harry opened up his metaphysical mind to display all the unknown depths the gauntly yawning vacuum the absolute otherness of the endless mobius continuum ac saw how harry was a part of it linked to it and finally sensed the preternatural chill of the great unknown creeping in his bones then as the psychic ether slowly cleared well the necroscope was very quiet now and are you still coming for me arthur the answer was a howl but one of anguish of a diseased mentality frustrated to the breaking point that reverberated in the darkness of the garage and went echoing off into a throbbing silence no ac wasnt coming for him a c was running from somewhere below came the cough of a motor revved into tortured life the scream of its abused engine and harry supposed that ac was heading out of here there was only one way out down the old carpark ramp and through the barrier but if the barrier were lowered harry judged the coordinates and made a hasty jump to the garage entrance just inside the retractable doors to his left he saw the dark tunnel of a twolane downramp to the basement down there headlight beams swerved erratically tyres shrieked their shrill protest as the revving roar came closer hurriedly harry scanned the walls on both sides of the exit for the button controlling the overhead door to no avail and it was too late to cover the thirty or so feet to the barriers tiny control shack switch on and lower the boom acs vehicle was already roaring up the ramp from the basement but dont sweat it necroscope said george jakess incorporeal voice in his head didnt you hear the bugle sounding the charge the cavalrys right here harry harry looked and he saw and even the necroscope himself scarcely believed what he was seeing but conversation with the dead often conveys more than is actually said and jakes showed him the whole picture in the time it took for the battered van to make it up the ramp or rather he showed him the picture as it had been just a minute or so ago a c doyle jamieson tall burly decked out in his wolfmask and wearing his glove weapon lurching like a drunkard in the darkness of the basement spewing obscenities like the madman he was as he made for his van the vehicle was parked with its drivers door to the wall ac yanked open the frontseat passengers door and hurled himself headfirst inside the cab but before he could reach the controls the motor coughed into life someone was in the drivers seat hunched over the steering brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i wheel andac knew it could only be one of his enemies so why hadnt he been able to read him the answer was obvious but of course a c couldnt know it that only the necroscope harry keogh can read anything of the dead the cab rocked as the van drew out into the central aisle and the driver gunned the motor heading for the dim square of light that marked the exit ramp then the headlights blazed on and illuminated a figure standing dead ahead a female figure with her arm and hand raised and pointing or aiming directly at the cab this was a concerted attack they were acting in perfect coordination all of ac doyles enemies together he yelped ducked turned and struck with his honed steel claw all in one movement struck at the face of the man at the wheel and the face unzipped itself like a banana its flesh flopping down in strips then turned to grin at him with scarlet gums and reddened teeth and wet pusdripping eyes ac would have screamed then but could only go urgh urgh urghhh as the thing beside him lay back its grotesque head and gurgled owwoooow wolfman ifs silver bullet time but in fact it was crossbowbolt time a bolt that came smashing through the windscreen and nailed a c s shoulder to the padding of the seat where its head jammed in the aluminium backplate all of this from jakess mind as the van reached the top of the ramp and bounded onto the ground floor level and turned left not right to go revving up the skeletal ramp to the next floor and the next and the one after that all the way to the top and harry seeing it through jakess dead eyes but hearing it with his own ears even over the thunder of the vans engine ac doyles shrill agonized maniacal screaming as it finally dawned on him that a man hed killed was about to kill him and cheers necroscope jakes crowed in harrys metaphysical mind and he aimed the vehicle at the parapet wall six storeys up thanks for having me in on this this is for jim banks and derek stevens but mainly if s for me the tank of this bucket is full and i always wanted to go out this way in a blaze of glory oh and by the way heres the face of the ugly fuck who caused all of this and he reached over with a dead hand to rip acs wolfmask right off his head which was at the same time as the van hit the wall and went through it in a crumbling of rotten mortar and battered concrete and a shrieking of twisted metal harry staggered back against the wall in the entrance to the garage flopped there with his jaw hanging slack looking at ac looking at george jakes at the mad black screaming face the clawhand held up to ward off the very sight of the dead man dreadlocks flying in the midnight wind as the vans door was shorn from its hinges the mad eyes almost bursting from their sockets the thick foaming lips the torso beginning to float in freefall but pinned to the backrest by the crossbow bolt whose flight stuck out from acs shoulder lets talk again some time necroscope said jakes but right now i just want to savour the warmth harry shook himself had time to straighten up and look out into the street where even now something was crashing down in the centre of the road and jakes was right the vans tank must have been full to brimming under a sky clearing of clouds in which a bloated moon lit the wetshining streets of london acs van hit like a bomb nose first went off like a clap of thunder and blotted out the night with the abrupt brilliance of his funeral pyre and of george jakess which was the way one of them had wanted it at least harry shook himself again his numb mind cleared and he heard police sirens of course and theyd be here in just a few minutes harry are you okay yes harry answered are you out of it well out of it jordan answered with a mental sigh see you later harry told him nodding but right now there was something he had to do had to know he had seen the girl outside the garage then hed seen her inside when shed saved his life and hed seen her a third time in jakess dead mind so that finally he was sure now he wanted to see her again find out who she was why she was here jakes had pictured her at the far end of the basement to the necroscopes knowledge there was no exit down there and he knew that the maintenance yard doors on this level were locked she had got in through those doors but couldnt get out that way which left only one escape route she had to come this way and she did she came panting alert aware of the growing clamour of the sirens but harry was waiting for her well inside the garage at the landing where the downramp met the ground floor she came up the ramp at the run still carrying her shopping bag the necroscope knew what was in it her crossbow shed shot two bolts to deadly effect and was probably out of ammunition else shed be holding the weapon but he still had the browning and hed found the main switch for the lights set back in a recess in the wall at the top of the ramp as the girl drew level he threw the switch stepped into view she gave a small cry of surprise skidded to a halt and blinked in the suddenly bright light who what dont be scared harry told her its all over i just wanted to thank you for my life oh its you she said and breathed her relief i didnt know necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley which one of you to shoot i was just lucky i suppose her dialect was a distinctive husky even sexy edinburghian brogue that harry vaguely recalled and recognized from early childhood days in scotland and from later visits me too he grinned however wryly very lucky and for the first time he felt the stiffness of his drying blood sticking his torn trousers to his legs but the one in the stockingmask she continued well he looked the most likely target she licked her lips nervously and glanced this way and that obviously seeking a way out she had seen the gun in his hand and the man in the van harry was intent now staring at her the passenger i mean why didnt you shoot the driver it would have made no difference but he wanted to know anyway her eyes went this way and that i i saw what looked like a big dog or wolf sitting in the van but it was a man in a mask he attacked the driver tore at him and i i you fired at the one who looked the most dangerous harry nodded so were you hunting them or what he stepped closer to her but she didnt shrink away out in the night the sound of the sirens had grown very loud and he could feel the girls urgency radiating from her just one o them she replied her brogue thickening as her anxiety increased and now she moved closer to harry are ye the police the way she said police it sounded like polis no the necroscope shook his head and at the same time made up his mind about something this girl should answer questions to the law if not to him but she had saved his life after all i was hunting them too well and we got them did we no but now ive to go she made to brush by him and cars skidded to a screeching halt immediately outside the garage where orange flames lit up the night and black smoke roiled for the moon tell me one thing and ill help you he gripped her arm and she looked at his hand where he held her i promise ill get you out of this better make it fast then she gasped as running footsteps clattered on the entrance ramp why were you hunting him why were you she was drawing back from him and she was surprisingly strong they murdered friends of mine and they placed good friends o mine in in jeopardy but im afraid yere too late to get us out o here harry reached back threw the master switch and the entire garage was black as night then he conjured a mobius door and swept the girl through it and where to he asked her thoughts were like a vastly gonging cracked and echoing bell what what what shhh harry told her just cling to me and tell me where home is where do you want to go she clung to him just as tightly as she could and anywhere out o here she whispered hoarsely a whisper that rang like a shout in the primal emptiness of the mobius continuum he went to a place he knew exited from the continuum and held her upright until she felt the solid ground under her feet and stopped trembling then gradually opening her eyes she reeled for a moment and abruptly sat down on the rainslick cobbles of the alley just across the road from the garage but the rain was finished now and a mist swirled ankledeep like a river of whiteglowing milk all along the alley lapping into recessed doorways and swirling from the necroscopes sudden resurgence harry didnt want to answer any more questions right now but later he might have some for her now ive to go he told her in her own brogue how can i find you again i mean if i wanted to or if you wanted me to he held out a hand helped her to her feet i i just dinna believe what happened then she gasped i really dinna believe it her hands fluttered up and down the length of her thighs brushed water from the wet seat of her trousers ive really got to go harry told her moving off along the alley away from a street that flared red and orange in the roaring firelight bjs she breathed find me at bjs oh he looked back from the dark threshold of a recessed warehouse back entrance and cocked his head questioningly a wine bar i mean mah wine bar in edinburgh her mouth was hanging open and her words came out soft as breath but harry had had enough of initials acs and rls and bjs included so what does it stand for bj i mean eh her mouth was still open and looked delicious oh mah initials bonnie jean she said the name rang a bell harry remembered an old musical hed seen on the tv in his flat at hartlepool how long ago now he recalled the title and the words of a certain song go home go home go home with bonnie jean go home go home iiiiill go home with bonnie jean well maybe but not tonight bonnie jean just like in brigadoon he said brian lumley she obviously understood his meaning for now accepting the weirdness of things she closed her mouth smiled however wonderingly and said aye mah brave laddie exactly like in brigadoon and your name but then momentarily distracted when a police vehicle with blaring sirens went screeching past the mouth of the alley she looked back over her shoulder and bj s question hung unanswered on the damp night air for when next she turned to harry all that remained of him was a swirl of mist collapsing like an exorcised ghost on the spot where hed been standing harry made brief stops in several locations graveyards all of them to report the results of the nights adventure the principal details were already known however mainly through the efforts of one rl stevenson jamieson before returning to ebranch h q harry spoke to rl himself and said well a proven principle is shown to be working still i mean what you did in life youll continue to do in death and in so doing youll earn the gratitude of all the teeming dead no need to worry about your name being cursed now r l you talking bout my obi necroscope harry nodded you know i am for in life you took care of your brother as best you could you kept the balance now in death youll go right on doing it it dont take no effort harry rl told him its a natural thing specially now that im in touch with poppy again see i didnt like to bother him with all this before but now we is all together so to speak again harrys nod no shame attaches to you or your poppy rl and like i said the dead will always be grateful to you for keeping ac in his place what i mean is when the teeming dead talk to each other its voluntary they dont need to feel anything like ac creeping in their minds oh ac be no trouble now harry the werewolf s gone for good no more howling just the whimper of a cold lost little puppy but hell be okay once he learns hes safe in the dark and the quiet and fair enough the necroscope answered lets leave it at that then part two searching for brenda and for himself despite his several duty stops still harry beat trevor jordan back to ebranch h q he found the place just as the telepath had advised my activated under darcy clarke and ready at a moments notice to back him to the hilt psychically if not physically in the event and with the assistance of newfound friends he hadnt needed extra help also and right from the beginning he had asked darcy to keep out of it be that as it may the head of branch had been ready willing and able and it said a lot for the value the espers placed on harry eventually the necroscope was able to complete his report and in the wee small hours he sat alone with darcy in the latters office with his duties behind him harry at last found time to inquire after brenda and his infant son not that his concern was any less than it should be or his attitude in any way casual but he knew that wherever his wife and child were it was unlikely that they would come to any harm for all that harry jr was a babe in arms hed already displayed his ability to protect his mother from even the most dire threat and harry sr knew that whatever mundane things the infant wasnt capable of doing for himself brenda or the great majority would do for him and in answer to his anything nothing darcy shook his head worriedly not a thing every man who wasnt on your case has been on the lookout for brenda and the baby theyve all drawn blanks precogs telepaths hunchmen locators a dead end if youll forgive that expression when brenda first came here it was harry jr who brought her we have to assume hes taken her away again why and where to is anybodys guess of course we shall go on searching for them but right now his shoulders slumped a little im sorry harry youve done so much given so much of your time and energy for us and we dont seem able to do a thing for you which means ill have to do it for myself harry answered but necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley without bitterness darcy you must have known from square one that the main reason i let you talk me into staying here was for brenda you had all the contacts and i hoped the people you brought in would be able to do something for her i knew shed be safe here if there were any aftershocks from the work id been doing but thats all over now darcy saw what was coming youre moving out lock stock and barrel ebranch isnt for me darcy i was always a loner and thats the way i have to be and after all and as youve often enough said yourself do i really want to spend my life slopping out mental sewers i just cant see myself at the beck and call of the police their pet psychic who they can call on to solve every grubby little murder in the book oh i know it wouldnt be like that but it would be something like that and it isnt what im cut out for so it looks like its come sooner than either one of us expected im moving out yes when i dont have any ties here i mean im not bosom buddies with any of the people here or anything like that i have friends here yes i hope youre all my friends but no one i have to say goodbye to except maybe you so goodbye plainly darcy didnt know what to say youre our greatest asset or you were im just a man harry answered and meant it and anyway the branch has enough going for it but lock stock and barrel harry shrugged that doesnt amount to much nothing in fact whats in that wardrobe in my room can stay for now maybe ill pick it up sometime thats not what i meant no contact only if you find my wife and child but in any case ill probably find them first suppressing a yawn but stretching a little the necroscope grimaced as he felt a scab break on his thigh under new bandages his expression was wry as he looked at his hands which were also bandaged you should have had stitches darcy was concerned i hate stitches harry answered not to mention scars this way if im lucky therell be no scars so where will you go and when not tonight surely theres my flat in hartlepool which could use some tidying up before i sell its been empty for well over a year and my inheritance up in bonnyrig that big old house i think id probably like the solitude and i would be that much closer to my ma as for when whats wrong with tonight look darcy said suddenly anxious were both tired you especially you look all in and we dont see things right nobody does when were tired spend the night here have breakfast with me in the morning make up your mind then harry shrugged again its made up he answered on the other hand youre right and i am tired okay tomorrow is soon enough darcy looked pleased said and youll stay in touch i mean when youre settled harry sighed if you promise not to bother me maybe but lets have it understood right here and now im through with ebranch darcy it isnt me i wouldnt have time for the branch anyway no time for anything until i know about brenda and little harry darcy nodded very well and then on an afterthought what will i tell the police eh they found two bodies in that burnedout van one was our werewolf yes but the other theyre bound to identify him you know and then theres the one inside the garage shot dead but with a crossbow lets deal with george jakes first harry answered the big question is going to be how did george get out of a fulham mortuary into a burned out van in the east end right youre the last one who saw him er in designated situ as it were if we have to put a name on all of this i mean we wont but if we had to it would be mine yes harry gave it a few seconds of thought and said tell them that ac jamieson was an obeah man from haiti they should be able to prove that easily enough he must have stolen jakess body so that he could use it to put some kind of hex on the police as for why he chose to commit suicide who knows he was a madman after all also tell them to look for a shrivelled or melted wolfmask and a claw glove then theyll have all they need more than they need darcy agreed that garage was full of class motors most of them knocked off as for the one inside the garage skippy maybe that was jamiesons work too sure he was a madman but mad like a fox killing skippy he was covering his tracks simple and the murder weapon they wont find it harry shook his head something you havent told me something i might look into eventually well then said darcy nodding thoughtfully it seems weve covered just about everything then the faint halfsmile that had almost made it onto his face turned to a frown still im glad jakes didnt leave anyone behind family i mean i know what you mean harry answered it would be hard to explain right but dont go worrying about jakes darcy i have it on necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley pretty good authority that he doesnt feel sorry for himself just glad that he got his man albeit after the fact thinking about it darcys face went pale he remembered the bodescu case hartlepool on the northeast coast and the teeming dead coming up out of their graves but for the fact that he what liked the necroscope trusted him knew there was no menace in him he supposed by now his guardianangel talent would be howling for him to run the fuck away from the man it just doesnt bear thinking about he said quietly well if you must the necroscope told him then think of it this way jakes was only doing what hed always done in life and what he did best he considers himself fortunate to have had another crack at it and to have done it well i say we should all be so lucky all i know darcy answered is that when im dead and gone all i will want to do is lie very still yes but thats for now harry told him without emphasis but with a strange light in those eyes that knew so much darcy was scarcely listening to or looking at him which was probably as well but was still considering recent events the dead thief and murderer in the garage for instance harry was right so far the police hadnt found the murder weapon but they did have the actual instrument of death the short hardwood bolt they had spoken to him about that and it was worth mentioning at least are you sure you dont want to say anything else harry he said about this crossbow thing maybe i mean a crossbow is in any case an odd sort of weapon but forensic are looking at it and theyre puzzled by the fluke the arrowhead this was something new harry cocked an eyebrow so what about it darcy shrugged its a steel arrowhead as youd expect but silverplated you kill werewolves with silver dont you harry was good at hiding his thoughts his emotions and this time his surprise and coming to him as an extra surprise it seemed he was getting good at telling lies or halftruths too never to the dead but to the living i didnt know what i was going up against he said oh sure we had decided that this was the work of a what a lycanthrope some kind of lunatic but what if we were wrong there are strange things in the world as we know only too well darcy nodded you did kill him then hence the missing weapon the necroscope looked away finally muttered hes dead isnt he but now it was definitely something he would have to look into eventually he stood up a little unsteadily and said i seem to be more tired than i thought yet how am i supposed to sleep i have a lot on my mind going round and round sometimes i cant remember a time when i didnt have a pity we cant just switch ourselves off like machines darcy gave a small start as if hed just remembered something and said but we can what do you think that as head of this bloody outfit i leave sleep to chance god id never get any harry looked at darcy as he opened a desk drawer took out a small bottle stood up and went to a water dispenser do you have any allergies he dropped a single white pill in a glass and filled it with water the tablet dissolved in a moment no harry shook his head no allergies that i know of but sleeping pills just one darcy told him does the trick for me every time just switches me off harry took the glass maybe this once he said tilting his head back and downing the water but as he drank he didnt notice the fact that the head of ebranch seemed to be holding his breath after the necroscope left to go to his own room darcy called a branch specialist on his home number not an esper as such still this was a man with an extraordinary talent doctor anderson darcy inquired when finally the phone was picked up james anderson this is darcy clarke and in a moment answering the tinny tired voice at the other end of the line yes i do know what time it is anderson and im sorry its so late but this is important do you remember that keogh thing we spoke about well its come up and in another moment just two minutes ago yes and finally before putting the phone down good ill be expecting you after that there was nothing for darcy to do but wait for anderson to get there that and to suffer feelings of disgust selfloathing like his substance had devolved to so much quaking treacherous scum on the surface of a sucking swamp on the other hand well duty and conscience didnt mix not in his job darcys first duty was to the branch and he knew it his conscience would have to take a back seat maybe the necroscopes attitude had been too casual after all or he had been too sure of himself so ebranch couldnt discover the whereabouts of his wife and child so what they didnt have the mobius continuum to work with like a little kid refusing to let the other kids play with his ball nyahh nyahh nyahh or too possessive and much too pleased with himself that he had a ball in the first place but as the saying goes what goes around comes around and just like the little kid harry had discovered that you cant play the game on your own especially not hideand seek brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i from his rambling old house outside bonnyrig he called darcy clarke and poured out his frustrations but darcy could only tell him what he already knew else ebranch would have contacted him first we havent even the foggiest idea where they could be harry its like theyve vanished off the face of the earth a month five weeks harry looked at the telephone like he didnt believe what he was hearing youve been on it for five weeks and nothing what ebranch with your locators and your hunchmen your seers and scryers and precogs you havent the foggiest idea which got darcys back up more than a little what are you trying to say harry he snapped that you dont think were trying hard enough that you dont believe were looking for them is that it well start getting it together and believe this that we have as much interest in the kid as you have if not for the same reasons and while harry didnt much like that last still he knew it must be true of course ebranch wanted to find harry jr just because his father had turned them down that didnt mean the child would when it was his turn but maybe darcy realized hed said too much and harry his tone of voice was more even now i dont want to fight with you i mean christ we shouldnt be fighting we are looking for them you know we are and i was wrong to fly off the handle like that what i said wasnt what i meant to say but you did say it harry answered and he was quieter too my son the next ebranch dupe what when hes fifteen sixteen and while youre waiting youll be stood off in the background watching him grow up measuring his skills letting him develop or will you step in before then recruit him like i was recruited by showing him all the worlds evil and telling him that with him on the team ebranch will have the power to change all that and what then darcy will he be the one who ends up slopping out all of those mental sewers oh really not if i can help it and not if can help it harry darcys voice was pleading now look youre not yourself or you wouldnt be talking like this and i really didnt mean it the way it sounded you want my word on it youve got it well never interfere with your son or his way of life but harry the fact is that none of us will ever have anything to do with him if we cant find him and at the moment we cant the necroscope was silent for a while then said but you will keep trying of course we will well thanks for that at least and harry put the phone down down by the river bank where the water swirled and eddied in a small bight harry spoke to his ma it was the first time since the day hed come up here almost three weeks ago after selling off his flat in hartlepool and the necroscopes mother was beginning to feel neglected but his mind had been troubled oh for a long time and like any mother shed sensed it so despite that she could speak to him anywhere any time she hadnt intruded and anyway she knew how he liked to visit the people he talked to it was the middle of april blustery but at least dry and harry was wearing his overcoat where he sat at the rivers rim but you ii probably catch your death anyway she told him feeling the cold breeze in his hair and scanning the blurred grey mirror images of clouds scudding in the river as seen through his eyes of course its no day to be out harry she was down there in the mud and the weeds her spirit at least and probably her bones too even if the rest of her was long washed away but typical of a ma even though mary keogh no longer felt the cold for herself she was still able to feel it for her son im okay harry told her no youre not but she wasnt ready to push it not yet at least and because he didnt seem ready to speak well how are things with the world harry the rest of the world i mean he recognized the ploy to take his mind off his own problems by getting him to relate the troubles of the world in general now that the dead were all linked up and talking to each other from their graves and various resting places they could get the news from recent arrivals of course but through the medium of the necroscope it was that much more immediate they could see it and perhaps even feel something of it if not actually experience it harry was their one link with the living and on this occasion especially he went along with it for his ma was right andhe wasnt okay not that there was much of good news do you really want to know is it that bad well it isnt wonderful he pulled a face youll have to judge for yourself and recalling a recent newscast most of africa is in turmoil zambia and rhodesia mogadishu somalia ethiopia white supremacy looks to be on its way out in rhodesia where theyve just voted for black rule but isnt that just right arent all men born equal again his shrug as long as the recently equal are happy to remain equal mean as long as they dont want to be more equal i suppose its okay and quickly so as to radically change the subject before she could start protesting or moralizing and theres been an atomic meltdown at a place called three mile island in the united states its a power station oh something melted is it that important harry had to grin when his ma had died nuclear power was fairly new industrially at least its pretty important yes dangerous stuff it brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i kills people ma an unpleasant invisible silent death the grin was gone now from his face and his ma knew why she had gathered the rest of it the seething horror of it from his mind and he felt her incorporeal shudder what else she said well theres been some pretty terrible stuff coming out of cambodia but but harry couldnt possibly talk about that not to his ma he at once bit his tongue and blanked his mind wondering where in hell his thoughts could have been wandering that hed ever mentioned it maybe it was because of the way she his ma had died but reading about that deathlake in stung treng had given the necroscope nightmares those two thousand bodies tied together with ropes and weighted with stones she had caught on from his first mention of cambodia however and quietly said oh dont worry harry for we know all about that and as for pol pot well hell have to come to us too you know in the end but he can have no idea whats waiting for him down here whats waiting for him harry had never thought of the dead as being especially vengeful after all what could they do well without that he harry keogh the necroscope was their motivation do his ma at once answered well do nothing say nothing have nothing at all to do not with him and hell be so cold lost and lonely it will be as though he has no existence not even this kind of existence whatsoever and eventually he wont have hell simply fade away into nothing but he will know why for a moment harry felt the icy chill of her words the coldness of outer space the blackness of inner earth as if it had entered into his soul but it quickly passed and she was warm again strange but of all harrys dead people she was the only one who ever felt warm or maybe not so strange she was his ma after all so thats it then he said after a while and shrugged oh theres other stuff but maybe it wasnt such a good idea to tell you what was happening in the world after all i mean when you think about it that meltdown at three mile island is probably the least of our worries and she was glad to change the subject too but if this meltdown is so dangerous then why did they do it what but it was an accident ma they didnt do it on purpose oh then i suppose it cant be helped can it but her laughter quickly died away and it was time to be serious again so in fact nothing is very much different from what it always was men go on making mistakes and i dont suppose theres much help for that but now youve got to tell me what can be helped harry tell me how i can help and more especially how i can help you so finally the necroscopes beloved mother his frequently omniscient ma where he was concerned anyway had got to the point she sensed it when his shoulders slumped a little just before he sighed and told her i havent found them yet ma brenda and my baby son oh there are a million places ive not even thought to look yet i know but that seems a million too many to even know where to start for a while she was silent then quietly said do you want me to ask among the dead harry i mean do you think its possible that harry scarcely dared question her on the subject but knew he must surely not ma he said almost pleadingly if that was the case wouldnt you have known by now if they were not necessarily son she said it depends where and when i mean if it were you wed know be sure and no matter where or when for theres only one necroscope well two now and wed know it at once if your light went out but death is generally a common affair someone is born lives and dies inevitably brenda is brenda just another ordinary person another life and if she were to die in some far place well that could take some little time to get back to me and your grandson harry jr is he just another ordinary person i dont think so and not just because hes your grandson he knows about you you know about him wouldnt the great majority know it if his light was extinguished too but you have been with us for some time harry she reminded him and the great majority didnt know about you either at first why they didnt even know about each other until you came on the scene oh i knew you were different but then i was your mother but believe me it took quite a while to convince the rest finally they believed how could it be otherwise they felt your warmth as you passed close by they heard your dreaming and sensed you trembling when you were afraid in those days of your childhood they sprang to champion you little did they know that one day you would be the champion of the dead you mean they dont know him yet he hasnt been around long enough but in hartlepool that time what a year and half ago they even came up out of their graves for him for both of you harry oh harry jr called them up but who did they come to save isnt he warm then like me hes warm yes and the dead feel him like a small kindly flame but he isnt the light in their darkness like you one day maybe but not yet you wont know it then if he dies it wasnt a question but a statement and in a way harry was glad he wouldnt want to be appraised of his sons death nor of brendas ever neither by the living nor the dead would know it sooner or later his mother told him but right now i can promise you this much at least nothing of that nature has brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i reached me yet to my knowledge they are still among the living harry breathed a sigh of relief if his mother said it was so then it was so and in all truth that had only been a very small fear anyway he had known been sure that his wife and son were alive somewhere but where his ma heard his silent query and asked him where would you go harry if you wanted to hide yourself away where would brenda go surely you knew something of her secrets her fantasies her dreams suddenly the necroscope realized how selfish he must seem because he hadnt been thinking of it from his wifes point of view not really but his own and now his mother in her way had brought it home to him that brenda was a person in her own right with her own secrets fantasies dreams with feelings and emotions and passions all of them damaged now or contaminated by contact with harrys world until she had only wanted to hide herself away from it but thats not what i meant son his ma told him you know it isnt it was simply my my manner of expression except harry knew that speaking to the dead often conveys more than is actually said so maybe hed read something of his mas true thoughts after all and certainly she had touched a raw nerve in him perhaps deliberately ah but she had a way of bringing things into perspective his mother and ways of bringing him into line but at the same time her approach to his problem had set the necroscope thinking for of course brenda was different a person in her own right with her own ways of thinking her own likes and dislikes so that now harry wondered where would she be likely to hide herself away if hiding as such had seemed the only course open to her she had never been much of a one for the sun but always enjoyed the rain shed loved gardens the wind in her hair dramatic misted landscapes to sit in a windowseat in their garret flat and listen to the rain on the tiles that had been one of her favourite things in which case harrys ma chimed in this place would seem entirely suited to her purpose this very place she never even saw this place he shook his head but a place like this one maybe maybe not certain coastlines seemed to appeal to her rugged cliffs and rainy skies and any garden but more especially a garden with a coiner run wild long grasses wild flowers and a place where she could lie on her back and watch the clouds and the stars the brighter the better she didnt know a single constellation but she liked them anyway a place of wildness a wilderness and a lot of stars in the clear night sky that would suit her perfectly youre a poet and you dont know it his ma rhymed i wonder where i get it harry said and she sensed that his mood was lifting a little think its about time you started checking on those million places she told him for after all we must have narrowed them down a little by now and harry agreed they little thought or could ever have guessed that brenda and harry jr were in just such a place as the necroscopes ma had suggested which her query had brought into vivid definition in his mind a place of dramatic scenery however alien of long misted nights slanting sunlit days long grasses and wild flowers and a garden quite beyond brendas previous expectations her mundane imagination for the fact was that at this point of time it was beyond even the necroscopes imagination too and would stay that way long after hed given up any real hope of finding them but for now first harry reconsidered the places hed already checked out starting with brendas old home with her folks in harden a colliery village on the northeast coast the mine itself had been worked out and shut down for some time now so that the place had seemed even more soulless than before but the people were there as always of course if brenda or the baby were really trying to avoid him if they were actually hiding themselves away from him which he was forced to believe was true then this would be the last place theyd go harry had known that from the start but still he had looked what hed found had made him more miserable yet he couldnt simply approach brendas people as in the old days for he was no longer him what go to them and tell them he was harry keogh and try to explain theyd never accept any of that these saltoftheearth and very much down to earth northeast folks instead hed approached brendas father in his local pub introducing himself as a friend of harrys and asking what had become of him which had had a mixed result to make a long story short brenda and harry had got married and there was a child eighteen months ago shed taken the baby to london to join her husband he was working there writing a book or something she was always very quiet about his work nothing strange about that she was probably a bit ashamed that he didnt have a proper job what harry keogh why he hadnt done a stroke since leaving school not physical work anyway but whatever he did writing or whatever he must be doing all right shed never been short of money but then just a few weeks ago shed written to say that she was taking the baby abroad somewhere and that was maybe a funny thing for she hadnt mentioned her husband just herself and the baby still shed hinted often enough that harry did some kind of hushhush job with the government maybe that was it they must have gone off somewhere overseas to some embassy or other maybe the writing hadnt worked out so he was wearing his other hat now maybe the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i government had given him a job as one of these special couriers or something someone who carries important documents or goods from country to country or perhaps the writing had worked out after all and all of this was a tax dodge except well brenda should write more often that last letter had been what all of five or six weeks ago and they were her parents after all in short they were obviously worried about her no less in their way than harry himself and equally obvious it wasnt a putup job brenda wasnt with them and they really didnt know her whereabouts he got the same story from all of her old friends so harden was out she simply wasnt there and no one knew where she was then another thought had occurred and one that really was worrying the necroscope had given the russian ebranch a hard time of it in the last two and a half years theyd lost three heads of branch over that same period and seen their hq outside moscow reduced to so much rubble what if this thing with his wife and baby was something they had been engineering ever since harrys showdown with boris dragosani what if they knew that he harry keogh was alive despite that his body his original body was dead if anyone was likely to have that information it had to be the worlds espionage organizations the oppositions top telepath zek foener had known it definitely and following the destruction of the chateau bronnitsy harry had let her go free could zek have told them and had they then taken brenda and the baby in order to facilitate the coercion of the necroscope himself but no a large part of that didnt make sense hed been incorporeal following his fight with dragosani and no one in the world would have believed that hed ever be back not even harry himself but on the other hand part of it did make sense right at the end of it up in the khorvaty region of the eastern carpathians zek foener had known that he was back so she could have given him away after all which would mean that her russian superiors had put this thing together all in the space of what eighteen months even after hed decimated their ebranch no way he hadnt left the soviets nearly enough machinery to bring it into being which meant it had to be another dead end and in a way the necroscope was glad he would hate to have to blame this on zek foener partly because he had genuinely liked her but mainly because his last words to her had been a warning never to come up against him or his again if a threat carries no weight then it isnt a threat but this way he wouldnt have to enforce it so where had brenda ever been that she might want to return to nowhere to mention where had she ever expressed a yearning to go again nowhere since their early teens shed only ever wanted to be with harry and he hadnt been the most responsive of sweethearts either indeed hed asked himself a hundred times if he really loved her or if she was just some kind of habit she had never known his uncertainty he hadnt been able to tell her because she herself had been so absolutely sure but now he despised himself for it anyway but on the other hand how do you tell someone who has loved you for so long as long as you can remember that you just arent sure of your own feelings not so easy and a lot harder when shes pregnant with your child misted landscapes dramatic scenery cliff paths and gardens grown wild and starry skies it brought a certain picture to mind but of what high passes and mountain peaks and stars like chips of ice glinting on high and a plain of boulders stretching away to a far northern horizon under the weave of ghostly auroras the picture came and went like like an invention of his own imagination it had to be for he had certainly never visited such a place but in any case it was already fading melting into unreality like a fantastic dreamscape which was probably as good an explanation as any that in trying to visualize brendas ideal habitat hed evoked a leftover from some old dream not so old in fact indeed so new that the actual fact of it its basis in reality was yet to happen but the necroscope couldnt know that and in the space of just a second or so the picture had faded entirely the future was ever a jealous place a million places hell no there were a million million places since brenda had never been anywhere or done anything very much she could literally be anywhere doing anything but the northeast coast was where shed been born and grown up and it still had to be the best bet harry had tried all the towns and villages between harden and hartlepool and had then backtracked all the way to sunderland and durham city to no avail but he had been surprised how many small villages there were that hed never heard of or visited before and how easy it was to try to find a lost someone albeit hopelessly housing and building societies hotels and flats and bedsits and temporary accommodations these were the obvious places to check brenda had to be living somewhere had to have a roof over her head she wasnt registered at any of the agencies the dozen or so girls with small babies who were registered werent brenda and harry wasnt greatly surprised but hed had to try anyway somewhere abroad that letter she wrote to her father had said she was going abroad hence the million million places for if there were a couple of hundred towns in the northeast that the necroscope had never r brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i visited and five thousand in the rest of england then what of the rest of the world somewhere abroad a garden in a fertile saddle between ruggedly weathered spurs where dusty beams of sunlight came slanting through the high passes during the long daylight hours and the stars glittered like frosted jewels at night or iceshards suspended in the warp and weave of ghostly auroras the northernmost of the north american states canada the frozen tundras of the northern soviet union switzerland did they even see the aurora borealis in switzerland and why the northern lights anyway but brenda was a british girl naive in most things even in her native country even in her native county and as the necroscope rubbished his own inward directed queries so that fleeting picture of some far alien land once more retreated which was just as well for search as he might he would never discover it on earth never find them never find his baby son never even see them again not on earth harry started awake in a cold sweat in his bedroom in the old house not far from bonnyrig a sweat of fear and frustration yes and a feeling of utter loneliness he lay panting in his bed damp with perspiration feeling his heart racing and his blood pumping so that for a few brief moments it wasnt as if brenda and the baby were missing at all but simply that that he was the lost one and of course the genuine harry keogh the original harry was lost that again his body gone and piece by piece his entire world going too was that why he had to find brenda in order to find himself in which case his search was useless for she would only deny him fuck it that was why shed run away in the first place because he wasnt him shed run or been taken away by the baby or by someone else the russians but hed already been over that and it seemed very unlikely so if not the opposition the muchravaged soviet ebranch then who as his sweat dried on him so harrys thoughts cleared and his mind seemed to sharpen and focus as he hadnt been able to focus it for quite some time he went right back to square one to that night at ebranch hq when hed first been told that his wife was missing at the time he had put aside the possibility that ac doyle jamieson selfstyled werewolf could have been responsible for the double disappearance but now the man had been into his mind after all but for how long harry had become his enemy the moment he became involved with the dead police officers and took up their case had a c been listening to him to his thoughts and worries and problems from that time on in which case he would know about brenda harrys one weakness but surely if that were the case he and his gang of car thieves were responsible for brendas disappearance then right at the end when ac himself had come under fire he would have used her as a threat to stand harry off yes of course he would but he hadnt so so damn it to hell it was another blind alley after speaking to his ma hed come back to the house full of resolve and now it was almost burned out of him again but while his mind was sharp he must pursue the problem it was so frustrating to be equipped with his powers the powers of a necroscope and no way to use them to solve his problem except by trial and error he got up from the bed feeling stiff this damned body of his which wasnt nearly as flexible as it had used to be because it was a different one naturally or unnaturally the light coming through flyspecked windows was grey as the day outside he had been down only an hour or two an hour or two wasted down and out wilting going to seed oh really and suddenly harry was angry with himself he had to shake himself out of it and get on with the search get on with life he was ten years older than he should be sure but he didnt have to settle for that did he his mind was still in shape wasnt it and the mind governs the body doesnt it well then hed have to get the fucking body in shape too he was dressed he went out into his overgrown garden and did twenty furious pressups then felt ridiculous and sat hugging his knees in the deep grass and shivering from the difference in temperature between the house and the garden and in a while he thought my mas right ill catch my death death yes always a close companion of harrys death wasnt something he worried about not from a distance anyway close up it would be different of course if ever death should attempt his stealthy approach then like anyone else harry would be galvanized to life but as for the idea of death and the dead themselves he knew no fear indeed he had a thousand dead friends but not one of them who could help him now not this time while among the living did he have any friends at all well some like darcy clarke and his people but even they werent like the dead because the dead were true friends and rarely demanded payment as for the exceptions to the rule the one or two monstrous members of the great majority who had demanded payment but they were in the necroscopes past now and couldnt resurface at least he prayed not it was a morbid train of thought which he tried to break by numbering his friends among the living these were a handful at best necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley no not even that for he couldnt any longer approach them as harry keogh they would know that he wasnt depression was that it probably and harry thought believed in psychiatry i might even go and see a shrink but if he started to explore my past how could i explain it hed be certain was incurably insane or if i liked strong drink i might go and get drunk and see how i felt when i woke up except i wouldnt know where to go to drink and id probably feel out of place when i got there but damn it i really feel like i could use a good stiff drink and a talk with a genuine friend yet i have no one to talk to but the teeming dead and theyre the only ones who give a damn anyway a morbid train of thought yes but now the entire chain of his thoughts ever since hed started awake in a cold sweat began to join up link upon link and there was one missing link which was integral to the rest he hadnt thought of it until now because it had seemed wrong especially when he was searching or trying to search for his wife and child but there might be something in it at that initials writhed on the screen of harrys mind not ac doyle jamieson and his brother rl stevensons initials but someone elses someone the necroscope had studiously avoided thinking of until now but now maybe he did have a friend among the living after all or someone who owed him at least and maybe just maybe it went a lot deeper than that for one thing the time frame was right the disappearance of his wife and child had coincided precisely with this ones advent and since that was true mightnt there be a more relevant more sinister connection psychiatry maybe that was the last thing harry needed maybe all he needed was a rest from all of this even from thinking about it or a change didnt they say that a change was as good as a rest have a good stiff drink and sleep it off sleep it right out of his system clear the air christ he needed a drink or was it simply his body or somebody elses body that needed it but the mind controls the body doesnt it well yes it does except when the body has habits or needs that control the mind suddenly things clicked into place in the necroscopes metaphysical his lateralthinking mind but his mind in anothers body and a little shakily shaky with realization albeit as yet unproven he went back into the house to the telephone darcy clarke was at ebranch and he at once sensed something of the excitement in harrys voice and in answer to the necroscopes question what alec kyle what did he do when he was under pressure darcy said well he would just ride it out harry when there was work to be done or a problem to be solved hed work at it all the way until hed covered every angle almost to the point of exhaustion and after that what did he do for relaxation well im not sure if i should mention this you know i mean speaking ill of the dead and all that but did he like a drink finally harry forced the issue and darcys answer lit up his mind like the crack of dawn on a summer day did alec like a drink did he ever when he was wound up so tight it was the only way to unwind then he would drink yes usually at home because there he wasnt risking anything and he didnt have so far to fall into bed i remember one time he invited me round to his place and between us we killed a big bottle of jack daniels i stayed over because i knew i wasnt going to make it to anywhere else and i paid for it for three whole days but alec was just fine that body of his could soak up hard liquor like a sponge he wasnt an alcoholic was he god no once in a blue moon thats all but when he did it alec did it right thanks harry breathed and put the phone down and now he knew knew how to be himself again by not being himself feelings of illicit attraction chemistry thats all alec kyles chemistry and the need to have a good stiff drink following a period of prolonged stress again chemistry the exprecogs body doing its own thing or rather the thing it had used to do and there stood harry smack dab in the middle firm in his determination to get used to his new body without giving a moments thought to the fact that it must get used to him so maybe a night on the town wasnt such a bad idea after all maybe then hed be able to get it all going get body and mind working together and figure something out and come to think of it he did know where to go to get a drink and probably a free one at that she owed him that much at least alec kyles personal body chemistry illicit attraction sheer loneliness maybe it was all of these things and initials certainly bjs necroscope the lost years vol i ii bjs it was pm and just as grey in london as in edinburgh and even darker for darcy clarke who had been sitting at his desk for the last hour ever since the necroscope called him still feeling bad about things in general and wondering what the hell this latest thing was all about alec kyles personal habits especially the fact that hed liked a drink now and then what in the world could that have to do with harrys search for his wife and baby son answer nothing which meant that harry was still dealing with the same basic problem still getting used to the fact of his new body and as if that werent enough darcy thought had to go and fuck about inside his head or get someone to do it for me anyway the had to part was the only tiling that let darcy live with it the fact that ebranch and the security of the people the country came first above all other considerations but it had been inevitable from the moment the necroscope had let him know that he would probably be moving on then even hating it darcy had been obliged to set the thing in motion but all the time hed been hoping against hope that it would never have to be brought into being and hed kept right on hoping until the moment harry had said he was through definitely from then on it had all been down to doctor james anderson whose business address was a consulting room and a highly rewarding practice in prestigious harley street one hell of a step up for a man who only three years ago had been working the nightclub circuits as a stage hypnotist but ebranch had found and elevated him which was about the same as saying that they owned him and certainly he owed them that was why hed come in that night a halfhour after darcy called for him and why he had done what hed done sinister but in a way it might be argued that everything ebranch did had sinister implications for someone except this time it was being done to a friend and that was what bothered darcy the most that this time the department of dirty tricks had come down on harry keogh yet for all that darcy felt guilty about this thing the fact was that he hadnt initiated it that had come from much higher up from a grey almost anonymous entity known only as the branchs minister responsible it had been darcys duty merely to let the minister know how things stood and the ministers to order counter measures and they could very easily have been much harsher measures except hed been able to advise in that respect too so harry had suffered a degree of minor or maybe not so minor interference so what he was still functioning wasnt he darcy gave a small shudder as he put what might have been to the back of his mind as for why it had had to be done harry keogh was potentially the most powerful force in the world for good or evil he was the necroscope and sir keenan gormley had spotted him almost from scratch and homed in on him with unerring instinct recruiting him to ebranch but if sir keenan had discovered him so to speak couldnt a far less friendly agency just as easily find him for example the russians by now they must be keenly interested in harrys kind of esp it was a weapon he had used against them to devastating effect even though harry himself was or might appear to be dead and gone still the attention of all surviving members of the soviet esporganization would be riveted upon their british counterparts every move from this time on it was even possible that the russians already knew about british ebranchs new necroscope and wouldnt that be causing them some concern what the exhead of branch alec kyle back in business not braindead or physically dead and blown to bits along with the chateau bronnitsy but alive and well and living in england not drained of all intelligence on a slab in some necromantic espexperiment or pulped in a holocaust of almighty proportions but sound as a bell and consorting with his old colleagues in london good god by now theyd probably be thinking that every englishman was indestructible and theyd be wanting to know why and how darcy found himself grinning at his own flight of fancy but of all men he knew that there had never been so fanciful a flight as that of harry keogh necroscope and the grin died on his face as he considered other possibilities assuming that the russians knew nothing that they were still recovering from the necroscopes onslaught still there were other espagencies in the world and harry could conceivably fall into their hands and not only mindspies but crime syndicates and terrorist organizations too what a thief hed make what an assassin or terrorist brian luraley necroscope the lost years vol i barriers borders and brick walls couldnt stop him he could disappear almost at will the teeming dead were in his debt and would go to any lengths literally to advise and protect him and all the knowledge of earth had gone down into the soil or up into the air where it was written like lore in some mighty volume in an infinite encyclopedia for harry to open and read if he had the time but he didnt because of his search oh yes harry would be invaluable in the hands of any one of a score of criminal elements and it was still possible that his wife and childs disappearance was connected in some way to just such an organization which was why the branch was indeed working flat out to discover their whereabouts oh they were doing it for harry too who had done so much for them and for the world but they were also doing it for themselves for the common good and it was for that same common cause that darcy had called in doctor james anderson anderson was the best the very best there was a hypnotist without peer in all the land as far as was known working without anaesthetics on patients lulled to a painless immunity under the weird spell of andersons eyes and systems surgeons had carried out the most delicate operations women had given effortless birth in exceptionally awkward circumstances mentally traumatized and schizoid cases had shed their delusions and extraneous personalities to emerge whole and one from his healing gaze and far more importantly where darcy was concerned anderson was a master of the posthypnotic command darcy remembered how it had gone that night by the time they had entered harrys room using a master key the necroscope had been dead to the world and probably to the dead too the drug darcy had given him had been a sleeping pill but a pill with a difference distilled from the oriental yellow poppy and as such an opiate the principal active ingredient had the effect of opening the mind of the subject to hypnotic suggestion while he slept on the hypnotist would then insert himself into the subjects dreams his subconscious mind implanting those commands which the subject would act upon and accept as routine long after the drug had dispersed and he was awake darcy had obtained the pills from anderson who used them when he was treating mental cases not that harry was a mental case but it had provided an easy method of bringing him under andersons control without the necroscope himself knowing what was happening since he wasnt a patient as such it was imperative that he did not know what was happening for rather than being a curative treatment this was to be preventative darcy had been present throughout and remembered the entire thing in detail especially he remembered his only partly covert his almost suspicious examination of anderson himself the way hed considered the hypnotists attitude to be far too relaxed too casual well in the light of what he was doing and who he was working on didnt he know who this man was but then hed had to remind himself no of course anderson didnt know who or what harry was he was only doing what hed been asked to do anderson was young maybe thirtyfive or six years old tall and goodlooking in a darkly humourless sort of way or perhaps more attractive than goodlooking but maybe that was residual of his stage days when hed used to portray himself as some inscrutable deity of inner mind if so then hed succeeded very well indeed with his higharching eyebrows full sensual lips that seemed too full and sensuous against the pallor of his face and the sunken orbits of his eyes dark as from countless sleepless nights why only give him a pair of horns and anderson would be the very epitome of the devil a handsome devil yes his hair was a shiny black swept back and darcy suspected lacquered into place his chin was narrow almost pointed and sported a small neatly trimmed goatee his sideburns were angled to sharp points midway between the lobes of his small flat ears and the corners of his mouth and as if to underline or emphasize his looks he wore a cloak which to darcys mind was about as theatrical as you could get andersons eyes of course were huge black and hypnotic and his voice was velvet inside harrys room the doctor had wasted no time darcy remembered how it had been first anderson sitting by the necroscopes bed and lifting each of his eyelids in turn to check the dilation of his eyes then when harrys eyes stayed glassily open the classic technique a crystal pendant swinging on a chain and the doctors soft smoothly insistent voice commanding harry that he watch the lights the sparkle the heart of the crystal feel the heartbeat as the crystal swings to and fro and match it with your own then andersons hand seeking and checking the pulse in the necroscopes wrist his nod of approval and the pendulums swing gradually slowing as the doctors marvellous voice continued harry you can close your eyes and sleep now you are asleep you are asleep but you will continue to hear me i am your heartbeat your mind your very life and soul i control you i am you and because we are one you will obey me you will obey you for i am you we are one and were asleep but we hear our mind speaking to us and we obey can you hear me harry if you can hear me you may nod the necroscope had closed his eyes at andersons command as he slowly nodded his head so darcy had found himself holding his breath harry keogh you are a rare man with rare powers you are a man with rare powers rare powers yes did you know that that youre a man with rare and wonderful powers anderson hadnt known necroscope the lost years vol brian lumley what harrys rare powers were only that he was following darcy clarkes instructions and again the necroscopes nod if others knew of your powers they would want the use of them others might want the use of these strange powers others might even use them against us to harm you and me and the ones we love do you understand now listen anderson had leaned closer to the man in the bed his voice more deep and sonorous yet we can only be safe so long as others know nothing of our powers we are safe only so long as we protect our powers others must never know what we can do we must never speak of our powers you must never ever mention your powers to anyone you must never disclose them to anyone you must never display them to anyone do you understand harrys slow uncertain nod you may use your powers as is your right harry but you may never speak of them or display them or otherwise disclose them to others you may never ever speak of them or disclose or display them to others no matter what the provocation not even under the stress of extreme pain or torture do you understand now listen harry you are still you but am no longer you this is someone new speaking to you someone you dont know you dont know me but you can hear me if you can hear me say yes harrys head had commenced its almost robotic mechanical nod but now it paused stiffened into immobility and his mouth fell open his tongue wriggled a moment in the cave of his mouth then stuttered y ye yes good now then my friend my good friend ive heard it said that you have amazing powers is this true answer me the necroscope said nothing but his face grew pale his eyelids fluttered and his tongue wobbled wildly which was the point where darcy had begun to wish hed never set this in motion except the possible alternative had been unthinkable lets be reasonable andersons oh so persuasive voice had droned on lets have a normal conversation harry your throat is no longer dry your mouth is salivating your tongue is freed and you can talk normally lets talk normally shall we now what is all this about these powers of yours you can trust me harry tell me about them at that the necroscope had seemed to relax a little his eyelids had stopped fluttering his mouth closed as he licked his lips his adams apple bobbed as he moistened his throat then powers he said enquiringly whose powers you have me at a disadvantage im afraid i dont know you or what youre talking about at which darcy had grinned for this was more like it harry didnt seem uncomfortable any more indeed he was having a normal conversation and he was lying his head off anderson had glanced at darcy nodded and said he was a difficult subject i know its hard to believe that it looked very easy but youll just have to take my word for it he was hard to get into and i could feel him fighting me i always know when they are fighting me for i get these terrible headaches he used a handkerchief to pat several beads of sweat from his forehead and you can believe me ive got a beauty right now but lets put it to the ultimate test eh he knows you right he knows you for a good and trustworthy friend so why dont you ask him about these wonderful powers of his what darcy had been taken by surprise just like that i can talk to him while hes under and wait anderson had told him and turned back to the necroscope harry you have a friend here darcy clarke darcy wants to speak to you harry and you will talk to him just as you have spoken to me a perfectly normal conversation do you understand of course harry had answered a halfsmile forming on his sleeping face and without pause hows it going darcy for a moment darcy had been taken aback he hadnt quite known what to say then words had formed and hed said its all going well harry and you oh soso better when i know about brenda and the baby i mean when i know theyre okay it was the lead darcy had been looking for sure and as the necroscope i mean with your powers and all it wont take too long right harrys eyes had stayed closed but hed cocked his head inquiringly on one side eh hed finally answered frowning and it seems everyone is determined to talk in riddles today look i hate to rush off like this but im you know busy do you mind and with that hed rolled over in his bed turning his back on both of them at which anderson had grasped darcys elbow saying not even you you see he wont even talk to you about it whatever it is well so far so good but now id like to hammer the point home i want to reinforce it and make absolutely certain that my posthypnotic command is in place except i warn you this is very repetitious stuff im afraid i may bore you to death or if not that i might certainly put you to sleep too andersons success had pleased him making him seem more warm and human darcy had stayed however and seen it out to the end and anderson had been right it was repetitious and boring so that by the time he was done darcy was indeed yawning and now he can sleep it off the doctor had told darcy as they turned off the light and let themselves out of harrys room necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley then in his office darcy had asked what next is there anything else i should do im having breakfast with harry tomorrow morning anderson had shrugged hell probably seem a little confused reluctant whatever this big secret of keoghs is all of your ebranch agents presumably know about it its simply that youre keeping it from the outside world right thats right darcy had nodded his agreement we know about it and harry knows we know hence the confusion anderson had finished for him if i were you i wouldnt test it dont even bring it up or if you must then have someone else test it some stranger but well away from this place and darcy had seen the sense in that and is that all nothing else i should know anderson had looked at him pursed his full lips said hes no longer one of yours thats right hes moving on he has things to do but why do you ask is it important again andersons shrug there may be i dont know side effects but before darcy could show his alarm i mean ive been into his mind or not into it but i have opened it up a little in some people the mind is like a door with rusty hinges and as i told you harrys door was damned near welded shut so i applied a little oil you see its not simply the drugs and my eyes and my voice darcy its also my mind no im not an esper like you and yours but im special in my own way just the same i mean i can put certain people under just by snapping my fingers but harry wasnt one of them he was difficult except now that ive oiled his hinges so to speak well he could be easier the next time the next time if someone did get hold of keogh its possible just possible mind you that theyd be able to get into his mind as easily as i seemed to they could undo what youve done ah no i didnt say that anderson had held up a cautionary finger what ive done is done and as far as i know only i can break it but the rest of harrys mind might now be more accessible he might more readily give in to hypnotic suggestion however thats a pretty big might i shouldnt worry about it if i were you but in fact darcy clarke hadnt stopped worrying about it ever since for close on five weeks it was a terrible idea a fearful concept to have someone break into a mans id into him without his knowing it to weaken him in ways he wasnt even aware of then leave the doors of his mind flapping helplessly to and fro in the wind of some future mental intrusion not that it was really as bad as all that darcy told himself returning to the present he was simply overdramatizing again thats all it wasnt as if the necroscope was likely to come up against another hypnotist now was it but still it wasnt the sort of thing darcy clarke himself would ever want to happen to him not likely and of course it couldnt ever happen to him not as long as his guardian angel talent was watching over him on one of the last two counts darcy was quite wrong and on the other he wasnt quite right but then he wasnt a precog which was perhaps just as well that same night harry took the mobius route into the heart of edinburgh and hailed a taxi it was raining and he didnt want to walk and anyway he wouldnt know where to go for bjs wasnt in the book but his taxi driver should know it bjs he told the man who turned looked back at him and shook his head sadly theres a lot cheaper places tae get pissed chief if ye must he said but the booze in they damn wine bars costs a pretty penny aye he was a canny scot obviously thanks for the advice harry told him but bj s will do as ye say the other shrugged ah expec its the young lassies aye and they headed for bjs the necroscope quickly got himself lost as the taxi turned right off princes street into a maze of alleys and the looming grey bulk of edinburgh castle his principal landmark vanished into a rain blurred sky behind the complex and merging silhouettes of shiny rooftops and arching causeways the echoing canyon walls of bleakly uninteresting almost subterranean streets and alleys sped by on both sides and between squealing nerverending swipes of the windscreen blades harry could look ahead and see a pale glow of city lights reflected on the undersides of lowering clouds time seemed suspended he might even have dozed a little in the mustysmelling back seat but eventually bjs the driver grunted bringing his taxi to a halt in a narrow street of threestorey buildings whose shopfront fagades were built onto or extended from the old brickwork of a gently curving victorian terrace harry shook himself awake climbed stiffly out of the taxi and paid the fare then turned up his collar and looked up and down the street and as the taxi pulled away he saw that the area was more than a little rundown and shabby and hardly the place hed thought it would be it scarcely matched up to bj or what hed imagined of her but just what had he imagined of her what sort of place had he envisioned a low moorish dive but one with style on the fringe of some moroccan kasbah like a ricks cafe and casino magically transported from prewar casablanca what to edinburgh oh there were dives here necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley certainly likewise in london birmingham newcastle liverpool and leicester and in berlin moscow nicosia new york paris almost anywhere but as for style that was about as far as it went harry had no idea where he was his physical geographical location but he did know hed never have any trouble finding it again he had instinctively absorbed the feel of the place its aura its coordinates into his metaphysical mind from this time forward using the mobius continuum he would always be able to come here the rain came squalling slantwise the street was almost deserted it was too late for runofthemill shops and only one latenighter was lit at the far end of the street a chinese takeaway was open maybe halfway down also a pub opposite the restaurant letting out a little orange light from incongruous antique bullseye windows but where was bjs for a moment the necroscope thought his driver had simply dumped him at the end of the known world until he spotted the illuminated sign no bigger or brighter than a cinemas exit sign over a shaded door set back from the pavement between a shoe shop on the one hand and a fishandchip bar with a for sale sign in the whitewashed windows on the other the illuminated sign was in dull blue neon and simply said bj s harry moved into the shadow between the two shops making for the door but as he did so he sensed movement across the street turning his head he was barely in time to witness the brief electric glare of a cameras flash from a dark shop doorway directly opposite now what the hell someone taking a picture of him outside bj s but who could have known hed be coming here he hadnt known himself until this afternoon and he certainly hadnt told anyone he turned towards the street and made as if to cross and a slight bent figure came scurrying out of the shop doorway heading down the street towards the pub birdbright eyes under a widebrimmed hat glanced back at harry as the figure made off in a slap slap slap of leather on wet paving slabs harry wanted to get a better look at this one fixing the orange glow of the pubs smallpane windows in the eye of his mind he quickly stepped back into the shadows and conjured a mobius door and a moment later stepped out of the shadows of the pub into the street and headed back towards bj s the mysterious figure in the raincoat and widebrimmed hat came almost at a run saw the necroscope at the last moment and very nearly collided with him as the man swerved aside harry caught at his arms as if to steady him and so came eyetoeye with him however briefly briefly yes because even as harry stared at him so the small man displayed a surprising strength and wiriness wrenched himself furiously free and made off down the street again and this time harry let him go all five feet four or five of him watching him disappear out of sight down a side alley harry felt fairly certain hed never seen the man before and therefore that the stranger didnt know and couldnt possibly have recognized him as for harrys use of the mobius continuum the stranger would never believe that the man in front of bjs was the same one hed bumped into on the street just a moment later so nothing much for harry to concern himself over there but what was it all about was it some kind of threat something to worry over or was it simpler than that maybe darcy clarke had decided to have harry watched or watched over for his own good but if that was the case how had darcy known hed be going to bj s maybe the explanation was even simpler like someone was watching bjs for his own reasons or perhaps a private detective for someone elses reasons or the police what if bjs was a front for something else and what kind of a girl or woman was this bonnie jean anyway that she should go around shooting at men with a crossbow but that last was a question harry had asked himself many times before it was one of the several reasons he was here to find out if there was any connection between bj and brendas disappearance walking thoughtfully back to bjs in the rain he considered the face hed seen or that glimpse of a face before the what observer had wrenched himself free that face on the little man that startled face that had decided harry against any further action at this point it wasnt that hed felt afraid of the little man just surprised startled even as startled as the small observer himself but by what there are looks and there are looks and the little man had had one of those looks like a cornered rat and everyone knows that its best not to corner a rat such a look on the face of the little man had been enough to stall harry on this occasion anyway but if there should be a next time then he might want to know more approaching bjs he pictured that face again that wrinkled old face with its rheumy runny eyes at a distance hed thought of them as bright bird eyes but seen closeup they werent those oh sostrange threecornered eyes that one second looked grey and the next shone dull silver like an animals at night and the next turned grey again or maybe it was a trick of the street lights and the long heavily veined nose flanged at the tip and the toowide looselipped mouth in its thrusting aggressive jaws and overall the grey aged aspect of the face generally just a glimpse yes and not necessarily accurate but it had been sufficient to give him pause letting the picture gradually fade in the eye of his mind the necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley necroscope was satisfied that he wouldnt easily forget it indeed he might just ask bj about it about its owner anyway for if she was aware of the little man if shed ever seen him shed certainly know who harry was talking about it was just one of the several questions he had for her as for the questions she might have for him well hed do his best to avoid them so he told himself anyway the door was heavy and banded with metal and equipped with a buzzer a peephole and a speaker grille harry buzzed detected slight movements within and felt himself observed eventually a female voice asked are you a member sir if so hold up your card if not state your business obviously one of the clubs young lassies harry thought im not a member he answered i was invited by bonnie jean there was silence for a long moment thenwait harry seemed to wait an inordinately long time but when the door finally opened it was b j herself who stood holding it open for him and again harry wasnt certain what hed been expecting he had met her before yes but a lot had been happening at the time funny but the best picture he had of her was the one george jakes had given him a real looker tall slim slinky yet natural with it the shape in jakess dead mind had been that of lauren bacall in that old bogie movie where she says you know how to whistle dont you maybe eurasian she could be from the shape of her eyes like almonds and very slightly tilted and her hair bouncing on her shoulders seeming black as jet but grey in its sheen the ageless type anything from nineteen to thirtyfive but a looker oh yes and now the reality but still the necroscope couldnt see her clearly enough not in the dim light in the hallway inside the door on the other hand she could obviously see him so its mah brave laddie in person she breathed smiling at him wonderingly with her head on one side mah own wee man wi no name then she straightened up and was still two inches shorter than harry and maybe no so very wee at that but i was beginning to think id never see you again come in come in the hallway or corridor was wide highceilinged carpeted low music came from somewhere up ahead pop music harry thought late s or early s he quite enjoyed all that old stuff the corridor seemed a long one there were pictures on the walls large tapestries in gilt frames but there were no doors leading off to right or left a peculiar setup i know what youre thinking bj said leading the way i thought so myself the first time i saw it a fire hazard right aye well the authorities thought so too but in the event of fire god forbid there are escape routes enough at the back and out into the garden and we are on the ground floor after all i wasnt thinking about fire harry answered not looking where he was going and bumping into her where she paused at a fire door and sorry he said as she raised a querying perhaps amused eyebrow clumsy of me but you werent so clumsy the last time we met she answered with the hint of a frown in her voice indeed i might even say greased lightning if she was fishing for some kind of reaction she didnt get it harry merely shrugged and continued no i wasnt considering the fire risk i was just wondering why such a long corridor they were standing very close together he could smell her scented breath when she answered originally it was an alley between the buildings to right and left when the shop fagades were built at the front the alley was roofed over to give safe access to the property at the rear my place now her edinburgh burr had almost disappeared replaced by something harry didnt quite recognize downstairs is bjs she continued turning from him and pushing through the door upstairs is my living area and the garret is my bedroom harry followed her commenting when you answer a simple query you really do answer it in full dont you and giving him that look again well at least one o us does she replied and a little of the brogue was back then with a wave of her arm bjs she announced inside was definitely better than out shrugging out of his coat which a pretty girl in a notquite playboy outfit took to the cloakroom harry looked the place over there was a longish mahogany bar with access hatches at both ends behind which two more girls served drinks or would serve them presumably but at the moment there were only one or two customers and at the far end of the room another girl sat near the jukebox an original wurlitzer by its looks flipping the pages of a magazine a quiet night bonnie jean commented wryly as harry perched himself awkwardly on one of too many empty barstools and she went behind the bar to serve him its always the same when its raining there were two other customers at the bar one at each end where they nursed their drinks and chatted up the girls and a group of three seated at a table in a corner close to a darts board bjs clients were all over forty well turned out business types men with money anyway it looked like the taxi driver was right this wouldnt be a cheap place to drink harry continued to look the place over and decided its a converted holeinthewall pub and he was right bjs had been a fairly standard brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i if poorlyfrequented public house at one time the ancient pumps were still in place behind the bar and the oak ceiling beams were darkstained from genuine fire smoke the open fireplace itself was still there big enough to take a small table but the flue had been sealed when central heating replaced the warmth of a real fire that fireplace isnt victorian he said an awkward seeming statement almost an accusation but he was still finding his way getting used to the place and to bj to her presence or to his presence in her place she took pity on him and didnt smile but answered what he now saw as a dumb comment with a reasoned reply youre right this place isnt victorian it goes back a lot further two or three hundred years at least remember its set back from the modern stuff the terrace that fronts onto the street twenty years ago it got annexed to all of that almost by mistake when they started to convert the whole street on this side into some kind o shopping arcade but the builder went broke and it all fell through and a good thing too for this old building was here first more recently it was a pub but too out of the way when i bought it i couldnt afford to modernize it and now im glad and before he could make another stupid comment what the hell was it about this girl that so tangled his tongue harry wondered she went on this was once a huge living room why it took up most of the ground floor now its split in two by the wall behind this bar back there is a storage room an original kitchen modern toilets and access to the garden and the stairs whats the difference said harry eh she cocked her head and he admired the angle of her jaw but found that he couldnt look at her it was disconcerting he wanted to look at her but couldnt it was as though he was a schoolboy again his first fumbling approach to brenda that brought him up short what was this bonnie jean some kind of lorelei the difference she said oh he pulled himself together between a wine bar and a pub she nodded and smiled knowingly i hadna taken ye for a drinking man and it seems i was right but while were on that subject what would ye like hmmm to drink harry shrugged i dont know a short vodka gin whisky brandy rum you name it er brandy i think cognac courvoisier whatever you say no no no she laughed its what you say the man at the closest end of the bar had been listening to their conversation nov sneeringly he called out seems yeve got yoursel a real live one there bj he was short stocky and seemed to have no neck welldressed but uncomfortablelooking what a rough diamond a rough something certainly smiling along the bar at him the necroscope said a live one i guess i am for the time being the other didnt know what to make of that scowling he turned back to his girl and in a lowered voice bonnie jean said he chats me up from time to time the protective type you know she slid a glass of cognac in front of harry and said on the house i dont know your name its harry he told her harry keogh so what with him and me it seems youre well protected bonnie jean he sipped at his drink which hit him at once and in all the right spots so now he knew what alec kyles tipple had been what his bodys tipple still was b j she told him in here im just bj but she had known what he meant well enough and quickly went on i still owe you for that harry well you owe me an explanation at least he agreed and gave a shrug you know of a couple of small things but not here she replied not now and theres a good many things i dont know about you either harry knew a word game when he heard one and he was good at them yes but not here he said smiling not now astonishingly after just a sip or two the cognac was loosening him up but hed better not let it loosen him too fast or far and aware of her eyes on him finally he looked back at her and looked and drank her in finally he had her her picture had firmedup taken on life and she wasnt so much the looker that harry and george jakes had thought she might be but undeniably attractive yes even to the point of magnetic those eyes of hers their ohsoslight slant and their colour a deep penetrating hazel flecked with gold feral eyes her ears large but not obtrusive flat to her head and elflike with their pointed tips not quite hidden in the swirl and bounce of shining hair her nose tiptilted but by no means cute and her mouth too ample by far yet delicious in the curve of its bow as for her teeth the necroscope couldnt remember seeing teeth so perfect or so white but she had been studying him too funny eyes she said well not funny strange like someone else is looking out of them harry could have answered that one but he kept silent as she went on they look sort of sad compassionate and i dont know trustworthy but deep down maybe theyre a little cold too maybe youve been made cold harry have you led a strange life what have you been reading my palm he smiled his sad smile which was always a part of him and couldnt be changed not even by brian lumley alec kyles face maybe youve missed your calling bj maybe you should have been gypsy bonnie i fancy i might have come from gypsy stock at that she answered but how close was i really maybe too close he answered maybe right now youre too close showing feigned alarm she drew back a fraction oh and are ye big trouble harry i hope im not going to be he told her honestly and i hope youre not going to be i do need to talk to you bj she drew back more yet and meant it this time not away from harry but from the man who had spoken to him just a moment ago from the end of the bar he had finished his drink and now knocked a bar stool aside in his stumbling approach there was an unpleasant something on his face a question an accusation aimed at bj but intended for harry now he gave it voice is this creep botherin ye hon and harry thought protective more the possessive type id have thought and seeing the ugly glint in the mans eyes and weighing him up two hundred and twenty pounds if hes an ounce and every ounce a pain in the backside ill home with bonnie jean and sergeant said harry to a good friend of his well over a hundred miles away in the cemetery in harden believe i have a problem his dead friend an exarmy physical training instructor and an extremely hard man in his time was into harrys mind at once looking out through his eyes and reading the picture he saw in the bar room the thing is harry went on while sergeant got acquainted dont want too much mess step away from the bar harry sergeant graham lane told him this lads big and bold but hes getting old what fortyfive and look at his gut he drinks too much and hes had too much tonight too the next time he speaks to you if he really means to have a go is when hell make his move let me take it from there harry moved away from the bar into open space heard bj saying look big jimmy we were only talking ive the right to talk to people in mah own place have i no its the way he was lookin at ye lass big jimmy answered speaking to her but narrowing his eyes at harry i just dinnae like his attitude his flashy answers you big jimmy rasped turning more fully to harry so yere a live one eh and he started his swing well not for long ye fucking pipsqueak sergeant was right there in the necroscopes mind directing him almost controlling him so harry let him handle it his way the bar was on harrys right and big jimmy moving along it from the left still knocking aside bar stools the man had swung with his right hand a lumbering blow with lots of weight but nothing of speed the necroscope stepped forward inside the arc of the fist caught big jimmys wrist in both hands turned and bent forward from the waist the big mans impetus carried him forward harrys back formed the fulcrum and his opponents arm the lever he rose up somersaulted brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i came crashing down on a table and reduced it to rubble and harry said christ sergeant i said no mess what mess the other answered ifs over hes winded but thats all and maybe hell take it as a warning only a total moron would push it any further hes seen how fast we are well i hope youre right harry answered with feeling as big jimmy got groggily to his feet why ye the man took a stumbling step forward the necroscope took a pace back his arms lifting and extending forward as his hands commenced moving in an unmistakable karate weave and cocking his head slightly on one side warningly dont he said simply that huh the other grunted stopping dead in his tracks so yere a hard man are ye you really dont want to find out harry told him and from behind the bar yere leaving big jimmy bj snapped right now an yere no coming back big jimmy looked at her through little red pigeyes cast one more murderous glance at harry and grunted tuck yeall then as he swung around and headed for the door one of the girls was hot on his heels with his coat and bj shouting after them tear up his card no ones ever tae let that pig in here again her eyes stopped blazing and she looked at harry who was finishing his drink and regaining a semblance of control bj said greased lightning aye maybe yere right and i shouldnae have tae do with ye too late for that bj he told her were already had tae do as you well know he glanced round the room but no one was looking his way they probably thought it best not to one of the girls was clearing away the wrecked table we have to talk harry reminded bj she pursed her lips as if preparing to argue but finally said tonight then after weve closed midnight right here and now perhaps ye go yere no a member after all ahve mah licence tae think about and you should think a little more about your accent he thought which changes like the wind round edinburgh castle bj signalled for one of her girls to get his coat then phoned for a taxi just in case the big mans waiting outside for ye but he wasnt and neither was the little man with the camera harry didnt need the taxi but took it anyway as far as the town centrethen he took the mobius route the rest of the way to bonnyrig back home he rummaged around until he found an incredibly ancient bottle of scottish malt whisky that must have belonged to his stepfather there was still an inch or two of liquor in the bottom and as he poured himself a large shot he couldnt help but wonder what alec kyle would have thought of it oddly enough he still felt buoyed by the single shot of cognac hed had at bjs so what was he to make of that a warning and ive really got to get this body in training harry thought with which he poured the contents of his glass and the rest of the bottle away down the kitchen sink once you know your enemy its easier to deal with him and that was the end of that but maybe he should have taken a drink if only to lighten up a little doom and gloom were back by the time he used the mobius continuum to return to bjs a little after midnight and the miseries were on harry as heavy as ever also he was somewhat upset by all this unnecessary hopping about if bj had really wanted to talk to him why hadnt she simply taken him into her back room and talked to him or had she needed the time to set him up whichever he was alert as never before as he stepped out of the continuum across the street from bjs in the dark doorway where hed seen the little man with the camera if anything he was early two of bjs girls were just getting into a taxi at the kerbside and bj herself was seeing them off she gave a wave from her doorway as the cab pulled away then moved back out of sight and the illuminated sign blinked into darkness harry conjured a door of his own moved across the street rang bjs bell she hadnt had time to lock the door yet he sensed movement heard the rattle of a chain the door swung open and seeing him now how in all thats she said and frowned her puzzlement you werent here just a moment ago i thought you werent coming he shrugged i saw your girls leaving and waited didnt want anyone to get the er wrong idea oh really she raised an eyebrow well maybe yed better come in then before someone sees you and as he made to step across the threshold but harry you can believe me that they wouldnt get the wrong idea so lets have it understood this is strictly business its not that i want you here but that you want to be here right his turn to frown where he paused with one foot over the threshold you invited me no she denied it you insisted well im here anyway he said and do you still want to talk to me if youll let me in yes smiling she let him pass and walking along the corridor while she finished locking the door he wondered now what was that all about the lights were low in the bar room harry stood waiting until bj came in from the corridor and turned them off altogether then he brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i stood in total darkness until a vertical crack of light expanded into an oblong as bj opened a recessed door behind the bar and passed through into the back room and looking back at him she said well are ye no coming she was in and out of that accent of hers like a hungry budgie in its cage hopping to and fro from swing to swing harry let himself through the bar hatch and followed her into the back room or one of them it was a storage room with a door to one side and stairs ascending to bjs private rooms overhead here the necroscope hesitated until from the foot of the stairs bj said i see more than enough of that bar of an evening so if we must talk lets at least be comfortable following her up the lighted stairs he admired her figure and the natural swing of her backside in her sheath skirt which was slit up one side oriental style bj was slim and shapely and classy yes or was it just kyles body chemistry whichever the necroscope felt it also their closeness the fact that they were quite alone here but it was all part of the search for brenda this is where i live she told him stepping aside on a landing that opened directly into her living room go on in and as he stepped by her into the room do have a seat harry keogh she said before doing so he looked the room over and was pleased with what he saw for where the bar below was a mixture of different styles this room was all bj it perfectly reflected her image or the image that he still had of her it was tasteful yet exciting too it pleased the eye and simultaneously satisfied the mind lacking pretension or ostentation still it looked rich looked real like the woman herself the carpet was pile patterned and obviously wool harry could almost feel its warmth coming right through the soles of his shoes the carpets pattern was what turkish greek but mediterranean anyway as were the varnished pine ceiling beams that formed spokes from the centre of the ceiling completing the wheel where they were joined up by curving members around the rooms perimeter thus the room had a circular or at least octagonal look while in fact it was simply a square room but actually there was nothing simple about it the main lighting feature a small round chandelier on an extending golden chain depended from the hub of the pine ceilingwheel its crystal pendants served to contain the electric light from three eggshaped bulbs so that the whole piece was set glowing like a small soft sun its light was adequate but could be supplemented by use of shaded wall lights and by the reading lamp on its tall white stand near the circular central table the three inner walls were decorated with what looked like good quality old prints in modern frames while in the comers narrow tapestry screens framed in bamboo added to the circular effect in the exterior wall a wide bay window and seat took up threequarters of the space and opened onto a balcony overlooking the garden the necroscope could see the gently mobile tops of trees or shrubbery out there gleaming a lush green in the rain and a nightdark hill in the distance silhouetted against a lowering sky a lighttan leather lounger faced two matching easy chairs across the polished top of the pine table and a pair of tall narrow crammed bookshelves filled the gaps between the framed prints along one wall a television set at the foot of one of the screens that flanked the bay window could be viewed comfortably from the lounger while a music centre on its stand occupied the space in front of the other screen behind all four of the screens small chests of drawers were barely visible obviously bonnie jean kept her clutter in the drawers well out of sight of visitors she was one tidy lady to complete the picture there was a rotating drinks cabinet on the open landing itself where bj had paused presumably to prepare drinks and to inquire a courvoisier harry almost replied in the affirmative then remembered his vow against hard liquor and shook his head thanks no what she said and am i supposed to sit here drinking by mahself nothing hard he answered im not one for hard liquor tonight was a oneoff if you hadnt suggested cognac i probably wouldnt have thought of it but look since bj s is a wine bar why dont you offer me a glass of wine that seemed to please her actually she said i think im glad yere no a drinker hard drink will make a fool of a man like big jimmy for instance itll put an idiot in your head and a braggart in your mouth to think and speak for ye the necroscope was well able to appreciate that the idea of other people in your head speaking and acting for you and it wasnt too farfetched either except his people were anything but idiots and usually told the truth as for the difference bj went on eh he felt obliged to cut in between a pub and a wine bar she smiled oh its the licence she explained a pubs hours are controlled and its clients often arent but my wine bars a club whose opening hours are satisfactory to me within the law you understand and with clients that i can pick and choose like big jimmy harry sat on the lounger it was big jimmys first bad mistake she answered and his last you know harry said that was the first jock jimmy i ever met i know everyone calls everyone jimmy up here but are there really that many jameses r brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i she laughed and explained its like johns in london or bruces in australia if you dont know someones name you call him jimmy thats all but big jimmy really was one harry grimaced and agreed he was one all right til tell ye something though she said sitting in one of the easy chairs opposite him youd best be careful how you use jock the scots dont much care for it oh i can tell you know about them harry said despite that youre not one of them bj turned her face away and busied herself pouring wine generally hiding her momentary confusion she had brought a silver tray bearing a crystal decanter a bottle and glasses from the drinks cabinet now she poured a glass of red wine from the decanter and a glass of liebfraumilch from the bottle taking up the sweet white wine she offered a toast heres to you harry keogh and the accent had quite disappeared harry picked up his glass and looked at it the glass was manyfaceted its contents were a light ruby red but seemed misty the reds for me he queried but i thought red wine was supposed to give you a headache whats this the house wine that headache stuffs a myth she told him in fact i deliberately chose the red for you because its not so strong but it does have more than its share of sediment which is why i decanted it i managed to clear most of it but if you dont like it she shrugged i can always make you a coffee or something else of your choice harry took a sip the taste wasnt unpleasant there was a certain bite to it a hint of resin maybe he took a stab at it you seem taken by things mediterranean aha she said one minute an innocent the next a connoisseur but youre right a friend brought a whole crate of it back from greece for me probably very cheap local stuff which might explain its quality but its okay harry cut her short it tastes fine and im grateful for your hospitality but bj i do have to talk to you i know she said about that night yes well good because i want to talk to you too you probably saved my life harry went on and im not forgetting that i owe you for that but what you did was still a killing if not downright murder also you nailed the wolfman to his seat in that van and so helped kill him too and you were very cool calm and collected about the whole business which worries me i mean its not everyone who goes around shooting people with a crossbow then shrugs it off like its something that happens all the time she waited until she was sure he had finished then said you could have asked me all of these things that night after you well after i found myself in the alley when i was off balance lets face it harry if i have a case to answer so do you you said you werent a policeman so what were you doing there that night eh and then theres a really big question namely how did you get us out of there i mean i still cant believe that drugged the necroscope lied i drugged you what her eyes has narrowed to slits increasing their tilt making her look more feral than ever you drugged me how when disbelief was written plain on bonnie jeans face when i took your arm i squeezed your arm tightly held you but still you pulled away the effort you exerted to free yourself concealed the fact that id administered a drug from a small device in my hand it had been meant for the people i was after but i hadnt had an opportunity to use it she let that sink in and thought about it and finally that all sounds a bit farfetched she said what you got me out of there unconscious on your own but harry saw that she was uncertain i wasnt alone he went on i had friends in the yard at the back of that place and i switched the lights off remember that stopped the police for a little while by the time they went inside wed bundled you over the wall oh she cocked her head on one side and then you carried me across the road in full view of anyone who just might happen to be looking to the alley where you waited for me to recover right her sarcasm didnt quite drip but it brimmed certainly yes harry nodded delighted that she herself had supplied the answer to his biggest problem exactly right there was a lot of milling around most of the police were inside or gathered at the entrance ramp their vehicles were all over the place blocking the road and there was the distraction of the blazing van of course also if we had been seen well the people i work for are powerful and so you see it wasnt really difficult the drug is quickacting and just as quick to disperse after a few minutes you came out of it you were a bit shaken but nothing serious surely you remember sitting down on the wet cobbles bj looked very uncertain now her eyes blinked rapidly as she attempted to absorb all of this i was shaken up she finally said i didnt know what to make of things except that it seemed like some kind of magic i went to my hotel and to bed in the morning well it was all like a dream and i had no way to contact you or even to know who you were and i still dont she looked at him accusingly i shouldnt have helped you the necroscope continued and took another sip of wine it didnt do me much good with my superiors the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i people at the top i should have left you at the garage to fend for yourself and that way the police would have had a suspect for the killings but he shrugged you had saved my life and i felt obliged so youre an agent of sorts yes working for whom people harry shrugged again when the police cant do something that needs doing when the law defeats the lawful then my people are there to help except theyre not my people any more i overstepped myself with you her mouth fell open youre out yes he answered this is my last job to find out why you were there why you did what you did only answer a question or two truthfully youll be in the clear and i shall have squared it with my people theyll take you back no but thats okay i have other things to do he sipped again at his wine which was in fact excellent it soothed a sore throat he hadnt even realized he had and it was loosening not only his tongue but his mind too and making everything hed said seem reasonable even to him so after youd left me in that alley and that was something of a swift getaway too if i may say so where did you go and how did you disappear so quickly i went to my superiors and briefed them on what had occurred theyd been after that gang for a long time as for getting away quickly theres a wicket gate in that warehouse door in the alley i simply i stepped through it well hed stepped through a kind of door anyway if not a wicket gate the frown was back on her face i could swear that when i glanced away from you then back again you had simply i dont know disappeared that stuff i used on you he answered it has illusory effects but i they soon wear off also it was very misty in the alley anyway what are you suggesting wheres the mystery i get paid used to get paid not to be seen to arrive unannounced and depart without leaving a trace suddenly harry was slurring his words not a lot but sufficient that he noticed it so what with the mist and all and your disorienta i tion and there was bj refilling his glass had he emptied it that quickly now its your turn he said stifling a yawn is my company that boring bj smiled wonderingly or so he thought tired the necroscope told her feeling the weight of his leaden eyelids not surprising really all the chasing about hed been doing and the drink and the big question mark still hanging like a sword over brenda and harry jr their whereabouts their safety he leaned to one side propping himself up with one elbow on the lounger and asked why were you there why the crossbow why did you kill that skippy bloke and try to kill the one in the wolf mask just for revenge you said that theyd put friends of yours in jeopardy the word jeopardy hadnt come out very well but harry continued anyway which was enough to make you track them down and kill them well all i can say is you must really care for your friends why not start by telling me about that are you okay she looked a little worried now concerned for him me im fine but the glass tilted in his hand a little that was okay there wasnt much wine in the glass anyway look be comfortable she said ive only just realized how wiped out you look here let me fix that and before he could complain even if hed wanted to bj had placed a couple of pillows under his head you have hollows under your eyes a cat could curl up and sleep in she said but the way she said the word sleep was like an invocation he could actually feel his itchy eyelids closing and was too tired to rub them open your turn he said lolling there and barely felt her hands touching his shoulders turning him on his back and easing his head onto the pillows and damn it he thought as he passed out and a moment or an aeon later even more idiotically hope i didnt drop my glass when she was satisfied that the necroscope was well and truly under taking her time and careful not to disturb him too much bj unclenched his fingers from around the glass removed the tray and wine and all back to the drinks cabinet then returned to harry and pulled down the crystal chandelier on its retractable cable and chain his story hadnt been so wild after all not to someone like bonnie jean mirlu who had heard many wild stories and known many wild things in her long long life and what hed said about drugging her hadnt come as too much of a surprise either except for the fact that she hadnt been able to work out what hed done to her at the time but now it was far easier to believe that than that hed somehow conveyed her in the blink of an eye from one place to another without covering the space between what like some kind of genie out of the arabian nights well bonnie jean didnt believe in that sort of magic but the magic of secret agencies like mis or and mindbending drugs especially these were things she could readily believe in yes for she had experience of the latter necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley indeed her red wine was a case or a good many bottles in point the recipe for that had been old when the sciences were young and when dabblers had been called alchemists bj didnt know what the ingredients were but she knew where they were cached and how to brew them up and she knew something of their origins too the islands of the greek sea the mediterranean as it was now and the bulgarian empire oh yes and even further afield for certain of the ingredients had come from the far east with the hsiungnu later the huns in the form of precious balms and medicines certainly the wine had been known in manchuria and sinkiang and to the esoteric worm wizards of the takla makan desert and much later to arab alchemists in olden irem the city of pillars in the th century it had been used by the bulgars who were good chemists and winemakers both and by the serbians and the ottoman turks to ward off the black death itself which also had its source in the east after that its secrets had been lost to mankind in the reel and roil and turmoil of a troubled world lost to mankind aye but not to bonnie jeans master who remembered all things and told them to her in the hours when she was called up to attend him for she was his watcher where he lay in state the guardian of his place and the hour of his calling would be soon now the howling in her mind that would call her back even from halfway across the world the cry of the great wolf in his secret den that throbbing throat that the wild carpathians had known when the danube was a trade route and alaric of the visigoths was yet to sack rome reluctantly bj drew herself back from her mental wanderings in space and time after all these werent her memories but those of her master and she was only privy to them through him but bonnie jean had watched over him for two hundred years like her mother before her and hers before her and was a zealous even a jealous guardian and now someone was come who might just might threaten bj and in so doing threaten him in his place well threats werent new they were old as earth as old as her masters being here indeed some of them had come here with him but the nature of the threat was something else aye for there are threats and there are threats now she must discover what sort harry was and decide how best to deal with it kill him oh that would be easy so easy she could have done it in the garage she almost had done it except shed thought he was a policeman and knew that the police dont give up easily when one of their own is murdered she could even do it now this very minute ah but what would follow behind what of these powerful friends of his these men who could act when the law couldnt and what was their interest in her was it just the way he said it was or was there a lot more to it no killing him now would be stupid dangerous especially if he had been sent here as he alleged safer to find out about him discover all there was to know and then let her master decide his fate by now the wine would be right through his system it was time to begin bonnie jean propped harry up with pillows until he was in the halfreclining position she drew curtains across the bay windows turned down the chandelier lights to a softly luminous glow and gave the spiral flex a gentle twist that set the pendants slowly turning winding and unwinding they sent a stroboscopic flicker through the finely sheathing membranes of the necroscopes eyelids and my turn aye she said softly in a while or are you no longer interested dont you want to listen to me then harry keogh his eyelids flickered and bj smiled oh he could hear that hypnotic voice of hers all right as in some especially vivid dream no need to speak she told him simply nod or shake your head in answer to my questions do you understand bj couldnt know that this was a game hed played before and that therefore his resistance was weakened or should be he nodded but his eyelids continued to flutter a little would you like to see bj wondered out loud if so then open your eyes the light wont hurt you indeed the crystals will help you see more clearly theyll help both of us to see much more clearly the necroscope opened his eyes and bonnie jean was gratified to note that their pupils were dark pinpricks swimming on moist mirror irises now listen she said ensuring that the soft spokes of light from the chandeliers pendants were wheeling directly across his eyes and forehead i want you to listen carefully and answer truthfully you do want to answer my questions dont you her voice was now magnetic utterly irresistible a slight twitch of harrys head left and right left and right a shake a denial he must be stronger than shed suspected but no hed been asked a question and was only trying to answer it truthfully just as she had demanded then his adams apple wobbled and he gurgled yyour tturn why he was continuing their waking conversation a different reaction from anything shed ever known before oh he was a strange one all right this one but my turn yes she agreed and why not why not satisfy his queries here and now then whatever his fate would be later for now at least hed be satisfied that she was innocent of any ulterior motives in connection with the killings in the garage what shed told him at that time that her motive was preemptive defensive had been a lie concocted on the spur of the moment she had hoped to gain his sympathy by telling him that those people had threatened necroscope the lost years vol i brian luraley friends of hers that way hed be more likely to see her as an instrument of his own revenge which he had and now was the ideal time the perfect opportunity to substantiate and reinforce his previous opinion and so my turn she said again you want to question me harry you want me to answer those questions you asked me before you fell asleep and bj wondering what sort of mind has this man anyway a determined one certainly very well she went along with it except i shall expect you to believe everything i tell you and no matter what i tell you or say to you you will only remember that im innocent of any crime youll only remember that im innocent and anything else that i require you to remember and in that respect and with that regard to myself you will only act when i desire it at such times as i require youll follow any instructions i may give you to the letter youll follow any instructions i give you to the letter is that understood but his nod was tentative trembling if im to trust you with the truth you must trust me she insisted isnt it only fair yyes he said very well she said now pay attention and lets try to have a normal conversation except you will generally accept what i say but you are allowed to point out any holes in the logic of my answers so can we try to talk normally harrys throat worked up and down as he licked his lips his face relaxed a little and he said sure why not in a perfectly ordinary speaking voice but his pinprick pupils remained fixed unblinkingly on the slowly mobile pendants bj was frankly astonished at one and the same time he was difficult and he was easy perhaps when these people of his had trained him they had somehow strengthened him against hypnotic suggestion and posthypnotic suggestion if so then he was a dead man he mustnt be allowed to take any knowledge out of this room except what she desired him to know but that was for the future while for now all right then lets take it question by question she suggested you wanted to know about my crossbow its a weird weapon he said attempting a shrug no it isnt she shook her head despite that he wasnt looking at her its a perfectly normal weapon which i use to hunt rabbits in the highlands i climb hunt and live off the land those are my hobbies but i know a crossbows power and that it will kill men as well as rabbits also its a silent weapon anyway it served its purpose admirably and it saved your life does that answer your question yes and no yes and no theft lets deal with the yes part first what do you mean by yes your answer goes part of the way to explaining a coincidence which is that the man you helped to kill the one in the van believed he was a werewolf that hit bj like a fist and forgetting for the moment that she was in control here she even tried to cover her momentary confusion which harry wouldnt notice anyway but then regaining control are you saying that you or these people of yours actually believe in werewolves no but the man you shot in the van did believe in them he thought he was one if you had believed it too youd use either a silver bullet or a silvered crossbow bolt yes and you did she laughed however shakily that bolt was ornamental both of them were they were taken from the wall of a hunting lodge in the grampians they were decorations hanging over a fireplace along with a lot of other old weaponry the lodge was my uncles place and when he passed on i got one or two of his things the heads of those bolts were silvered for easy cleaning because silver cant rust it was all a lie clever but a lie but she knew that because it at least sounded feasible it would be that much more acceptable to her guest especially in his druginduced trance in any case this was a normal conversation and allowed for normal responses so perhaps harry had been looking for just such an answer maybe hed even hoped for one at any rate he sighed a sigh of relief it seemed to bj yet still she frowned and said but if you and these these people of yours dont believe in werewolves what made you think i might i didnt say that we did harry answered it was just something that required resolution thats all and is it resolved now yes very well and now i have a question for you oh what else are you working on you said you werent concerned that youd been dropped by your people because you had other things to do what things tm searching for my wife and child stranger by the moment bj thought but he couldnt be faking it his eyes hadnt blinked once they were still fixed firmly on the crystal pendants where they slowly revolved continuing to seek their natural balance are your wife and child lost then necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley they went away he said from me my work the baby he it was a difficult birth my wifes health suffered mental as well as physical or rather mental instead of physical postnatal depression and other problems yes so she ran away with your baby yes but in your line of work with your experience youll be able to find them right i mean like you found me im not in the telephone book harry neither is brenda he answered but i cant simply ask a taxi driver to take me to her thats how you found me yes so where will you look for them abroad canada maybe america the west coast seattle thats where ill start anyway probably and when will you go as soon as possible maybe tomorrow but thats a lot of questions and its your turn again she nodded despite that he couldnt see her it was just that their conversation was that normal you asked me if id killed or helped to kill those men in the garage out of revenge she reminded him well i did revenge pure and simple i told you it was because they had placed friends of mine in jeopardy but it was more than that i dont much like to talk about it thats all she was lying again but trying to make it sound good you see one of them used to come here into my bar he was chattingup one of the girls a close friend of mine later he called from london asked her down to see him she went and didnt come back but she left a note of the address shed gone to i waited and eventually saw in the newspapers how her body had been discovered after that i felt it was all up to me i look after my girls harry their welfare is very important to me at least that last part was the truth and bjs story as a whole wasnt a complete falsehood about a year ago she had lost a girl on holiday in london she simply hadnt come back and was still missing bj presumed dead the work of her masters olden enemies she prayed not meanwhile though she had finished speaking harry wasnt saying anything so bj prompted him does that sound reasonable yes he answered tentatively as far as it goes skippy was from newcastle edinburgh is a short hop skippy was always on the run he might have come up here to get away from trouble in newcastle but you shot at two men one because he was trying to kill you she answered it was dark in the garage and he was obviously a killer and and the other harry prompted her his eyes as glassy and fixed as ever because i thought he was trying to run me down i mean i didnt actually shoot at anyone just at the van and i had to get out of there i was frightened harry it was another clever lie and while the necroscopes drugged mind was absorbing it your turn harry she said just what is this organization you worked for its called ebranch he said flatly part of the secret intelligence services the most secret of them all and your job with this ebranch he was silent but beads of sweat had formed on his brow well i was a field agent doing what you saw that for yourself those louts in the garage were murderers and thieves they were responsible for the deaths of innocent people including policemen and your friend i was oh a means of enforcing the law where natural laws no longer applied what she cocked her head on one side theyd given you a licence to kill that wasnt exactly what hed meant but oh im no stranger to death he answered and before she could respond but now its your turn again why does an innocent girl like you have access to mindbending drugs like the stuff you must have put in my wine and why if youre so innocent are you afraid of being questioned instead of hunting this skippy and his lycanthrope friend down why didnt you give the police the girls last known address in london which you told me you knew last but not least why is someone watching you or your place this place a shrivelledup little man with a face like i dont know like a greyhound but bonnie jean had had more than enough of this game now and anyway he was much too good at it as for that last question of his it had shaken her to her roots so enough of this she thought now it was time to apply the real pressure necroscope the lost years vol i iv harry weird warnings bonnie jean she wonders and worries beyond the bay window low over the distant hills and gleaming palely on the rim of the clouds the waning moon was five days past full strength bj s powers or some of them such as her metamorphism had waned with it but others had been hers from birth they were hers by right her masters greatest talents had been his mentalism and upon a time his metamorphism of course and bj was blood of his blood she would have all that was due to her in the fullness of time even if it took another two centuries for full development but for now she was a beguiler that was her art hypnotism aided by the wine her eyes and mind would exercise such power even over this awkward subject this harry keogh that he would become as a toy in her hands hers to command to do with as she willed and because she had never failed bj never once considered the idea of failure in this she was surely fortunate for harry keoghs metaphysical mind wasnt at its best it resisted the necroscopes contours echoes of alec kyles precognitive talents continued to shape it its defences had been undermined by previous tampering but bonnie jean knew none of this now drawing the small table to one side she positioned her chair so that the chandelier hung just to the right of her head where its scintillant pendant crystals continued to turn to and fro but on a level with her eyes and in this position she faced the man on the lounger across eighteen inches to two feet of space and said harry now well do something else when i tell you to i want you to look into my eyes not now but when i tell you is that understood sure he said but its still your turn oh he had willpower this man but so did bj and she also had the wine and powers other than will to subvert the will of others but that game is over now she insisted and at my command you will look into my eyes and before he could answer if hed intended to harry this is no longer a normal conversation your mind isnt yours to control you feel the effects of the wine you feel ill as never before your brain is swimming the room is spinning only i can stop it only my eyes can stop it harrys head began to loll on the cushions to and fro backwards and forwards more beads of sweat stood out on his brow forming damp spots in the permanent creases of forgotten frowns but his pinprick pupils never once left the pendants even though his eyes rolled to the motion of his face and head you do believe me dont you she went on you do feel those effects ive described in combination with her purring persuasive voice the action of the delusioninducing suggestion enhancing wine worked on harrys mind to the desired effect he was pale as death panting now and beginning to convulse as rapidly as that he displayed all the symptoms of physical illness in a little while he might even be sick and now thought bonnie jean reaching behind her back to the top of her sheath dress finding the zipper drawing it down down and shrugging the garment off her shoulders let it be now for a moment the dress clung to her breasts then fell forward and exposed her to the waist she stood up stepped out of the dress as it fell and pushed down her panties and once again now let it be now this would take some effort it wasnt her time the full moon was bjs time but she needed more than her own strength now more than the strength of her human eyes oh harry keogh would listen to her as a woman and obey her to a point but as the other she would be more powerful yet and have complete control over him or so nearly complete that it wouldnt matter and seating herself naked before him she turned her gaze on the chandelier and let its light fill her brain it formed a softly glowing moon floating right there in her room a gloriously full moon a moon of strange powers and one of change and bonnie jean changed it was as if her flesh rippled it was as if her colours flowed especially the colour of her hair out of her head and into her body the grey highlights were highlights no more but solid colour she was grey almost white her coat pelt fur was white and her eyes their shape was angular now triangular or at least framed in triangles of white fur and their size was huge and their colour was blood and bonnie jeans lips her mouth her teeth it was metaplasia but almost instantaneous it was metamorphosis monstrous and immediate if the necroscope had been awake or other than entranced if hed seen it experienced it then he would have known what it was would have known to cry out and the one awesome word he would have cried necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley wamphyri but he hadnt seen didnt know and the breath he might have felt upon his face which came from scant inches away now was still sweet not with the sweetness of perfume but an animal sweetness or musk and the words he heard when she spoke were more a cough a grunt a growl but still her words which he must obey my eyes harry only my eyes if you would put an end to your sickness your misery then look into my eyes dont look at me but only into my eyes and he did into her furnace gaze into those eyes which had fascinated mesmer himself into a hypnotic whirlpool that was easily the equal of doctor james andersons except james anderson had been here first and his posthypnotic commands still applied they were buried deep but they were here and they were still active and there the creature that was bonnie jean husked binding harry to her gaze and all your pain is eased your sickness is washed away the whirling of your brain has been stilled now tell me is it good harry the necroscope tried to answer but couldnt his tongue was swollen his throat parched but she heard his sigh and saw how the heaving of his chest gradually subsided and finally completely under her spell he nodded and his pinprick pupils were like crimson motes burning in the reflection of her gaze or tiny planets swayed by the lure of twin suns in the morning starting awake from some instantly forgotten nightmare harry had a splitting headache and felt like death warmed up then he saw where he was knew that hed spent the night here without remembering a thing about it and felt even worse bjs livingroom her lounger herself emerging onto the stairwell landing in a towelling robe shed showered and her hair was still damp on her collar the smells of coffee and toast came wafting from the tray she was carrying god said harry sitting up and laying aside the blanket she had thrown over him and he meant it when he repeated god for the last time hed felt like this was on that morning in london after taking darcy clarkes sleeping pill she smiled at him where he screwed up his eyes fingered back his hair and gritted his teeth and told him when you went you went really fast and never knew what hit you but i have to admit i asked for it after all youd warned me that you werent much of a drinker the wine harry grunted that stuff how can anything that tastes so good be so wicked but isnt that always the way is it she laughed at his pained expression anyway it was either the wine or the life of a secret agent is very very strenuous ah he said i told you about that nothing specific but i would have known anyway i mean you were so calm and controlled in that awful situation in london you would have to be something special just to be able to get us out of that place the way you did with which most of it came flooding back or so the necroscope thought the words that awful situation in london were a mental trigger a trip to release his stored memories and now they were there dropping neatly into place her motive had been revenge pure and simple her girls were very special to her and she felt like a mother to them in almost every case theyd been in need of care up until the time she employed them also she had known that skippy was a bad one if the police werent able to pin the murder on him he might easily put two and two together and work out that bj had fingered him after that he might even have come looking for her it seemed like a perfectly sound motive to the necroscope at least because bj had told him it was sound and the silvering on the heads of the ornamental crossbow bolts perfectly acceptable even the odd little chap who had been watching the place the father of one of the bars hostesses maybe checking that she worked in a decent place or perhaps a private detective following one of bj s more dubious customers well if she had any more clients like big jimmy that would seem reasonable enough too and so his memories seemed whole complete as some wellremembered tune and not a single discordant note to jar his mind awake to its errors as far as last night was concerned that page of the necroscopes mind had been rewritten maybe he frowned once or twice and blinked as bj sat down beside him and poured coffee but that was all harrys main concern right now was that he hadnt been bothersome to his lady host for after drinking her red wine well the nights events were vague to say the least have you decided then bj broke into his thoughts startled he looked at her decided she nodded sighed said my but youre having a really rough time of it arent you have you decided when youll continue your search for your wife and baby it was the very last thing you said to me before you er turned in no i can see that you dont remember you said that youd have to sleep on it you told me it could be as early as today but looking at you this morning i cant say id advise you to travel anywhere too far too fast harry keogh too far too fast the word sequence opened another door in the necroscopes mind brenda and his son he had come here to find out if necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley there was a connection between bonnie jean and their disappearance forlorn hope no bj was just a strongwilled young woman who believed in taking matters into her own hands and harry couldnt deny that if hed been in her place he would probably have done pretty much the same thing an eye for an eye her connection therefore was purely coincidental and despite his false memories this time harry was absolutely right where brenda was concerned bjs coming on the scene had been entirely coincidental so back to her question til think it over think it out a while longer he said well for a couple of weeks anyway a couple of weeks yes he was decided three weeks at least to think it out and fingering his scalp again that is when i can think again but ill need at least that long to work out some kind of plan wont i she nodded and shrugged well its none of my business of course its just that i wish you luck but whatever you do you will stay in touch right let me know how you get on harry wasnt looking at her he was sitting there holding his head between his hands blinking his stinging eyes and trying to focus them looking at his left sock where it hung half off his foot but her words rang in his mind like a bell stay in touch he gave a slight involuntary jerk was unable to stop his reaction as a short sharp series of vivid scenes flooded his mind a full moon brilliant yellow like burnished gold sailing a clear night sky that was all he should have seen and he knew it knew something remembered something however briefly like a name on the tip of the tongue that comes then slips maddeningly away when the moon is nearing its full stay in touch that was all there should be yes but there was more a snarling visage the merest glimpse of dripping fangs salivating leathery lips pointed ears and grey fur and commanding eyes red as sin full of sin carrying some secret message that harry couldnt read then the moon again showing the wolfs head in silhouette thrown back in a silent throbbing howl the kaleidoscopic scenes were there and they were gone and even the knowledge that theyd been there was gone except for a fading shadow on harrys metaphysical mind and of course he jumped to the wrong or not entirely correct conclusion it had to be alec kyle his precognition but had it been a warning or what or was it simply an echo not of the future but the past a flashback to the madness and mayhem down in london and if so why but already it was gone bj had seen him start he could feel her watching him he jerked up his head and looked at her catching her off balance there was a smile on her face or the vestiges of one that she hadnt quite managed to drop and knowing shed been caught out as it were she shook her head and said so there we have it no drinking man you harry man yere rough so shed been smiling at his discomfort right but a very secretive sort of smile or maybe a knowing smile again harry jumped to the wrong conclusion bj must see a good many heavy drinkers in her bar alcoholics even lets face it you could find alcoholics in just about any bar anywhere in the world couldnt you the trouble was the necroscope didnt know much about them only what hed heard for instance one drink is enough for some people while others can drink all night and never show it for a moment what kind of drinker had alec kyle been really a heavy one maybe too heavy a secret one secret enough to hold down his job at ebranch and here was harry keogh lumbered with kyles body and his addiction he looked at the tray where bj had set it on the pine table the coffee looked good but he really didnt fancy anything to eat his throat was sandpaperdry and his brain felt like a wet sponge but bonnie jean had asked him a question god he felt so stupid what was it shed asked wont i be seeing you again she obliged him i i have your number he told her ill know where to contact you but why in hell would he want to contact her apart from the obvious reason what arrangements had been made last night he was sure that nothing had happened here mulling it over he drank his coffee half an hour later he left walking off along the street into a dreary morning and not long after that one of bj s girls reported back to her and said i followed him like you said but i lost him what bj was angry she had obtained harrys telephone number but that was all it was a simple oversight an error on her part shed wanted to know where he lived how to get there and what it looked like things that she could have asked him last night it had seemed such a perfect coincidence the fact that he had a place up here close to edinburgh but shed known that harry would stay in touch with her and so hadnt really considered the possibility that he might be hard to locate she had only sent the girl after him on an afterthought now however taking time to give it a little more thought harry was some kind of agent what if this place of his wasnt his place at all but a safe house perhaps it was a good thing her girl had lost him perhaps these people of his had been waiting for him to whistle him away and the telephone number was merely a contact number she knew it was listed which meant she couldnt use it to brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i discover his address all very irritating and because the girl hadnt answered her yet how could you lose him she snapped he went into a newsagents the girl told her hurriedly i thought hed be buying a newspaper and waited in my car but he didnt come back out maybe hed spotted you bj snapped i told you to be careful hes no fool that one i thought i was careful the girl looked bewildered bjs attitude softened and finally she said maybe he went out the back way and she left it at that for after all harry was that kind of man and in his line of work it must be second nature to take precautions against being tailed indeed he had said as much he was just good at his job that was all again she remembered that damp dangerous night in london the action in the garage and how something had happened to her before she came to her senses in the alley then how harry had seemed to disappear into the mist oh yes hed been good at his job all right but in any case what difference did it make for bj knew he would be in touch again and even when he would be in touch in just three weeks time glad to be let off the hook bj s girl went down to tidy up in the bar room for in fact she too was lost for an explanation as to how she had so stupidly even ridiculously lost her target because as far as she knew having checked and doublechecked the newsagents shop in question didnt have any back way out harrys coat was of the voluminous variety a big heavy thing that john wayne might have worn in some wintry western shrugging out of it in the old house near bonnyrig he became aware of an oblong shape swelling out the lefthand side pocket and of extra weight on that side he would have noticed it sooner except he wasnt up to noticing much of anything this morning it was a small flat bottle of bjs wine no label but the same unmistakable red and loaded with sediment a gift obviously what from bj but after last night anyone would think shed know better red wine and harry keogh didnt mix maybe shed simply dumped it on him before someone else suffered the consequences well cheers bj he gave it no further consideration because hed been told not to there was something else that bj hadnt mentioned about her greek wine the fact that it was savagely addictive far more so than any cocaine derivative but even if the necroscope hadknown right then he wouldnt have been able to so much as look at the stuff not yet anyway it was midmorning and harry was still tired he had a stiff neck from bjs lounger not to mention a hellish hangover taking aspirins he tried to think straight there were things he had to do this morning if only he could remember what they were but call your superiors the people you worked for get me off the hook we dont want them carrying out any unnecessary investigations on an innocent girl now do we no of course not but bonnie jean wasnt on the hook was she they didnt evenknow about her even as these pseudomemories and thoughts crossed his mind harry had picked up the phone and dialled darcys number it was a saturday but still darcy might be in his office and he was harry what can i do for you and more quickly if its about brenda im sorry but no its something else the necroscope cut in and now he knew what it really was about darcy check and see if the police down there have an unsolved murder on their hands wont you an edinburgh girl or young woman murdered in london about a year ago if they have you can tell them the case is closed tell them it was down to skippy or our wouldbe werewolf or both of them youre still working on that no it was just something that came up oh well thanks anyway oh and you remember the silvering on the heads on those crossbow bolts well it was ornamental they once decorated a wall over a fireplace in a hunting lodge or something the silver was to stop them from rusting you have been working on it no harry sighed just checking back on everything that was going on at that time thats all the time when brenda and my son you know sure said darcy and well thanks again harry also the necroscope blurted before darcy could put the phone down you might be able to tell me something more about alec kyle if i know ill tell you darcy answered i asked you if he liked a drink you told me he wasnt a heavy drinker but that when he did take a nip then he really went to town on it thats right could he have had a problem that you didnt know about i mean is it possible he was an alcoholic and knew it but he had it more or less under control except on occasion when it would break out and hed have to feed it wait dont give me your answer right off but give it a moments thought it could be very important and i know how loyal you are darcy several seconds ticked by then the other said well it is possible of course in this game ive come to realize that almost anything is possible but i wouldnt have thought so i never knew a steadier man brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i harry on the other hand he was a precog as you know they all have this thing about the future theyre all a little scared of it and sometimes a lot if and i mean if alec had a problem he kept it pretty well hid and if he had one you can bet your last penny it would have to do with his talent talent thats a laugh i sometimes wonder if were not all cursed harry thought about that then said thanks darcy no its me we us who should be thanking you darcy told him youre welcome harry answered automatically and he started to put the phone down then paused and said darcy ill be up here for maybe three more weeks then ill probably be out of the country i think they must have gone abroad but when i go i may be gone a while i mean i wont be coming back here each night and ill need funds i can swing that darcy told him without hesitation no harry answered im not going to hit on you or ebranch for money but there is something you can do for me just mention it find out where the russians keep their gold what where the russians i mean their repository like fort knox or something as the last word fell from his lips so harry reeled it was as if for a single second he was no longer in his room it was just like that time in darcys office in the moment following the warning of an imminent ira attack except this time nothing had prompted it there was nothing to explain why why harry stood in the open somewhere else in bright daylight and craned his neck to look up and up at stark yellow and white cliffs and at the squat whitewalled castle mansion or chateau that was perched there on the edge of oblivion a fortress on a mountainside from harrys viewpoint at the very rim of a sheer drop that must be all of twelve hundred metres to the sloping scree of a rubblestrewn gorge the scene was mediterranean all sunbleached rocks brittle scrub a few stunted pines and a salty tang from the unseen ocean their repository darcy answered abruptly yanking the necroscope back to the here and now why im sure they must have and i can probably find out about it yes but harry quickly pulled himself together it could only have been a manifestation of alec kyles precognition as to what it meant who could say he tried to carry on the conversation as if nothing had happened or if not the russians someone or some outfit maybe the mafia or some other organization like that with bullion who youd like to see lose some big money maybe to our advantage like gunrunners or drug traffickers im sure you know what im saying darcy laughed out loud but the necroscope didnt even chuckle he was still recovering from the effects of his inexplicable what visitation finally the head of e branch said ahem you know if i didnt know better harry i might accuse you of planning something decidedly illegal i suppose it depends whose side youre on youll do it if thats what you want yes darcy said harry nodded despite that the other couldnt see him and said then do it soon and darcy see if you can find someone wholl give us a decent exchange rate no questions asked this time putting the phone down harry was smiling despite his headache because he knew that on the other end of the line darcy clarke wasnt but even as the phone settled in its cradle he was there again but this time he was up there on the rim of the cliff and the walls of the keep rising before him its medieval turret towers seemed semisentient like stone sentinels where he craned his neck to look up at them and he felt his hair moving on his head perhaps blown by the winds off the gorge it came and it went and harry sat there beside the telephone again with his hair still standing on end bonnie jean was worried about ebranch how successful shed been in throwing harry or them off her trail about harry keogh himself because she believed there was still something about that one that wasnt connecting where he was concerned no sooner was one mystery cleared up than another surfaced like how he moved so quickly and came and went the way he did and the way he had eluded her tracker as to the matter of his drugging her that night at the garage in london the more she considered that the more utterly ridiculous it seemed but any alternative was even more ridiculous indeed impossible so it could only be true if only she had been a little more thorough when he was in her power she could have discovered a lot more about this ebranch hed worked for for one thing and as if all of this werent worrying enough now there was the question of the watcher a detective or the father of one of bonnie jeans girls she thought not but from the description harry keogh had given her bj believed she knew who or what it might be well it had happened before on several occasions down the decades and now it could be happening again she supposed she should be grateful harry had brought it to her attention except grateful wasnt part of the equation but forewarned is forearmed if indeed this should prove to be the worst possible scenario come or coming to pass then bj must look into it and if necessary draw their fire away from her master she had brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i done it before all of a hundred and seventyfive years ago to lure them from the true spoor and twice more in the years flown between inexperienced though she had been on that first occasion still shed won and likewise ever since else she wouldnt be here now it was why she was here after all to guard over the doglord in his immemorial sleep where he patiently awaited the advent of the one foreseen the mysterious one the right one aye and yet again bj thought of harry keogh if only for a moment and the time of the calling so close now when again she must go to him but this watcher if he were that close and if they had been allowed to follow bj all unbeknown perhaps to the very lair that was unthinkable that she might so easily have betrayed a secret so wellkept for six long centuries well at least it excluded keoghs involvement with them for if he were one of them he never would have offered his help in the first place and when he had her under the influence of his drug he could have done whatever he wanted with her could have removed her and so dealt with her master too for without bj what was her master but a poor defenceless thing in a cavern tomb but harry had done nothing except bring her to safety but oh what she wouldnt give for harry keoghs extraordinary skills now the way he seemed simply to vanish like that why with him on her side bj would have nothing to fear during the coming visit to her master harry would lose any wouldbe trackers as easily as hed eluded her girl with him on her side or him by her side keogh keogh keogh why was he on her mind so for after all she bonnie jean mirlu was the beguiler with the power of fascination and yet somehow this keogh fascinated her oh and did that mean something his eyes so warm and innocent neither brooding conniving nor flirting or flirting only a very little not even especially beautiful yet extraordinary in their depth in the way they echoed the soul behind them they were oh so soulful those eyes of his and at that bj gave an involuntary shiver for the thought of his soul was delicious and if her master were to give the word why she might yet taste it steal it from him in one raw red moment aye and that would put an end to his mysterious ways for sure his mysterious ways bonnie jean started into shocked awareness where she sat thinking things out and brooding in a chair in her livingroom harry keogh a mystery man appearing on the scene from nowhere as if on cue and bj feeling this attraction a weird affinity that was hard to place as if she already knew him so much so that when she should have let him be killed or killed him herself instead shed entrusted herself to him then later he had sought her out to bring her a warning this mysterious harry keogh what was she thinking that he might actually be that mysterious one the mysterious one for whom the doglord waited and if he was and she had simply let him walk out of here bonnie jean had lived too long to panic but for a moment thats what it felt like then logic took over so harry keogh had come and gone so what he would be back and she knew he would be back whenever she called through her hypnotism her fascination he was now as much in thrall to her as she was to her sleeping master except he didnt know it yet and probably never would she could be with him use him deal with him however she chose and afterwards he would remember only what she required him to remember her immediate instinct to call him on the telephone now at once gradually eased he was at her beck and call and not the other way around and anyway he wasnt going anywhere for at least three weeks and when he did hed be going with bj to see her master yes and then all would be well if by some miracle harry should prove to be the one then she would reap her reward her masters eternal gratitude and if he was not the one still she would be rewarded and the dog lords most urgent need satisfied for it would also be the time of replenishment the time of nourishment bonnie jeans time too as well as that of her lord and master and ancestor the doglord radu lykan meanwhile she would put a watch on the watcher and perhaps discover who or what he was using her girls it would be an easy thing to arrange a roster of observers a stakeout on the street outside the wine bar a tiny garret window in bjs bedroom looked out over the rooftops but could just as easily look down across the street into the very doorway where harry had seen him a person might sit there unseen and unsuspected behind the windows net curtains all day long and keep watch on the street all night long too if bj desired it then if someone was watching the place and if he should be a terrible someone bj would soon know about it and the next time one of her girls followed someone be sure she would not lose him she would not dare lose him not for her life not for all their lives it was that same afternoon some miles away in the study of his house outside bonnyrig the necroscope harry keogh sat absorbed in and occasionally nodding over the list of faraway places which hed spent hours compiling in the reading room of a local library his system had been elementary and flawed brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i take a modern world atlas and track the lines of longitude west from the northeastern region of the british isles to discover areas of similar climatic characteristics and habitability in the rest of the world not forgetting the west coast of england itself of course but with all coastal regions given the same priority the idea sprang from what his ma had said and what he had later thought that brenda might have found this place bonnyrig ideally suited to her personality from which harry had gone several steps further extrapolating an imaginary yet persistently real world or place of dramatic scenery misted nights slanting sunlit days long grasses leaning trees and wild flowers indeed a vast garden run wild all hidden away from the eyes of men hidden from harrys eyes anyway so where to find such a place and would the climate prove to be similar along the same lines of longitude for the imagined scene at least with regard to its weather patterns wasnt especially dissimilar to the northeast coastal region of brendas childhood and the necroscope had simply extended that region one hundred and fifty miles north to take in edinburgh and the firth of forth and bonnyrig of course it gave him a band round the earth bordered by lines of longitude and north including parts of antrim donegal and londonderry in northern ireland which was something that harry hadnt previously considered that brenda and his baby son could be as close as ireland it had given him pause but not as much as the discovery that if he followed the same lines east they would also enclose moscow several thousands of miles of frozen tundra the bering sea and alaska which would seem to put paid to that theory at least and harry had shaken his head and grinned however wrily thinking himself a fool that he hadnt paid more attention in school if only his knowledge of the worlds geography was as good as his understanding of maths but there again the necroscopes amazing skill with numbers had very little to do with his education nothing hed learned from the living anyway it was then as he tossed his pencilled list aside to let his head loll against the back of his easy chair that the telephone rang harry sat up reached for the telephone on the occasional table paused and frowned bjs bottle of red wine was there beside the telephone where hed set it down and the necroscope was thirsty he or alec kyles body was thirsty his eyes stung like there was a pound or two of grit in them his throat hurt as if someone had wirebrushed it on the inside his mind felt equally desiccated dried out and somehow he knew that a sip of the wine just a sip would ease everything and hed be able to face up to things but face up to what things just a moment ago he had seemed okay and now for his life harry couldnt say why he had frozen like that with his hand stretching halfway to the phone but the room was suddenly darker as if a storm was about to break or maybe it was just the grimy patio windows he hadnt found the time or energy to clean them and what little light forced its way in from the overgrown garden was usually grey the telephone rang again insistently drawing his hand just a few inches closer to where it hovered nervously above the top of the dusty table yet still he held back from picking up the phone he felt a chill on or in his back as if a cold wind was blowing along the marrow of his spine and shivered uncontrollably in the last few seconds it was as if the whole room had gone cold as the grave now what the hell pick it up idiot he heard his own voice demanding from deep inside his head pick up the damn telephone what in the worlds wrong with you but he wasnt expecting a call was he or was he there was something he should remember about the telephone but when he went to think about it it kept giving him the slip like a word on the tip of his tongue that he simply couldnt remember and his brain was fuzzy from all the planning he was well supposed to be doing was he expecting a call maybe he was but not yet surely and what call was it anyway the phone rang yet again and this time despite that he knew it was coming it caused him to start in his chair so why not pick the fucking thing up answer it and find out but find out what something that he really wouldnt want to know maybe and what had made him think that anyway questions questions and nothing in his head but a ball of fluff or rather a tangle of barbed wire his stinging eyes his sore throat and bjs bottle of red wine sitting there ohsotemptingly and the rrrriiiing rrrriiiing damned telephone harry went for it curled his fingers around it picked it up and the room went dark as night so that he knew it had to be a storm now the thunder he thought now the lightning but the thunder and lightning never came something else came almost involuntarily harry tightened his grip on the fur ruff of the telephone as he drew it from its cradle towards his face the telephone that wasnt he drew it at first but in the next moment it was drawing him a straining bristling ruff that dragged on his arm as if he was walking an unruly brute of a dog and he simply couldnt believe his eyes as he looked at his hand and saw what it was holding in check but barely brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i not a dog but a snarling coughing choking wolfs head redeyed with feral yellow pupils the thing didnt have a body but grew out of the telephones speaker and the cable was like a leash that lashed with the living heads frantic motion then stretched itself taut as the awful thing it anchored strained on it turning harrys arm inwards towards his gasping utterly astonished mouth the head was trying to get at him bite him crush his face in its slavering fetid mantrap jaws almighty ggod harry gasped tightening his fist to a knot in the ruff of coarse fur trying to force the head back while bringing his left hand into play as he fought to protect his face the wolfs gaping snarling muzzle was black leather flecked with white foam its unbelievable teeth were ivory yellow its ears lay flat to its head seeming to streamline the horror of its intentions as they pointed the whole gnashing clashing monstrosity of a visage at the necroscope then that tunnel of teeth closing on harrys flapping left hand where he felt bones snap in at least three of his fingers and the searing agony of flesh severed shorn through and paws as big as his hands were elongating themselves out of the telephones speaker followed by a long grey slimedamp body as if the telephone was giving birth to this thing and the jaws were clashing inches from his face they slopped blood and bits of mangled twitching finger and the grey fur of the beasts ruff tearing in his right hand coming out in scurvy matted tufts he he couldnt hold it off and worst of all the intelligence in those yellowcored murderous ohsoknowing eyes as the redribbed throat of the monster expanded to engulf his face his head harry screamed gurglingly but unashamedly thrusting himself back so spastically with such force in his driving legs as to topple his chair over backwards and as if from a million miles away the heavy pattering of raindrops on glass and a flash of lightning at last then thunder clattering mightily close by and a gust of wind hurling open the patio doors harrys ma came rushing in through the doors crying harry good god son what sort of a dream was that and his ma was all mud and bones and weed but that was okay because it was how she had always been but he also knew she shouldnt be here that she wasnt here except except in his head harry and ma he gasped panted choked where he lay sprawled on the floor with the rain hissing in his face and a wind howling from the garden whirling his pages of looseleaf notepaper in a dervish dance all around the room dream of course it had been a dream but had she really needed to ask what sort a nightmare ma he told her where her drowned spirit lay deep in mud and weeds in a bight in the river that was her grave a ffucking godawful nnnightmare for the first and probably the last time in his life the necroscope harry keogh had uttered a curse word in the presence of his beloved ma but he neednt worry for his ma had seen his dream and understood necroscope the lost years vol i v harry presentiments and precautions bonnie jean the route to the lair ma harry said after hed stopped shivering do you think its possible im going well maybe a little crazy do you mean really crazy do you mean mad if so then i think its highly unlikely if that were going to happen at all son then surely it would have happened some time ago but after all youve been through which really doesnt bear thinking about think its very possible that youre suffering from stress anxiety pressure and who knows perhaps youre physically ill too i mean with an ordinary illness my eyes my sore throat the fluff in my head he blinked watering eyes and swallowed hard to try to ease his throat flu if ever i saw a dose his ma told him all the classic symptoms youre suffering from the backlash of living down in london i was only there once oh thirty years ago when i was a girl and then only for a few weeks but it did the same to me all that smog the smoky trains and dirty railway stations not only that but didnt i warn you against coming down to the river to talk to me not in this bad weather harry not when you could just as easily be warm and dry in the comfort of the house harry shrugged and told her but you know that isnt my way ma then he managed a wry grin and added anyway that london youre talking about was some time ago its not as bad as that now dont i recall reading somewhere that if you fell in the thames in the forties when you were a girl youd have to be really lucky to drown because it was much more likely youd die of any one of a dozen fatal infections instead he sensed his mas incorporeal nod think thafs probably true yes but but there are fish in the thames now he informed her even salmon well you wouldnt catch me eating them she said and anyway youve changed the subject because you know whats coming next i should go and see a doctor he hugged his overcoat more tightly to him where he crouched at the rim of the bight over the greygleaming windruffled water but there had been something in the necroscopes voice that caused his mother to bridle huh she snorted and is that how you reward good advice well your grandmother used to say no one can help the man who wont help himself harry finished it yes ma i know and i also know youre right so ill go and see a doctor tomorrow but why not today because its late in the afternoon even if i could find a surgery open its an oddson bet thered be a queue and ma these days youre not much appreciated if you call a doctor out for something like the flu no she said you wait until you die right and before he could answer harry youre living alone up here and you dont have any close friends well not among the living what if you should come down with something serious he shrugged but i do have a teleph and he broke off and she said a telephone yes which youre afraid of but i cant say i blame you that was a very bad dream harry or a warning maybe he wondered out loud then shook his head and said no ma im not afraid of the phone just a little wary of it and ill stay that way until i find out what all of this means she picked up on the first part of what hed said a warning how do you mean alec kyle was a precog that was his talent he was able to catch these glimpses of the future usually in his dreams just before waking and i think he still does or rather you do possibly that dream wasnt my first what warning but isnt that all to the good she queried mean surely its better to know something of what to expect than nothing at all maybe he answered but just to know that something unpleasant is coming doesnt help me to understand it sometimes i do and other times i dont that was how it worked for kyle too also he and harry paused again yes i think that kyle may have been an alcoholic he blurted it out he kept it under tight control or as tight as possible but it was there nevertheless oh dear his ma said slowly and sadly and you til have to control it the same youve experienced the need the urge to take strong drink necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley more than just the urge harry nodded ruefully and knew she would sense it my thick head he sighed not the flu as you see and quickly but i promise you ill see a doctor anyway she was suddenly thoughtful so your dream wasnt necessarily poor mrkyles talent in action after all then what but since speaking with the dead often conveys far more than is actually said the necroscope had her meaning well enough you mean some kind of delusion delirium tremens well possibly so as you see harry that makes a doctor imperative he hugged his coat tighter still and sighed his agreement yes ma i suppose it does it was coming in squally again and harry headed for home home the old house where his mother and stepfather viktor shukshin had lived until the maniac shukshin had murdered her drowning her under the rivers ice harry had been a small child but he remembered that day well enough and from his mothers point of view at that so maybe this new thing was just part of an older skill maybe he was an observer of times like some old testament wizard for if he was able to so vividly visualize a past he had never personally known then why not something of a future that no man had known as yet perhaps these flashes of the future came to him via the mobius continuum and had nothing to do with alec kyle at all thus harrys metaphysical mind ran in contradictory everdecreasing circles while he continued to get nowhere home a drab unkempt sort of place at best one day hed find the time to do it up starting with the garden that sprawled almost all the way down to the river except to call it a garden was to lend it an unwarranted respectability in fact it was an overgrown and weedinfested wilderness as it started to rain again the necroscope hurried along a crazypaving path to the flyspecked patio doors swearing a vow along the way that the thorny bramble creeper that whipped at his legs would be the first to go letting himself in he saw the sky darkening over again as the wind came up to bend the trees bordering the river a great day for a nightmare no question but harry didnt believe that was all it had been despite its surreal quality it had seemed very real at the time and what if hed ignored that other warning down at ebranch hq in london that had been a hell of a mess anyway but if he hadnt been able to use his mobius door as foreseen it didnt bear thinking about at least he had understood that warning which made this other thing about the old castle the place on the cliff seem doubly suspect it was something he didnt understand why he could feel the hair on his scalp moving again at the thought of it as for this latest warning the telephone nightmare whatever else he did harry knew he couldnt afford to ignore that one this time he locked the patio doors behind him and turned on the single ceiling light and in the dusty jumble of his socalled study where a plywood packing case stood open in one corner dribbling straw and harrys handful of worldly goods were strewn about willynilly the mere fact that an easy chair still lay on its back where hed left it in his rush to get out of here and that the occasional table had been overturned and that the telephone was still purring away to itself where hed spilled it onto the floor these things would hardly seem to matter they were just part of the general clutter thats all except that wasnt all for harry knew that in fact they were the debris of his dream especially the telephone he picked the phone and cradle up and went to replace the receiver and paused what if it were to ring but how could it ring no one knew his number or next to no one he hadnt been up here long enough and his name wasnt even in the telephone book and in any case hed asked for his number to be listed exdirectory bj had it yes though for his life he couldnt think why hed given it to her but what the heck she was just an innocent if strongheaded even wrongheaded young woman anyway but fascinating in a way and then there was ebranch was that it was he scared of getting a call from ebranch frightened of learning something that he really didnt want to know such as the death of his wife or his child or both or maybe being called in on something he couldnt ignore for the fact was that as part of the countrys security services the branch had its own dirty tricks department and if they really needed him he knew they wouldnt think twice was that it that his dream had been symbolic coloured by his recent experiences in london that would explain this wolf fetish he seemed to be developing which had combined with the warning to produce his nightmare so it still remained his best bet that this was some sort of left over of alec kyles talent he was seeing something of the future he had been warned about receiving a call most probably from ebranch that would prove to be dangerous he must protect himself against it well that was easy and more determined now he placed the phone in its cradle and dialled the operator but even so and while he waited for her to answer still he sweated and glanced all about the room until finally this is the operator how can i help you i want to change my number to exdirectory he said brian lumley and after shed checked but your numbers already listed sir it is exdirectory i want to change it anyway fine ill put you through to the service you require it was as simple as that as for bonnie jean he could always give her his new number if the need should arise and then generally feeling a lot better the necroscope shaved tidied up his study finished the unpacking that hed started a month ago and made himself an evening meal and thought about brenda and his baby son of course the way he worried about them he could have set off right there and then heading off aimlessly into the mobius continuum on some wildgoose chase that might easily last him the rest of his life a wildgoose chase now why had he thought that but of course he knew why because his son had powers the equal of his own and if he didnt want to be found then harry didnt stand much chance of finding him his one trump card was that he knew more about the world and its ways he was experienced as only an adult who has lived can be experienced while the baby was a baby but in any case he wouldnt be going anywhere for oh at least three weeks he would need that long to work out his plan of campaign surely and meanwhile he would stay here warm and comfortable despite all the bad weather safe in this big old house harry shook his head and frowned god he was starting to think like his mother starting to worry about himself promising to see a doctor and such but three whole weeks to plan some kind of search campaign he shrugged blinked watery eyes rubbed at his sore throat and the mental fluff was back right there where his brain should be so much for a rapid recovery as for getting a plan together if three weeks was what it took then thats what it would get all he had to work out now was what to put in it but his throat was so sore and his eyes hot and itchy as hell probably through sleeplessness or a night spent in a drunken stupor tossing and turning on bonnie jeans lounger at which he remembered her wine it had been on the table and was now on the floor having skittered against the skirting board under a bookshelf when hed knocked everything flying he went scrambling for it without realizing how desperately he needed it trying to convince himself that it might be just the ticket just what the doctor ordered its warm resinladen sleepinducing glow all rubyred and swirlydeep in his glass it would ease his throat for sure a sip thats all just this one small glass after all it wasnt his addiction he was pandering to but alec kyles except this time it really was for curative or medicinal purposes he was just so tired damned if necroscope the lost years vol i he didnt intend to get a good nights sleep tonight at least and doubly damned if he did too two and a half weeks later when bj could no longer resist it and when she had decided that she couldnt afford to wait any longer she did try to call the necroscope only to discover that he had given her the wrong number but she knew he couldnt possibly have done it deliberately checking with the switchboard she then found that hed changed his exdirectory number but since shed given him no instructions to the contrary why shouldnt he she had simply failed to consider the possibility that he might do such a thing that was all but all was not lost he had been ordered to stay in touch with her and bj knew he would and even when he would just a few days before the full moon harry would contact her he had damn well better and meanwhile she had decided to do a little searching of her own for him for in the glaring light of the possibility that he might be more than a mere mystery man and in fact the mysterious one harry keogh had become very important to her so important that perhaps it was time bj took a short holiday she had already closed the bar down and split her five girls into two teams one pair of girls searching for harry locally and the second team stakingout the wine bar in its immediate vicinity to see if they could sight this watcher harry had warned her about and discover his business with her which left bj herself and one other girl well now she had somewhere to go with or without harry keogh and couldnt risk being followed and she knew exactly how to employ the last of her girls in the wee small hours of a wet and windy sunday morning some four days before bj was due to hear her masters call she headed north she felt sure that once shed explained why she was early radu would understand her zeal in this respect she drove a hired car a cheap old reliable but unspectacular model that wasnt likely to attract unwanted attention even so she wouldnt drive it directly from the bar but took a taxi to the home of one of her girls who had picked the car up for her the girl lived in a northern district of the city it was a welltimed operation bonnie jean left the taxi and paid the driver got into the hired car and drove it away and in the mirror she saw the girl one of her lieutenants following close behind in her own car the girl wasnt just acting as a decoy she would become a physical obstruction if bj should be followed she would simply put herself and her vehicle in the way of the pursuer but it was am and the weather was bad and with the precautions bj had taken she didnt think it likely that shed be tailed to further bolster her confidence in that respect there was the fact necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley that despite all her vigilance there had been no further spying on her place as reported by harry keogh so perhaps it had been a oneoff sort of thing after all a coincidence that hadnt involved her directly well maybe but bj was becoming less and less inclined towards coincidences and in any case she hadnt been willing to risk it and now there was only one hazard one gauntlet left to run the firth of forth bridge the only way into or out of the city from the north if anyone had seen her leave home and assuming they knew she would ultimately drive north the bridge would be the ideal place to pick up her trail but the bridge came and went without incident and so did bjs escort a mile or so beyond the firth of forth heading for perth the headlights of the car behind flashed three times in her mirror and she knew what the signal meant there was no one in pursuit no one to track her to the lair in its mountain fastness but even so her lieutenant would park at the side of the road and wait there a good hour recording the details of passing cars and observing what she could of their drivers and the rest of it was all down to bonnie jean mirlu dawn found bj at a friends house in tiny inverdruie she stayed there whenever she was up this way which of necessity meant regular quarterly visits but auld john was always here as his father had been before him john belonged to her master no less than bonnie jean herself but his blood was not of the blood and so he was merely a thrall a watcher or sentinel here on the approach routes to him in his lair high in the mountains but having been sworn to him by moonlight john was nevertheless his masters true man bjs route had taken her through perth pitlochry kingussie and kincraig and finally across the spey to inverdruie and as true dawns light limned the misty horizon of the grampians so auld john was there to greet the wee mistress as he thought of her when her car pulled into his drive and better garage the car john she told him after a brief hug ive had snoopers at my place in edinburgh and we cannot afford such up here and entering his small house where it was almost hidden from the road in a copse of birch rowan and juniper she waited for him it was dire cold last time ye were here bonnie jean he told her coming in and closing the door me ah couldnae hae climbed wi ye not this time its these old bones mah fingers hae no grip in they youre for watching john she reminded him no for the climbing aye but ahd hae dearly loved tae see him just one more time he said perhaps next time come summer but surely yere early lass snoopers as i said she nodded and maybe worse than snoopers things he should know anyway and a stranger john all very mysterious but as for him well ive no doubt youll be seeing him soon enough if ive gauged it right the old man cocked his head a stranger here and mysterious did ye say his eyes were suddenly birdbright again her nod who knows who knows she gave herself a shake turned to the fire and warmed her hands reasons enough to come up here a few days early anyway auld john was maybe sixtyfive but still spry for all his complaining he was tall gangling walked with a woodsmans lope an entirely natural one the insignia of his calling as a gillie and tracker if anything and not rooted in any condition and wore his long thinning grey hair tied back in a clasp to keep it from his weathered face he had on occasion accompanied bonnie jean high into the cairngorms to the lair but that was a climb and auld john was no longer up to it as for their relationship that was strange as can be for more than sixty years ago bj had used to bounce him on her knee and here she was a young girl and him an old man the blood is the life auld john sat down opposite the wee mistress reached out to put a log on the fire in the great wide hearth and said a body grows auld truly auld but slowly john she answered very slowly and youll outlive most men aye and youve a lot to be thankful for for after all youve known him in his sleep ahve known him its true but tae see him up and aboot dye think and now his voice was low and his eyes narrow in the firelight narrow and feral over a long flat nose all things are possible in him john she told him as the stars and mistress moon spin their tracks through space and time slowly but surely his time comes around he may not stay down forever for just as your bones age and wither so do his and he has outlasted the centuries ive calculated his time over and over again and always it comes out the same four years is it the old mans voice was low almost a growl yet pleading in its eagerness is it down to just four years bonnie jean nodded again and repeated him three or four at most after six long centuries a drop in the ocean john and then and then it was an old story but he would hear it again then a legend born anew she answered a new creature in the heights along with the pine martens the golden eagles and the wildcats but just think john in his horseshoe mountains he knew the real cats the last of the sabretooths a new creature in the high crags he whiningly repeated her his yellow eyes blinking his excitement brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i and in the cities bonnie jean added dont forget the cities oh our master tried the other way the secret way all those many centuries ago it didnt work then and wont now but the old man protested only show a man something thats different be sure hell murder it come hell or high water if its strange and fails to conform its a goner and if its like him up there if its like the master war bonnie jean war indeed she agreed and as it was then when he first came among us so it is now except men have forgotten the old times the old legends and no longer believe and by the time they do it will be too late aye and theres no great black death now john to plague him and his and just as our master was driven here driven west and north by that black devouring fire so now he will light a flame and drive east except hell not stop but drive south and west too for in his time the world was so small why there are entire continents that he never saw or knew about but he will he will the black death stopped him consigning him to the everlasting dark auld john shivered not everlasting john she told him and when hes up its the red death that will light his way ah but nothing from poor mr poe though certainly it will seem like it no more hiding john when next he comes down from the mountains and the name of the pack shall be mankind they shall be legion she tossed back her hair grey as auld johns in the firelight and his enemies who or whatever remains of them the true death he nodded neither undeath nor any sort of sleep such as he has known but death forever amen to that she said and smiled when will ye go tae him give me soup your good broth and tea to brew and a little strong wild meat to take with me inverdruie sleeps when she wakes ill be long gone youll see me along the trail into the foothills as always then return and wait for me here but i may be gone a while so dont worry if i seem late til no worry he told her and my equipment safe and sound but are ye sure ye need it there was a chuckle in his voice she answered with a laugh of her own i could climb it blindfold as well you know then her laughter stilled and she sobered in a moment except i cant afford to slip my life means nothing but his aye lass aye he leaned across and took her hand he has lived too long to die like that cold and alone lonely in his lair bonnie jean said nothing but stared into the fire shortly john went to see to her food and make his preparations bj s climbing skills were prodigious working with enormous efficiency and at great speed and using only her sense of balance and the natural tenacity of long fingers and toes to defy gravity she seemed almost to adhere to a rock face and in all truth she scarcely required auld johns ropes pitons karabiners and similar paraphernalia of the professional climber but she took them with her anyway it was as she had explained as his guardian his keeper she simply could not afford to slip for while to bonnie jean the climb itself was little more than a thrill and her faith in her skill was absolute still she might make a slip which to him in his centuried sleep could easily mean the difference between undeath and the true death for the balance bj was required to maintain on the rock face wasnt nearly so delicate as the balance of his continued existence auld john knew all of this and though he was silent on the woodland trail where they walked still all of his thoughts were for bonnie jean and their mutual master yell take care lassie in the heights you know i will john there has been a rockfall or two good im always on the lookout for new routes early spring sunlight sharp and bright dappled their path through birch and scots pine bj didnt much like the sunlight stepping aside from the larger yellow splotches she felt glad that her climb would be mainly shaded by the bulk of the mountains back in inverdruie most people were still abed barely awake tossing and turning but mainly turning their backs on the light coming in through their windows on this fine but chilly sunday morning thered be church of course and animals to feed at the nearby nature reserves brown bears bison antelope and reindeer and maybe even a handful of visitors tourists at the gift shops in the villages nothing like the crush of a few months ago when the snow was deep at aviemore and the skiers dotted the slopes like a myriad brightly hurtling insects against winters blinding white backdrop aye and there were climbers too auld john reminisced but no out this way no for this was the cairngorms nature reserve more than a hundred square miles of mountain heights and wilderness the haunt of deer and wildcats of foxes otters and other creatures of the wild but rarely men and it was johns domain too these were the trails where he was a guide which made it easier to ensure that the most secret of the forest tracks remained secret oh sometimes even in the winter months some idiot climber would ignore all the posted warnings to bring his team in here and stray this way and sometimes they wouldnt make it out again it rather depended on brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i where they walked and especially where they climbed and also on who else might be climbing there now the ground was rising at a break in the trees bonnie jean and auld john paused and looked back along the way theyd come across loch an eilein with its crumbling castle bonnie jean was well acquainted with a local tradition that the old castle in the lake was much associated with the outlawed son of robert ii called the wolf of badenoch badenoch being the area east of the spey and along the cairngorms foothills ah but she also knew that the wolf had been dead for a hundred years before the castle was built which seemed to her to beg the question just which wolf was remembered here and just how well had diverse traditions kept themselves apart or how badly among the trees mossy granite outcrops began to show the tears o the titan mountains as auld john was wont to call them and at last they were through the foothills to the base of an almost sheer rock face and granite auld john informed unnecessarily an more than four thousand feet of it at that perpendicular well not quite he had carried her pack now he helped to transfer it to her person tied back her hair with his own clasp and filled a small pouch at her belt with chalk powder to keep her fingers dry for the climbing finally where the goings rough use the rope he advised for he dared not order and up she went four thousand feet of granite but by no means perpendicular not all of it in places the going was flat or very nearly so screefilled basins domed plateaux rocky reentries and pineclad saddles oh in one or two places it was sheer and in the worst place of all vertiginous to overhanging through five hundred feet of a traverse that would cause the best of climbers to blink and cringe back from it if only for a moment or two before the actual assault but to bonnie jeans mind that was what climbing was all about the challenge not so much of a challenge to her though whose business whose duty it had been to climb these rocks at least once in a threemonth every season of the year for the last one hundred and seventy years some six hundred and eighty times now she occasionally lost count bj had pitted herself against these heights and so knew each crack and crevasse every cave ledge and chimney along the way she knew where veins of rose quartz shone pink and purple in the grainy granite face and a chimney where curious smoky crystals or germs had weathered loose and lay in a neat pile like a natural cairn she knew where to avoid the aeries of the great golden eagles especially now in the mating and nesting season and used as landmarks the bruised and rusted pitons of yesteryear more often than not her own out of times when shed lacked experience and for every thousand feet she climbed she would move laterally a kilometer or more ever deeper into the mazy interior of the mountain system where few climbers had ventured before but in one hundred and seventy years especially the last thirty there had been climbers some of whom had come too close well the cairngorms were notoriously unforgiving mountains and in places they were entirely inaccessible some bodies had never been never would be discovered but bonnie jean knew where the bones of a handful of them lay at least knew too what was become of their flesh some two hours after midday she rested on a ledge overlooking a dark ravine with a waterfall and white water that rushed down to the swollen neardistant spey almost all the snows of winter had melted down into the earth and the rocks now to filter their way into falls and cataracts the heavy rains of the last few months had added to the tumult and the tumbling tributary four hundred and fifty feet below sent up spray to dampen the rocks higher up a series of caves opened into a far greater cavern system the lair itself bj could have perhaps should have chosen the easy route into the lair up onto the plateaus shattered roof and down through any one of several shafts into the dusty rubblestrewn heart of the place but this way had been a challenge albeit a small one for here the rock was rotten and given to crumbling thus it presented her with an opportunity to test secondary skills this time with the generally despised apparatus of the professional climber and having eaten just a bite and sipped a little water then for the first time during her climb pitons and hammer karabiners and fine light nylon rope came into play she used them all to form a hoist then cranked herself up onto the last ledge where a treacherously fractured window opened into the gloom of the lair and leaning back with her feet on the ledge and every ounce of her weight suspended on the rope she looked down through all that deadly height to where fangs of rock were blackened by the torrent and the gorge was a snarling gash of a mouth more terrible than any dark beasts almost and so into the lair which for all bj s previous visits was at least as fearsome a step as the actual climb itself once inside after a brief scramble through shrouding cobwebs accumulated dust and sharp stony debris bj wasted no time with the ease of any nightsighted animal and most wild creatures her eyes very quickly adjusted to the gloom had it been pitchblack they would have served her just as well so that even as she shrugged out of her brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i harness she was able to gauge fairly accurately her location in this cavern system which she had explored so many times before she knew where she was and therefore where he was and between them maybe two hundred feet of pitfalls and crumbling pathways jumbles of fallen hexagonal pillars and dizzy causeways over crevasses which for all she knew might well go down to the roots of the mountains on this one level she had explored the lair for this was his place but as for other possible levels she didnt know couldnt say and apart from the natural obstacles of this great cavern there was one other thing standing between bj and her master a thing yes and she shuddered at the thought of it even the wee mistress herself it was something of his she knew but still it was beyond reason beyond her reason anyway but it was sentient it knew things sensed things it would know she was here and it would stir when she passed by and it would know why she was here that it the thing itself was one of her reasons for just as bj s master hungered so did his creature that would be the part she disliked the one aspect of her duty that bothered her her masters needs were one thing but the needs of his creature were something else she disliked feeding it even with beasts blood also she never failed to be amazed by the fact that so little could satisfy so much but would it be the same when the thing was up surely he intended to bring it up else what was its purpose but bonnie jean had never inquired about it it wasnt her business to question but to guard and inform as it was her duty to obey the place was unquiet only take a single step away from the crack of light gleaming through the dusty irregular shape of the window and silence fell as if someone had switched it on or switched all sound off except for the echoes of the lair itself the dripping of water in various unseen locations and bjs own breathing her own muffled movements quiet yet unquiet but by no means a contradiction of terms the tumult of the gorge was dead here it couldnt find its way in something shut it out there was some light at least rays or curtains of dim light filtering dustily down from various faults in a ceiling of illdefined height and extent the shafts through which she might have descended if shed chosen a different route light in this place anyway but not where he lay for bj s master could no longer suffer direct sunlight the moon was his light and the full moon his glory and it would be the same for bj in time to come for she too was a moon child so far as possible she shunned the sun even now though as yet it wouldnt kill her not in her human form at least and she had often wondered why here why build a lair in this high place when radu might have found himself a place of darkness utter but as she knew well enough it had been a matter of circumstance not choice and anyway he had been used in a different age in a different world to a lofty manse indeed but then hed been used to many things in his time carrying her pack slung over her shoulder and following a trail of poorly arranged flagstones long since fallen from the ceiling bonnie jean set out through the maze of stony rubble in places the path was obscured almost obliterated where recent falls had crashed down and cavedin the paving stones or hurled them aside forming angular granite piles and jumbles of rock which were almost crystalline in their nitrefused shapes but recent in bjs terms meant other than it would to persons of normal longevity indeed it meant any time in the last ten decades still it was as well that her masters time would soon be up that he would soon be up for this place wouldnt last forever and in this modern world well repairs were out of the question oh there remained a handful of thralls in various parts and bj s girls of course but getting them up here safely and secretly would be nigh impossible and the task itself utterly beyond them this place had been built before bjs time and the thralls who had built it for him had died at their work but in that bygone time all the land around was a wilderness when prying eyes were few and far between thus her thoughts ran as she approached the place of the thing that dark cave to one side of the main cavern where the light never reached and the silence was near absolute the physical silence anyway but the atmosphere or aether if there really were such a thing seemed to seethe here she felt the oppressive weight of the place almost tangibly upon her shoulders bj was no mentalist it was only the awesome strength of her masters sendings that made possible communication with him let alone his creature but as always in this place so close to the thing she sensed emanations of weird entity the foetal fumblings of that which waited to be born and because it was her duty despite the fact that she hated it still she turned from the path however briefly entered the cave of the thing and thus announced her presence and as her eyes adjusted to the greater darkness so the aura of awful sentience of a vacant yet savage awareness grew more tangible yet and the sure knowledge that she in her turn had been recognized an outline or silhouette took shape in the darkness one which radiated its own almost imperceptible red glow like the embers of an almostdead fire in a dark room it was a cylindrical shape formed of hexagonal granite columns standing on end like the staves of a barrel at their bases these pillars were buried in rubble and buttressed with brian lumley boulders to stop them toppling outwards they formed the walls of a massive container or vat but several of them were cracked and others were slightly splayed or stood askew or had been forced apart by the geological stresses of the mountains allowing trickles of a resinous sealant or preservative to escape from within and form puddles hardening to amber at the bases of the surrounding boulders bj approached the vat reached out tentatively at first but finally placed her hands upon two of the columns the stone was cold to her touch it shouldnt convey anything but that it was stone nothing of the nature of its contents should be apparent but something was apparent and bj thought ifs like listening to the sea in a sounding shell except the sea has an entirely natural sound with nothing of sentience and entirely oblivious to the rest of the world around it it cant respond except to ignore but this thing her masters creature was not oblivious and even as she listened to it so it listened to her and thud she had felt heard or sensed it before and didnt recoil in another five minutes or fifteen or twenty if she cared to stand here so long she would hear it again the sloweddown almoststilled hibernating heartbeat of the thing no not hibernating she corrected herself but suspended indefinitely extended waiting and alive oh yes alive in there her masters future what guardian something to take her place when he was up again that was a thought she had thought before even scarcely daring to think it his own fierce creature to guard him in his lair thud and this time because she stood there rapt in thought and perhaps unworthy thoughts at that because he had assured her often enough that she would always have a place with him bonnie jean was startled and snatched back her hands was it intelligent like him she wondered would it perhaps be jealous of her this unborn thing she moved quickly to the side of the stone vat climbed a stairway of stacked slabs finally gazed down into the solidified murky swirl of a mainly opaque luminous resin reservoir and with eyes feral in the darkness she kneeled at the rim to peer through the crusted surface deep into the looser liquids beneath at the foetal thing that was curled there that massive wedge of a head as seen in profile those long dog jaws the dark orbit of an eye big as a platter the last time she was here its heartbeat had been slower and the great lid of its eye entirely closed asleep but now thud necroscope the lost years vol i the thing quickened beyond a doubt and the lid of its eye seemed gashed where a crack of yellow light glowed from within brighter than its protective resin sheath bonnie jean stood up descended the stairs left the cave for the less fearsome labyrinth of the cavern complex and finally ran breathlessly to her master to radu lykan part three vampire genesis i shaitan his rise and fall cams sapiens the werewolf connection shaitan the unborn came out of the vampire swamps oh a long time ago the first and worst of the wamphyri the first of the great vampires shaitan was the source of undeath he came out of the west and saw that the darkness of starside was good but he felt through the thinning mists the withering rays of a hot sun blazing through the high passes of the barrier mountains it turned his skin rough and red so he took the lefthand path round the mountains and came upon the boulder plains of gaunt and gloomy starside whereon dwelled nothing of any threat while southwards lay the sun which was injurious to him and all such as he would bring into the world from which time forward he would always choose a dark and sinistral path through life when he knew a strange dark thirst he drank of the sweet water tumbling down from the mountains it quenched his thirst but did not truly satisfy him when he felt a strange dark hunger he ate grasses herbs some bitter fruits these served to fill him but the hunger would not pass it was the hunger of an evil spore a leech which had taken root within shaitan body mind and soul if there had been a soul shaitan was unclothed but unashamed for he knew that he was beautiful and he would display his beauty so he compared himself to the beasts of the wild of the swamps foothills and mountains and saw that their beauty came from their innocence for which reason it was useless to display himself or even impose his will upon them unintelligent innocent they could not deny that he knew best they would bend to his will too easily wherefore he would impose that will upon others of his own design except where were they travelling east he looked for them but discovered them not yet a while and in his loneliness he took bats for familiars whose flying skills he envied eventually he came upon trogs cavern unmen and women who were scarcely beautiful and not greatly like unto himself but shaitan brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i corrupted them anyway filling them with his vices and making them sick and dead and undead he took trog women to his bed and there was issue such children as were born were hideous insane ever hungry they suckled blood not milk and grew too fast their mothers lay on them to smother them shaitan devoured one in order to taste of its flesh it satisfied the hunger of his leech barely for a while so then with the bats and the trogs shaitan had gathered minions unto himself but was this all there was the parasite within him was mature now it desired more it lived on shaitans blood as he lived on the blood of others but was not satisfied with its hosts regimen and so he would seek out other men on whom to impose his will except he sometimes wondered whose will was it his or his parasite leechs and from then on the question of free will and integrity of spirit became matters of great importance to shaitan even assuming dimensions of obsession in him and in all subsequent vampires the trogs likened shaitan to certain men on the far side of the mountains in sunside he determined to conquer sunside which would be as subtle as all his works first he would approach the sunsiders as their friend later as their master and so in the twilight before the night shaitan went into sunside and in the gloamy foothills was drawn to the fires of hunters east and west as far as his eyes could see the fires lit up the night like beacons the sunsider tribes were legion in his black heart shaitan was glad believing that at last he had found true men upon which to impose his will his dreams of conquest quickly evaporated with starsides trogs it had been easy but these men were very different and their women different too unlike trog females szgany women were lovely creatures shaitan was the great seducer he seduced and he murdered but his crime was discovered and he was hounded out of the szgany camps his trackers set a wolf upon him and for the first time shaitan used metamorphism to change his shape and become more animal than the wolf itself furious in his rage he slew not only the watchdog but certain of his human pursuers and took others for his thralls for as a dweller among starsides cavern trogs shaitan had discovered his power over men how his bite infected their blood with an incurable fever until they became his thralls for ever and ever and hidden in a vampire mist called out of his own pores and up from the earth shaitan and one of his thralls went up into the dark foothills finding refuge in a cave for the purple dawn twilight was fading and a poisoned golden blister was poising itself even now on the southern horizon far across the forest shaitans symbiont had become a twoedged sword impossible to accept its advantages without its disadvantages sunlight it was a seething agony in his eyes and against his hide it burned him visibly steamed the moisture from his flesh and sapped his great strength he could go out from the cave for seconds but minutes would deplete him horribly and an hour would kill him and his leech both he had suspected it which was why he had gone into sunside in the evening but now he had proof positive the sun was his mortal enemy the long day crawled endlessly by more men of the szgany whom shaitan had vampirized came to him as thralls when night fell he took these poor creatures over the mountains and down into starside where several trog thralls were waiting on the return of their master now his band numbered thirteen in all and shaitan named them his disciples and thirteen would become a number of illomen from that time on in more worlds than one coming down into starside shaitan saw a light shining up into the night which one of his band said must be the fallen white sun that some called a gateway into hell shaitan was curious and said he must see this hellgate they climbed a low crater wall stood on its rim and gazed down upon the dome of cold fire within blinded the trogs staggered to and fro one tripped fell landed on a ledge close to the white glare fearful of the strange light he put up a hand to fend it off his hand touched the dazzles surface and sank into it he cried out in his guttural fashion as the hellgate dragged him in and swallowed him whole and shaitan said this shall be a punishment for any who would offend me three times three chances for i am forgiving as you see and there shall be other punishments aye i am the lord shaitan who can make men undead anyone who would do me harm let him first think on this i shall drain his blood and bury him deep in the ground and he shall lie there and scream forever or until he stiffens to a stone in the earth and that land there to the north i perceive it is icy cold and no fit habitation therefore let him who would deny me beware in my house there shall be no warm bed or soft womanflesh for him no kind master to guide and instruct him neither wonders to be witnessed nor mysteries revealed for i shall banish him north to freeze in the ice all alone but for him who would obey me in all things and be my true servant a rich red life forever aye even unto death and beyond so be it lord shaitan and his followers came to a region of giant stone stacks weathered out of the mountains in their bases they were fortified with fallen scree jumbles in their columns were fissures ledges and caverns many as vast as halls shaitan much admired these soaring necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley stacks which were very grand and gaunt one of these shall be my househe said and a thrall told him they are like unto the aeries of the mountain eagles aye said shaitan the aeries of the wamphyri he set to and built his house the task was enormous only a vampire and his thralls could ever accomplish it except shaitan would build not only a house but an empire of vampires he recruited trogs out of their caverns and sent his lieutenants into sunside to hunt szgany and in the bowels of his rearing house shaitan experimented with his own metamorphic flesh to furnish himself with all of his requirements he bred trogs into cartilage creatures whose minds were small and bodies elastic from these he made leathers and coverings for the aeries exterior stairways or articles of furniture for his rooms and all of his materials still living a life of sorts gradually petrifying and becoming permanent in their places he mated men with trog women the issue of which was unseemly he got foul bloated things all gross and mindless which he bred into gaslings for the heating of the stack and into thingswhichconsume for his refuse pits shaitan took mindless vampire flesh and converted it he would build flying creatures and soar out from his aerie upon the winds like his familiar bats at first he failed later he provided his flyers with the altered brains of men that they should have something of volition all of which creatures nascent and fullformed were his thralls word of his works went abroad into sunside starside was now damned and shunned utterly by men at least but by now the szgany had problems other than shaitan and his raiders far in the west the swamps were a spawning ground for monsters foolish men and innocent creatures went down to the scummy waters to drink and things other than men and wolves came up and in the early years of shaitans ascendancy a great many beings who were like unto him came over from sunside to build their houses in the rearing stone aeries of the wamphyri and because they were even as strong as shaitan and much of a kind he made no protest but let them be for in any case there was space enough among the great stacks and even shaitan was unable to lay claim to all of them also across the barrier mountains there was food and entertainment for all still as a precaution shaitan fashioned fierce warriorcreatures to fill any wouldbe enemies with terror and in the next two hundred years the wamphyri became a great many too many on sunside the szgany had become clans of travellers moving nomadically from place to place by day and sleeping in deep forests or caves at night even so the lords of starside gave them no peace and the toll in blood was monstrous then shaitan saw his error in permitting other lords to wax so strong and so many he determined to get bloodsons out of comely women with which to whelm the other lords and keep them down and his sons and daughters were many of the latter he used them in their turn for his own flesh was the sweetest which would be the way of it with vampires down all the ages and as the lords and ladies of the wamphyri proliferated so they degenerated going from evil to evil and descending depth to irredeemable depth eventually all of the greater stacks had masters or mistresses the lesser aeries were occupied there was no room left in all the heights for men and their sons daughters thralls and creatures and so finally they warred for possession of the stacks until starsides skies were full of flyers and warriors fighting under the icechip stars and in the ramparts of the great aeries gongs sounded wardrums pounded and banners fluttered displaying the devices of their masters vampire destroyed vampire even fathers sons and brothers as the boulder plains and lands around were drenched in blood and littered with the grotesque shattered corpses of fallen beasts even shaitan came under attack but he was clever in the defence of his aerie and went not out to war but as various lords were weakened in stacks close by then he would swoop on them and put them down in this manner a cluster of aeries all came under shaitans command when his strategy was seen the others called a truce and came upon him as a single force and shaitan was almost trapped in shaitanstack only his metamorphism saved him when like the fallen angel he was he used it to develop a bats design and glide from his higher ramparts to safety in a secret place meanwhile his forces had rallied and regrouped under his lieutenants and shaitanstack had not been taken the bloodwars lasted a hundred years the fashioning of flyers and warriors became an art wamphyri numbers were decimated in all the reek and roil of mindless slaughter it was the era in which sunsides szgany backed off from the abyss and breathed again and reorganized their lives and what little remained of their society except it couldnt last for shaitan was now the undisputed lord of vampires the high magistrate to whom lesser lords took their disputes for his judgement and as the clamour of war subsided so the period of mercifully infrequent raids on sunside was over and the nightmare sprang up again with renewed vigour for now the wamphyri must see to the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i provisioning of their ravaged and undernourished aeries whose sustenance roamed on sunside for sixty years this was the way of it and shaitan doled out hunting permits and took his tithe of trembling flesh from whatever the others brought back but the lesser lords loathed him and would whelm him if they could he knew it and when the coup came at last was ready to put it down all who had conspired against him he brought to trial even his own son who he banished to the icelands the least of his punishments as for the others who had plotted to overthrow him these were several and their punishments various some were buried alive on the boulder plains to stiffen to stones in the shuddering earth one nonari the gross was tossed with his entire court and the leaders of his szgany supplicants into the helllands gate and if this nonaris bloodname ferenczy had been a curse to the szgany of this world then it was destined to become just such a curse in another likewise banished through the gate were the drakul brothers karl and egon who rivalled shaitan in their evil and one other who was a great thorn in shaitans side for in the earliest days of shaitans coming he had tried to work his will on such as radu lykan but all in vain the grey brothers of the barrier mountains acknowledged no master but the leader of the pack and owned no mistress but the hurtling silver moon at her full and radu lykan was of that suborder of wamphyri a wolf or more properly a werewolf lord shaitan abhorred such doglords the sons of wolves and even if thered been no bloodwars he would have found a way to dispose of such as radu so for a while there was peace again on starside and a truce between the wamphyri lords and ladies but because they were wamphyri it couldnt last greedy jealous territorial they were a plague unto themselves and eventually even shaitan was whelmed and fell and was driven from starside into the cold and inhospitable icelands all of these things are legends told aforetime but what remains to be told was previously undisclosed perhaps wolves like men and bears foxes and bats and other species were creatures of both worlds sunsidestarside and the socalled helllands on the far side of the starside gate perhaps springing from the one cosmic germ a universal soup of genesis similar forms of life were preordained in the primal plastic of many worlds the fossil record of earth suggests it was so but unless some palaeontologist was fortunate or unfortunate enough to know exactly where to dig he would never in all the world find anything remotely resembling the wamphyri of sunsidestarside he would not discover them among the strata of earths prehistory for in their beginning earth was not the homeworld of the wamphyri but for an accident of nature the wamphyri could never have ventured here there would have been wolves of the wild in our world but not werewolves of the latter it has been told how men and beasts went down to the vampire swamps to drink and how creatures other than men but most certainly beasts returned from that place until they learned better the grey brothers of the mountains were among the first victims of the swampborn horror contaminated with a vampire spore occasionally a sick wolf would return to the pack but he would be different and changed forever like any human wanderer or explorer suffering the same fate he would become an outcast from his own kind men savaged by such an animal would usually die to rise up again as vampire thralls but without a master then they in turn must flee from their families and friends to wander as outcasts until their former brothers tracked them down or the furnace sun found them wanting or they could cross the mountains into the dubious safety of starside but they were different again from the victims of human vampires not only did they fear the sunlight but revelled in the moonlight for there was something of the grey brothers in them whose mistress is the full and tumbling moon also they were generally insane lunatics or at the very least they lacked total command of their senses as such and despite that they were dangerous they fell easy prey to men the sun the human vampires of starside thus in the language and psychology of the world beyond the starside gate it was such pitiful creatures as these who would have been the true lycanthropes madmen who thought that they were wolves except there was another sort paradoxically and for all that it sickened such lifeforms as suffered its infection vampirism was the source of an incredible longevity for the sickness was spiritual and of the soul while life was physical and of the blood which meant that rarely mercifully rarely a wolf infected with a vampire spore would live long beyond the years of a true wolf and its leech would mature then the real danger when a wolf such as this should savage a man for the vampire is tenacious and the bite of this wolf would carry a deal more than venomous spittle indeed it might even carry the egg of its leech by means of which a true vampire extends something of itself down all the ages and whether or no the victim died he would rise up again undead and wamphyri such men were they were men but the vampire egg of a wolf was in them with whatever it had contracted or inherited of its former hosts makeup and unlike the poor lycanthropes of a different civilization and world whose blood might be infected however slightly with some faint trace necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley descended from starside the werewolves of that parallel world did indeed have the power of transformation metamorphosis into their ancestral form all it took was the moon flying full over the boulder plains to transform man into beastman to turn certain lords of the wamphyri into men with the faces forms and ferocious appetites of wild dogs homo sapiens canis sapiens loupgarou werewolf radu lykan banished through the helllands gate by lord shaitan as we have seen was one such but before he was a doglord radu was a man and this is his story radu had been a loner a mountain man until he and his companion wolf had ventured east of the barrier mountains into the swampy badlands he had been a man who rarely bothered with his own kind favouring the company of a dog of the wild whose broken leg he had healed when he discovered the animal halfburied in sliding scree since when they had been inseparable but where other szgany loners were usually dull slothful fellows disinclined to the companionship of the camp or to working alongside their gipsy brothers on sunside or defective of mind or spirit which might tend to make them brutish turning them into thieves vagabonds and finally outcasts from the camps of the szgany by virtue of the fact that none would have truck with them radu was very different he had been born into the band of giorga zirescu a bully of a tribal chieftain whose twin sons were no better than their father made worse by virtue of giorgas influence and protection ion and lexandru zirescu had grown up with radu or rather he had grown up suffering their constant brutalities but no more or less than the rest of the tribe suffered under giorga and his sons for while the szgany zirescu were strong in numbers they were weak in resolve and easily cowed by their chief and despite that giorga was loathed he and his sons were huge men as hardheaded as they were hardfisted radus mother had died giving life to his sister magda that had been when he was seven years old following which his own childhood had been lost to caring for the small girlchild while his father freji hunted gathered or beat the bounds on the perimeter of giorgas territory in the lee of the barrier mountains where they commenced their gradual slump towards the western swamps and badlands and in frejis frequent absence radu fell prey to the zirescu brothers the twins were two years radus senior and their various torments ranged from trifling insults to major beatings they would even have hurt little magda if radu had not been there to redirect and absorb their spite so protecting her but he always was which served to earn him yet more insults when ion and lexandru were wont to catcall and name him radu the wetnurse and so forth radu was tall indeed and for all that his father was a slight man radus height was extraordinary aged nine he was tall as a fifteenyearold yet lithe and willowy as a lath or as a lass as ion and lexandru would have it perhaps it was his nature to be thin more likely it was the lack of good food that kept him that way but he was not without physical strength and likewise his character was strong however repressed his face was usually expressionless with dark deepsunken and humourless eyes long cheekbones and jaw and strong straight teeth in a thin mouth closed as if clamped shut for he had learned even as a child that it was best to say very little especially in the company or presence of the zirescu brothers as a child radus hair had been black black as night black as jet but even in his early teens it had started to turn grey and ashen streaks were prominent at his veined sensitive temples his nose was long but not severe until ion zirescu broke it in a onesided scuffle and it healed squat at the base and hooked in the middle lending radu a hawkish mien tempered by selfimposed strictures of iron will with which he held himself in rein it was necessary that he exercise a firm control over himself if only to appease his ailing father who was a pacifist at best a coward at worst and no match for the zirescus at any time which might explain why radu usually lost his battles for while the zirescu twins were trouble enough in themselves their cronies among the tribes young men were numerous and the times several when these had held radu down while the brothers kicked and pummelled him so the young radu had learned to control himself while events shaped which would be quite uncontrollable into radus midteens the bullying of the zirescus went on unabated the youth suffered many a bloodying many a sore bone and broken face but never once complained to his father whose health had for long and long been failing but if freji lykan was feeling the weight of his years and the weariness of many deprivations under his swine of a chief then giorga was likewise declining except in his case it was the good plum brandy and surfeit of meat that were taking their toll and of course his brutish sons looked on like the vultures they were wondering where and when he would fall down for the last time and who would bully the szgany zirescu when giorga was no more perhaps both of them if only out of mutual fear and suspicion oh for they knew well enough how much they were hated among a majority of their people all of which brings us to a time approximate with the era of shaitan when he came out of the west on starside and built his aerie on the boulder plains and the swamps in the badlands seethed with vampire spores but as yet the incidence of their evil manifestations on sunside brian lumley were few and far between as in all mankind however other evils were ever present and in the szgany zirescu the evil was in the name of their most prominent family the zirescus themselves the morning came when freji could no longer work his eyesight was failing and in any case he had never been much of a hunter now his back gave him such pain that he could scarcely walk and it was his turn to go into the forest to gather nuts and fruit in the szgany zirescu a man worked till he dropped then lay there while the tribe moved on or until he found the strength to get up again there were few drones among the zirescus with the exception of giorga of course his sons and a handful of their cronies and precious few old ones and despite that freji was halfcrippled his chief sent him stumbling off into the forest with a basket from which task he failed to return the sunside days were worth four of those in a parallel world that lay all unknown beyond the starside gate yet night fell and still freji was not back radu had had his own duties that day likewise his sister magda now grown to a beautiful girl even as beautiful as her mother had been and when finally radu left the camp and went off into the woods to search for his father he went without knowing or suspecting that it would be magda or her beauty or her loss that would finally forge the iron in his blood into cold hard steel magda and the zirescu twins of course but when hed found his fathers body and seen the truth of his dying that it had been no accident and certainly not the natural end of frejis life then the rest of it had gone blazing across radus mind like some mad meteorite through sunsides night skies for more than a year now the zirescu twins had been paying court to magda not yet fifteen giorga had said that eventually she must choose one or the other magda had scorned both of them she knew that already they were a scourge among the szgany zirescus girls and young unmarried women and among some of the married ones too her father freji who had a parenfs say in such matters had been stalling the twins and their father telling them that magda was too young but it was not uncommon among szgany girls to take husbands at the age of thirteen and freji had known he couldnt delay matters indefinitely giorga had fumed cursed threatened he wanted grandsons from his sons real grandsons and not bastards to carry his name on freji lykan had fumbled and fawned but still hed stood his ground the twins had poured scorn on magda and declared that she would end up an old maid or a tart for any man and deep down inside radu had bubbled and boiled and now this freji stiff and dead murdered and left to the flies in an area of the necmscope the lost years vol i forest rarely visited his body had been tumbled into dense undergrowth radu discovered it when a vixen started away from the corpse then after lighting a small fire he had seen the cause of his fathers death the long blade of an ironwood knife broken off and still buried in frejis thin back a cowardly attack typical of the backstabbing zirescu twins but frejis wicker basket was missing and never a sign of the fruit and nuts which he had surely gathered that morning back at the szgany zirescu encampment radu went direct to the keeper of the foraging called provisioner borisciu and asked him if anyone had brought in food from the forest that day but despite that radu held himself under tight rein perhaps borisciu saw something in his face answering radus question carefully he told him that it had been an extremely good day but surely he must already know that since he had been one of the hunters hadnt he from the forest radu repeated himself clutching the others wrist however coldly im talking about greenstuffs not meat provisioner and now borisciu was sure that there was something hard and cold and different in radus eyes fruits aye he answered but isnt the forest always good to us and quickly as if to change the subject but the catch in fishes was exceptional a good day at the river radu keep it to yourself and ill perhaps find you a fat trout for your sister to cook for you and your fathers supper with which hed paused remembering that someone had told him freji lykan was late coming in fruits radus grip tightened more yet while his voice became a growl tell me about the fruit and nuts did anyone bring in plums apples almonds a wicker basket of fruit out of the woods tell me quickly radu i who was out gathering today do you know what im saying or were you in on this too provisioner borisciu what boriscius mouth fell open in on something me why the govasci family were gathering today likewise andreas tuvi and but here he paused again and and your father i remember now but the provisioners eyes had suddenly gone very wide he was frightened for his own skin something that had struck him strange earlier in the day when the zirescu twins had come in very quietly and secretively with a great basket of fruit struck him even stranger now or perhaps not and what is it that you are thinking radu he trembled in the others grip what is it with your father dead radu hissed in answer releasing him with a shove so that brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i provisioner borisciu staggered back behind his counter against the side of his caravan dead murdered in the forest and his basket taken by some enemy of the szgany zirescu no doubt borisciu gasped wouldbe settlers claimjumpers landthieves on giorgas territory but radu cocked his head on one side and said enemies of the szgany zirescu aye its true the twins themselves at which borisciu knew hed been right even though hed scarcely dared admit it even to himself and radu saw it in the provisioners eyes nodding slowly grimly the young man said now tell me did they bring in a basket of fruit his voice was cold as the wind through the mountain passes though his eyes showed little or no emotion his lips were thin and pale his chest rose and fell rose and fell as if from running and suddenly borisciu saw the right and wrong of it the coldblooded murder of it and could keep his peace no longer they did he gulped at last a basket laden with fruit and nuts and i remember thinking it strange that for the first time in as long as i could remember the zirescu twins had done a little hard work dirty work aye the other muttered turning away they must be mad or halfwitted to bring that basket back here or they dont give a damn the provisioner called after him quietly because for too long they and their father have stood taller than any law even their own but you youre grown to a tall one in your own right only go carefully lad and look for them at hzaks brandy stall they were halfway drunk when passed by an hour and a half ago by now theyll have had a skinful they shouldnt give you too much trouble but whats this will you go hotblooded and without a weapon i like you radu lykan even as i liked your father id hate to see you dead too good advice radu went to the caravan of freji lykan now his and found it dark and still the lamps unlit the door swinging ajar in a night breeze but an empty clay jug lay on the grass outside and a whiff of brandy still drifting on the air foul breath of the beasts who had been here before him magda was in the bushes close by where theyd dragged her used her and left her broken and naked and dead and radu incapable of believing it he could only sit holding her in his arms rocking her and shaking his head until in a little while he grew cold then hot then bitterly cold again and trembling as from a fever or from the fury building inside as he pictured in his minds eye that which he could not bear to picture the blood under her fingernails some of which were broken a sure sign of the furious fight shed put up the coarseweave scarf around her neck with which theyd choked her screams and eventually her life the bruises and other signs upon her tanned body many hands had gripped magdas flesh to hold her down even as radu had been held down upon a time their fingers digging in to leave disgraceful impure marks on what had been purest of all and all of them had shared in her shared in her and there had been more than just the zirescu twins back to the caravan radu went his feet finding their own way for his mind was somewhere else to the box under his bed where in the afternoon he had cleaned his crossbow and wrapped it in an oiled rag until the next time for now it was the next time except he wasnt after goats now but pigs then to the campfire where the coarse guttural laughter of drunken men or louts rang out loud in the redflickering light and a halfdozen of them sitting there where decent men no longer sat for the szgany zirescu were ashamed of themselves but no shame here only whispers and jeers and the mention of of a name magdas name but to have heard it from the rubbery brandysodden lips of her violators and murderers to have heard it in such a context thats a fuck ill never forget and tight as the skin on a tambourine well until we were all done with her anyway the speaker was one arlek bargosi he burst out laughing at his own coarse wit then coughed choked and lurched to his feet the others looked to see what was wrong with him and saw the flighted half of a crossbow bolt sticking out of arleks adams apple and the reddripping barb protruding from the back of his neck arlek clutched uselessly at the stout ironwood shaft said urk urk urk then spewed blood and fell on his face in the fire and as hot cinders flew this way and that radu lykan stepped into view stretched the gut on his weapon and laid a second bolt in the tillers groove but radu was changed his face no longer expressionless but broken in a nightmarish grin his eyes reflecting the red firelight and teeth bared like bars of white light where saliva foamed in the corners of his mouth taller and greyer than ever he looked and even more hawklike except the hawk was blooded now and stooping to its second prey the zirescu twins shot to their feet bulky bearded red with booze they were nevertheless sober in a moment for this time in the astonished silence they heard the thrum as radu released his bolt and the hiss as it flew true to ions heart or would have flown true if another of their cronies had not stood up and put himself stumblingly in the way that ones name was kherl fumari and radus bolt smashed through his spine and pushed out his jacket a little in front before it lodged there and as kherl gave a gurgling cough and crumpled to his knees ion zirescu saw how close he had come for kherl clutched at him as he slid to earth and looked up into his face with eyes already glazing over and there stood radu grinning his mad wild grin chill as the night but fluid as a river nocking his weapon and sliding home his third bolt on the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i tiller a shot destined never to be fired behind him a massive figure loomed out of the darkness that of giorga zirescu himself a club was in giorgas hand he hefted it then swung it with smashing force against the back of radus head and that was that giorga tossed the club aside scowled at his dumbfounded sons and their stumbling colleagues and huh he growled as well i still have a friend or two despite that i sired such as you two father we lexandru started to speak be quiet his father told him do you think dont know what brought all this about well i do i was woken from my sleep by a friend as i said and he had overheard you talking about it round the fire radus sister magda dead and by your hands six of you onto one girl this pair of mangy corpses here kherl fumari and arlek bargosi and the ferenczy brothers rakhi and lagula giorga glowered at the ferenczys where they stood shuffling their feet and glancing slyeyed at each other and you two of course not all our fault ion shook his tousled head it was you who sent us after freji to do him in well and there was that in radus eyes as told us he knew he must have found his father out in the woods as for the girl that was an accident she wouldnt hold still coming closer round the fire the old man kicked arlek bargosi in the side so that he rolled over out of the embers smoke and the smell of roasting meat came up from arleks scorched corpse his black face crackled and popped giorga stepped around his body and paused where kherl fumari lay sprawled on the trampled grass huh he said again a hell of a todo all this and to ion help me with kherl ion stepped forward and met giorgas fist like a rock smashing into his face never accuse me again giorga stood over him where he fell never answer me back in any way do you understand and ion could only look up dazedly at his father dab at his bloody mouth and nod giorga nodded too glanced from face to face narrowed his eyes and muttered now then listen in and ill tell you whats to be done the four gathered round him and waited while he considered it then first the girl he said where is she lexandru started to answer but giorga cut him short no dont bother telling me i dont want to know two of you can collect her from wherever she is take her into the woods and bury her and bury her deep he looked scathingly at his sons later when everyone has their heads down you two had better do the same for freji lykan except this time make sure no one can find him ever as for radu if that clout i gave him on the head didnt do for him the river will so drag him to the river bank where its deep put a weighted rope round his neck and toss him in in the morning were moving on the next time we come round this way therell be nothing of evidence left thats it a whole family dealt with and our hands clean ion said and no one will ask questions giorga nodded probably but this is how it was radu went mad he was always the weird one as everyone knows quiet and sneaky and what have you so he was overheard arguing with his father then he must have followed freji into the woods and done away with him his sister guessed the truth of it and accused him he threatened her and she ran off knowing that she might come back and tell what she suspected radu made to go after her before he could leave camp kherl fumari and arlek bargosi who had learned something of the story from the frightened girl challenged him radu killed them one in a cowardly fashion from the rear and ran off as for the veracity of the tale why heres poor arlek all done to a turn and radus bolt in his neck and heres kherl with another bolt in his back and radus crossbow lying where he dropped it and there were witnesses you four all of this was tonight you must work out the finer details for yourselves for from now on i dont want anything to do with it but in any case and since well never see any of the lykans again therell be no one to deny your story as giorga finished speaking ion and lexandru looked at each other a mutual message however silent passed between them that theyd better have words with provisioner borisciu too to ensure that his lips were likewise sealed or maybe to seal them permanently if they werent already and well what are you waiting for giorga wanted to know best get to it before this spreads any further and all four of them they got to it radu knew nothing of the fact that he was dumped in the river and that a big rock dragged him down to the mud and weeds but the zirescu twins had been very sober by then and in something of a hurry the knot around his neck was fumbled it had slipped loose before he hit the bottom then the current found him buoyed him up and whirled him downstream midnight found him on his back where wavelets washed white pebbles at a bend in the river he was tethered by weeds supported by a mat of drifted branches the swelling at the back of his head was large as a hens egg but apart from a handful of scratches and bruises he was in one piece and felt all the better for it after hed emptied his system of river water he remembered well something of the night before the vengeful killing he had done certainly and of being knocked down and dragged through nightdark undergrowth fragments of whispered conversation but precious little still it was enough for now sleep and necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley warmth were what radu needed most to give the soft spot at the back of his head a chance to harden up he managed to get a fire going dried out his clothes and got back into them built a bed of bracken and grasses to sleep out the night and spent most of the next day in sleeping too and in trying to forget about his father and his sister it was hard but he tried anyway because by then hed decided to forget about mankind in general and be a loner one of the strange wild men who came down out of the hills now and then to sit by a campfire in the night except radu would be a real loner no campfires for him but his own and no mans company either all his life hed known the brutalities of his brother men and for all he knew it would be the same in any tribe as it had been with the szgany zirescu with which radu lykan was gone from the szgany of sunside and claimed by the forest and the wild mountains he had no friend but himself no cares but his own no counsel but that of the sun moon and stars for the first time in his life he was free and he moved from place to place and territory to territory as if there were no bounds to speak of taking to the ways of the wild as if it had been preordained thus radu became a creature of nature a man alone who went where his fancy took him he left no tracks and skirted or otherwise avoided the camps of men but more especially he vowed to keep apart from the szgany zirescu for he knew that if he returned to them it would be a bloody thing his blood or theirs whichever but he also knew that having tasted the blood of his foes hed found it to his liking which meant it could easily become a habit two of his had died and two of theirs had paid the price let that suffice let giorga lexandru and ion zirescu and the ferenczy brothers stew in the juice of their own miserable existence and if they thought radu was dead so be it he was dead to them anyway east lay the territories of the szgany hagi the szgany tireni the mirlus lidescis and many another band or tribe radu often heard their babble saw their fires reflected from clouds drifting low over the woods at night read their boundary marks and crossed their trails but other than that he had nothing to do with them and they never once knew he was there so he wandered the length and breadth of sunsides woods he climbed through the foothills to the treeline turned west and explored the passes and mountain heights for a year two three he was alone until the day when he found a great white shewolf trapped in the scree where the flank of the mountain had slipped a little and it was a rare strange thing radu had been hungry and could have killed and eaten the wolf it would have been easy hed stolen a good crossbow in his wanderings and could have put a bolt in her then dug her out and built a fire to roast her joints she was a dog true but she was meat but looking into her great feral yellow eyes radu decided against it he too had been crippled in his time by apathy and cowardice and by the shame of the szgany zirescu unable to escape from the shadow of a shameless leader but hed freed himself grown strong in his freedom and survived this shewolfs crippling was a purely physical thing a forepaw was broken where it stuck up awkwardly from the rubble and debris and she was unable to drag herself free but radu saw parallels and couldnt bring himself to kill her it was one of those strange paradoxes if shed been funning with a pack he wouldnt have thought twice about shooting her but now he made his way out onto the dangerous sloping surface of the sliding scree and patiently dug her free and with every passing moment the treacherous rocks could have slipped and fallen away grinding both of them into oblivion or the bitch could have turned on him and grabbed his throat but the mountain held its breath and the shewolf made no such vicious protest finally radu put a rope round her chest and dragged her to one side at which the scree jumble gave a shudder and a mighty groan and avalanched down onto sunside well maybe she knew radu had saved her life but whether or no she let him splint her paw and accepted cooked food out of his hand when he shot and roasted a rabbit and a day later when radu thought she could probably make it on her own and set off west again the shewolf came hobbling after him for while her pack had forsaken her this man had not and she would not forsake him after that going from strength to strength eventually she was fully recovered from which time on there were two of them in radus entire life this incident was one of the very few good things that had ever happened to him who could have guessed that it would result in the very worst thing of all necroscope the lost years vol i ii changeling in radus dreams his father and sister lived again and walked and talked with him reminding him of his past waking was invariably a bad time when suddenly he would know that they were dead of course and discover himself a loner and but for the company of singer so named for the fact that when radu sang to himself of an evening she would join in to serenade the moon he suspected he might very easily lose his mind nor would he be the first loner to go mad from the solitude of his ways but singer was there hunting with and for radu constantly by his side more of a friend and companion than any human creature he had ever known except for the mother he had loved for so short a time and his family which was no more but despite the presence of the white shewolf ever more frequently he would find himself dwelling upon the fate of his father and sister and the fact that hed been thwarted in the hour of his vengeance at the time two for two had seemed satisfactory now he felt the scales had been weighted again him and knew how hed been cheated looking down on western sunside from the heights where the barrier mountains commenced to crumble to the swamps he would fancy he saw the fires of zirescu encampments and despite his szgany vow to be gone from the western forests forever he would feel this oh so strong compulsion to return for however brief and bloody a time he was a man fullgrown now firm in all his limbs still lean but springy as a sapling swift as a bolt from a crossbow and just as deadly a hunter no less than his lupine companion and he wondered how fat and idle were grown the zirescu twins ion and lexandru and their loathsome father giorga and how long tall and pimply the ferenczys brothers rakhi and lagula perhaps giorga was dead radu hoped so but strangely he hoped the zirescu twins and the ferenczy brothers yet lived and when thoughts like that came to him then he would run with singer and hunt to take his mind off things until eventually weary of the mountain heights in spite of all their grandeur and perhaps afraid of his feelings when he looked down on western sunside he sought new horizons new scenes and sensations the far western lowlands lay mainly unexplored radu fancied there must be havens in the green fringes where birds sang and creatures played and fishes leaped in the cool clear water before it all ran to swamp but in any case he dreamed of the dark and misted forests hed known as a boy and once more walked with his father sister and mother along old szgany trails and so would go down into the unknown badlands if he dared he would prefer to go down into the sunside of his childhood however unhappy that had been but could not for reasons already explained at the moment he was an outlaw true but to the best of his knowledge men didnt seek him for his life all of which could change if he deliberately set himself against the zirescus and so it was the badlands which were not named that way for nothing at first all seemed well streams fell from on high cascading into cool misted depths and radu and singer swam where the falls had formed basins in centurieshollowed rocks vines and hybrid flowers flourished in the spray from the waters and the sunlight streaming from sunside and in fertile valleys between black eroded spurs the foliage was lush and filled with living things but then as the course of their descent turned away from sunside abruptly things changed the warmth from the sun lancing overhead was still present but now the rising mist was dark and dank no longer silveredged and glowing the shrubbery was lush and tangled but there were fewer and smaller flowers the nights were cold and singer full of some strange uneasiness of spirit radu supposed it was because they had turned their faces from sunside and at his earliest opportunity turned south again while yet continuing his descent the freshness of the heights never returned however and down in the western bottoms where the mountains crumbled to a desert of mud radu found no such green fringes as hed hoped for and never a haven to mention what he did find was a marshy bogland of fallen rotting trees and low thickleaved flabby grey shrubs under an evil miasma which rose as a mist from the apparently endless swamps of croaking hopping things there were plenty and of snapping lizardlike things too but of the clean warmblooded life of sunsides forests never a sign except for the occasional slumped black unrecognizable carcass rapidly turning to rot and becoming one with the swamp it was like a different world even a dawnworld whose dwellers were primal creatures out of time and in the swampy margins were toadstools as black as tar bursting necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley underfoot and sending up clouds of red spores to drift in the foggy reek it was as if the very air was poisonous and something warned radu to fasten a rag over his nose and mouth but singer went on all fours like the wild dog she was drinking the water between patches of scum and breathing the sporeladen air then as they began a retreat towards higher ground they saw a ragged mudstreaked fox stumbling in the mire all blearyeyed and threequarters done for radu was loath to waste a bolt on this poor emaciated creature yet knew it would be a mercy to put it out of its misery in the time hed spent with singer some two years now he had trained her in the hunt now he told her see to it which was the order to kill leaping out into the mud she came upon the fox at once to break his neck in her jaws and shaking the poor thing she let it fall on its side that should have been enough but in the next moment an amazing thing for the jaws of the fox yawned open and it snapped at singers face and what with the spray of flying mud and the snarling snapping and threshing of their heads where their jaws seemed locked it appeared to radu watching from the bank that something passed between them from fox to wolf or it could have been that singer had ripped out the foxs tongue to swallow it whole whichever that signalled the end of it the fox sprayed red from his mouth sank down into the mud and gave up the ghost but it was not the end of it for singer leaping to firm ground she sprang this way and that coughed and choked and bounded in the air until finally she collapsed unconscious she lay with her sides heaving then grew still and only the faintest of heartbeats to let her master know she yet lived dismayed radu sat with singer a while there by the rim of the swamp with her head in his lap and her tongue lolling until it appeared she wouldnt die then draping her over his shoulders he carried her out of that place and in an hour or so she struggled to be put down shortly after that to radus great relief she seemed as good as new she seemed that way at least they explored for an afternoon and an evening that was all but more than enough in that place before radu headed south and a little east to skirt the barrier mountains into sunside he knew it to be a route which must take him into zirescu territory sooner or later but by then he would have climbed back up into the mountain heights and so put temptation behind him so he thought and when the ominous twilight failed and the long night fell at last because the region was strange to radu and possibly dangerous with hitherto unknown hazards and the swamps alive with mosquitoes and other flying things he found a cave in an outcrop at the foot of the mountains and built a fire in the entrance to keep injurious insects and other creatures at bay behind which he and the now strangely withdrawn shewolf sheltered and prepared for sleep when down from the heights echoed a distant howling in praise of a blotchy yellow moon tumbling through the murky sky and though singers nose lifted and her eyes lit with recognition still she made no reply to the songs of the grey brothers on the mountain flanks and even when radu sang a low tune to himself singer held back from joining in not even a growl escaped her or a yawn of her longjawed softleather mouth so that all in all radu considered it weird but perhaps a mood was on her which in a place like this he could understand well enough during the night on those several occasions when radu woke up to toss branches on the fire stretch his legs or relieve himself he discovered singer awake silent staring out past the slowburning fire into the night or whining low in her throat or shaking her head from some unknown irritation and pawing at the earth where she stood in the entrance of the cave far more worrying on the last such occasion she was on her belly close by forepaws outstretched in radus direction peering at him intently through her feral or sick yellow triangular eyes following which he felt it prudent to remain awake and sat by the fire until the twilight before the dawn then moved on with all speed towards the risen but as yet hidden sun somewhere on the far flank of the crumbling mountains and it has to be said that radu was glad the night was over as the sunsidestarside nights are long the days are longer still but the territory was unknown to radu the rotting rock of the lower mountains was treacherous so that he must go with care and patience and there always seemed to be a new higher ridge behind whichever false plateau he had just negotiated for he had made up his mind that instead of skirting the mountains he would cut diagonally across their lower ramparts and so arrive in the western part of sunside already aloft and in the heights but because of the dangers and arduous nature of the route which seemed far more difficult than the one by which hed descended to the swamps it wasnt until the twilight before the night and after several camps that at last he arrived over sunside and even then not nearly as high on the mountain flanks as he had intended the twilight before the night a dull orange afterglow slowly fading over the far furnace desert and the sky to the south banded from amethyst on the horizon to a dark indigo in the vault of the sky where several stars were already evident while over starside the skies were brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i long since jet whose stars seemed like chunks of ice frozen in their orbits but starside itself was obscured by virtue of the mountain peaks a myriad of sunsides tiny bats along with a handful of a larger species whooshed and whirred on the air where they hunted while down in the woods the scattered fires of szgany camps lit the night sending aromatic odours drifting on thermals of their own making and there was a conflict of longings in radu hard to describe the need to be among men again oh yes but good men brothers men he could trust and the need to avoid them at all costs for this was surely zirescu territory the need to sit in the glow and warmth of a campfire and chew on a joint of meat with its juices hot and dripping washed down with a jug of good szgany wine and the dark desire to glimpse a startled face by starlight that of ion or lexandru perhaps or rakhi or lagula and squeeze off an ironwood bolt at pointblank range oh a medley of longings wishes desires and urges but the certain knowledge too that to surrender to them must bring about the worst possible result when he would not only be a loner but an outcast too from all men and for the rest of his days well and wasnt that his way and wouldnt it suit him well enough to be a loner yes but not to be pursued as a murderer when in fact he would be an avenger of the weeping dead for in radus mind and memory and in his dreams his father and sister were given to weeping causing him to cry too and so as always he put it from his mind climbing up into the mountains while yet there was the light for it and singer with him as ever but a singer changed now and almost unknown to him for now when she hunted the great white shewolf kept her kill and now when he would hug her she backed off from him whining and showing her fangs and whatever it was that was at odds between them radu knew that the difference wasnt in him not yet at least it happened quickly radu made camp that night in a delve in a cliff high over the foothills where a great boulder had weathered free of the bedrock rolled away and left a hollow behind scarcely a cave still it was dry and would shelter him if the rains came soft heather made a passable bed and a cured skin was his blanket it would suffice normally he would have singer too to snuggle close and keep him warm but the shewolf didnt want that now and truth to tell neither did radu she had a look about her a light in her eyes a flattening of her ears that warned of further changes in the offing which came as he slept it was a sound that woke him a whine a snarl a cough or grunt one or all of these things but a sound anyway made by singer and sitting up in his bed of heather backing away from her radu was astonished and horrified by this picture of a dog of the wild so patently torn between loyalty and strange alien emotions she crept towards him shied away whined as in some inexpressible agony and was at once drawn back to him slavering and showing her scythe teeth where the soft leather of her muzzle was drawn quiveringly back and radu understood that she now saw him as prey of sorts yet remembered him as her friend and master he sensed that she was driven by something and fought it with whatever remained of her former loyalty he knew something of her torment which must in a way be similar to his own for while he lusted after the blood of certain men still he remembered a handful of times when men had been good to him and while she came upon him to kill him she yet loved him with at least a spark of her old love and even as he drew back the string of his crossbow until it nocked and even as he slid a bolt into the tillers groove radu lykan grieved over what he must do for the companionship they had known together but plainly singer was mad and all of that was over now and like the fox in the swamp shed be better off dead and out of her misery he aimed direct at her forehead her brain to make a quick end of it and knew he couldnt miss for even though singer had witnessed the power of his weapon still she crept closer and closer yet almost as if begging him to kill her and all the while she stared fixedly at radu pleadingly with eyes he knew yet didnt know not any longer she was almost upon him her eyes were yellow lamps shining on him powerful jaws yawned open and goodbye old friend radu told her squeezing the trigger in the last moment singer had lunged forward only to be stopped dead by the ironwood bolt that chopped through her sloping skull into her brain so that she fell twitching upon radus chest where he had jerked back away from her her jaws still gaped open however his too as he saw something writhing in the dark cavern of her mouth then but too late he once again remembered the diseased fox in the swamp the thing he had seen passing from the one to the other which hed mistakenly thought was the foxs tongue torn out at the roots by singer it was the same now but as the shinyblack corrugated body of the leechthing ejected from the wolfs mouth and in the instant that it transferred to radus he saw that it was no tongue it lived it thought reasoned or instinctively knew and it moved like lightning as it sought a new better stronger more intelligent host impossible to close his mouth such was the girth of the horror that his jaws were made powerless like taking too big a bite of an apple and stalling on it except this loathsome thing was no apple headfirst it fed itself to him putting out hooks into his throat to draw itself down necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley inch by choking viletasting stomachheaving inch then it was in him and he could breathe again he did gasping coughing and massaging his throat and came lurching to his feet as he tried desperately to vomit to rid himself of the nightmarish parasite within and it knew that too radu would never know just exactly what the horror did to his insides then but even as he blacked out he guessed it was the same thing that it had done to singers and as incredible pain hounded him into a merciful oblivion he could more fully appreciate how she had felt when shed collapsed at the rim of the swamp and something of how she must have felt when she came awake his throat burned it was dry cracked bruised inside from the things passage into his body and so it had been no nightmare no subconscious association of ideas lingering from his recent visit to the swamps but the real thing a real thing had vacated singers body in favour of his it was in there even now hiding in his body lodged there where he could neither see nor feel it nor affect it in any way like the fox and then singer he was now the host of this parasitic creature this leech that he imagined to be similar to the tapeworms that occasionally got into the systems of the szgany well radu knew the cure for that well enough hed seen how the sufferers of such infestation submitted to starvation and when they were almost dead of hunger allowed themselves to be tied down with their mouths propped open so that the parasite could be lured out of them by the stench of rotting fish or meat but that was something a man couldnt do on his own the temptation to bite such a thing in half and spit it out as it disgorged must be overwhelming not to mention a complete waste of time and effort for only leave a segment of the creature inside the host body an entire new worm would grow from it then again the tapeworms radu had seen were slender manysectioned creatures they could be bitten in half but he knew that his parasite was different he knew it without knowing how he knew he felt it a malign intelligence of sorts a sentience other than the basic natural instinctive hunting and breeding knowledge of beasts of the wild or the higher spiritual or moralityguided intelligence of men this thing would use the guile of the fox the ferocity of the hunting wolf and his superior knowledge and intelligence for its own except there would be nothing spiritual or moral about it and nothing remotely human these were thoughts that entered radus mind in his first waking moments but he could hardly suspect that they were not his thoughts entirely or that their source was not entirely his mind but such was the case by virtue of its metamorphic makeup the leechs mutant dna was already bringing about the most drastic changes in his own and doing it in such a way as to link itself with his mind his blood and bones his very being the thing would be him and even though he would continue to believe himself master of his own destiny he would be it cold it would kill off whatjwas human in him while intensifying what was cold and inhuman devious it would so dilute what little was left of human love and compassion as to remove these things entirely while accentuating those baser emotions it could use to its own advantage such as lust greed and hatred tenacious it would cling to life to radus life even as it moulded itself to his internal organs and spine and thered be no getting rid of it neither by primitive medicine nor any method of mans devising for radu was the higher lifeform it had searched for since its development from a spore to a leech in the body of the fox and it was with him now for as long as he lived ever ravenous it would lust after the very source of life the redpulsing river of life which flows through the arteries of men and beasts except a man has only so much life only so much blood so that in order to survive radu too must consume or be consumed it was the burgeoning curse of the vampire new to sunsidestarside even as shaitan the unborn was new so that as yet radu knew neither of them but he would he would day finally dawned and radu was ill he carried singer out of the cave dropped her into a crack in the rocks filled it with stones under normal circumstances the effort would be scarcely worth mentioning now it felt like a days work he knew he should hunt for good red meat to fuel him through whatever was to come but the sun had a furnace heat hed never felt before which raised angry red weals on his skin and crisped the hair of his forearms to small coiled cinders even with his back to the sun he could scarcely see to find a target plainly he was ill but he knew he had a thing in him so it was hardly surprising and the very thought of that thing made him feel more ill yet he found water a small waterfall with a pool laved his scorched and rapidly roughening body and filled a skin took up his clothes in a bundle and headed back to his cave on the way he saw a rabbit nibbling the grass in the shade of a tree and even in his condition couldnt miss such an easy target back in the cave he found himself ravenously hungry and ate raw red flesh this wasnt the first time radu had had it red now and then when it rained and the grass he used for tinder was damp he might find it impossible to get a fire going then he would simply skin his catch cut himself a good hindquarter joint and fill his belly and of course singer had been there to dispose of the rest of their kill which she naturally preferred that way but on this occasion there was no such excuse the day was hot and dry radu had flintstones he could easily have cooked necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley his food but he ate it raw anyway perhaps it was simply a question of expedience and perhaps not and he slept and slept never such a long sleep in all his life never before and never again for this was the sleep of change this was his leechs chance to complete the melding and make itself one with him something of the foxs wiles went into him but not a lot for that poor creature had been out of its own environment it had never been afforded the opportunity to display its skills on the other hand a great deal more of the great white shewolf found its way into radu for the leech had liked her strength and ferocity her sense of the wild her sinuous shape and speed singer had been a child of the night a hunter of lesser creatures an eater of raw meat who slaked her thirst on blood good but the man knew things he had something that neither fox nor wolf of the wild could ever match a creative mind with the power to override instinct to say no or later to the normally irresistible hereditary urges and demands which alone command the actions of lesser creatures and because he could guide and control his own actions he could himself be guided and controlled thus even as radu had trained singer now his leech would train him and with filament extensions of itself rooted in his brain the vampire leech lay with radu where he tossed and turned in his cave through the long sunside day ignoring all the nightmares which its presence inspired while listening with rapt intent to his dreams and learning from them and determining how it would be radu woke in the evening twilight and was himself again so he thought he stretched upon his heather bed and there was a new suppleness in all his joints his throat no longer gave him pain and there was no aching in his bones whatever small symptoms of his solitary ways had been they were no more he knew a physical comfort a sensation of real wellbeing such as he had never experienced before he was a new man and he was more than a man and less during his recovery radu had defecated in a secondary cave that branched off from the main one close to its entrance the smell of his shit would keep creatures at bay strange for it was something he had never done before singer had done it from time to time but she was a child of the wild rather she had been a child of the wild then remembering that singer was no more radu grieved a little while he dressed his short trousers of stitched skins seemed baggy on him obviously hed lost weight but he didnt feel too hungry not for his usual fare anyway radus sandals seemed too short for his feet and his jacket failed to connect with his trousers or tie properly across his deep chest and there were short dark manes of hair on the backs of his hands and trailing down his wrists astonished he found twin pads of hair in the palms of his hands too moreover his fingernails were longer thicker darker and pointed at their tips like claws but how long had he lain there why he must have been delirious these changes in him had surely taken longer than a single night but they were natural changes obviously loss of weight and some slight wrinkling and shrinkage of his clothes and his hair and nails growing all unhindered by normal wear and tear but a healing sleep for sure for there was such a zest in him that except here radus thoughts were arrested by an echoing ululant faint but concerted howling from the high plateaux and passes as his grey brothers in the heights began to serenade a full and glorious moon where she tumbled through the darkening skies but his grey brothers radu wasted no time puzzling over it for now his zest had turned to something other than a human passion now he longed for the thrills of the wild the hunt the chase and the kill but again his bloodlust was not for the blood of the wild but for that of his own kind or those who had been his kind at least and down there in the western forests that was zirescu territory he paused for a moment in the mouth of the cave to sniff at his excrement his yes but it was black the black of the digested blood of the rabbit and perhaps the digested essence of something else what of the leechthing was this it liquefied and turned to black shit by his juices radu thought not but then why couldnt he feel it inside him a thing as big as that he frowned and gave a shrug what had been had been what was become was become and what would be would be but up in the mountains his grey brothers were aprowl and howling and radu threw back his head and howled with them it felt good as good as the night against his flanks and pausing beside the pool to go down on all fours and sip and seeing his face reflected in moonlight radu scarcely wondered at the fact that his eyes were triangular and gleamed feral yellow or that his longtoothed smile was the smile of a wolf for in the silver light of the moon all was made clear to him and he remembered his dreams of vengeance and knew that it was time except he would go among men as a man so that they would know who he was and why he had returned in his descent into sunside radu was quick and surefooted as a wolf but a wolf with all the agility and climbing skills of a man head first with his chest and belly close to the earth he dug in the heels of his hands to brake himself sliding and skittering where the way was treacherous brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i upright but bent forward he loped where the going was level and easy whenever he found his way barred by cliffs he reverted to human skills and clambered like a man and at all times he stuck to the shadows as much as possible for his eyes were suited to the night he saw as clearly as in daylight or better for he was wamphyri but as yet he wouldnt have recognized the word or known that it described his condition even if hed heard it shouted in the first quarter of the night radu was down into the foothills now the night was dark lit only by starshine for the orbit of the hurtling moon had taken her beyond the rim of the world which was just as well her gravity no longer enraptured radus mind and he was more himself or he would be if not for his symbiont and in fact his leech was a true symbiont for it gave as well as took now if radu were wounded the vampire would heal him now his strength was that of eight or nine men even ten if need be now he was nearindefatigable not to mention nearimmortal for barring accidents or an attack of the utmost ferocity or a disease such as leprosy which even his leech could not cope with he would not die not that radu knew any of this these were wonders he was yet to discover mysteries as yet unfathomed or irredeemable depths as yet unplumbed all he knew was that he felt well fitter faster and fiercer than ever before and that his body burned with an inner fire also that he was a force to be reckoned with greater than hed ever been but not nearly as great as he would be but mainly he knew that he had the ability to right several great wrongs revenge aye against the zirescus and the ferenczys and this would be what he gave to his leech this was his part of the unspoken unspeakable unbreakable pact that what he apparently did for himself he in fact did for the vampire radu knew how to kill and now must learn how to enjoy it his life had been governed by fear and hatred now his own hatred enhanced tenfold by his vampire would be an instrument with which to inspire fear his human passions hitherto suppressed contained within the dam of his humanity could now spill over in an inhuman orgy of emotion and violence beyond the range of common men he could feel it in his blood wamphyri and the weirdest thing of all was this that not even his leech knew these things all it knew and this by some alien instinct was that its host was a strong one and that through him it lived and all it had was its metamorphism its tenacity its awful hunger for the fuel of its degenerate regenerative engine was blood which was why that engine was geared to drive radus lust for life and for death aye even at the expense of every life he touched from this time forward coming upon the camp of the zirescus radu was cautious the camps watchdogs wolves reared from pups would be out in the dark forest silent but alert trained they wouldnt bark to scare an intruder off but simply tree him then whine or howl till someone came to discover what was what or if their victim should choose to fight theyd just as soon hamstring him behind his knees and bark to attract their masters all very daunting yet radu was not overly concerned for somehow he felt he understood the ways of wolves he believed he could handle them even as hed handled the great white shewolf of the wild perhaps even better than hed handled singer now sure enough when they came to sniff him out radu held out his arms to them and after a moment they crept close and licked his hands where he stood in the forests shadows then when they would whine he cautioned them with a low tuttut until they were silent and while he could sense that they were worried still they were silent for all of this was at a time when the wamphyri were unknown in western sunside as yet and apart from the frightful campfire tales of the occasional lone traveller the zirescus had no real knowledge of the terror out of starsides towering aeries that even now ravaged in the eastern woods thus the zirescu wolves had not been trained against such as radu but after tonight they would be the wolves were satisfied that radu was not a threat he sent them about their business then advanced upon the camp the night was young and there were men about the central fire radu was more than well acquainted with the habits of the zirescus he knew where to find old giorgas caravan on the outskirts of the encampment that is if the fat old bastard were still alive of course that last was as yet a matter for conjecture what with the old zirescus swinish eating and drinking habits and all and the ungovernable nature of his temper but zhe yet survived well the future extent of his span was hardly conjectural at all it would end right here right now this very night and radus father would be waiting to greet him in hell yet radu held back waiting in the shadows a while to think things out for it seemed somewhat bold to simply walk up to giorgas wicker door knock and wait for a reply if the old man were to look out through a peephole suspect something and cry out what then the stars were too bright the night too clear better if there were a ground mist to soften the sound of radus approach or the clatter of any brief scuffle better if the damp fertile earth and the trees of the forest were to exhale the moisture theyd gathered during the day and throw a soft lapping blanket of white over the entire camp except the earth and the trees couldnt do that could they in some worlds it would be thought of as witchcraft magic the supernatural and perhaps in radus world too yet in the himalayas of earth tibetan priests are known to test themselves by falling asleep in water turning to ice and upon waking generate sufficient bodily heat to melt it and the firefly turns on the lamp in his own body without brian lumley necmscope the lost years vol i burning himself and by its light finds a mate and certain creatures winter through in a state of hibernation where others would surely die a freezing death but here in this world despite that radu knew little or nothing of such things suddenly he sensed a measure of his power of a new power in sunsidestarside radu was like no he was or would be if he willed it a catalyst his presence in these woods was alien even as he himself was alien to mundane mankind the very chemistry of his body no longer a human or entirely natural chemistry had the power to bring about changes in natural things he felt it burgeoning within him he had desired something and now would will it he would breathe a mist and cause the forest itself to reciprocate and with the metamorphic assistance of his leech he did exactly that the pores of his body opened and seemed to steam the mist poured off him as if he were dry ice his heavy breath issued from his lips as an expanding evil essence that billowed out from him and appeared to call lesser mists out of the woods and up from the very earth itself and on the outer rim of the zirescu encampment radu flowed within his mist to reach up and tap lightly on the wicker door of giorgas caravan eh who radu would know that bass grumbly rumbling voice anywhere the old zirescu was still alive what is it cant a man catch up on a little sleep around here there came the sound of movement from within a small barred window opened inwards and a puffy bearded squinting and redeyed face appeared behind the bars radu stood at the foot of the caravans steps and kept his face averted his vampire mist obscured him a little where it swelled rolled and sent up wispy tendrils serving to hide his actual identity but the sparse and ragged clothing of a mountains loner gave him away as a stranger and eh giorga mumbled again but sharper now what a wanderer come at night to try the hospitality of the zirescus so why bother me there are men at the campfire im sure go sing for your supper there giorga was probably drunk certainly his brandy breath was strong in radus nostrils but before the old man could close his window i havent come to take anything but to give something radu told him disguising his voice as best possible which wasnt in fact difficult except now he must also disguise it from a growl and continuing giorga zirescu i bring a warning but i cant talk out here and he glanced quickly this way and that as if worried that he might be overheard so let me in and ill tell you of the doom that hangs over you and yours even now a warning the other gasped a doom whatever can you mean and more harshly commandingly speak up man and perhaps ill hear you out radu straightened up but kept his face averted im not one of yours giorga that you can speak to me like an underling im a loner yes a wanderer ah but the places ive wandered and the things ive heard they say that giorga zirescu grows old and fat and sodden and his sons no better than young shads in the rut and the zirescu women all slatterns who would open their legs to dogs rather than take the pigs his men have become what giorgas eyes bulged at the window who says these things who dares issue these lies i have no truck with neighbours so whos to know that that i and radu looked at him sideways just a glance but a look that said it all yes go on whos to know that you the other calmed down a little snarled ive no time for gossip sticks and stones may hurt me but catcalling sticks and stones aye radu repeated him and crossbow bolts and men who lust after your land because they believe youre not fit to hold it and when that sank in eh again giorgas gasp is that it land thieves but this is my land as it was my fathers before me so someones after me for my territory is that it a land feud but no one has the right tell me more i would gladly radu answered with a shrug beginning to turn away except it would seem that the one they call the old zirescu is much too proud to talk face to face with a loner and wanderer it seems hes too high and mighty and should i stand out here in this damp and clinging mist without even a sip of your good plum brandy to warm my throat no i reckon not so now youll just have to guess where theyll strike and how many and when well and good luck to you turning his back on the caravan radu made as if to stride away but wanderer whoever you are wait giorgas voice was anxious now all of the bluster driven out of it and yes youre right im an ungrateful old wretch at times but come in come in and warm yourself brandy did i hear you say why i could use a drop myself and look ive a jug of the very stuff right here the bolt was drawn back and radu heard the creak of the caravans wicker door in another moment soundlessly he turned and was up the wooden steps and something of his mist flowed inside with him whats more giorga zirescu had invited him in of his own free will well with a little help from radus lying leech necroscope the lost years vol i ill red revenge land giorga asked again after handing radu a leather jack is that what this is all about radu took a sip of the sharptasting brandy the merest sip then put the jack down it had been a long time and he needed a clear head its about land and life and death he said and his voice was very deep very gruff as for the first time he turned his face fully in giorgas direction and in the light from the old zirescus lamp he searched for some sign of recognition but found nothing in the redflecked boozy bulging eyes of the other if he had if giorga had shown even a glimmer of recognition then his time had come be sure his night visitor had already determined that it had come anyway but all in good time when giorga had been given to know why well were face to face the old man told him and that was true enough in the close confines of giorgas caravan they couldnt be anything else so now lets have it explain yourself as for land and life and death theyre all one if a man must fight to keep his territory then he fights his land is his life and its where hes buried when he dies and will his people fight with him or will they run away because they hate him radus voice was deeper yet a rumbling growl issuing from his throat his suddenly chaotic emotions no the old zirescu pushed his face closer yet theyll fight because they fear him here in these western forests since time immemorial the zirescus have always been strong in my time i giorga have been strongest of all i had to be in your time aye radu nodded but do you mean strongest or hardest were you strong with your people or hard on them by now the old man had sobered a little his gaze was curious as he sat down on the wooden frame of his bed and looked radu up and down if hed seen this man before he was sure he would remember him what a man as tall as this why he must be all of six foot three and his strange looks those eyes of his yellow in the lamplight and his grey hair swept back like a mane to fall over his collar his slightly pointed ears and long hairy hands then again the loners were all weird in their ways and looks this one especially why his words were almost what accusing and suddenly giorga suspected that this wasnt about land and likewise that he wasnt much interested what it was about simultaneously he suspected it had been a mistake to invite this man into his tiny cramped caravan in the first place whatever ive been and whatever ive done it was my way he answered at last and placed his pillow as a rest for his back but beneath that pillow he kept a long ironwood knife with a bone handle its edge wasnt so keen but its point was sharp as a splinter it was your way aye radu growled and always for your own good yours and your sons but never for the good of your people they do hate you giorga even as i hated you upon a time eh giorga sat up straighter pulled the pillow round in front of himself clasped the handle of his knife there was a good crossbow hanging on the wall but it wasnt loaded supposing it had been so what this man looked as fast as he now looked dangerous this isnt it isnt about land oh but it is radu answered sitting down carefully at the other end of giorgas bed and moving fractionally inch by inch closer and now his voice was a hoarse throb of anticipation indeed for its about a man who worked that land for you who hunted it for you and beat the bounds with you year in year out and for payment suffered the jibes and insults of a fat greedy old man and his loathsome sons its about how he was murdered because he stood in the way of his daughter going to one of your sons and its about the girl too who was as good as you and your lot were bad she was held down giorga raped time and time again then murdered because her father by no means a brave man had not obliged the zirescus by letting her go as wife to ion or lexandru i i i know you now giorga pointed with his left hand but radu knew that the old pig was righthanded and saw that treacherous right hand trembling behind the pillow in giorgas lap and indeed all of giorga trembling his fat belly his chins the very jowls of his face and youre radu son of freji lllykan he stuttered aye frejis son and magdas brother that same brother who was outlawed or who outlawed himself when he avenged his fathers death and his sisters rape and murder except he was stopped in the hour of his vengeance by you giorga i fancy and was it ion and lexandru who also tried to drown me and the ferenczy brothers likewise on your orders ah i know it was but as you see i am not drowned and not nearly dead and it is about land or soil after all this brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i soil zirescu soil where youve rooted like a pig all your days and where youre now destined to die a swinish death this earth which the poisons of your loathsome gases shall turn putrid even as youre lowered into it and no one to mourn over you giorga even if they would no for your sons will be down there with you giorga lunged his black ironwood knife was in his hand upraised radu grinned as he caught the others fat wrist in his own taloned hand and held it effortlessly and his grin was the grin of a wolf as his leech poured metamorphic juices through his system causing his teeth to scythe upwards from his raw red gums as his mouth yawned wider yet in the space of five heartbeats radu lykan had changed changed before the old zirescus bulging disbelieving eyes into something radically different from from anything hed ever seen before the man was gone and a monster crouched in his place and the face on that creature the flameeyed salivating grinning panting visage of hell itself that monstrous gaping mouth giorga sucked at the suffocating air and opened his own mouth to cry out but too late pain snatched the cry from the circle of his rubbery lips turned it to a yelp a gurgle a great whoosh of expelled air as radu twisted his arm until it snapped at the elbow closed a hand over giorgas hand and slid the knife home through unprotesting layers of fat and up under bulging ribs oh it hurt and it did great even fatal damage but not immediately giorgas fat protected him the knifes tip couldnt reach his heart not angling up from his belly like that his left hand ceased its fluttering and reached for the knife clasping its handle where it protruded from his gut and he panted oh ah oh as he tried to draw it out but couldnt because of the pain then still grinning radu towered over him cocked his head on one side in the inquiring manner of a great dog and looked him right in his cringing eyes as if he were looking into his soul and he said farewell giorga then caught his beard and yanked it up and without pause drove his fangs into and slicing through the old mans windpipe giorga flopped and vibrated in radus grasp until the werewolf released him and let him topple from his bed to the floor where he got jammed in the narrow space it was over this part of it at least and the old zirescu bled and tried to scream and flopped about in his own blood and bled some more great steaming jets of crimson pulsing from his gaping throat and punctured gut air whistling in and out of his severed windpipe where bright red bubbles formed a livid froth but all slowing down now as life quickly ebbed until finally it really was over outside the caravan in a mist of his own making radu paused for the merest moment to spit giorgas taste from his mouth his taste and the last trace of his blood for despite that radu was hungry and his leech ever hungry giorga zirescus blood tasted vile to him yet the memory of what he had done would always remain sweet and sweeter still when the rest of it was over and done with radu had taken down giorgas crossbow now he loaded it and his own weapon both hooked the one to his belt and took the other firmly in a pawlike hand and as the woods and the earth continued to issue his wreathing mist he headed direct for the communal fires dull orange glow in the centre of the encampment for he had realized his strength at last he knew his awesome power and that he need not fear anything in man or nature not yet at least and loping low through the mist his senses were alive with all the sounds scents and sensations of the night he was a child of the night he heard the rustling in the undergrowth that tracked the hunting shrew sensed the hooded eyes of an owl upon him detected an almost inaudible shrilling of tiny bats sounding clearer than ever before in his vampireenhanced ears and he smelled blood of course the blood of the zirescus and the ferenczys for giorgas blood had not been enough but that of his sons and their friends might yet quell the fire raging in radus veins the moon was up again a full and brilliant disc shining like silver in the sky its beam fell in a swath undulating on radus ground mist and lighting his way to the fire passing like a wraith between the innermost caravans and carts he was almost there now he could see the ruddy faces of men in a huddle about the fire and saw that they were frowning their conversation reached him they talked about the watchdogs the camps wolves for the wolves were there those tame dogs of creatures their tails were down and their ears flat and they whimpered around the feet of their human masters aye and if they could talk theyd be telling of radus presence too they probably were in their way but the men were too stupid to know it except if the blood of men had a scent so did the blood of the wamphyri radus blood and now the wolves around the fire smelled it moreover they smelled the death which he had so recently wrought there were three of them they quit their slinking about the feet of the seated men and as one creature turned in radus direction their ears pointed him out in the shadow of a caravan and now that they stood in the company of men they felt safe to issue a series of growls and yips eh someone said is there something there and indeed there was something there radu loped forward more surely into the fires glow came to a halt and straightened up without pause he scanned the faces in the firelight and saw that ion and lexandru were there also the ferenczys and three colleagues as scurvy a handful as he could imagine but he hated the first four above all other men brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i all jaws dropped all eyes were on radu who now grinned in his fashion and growled this is between me and the zirescus those two ion and lexandru rapists and murderers he pointed with his crossbow and also the ferenczys he pointed again ive killed giorga and now ill kill his sons and their friends as for the rest of you you dont have to die if you dont want to enough of talk too much even no longer just pointing his weapon but aiming it at lexandru radu squeezed the trigger it started as quickly as that without any warning other than that furnished by the watchdogs lexandru had come to his feet as radu spoke and as the bolt flew to its target he held up his hands in denial j the bolt passed between them and struck him in the left breast burying i itself to the ironwood flights oh he said in a loud voice as if he queried the thing and is it what radu not dead well theres a i ththing then he coughed blood crumpled to his knees and fell on his face i but one of the men at the fire had sufficient wits about him to shout j attack to the wolves and as radu hooked the empty crossbow to his belt and levelled the other the wolves at once sprang towards him the leader fastened to his weapon forearm snarling fangs bit deep radu grasped the wolfs mane with his free hand whirled in a circle and i released the disorientated animal into the sprawling fire twin strips of his flesh and skin went with it torn from his forearm by its eyeteeth j but radu scarcely felt it for he was in action doing what hed dreamed of doing for so long except for now ion and the ferenczys must wait for the other wolves were here one of them was in midair coming headon forepaws outstretched and muzzle slavering radu couldnt miss he shot his bolt and ducked and the skewered wolf yelped passed overhead bounced once and struggled to its forelegs then collapsed and lay still the third skidded to a halt as radu fixed it with a feraleyed glare and said growlingly oh and would you die too come on then lets get done with it for theres room in the fire yet but the grey one had seen more than enough of radu and backed off whimpering radu sensed trouble retaliation hed spent too long on these tame wolves quick as thought he fell to all fours felt a crossbow bolt fly inches overhead even as he dropped glanced across the fire at the knot of men the ferenczys had already bolted ion zirescu was making off between the caravans heading for the forest the man who had shot at radu was now readying his weapon for a second try the others stumbled this way and that startled out of their wits they scarcely comprehended what was happening radu loped to the fire stooped to snatch up a burning brand and as the man with the crossbow nocked his bolt radu let fly with the firebrand which hit him full in the face his beard went up in fire and smoke in another moment his head was a ball of fire dropping his weapon he danced yelped and beat at himself and went rolling into a patch of undergrowth close by by which time the others were all fled but radu had seen ion go and knew which direction hed taken the moon came up over the trees at the edge of the clearing and seeing it radu went to all fours threw back his head and howled it seemed the most natural thing in the world despite that the sound it made was surely one of the most terrible for although it was the cry of a beast the howling issued from the throat of a man and all of his pentup passions went into it it told of all the pain and frustration of a tortured youth remembered and stored and now released in a torrent of monstrous pleasure as it burst like a flood over the last of those who had caused it it cried all his years of torment relieved or in the process of being relieved at least for ion zirescu and the ferenczys brothers still lived and the fact of their living was itself a great torment but their deaths would be a pleasure incomparable like a sigh in the soul of radu lykan a sigh of relief if he still had a soul ah and the werewolf knew what he wanted from ion for hed dreamed a dream from time to time which he now believed was more memory than dream of lying facedown in the trampled earth of a clearing and hearing voices as if from a long way away yet coming to him clearly through a darkness shot with brilliant flashes of light but otherwise devoid of sensation except for a terrible pain at the back of his head and a great anger seething deep in his core and a yearning even as great as his current yearning to tear the living smoking hearts out of the ones who spoke these words radus sister dead and by your hands six of you onto one girl this pair of mangy corpses here arlek bargosi and kherl fumari and the ferenczy brothers rakhi and lagula and you two of course not all our fault it was you who sent us after freji to do him in well and there was that in radus eyes as told us he knew he must have found his father out in the woods as for the girl that was an accident for she wouldnt hold still that one had been ion and magdas death had been an accident because she had tried to fight them off where theyd rutted over her like beasts ah but there are beasts and there are beasts and the rest of it wouldnt be an accident be sure giorga was dead lexandru too but ion and the ferenczys still lived for now they lived anyway again radu howled howled his bloodlust and a vow to the goddess of the moon where she floated on high that magda would be avenged in a manner befitting her ordeal in answer it seemed the moon lit his way through the woods by silvering the madly trampled blundering trail of necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley ion zirescu to where the last of that loathsome family was hiding later radu would scarcely remember tracking him loping through the dark woods and falling to all fours to sniff the trail of freshly crushed grass and rootlets the vilesmelling spoor of sweat and fear but in a little while thered been a clearing with a stand of trees to one side and breaking from the woods into the clearing radu had sensed stillness all was still neither a sound nor any movement not even the hoot of an owl or the furtive creep of small creatures in the grass why because they had been startled to stillness by the sudden crashing of a fugitive possibly radus mist had subsided by then but the moon was still full and high and his powers were still with him except they were new powers and he didnt know them he wasnt experienced in their use but listening to the stillness keeping absolutely still himself and straining to detect even the slightest sound he heard something that wasnt a sound instead it was a thought they were thoughts the terrified thoughts of ion zirescu at first radu shook his head he knew he was imagining it this listening to anothers mind but as he concentrated even harder so the thoughts came that much clearer so that now he must heed them and this was what he heard followed me but how is he a man or a dog to track me so unerringly radu lykan alive or perhaps his vengeful spirit but a ghost that kills and his strength his great speed no this is no ghost but radu himself we thought him a coward like his father but the youth who killed kherl andarlek that night was no coward and now hes back but my father giorga dead well so what lexandru and i would have seen to him before too long ahhh that last was a gasp of horror and it signalled that radu had been seen he closed his eyes and concentrated more yet and saw through anothers eyes through ions of course saw himself or his shadow poised at the edge of the clearing head cocked forward ears alert as they angled this way and that and saw and indeed felt himself go down on all fours again and aim himself at the stand of trees for ions line of sight had given him away and the shock of his thoughts confirmed it hes pointing at me coming straight for me but i have my machete oh yes radu was coming halfupright and leaning forward he loped towards the stand of trees but ion had a machete oh really and deep in a clump of gorse radu paused to ready his crossbow four seconds at most before continuing in a new direction apparently away from ion and in his head hell go right by me he hasnt seen me it was a sigh of relief almost a sob a pitiful sound but there was no pity in radu lykan and in the corner of his eye radu saw ion there crouching in the shrubbery under the trees behind a dense patch of brambles but not dense enough radu whirled aimed and fired ion uttered a cry of shock pain as the bolt zipped through fringing undergrowth to take him in the right forearm spinning him until his feet tangled and he went down his machete had flown from useless fingers and suddenly he was a man alone unarmed against a monster a shadow grew out of the nights darker shadows and as the moon slipped behind a cloud radu lykan was there his eyes like yellow lamps in the darkness and up he panted his voice a cough a bark a hideous threat on your feet ion zirescu or die where you lie he nocked the last of his bolts sobbing ion got up and stumbled backwards away from radu until he backed up against a tree and perfect the werewolf radu growled as he pointed his weapon pointblank and squeezed the trigger the ironwood bolt shattered ions left collarbone and nailed him to the tree his cry of agony cut the night like a knife and he would have blacked out but darent his weight would rip the muscle of his shoulder open or stretch and tear the ligaments there and cripple him for life radu heard his thoughts and inquired what life kill me then ion sobbed get it done with if thats what you want and with a bolt in his right arm and another through his shoulder holding him in place he braced himself shuddering against the tree radus voice was a low rumble as he answered but thats not all i want whwhat you murdered my father then raped and killed my sister well frejis paid for giorga paid that debt but magda cant ever be paid for for she was priceless but you and your brother the ferenczys and those other two pigs you held my sister down and took her again and again maybe two of you at a time or maybe three i saw her body the signs you left your stinking froth on magdas skin as well she died for i dont think she could have lived with it well neither can i and neither can you his last words were a snarl he hooked a hand like a claw in the front of ions trousers and ripped them open ion was caused to jerk a little and the bolt in his shoulder dragged against raw nerves he almost passed out which wouldnt do at all radu pushed his wolfs face close sniffed at ions parts and growled that worthless thing was the instrument of your torture your your pleasure as he closed his talonlike hand on his captive ion could do nothing but writhe and shudder against the tree and you and the others all six of you you took turns to rape her of her innocence now its my turn except youre not innocent he crushed ion to the tree clenched his hand like a vice used his necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley vast wamphyri strength to castrate and more than castrate the other in a split second ion lost everything even the lower pipes of his body dislocated wrenched out of place and left dangling he lost consciousness too and would go on losing blood enough that hed never again wake up well and radu wouldnt let it go to waste not all of it while there was yet a pulse in his victims neck he sank a wolfs fangs into it to draw off the remainder of ions life and drank long and deep giving nothing of himself but taking all from the other even the very last dregs blood it was what hed needed what his vampire leech had needed it was the nectar of life it was the life and it was the drug that very nearly killed him because he almost but not quite let himself drown in it because the sheer unbridled pleasure of it almost but not quite numbed him to everything else until as if in a dream he heard a startled gasp as someone cried there but look only look will you radu knew the voice rakhi ferenczy the younger of that degenerate pair knew the next voice too as that of rakhis brother when lagula answered i see him and ive got the mooncrazed bastard he surfaced from his delirium of bloodlust straightened up from slaking his monstrous thirst and shook his head to clear his swimming senses and reddrenched vision both and moved but not fast enough lagulas bolt burned his neck cut a shallow groove in it before burying itself inches deep in the tree radu laughed a great bark of a laugh until rakhis bolt bit deep into his left thigh scraped bone and jammed there midway between knee and buttock radu had fired his last bolt he had nothing to fight back with except his fierce wamphyri strength he would have fought certainly if his leech had let him but survival was uppermost in the symbionts mind its hosts survival and its own of course the werewolf let himself fall to the forests floor went threelegged limping through the undergrowth but still with the sinuous flowing motion of the wamphyri and this time he breathed his mist in earnest knowing what he did to obscure him as he fled not far from ion zirescus dangling ravaged body he found the machete where it had fallen and for a moment considered standing and fighting but a greater wisdom forbade it for the time being survival was everything once near the edge of the clearing radu paused to look back and saw the ferenczys still blundering about in his mist searching for him in the undergrowth on the fringe of the stand of trees the fools to have let him slip through their fingers like this didnt they know didnt they realize that hed be back for them obviously not radu thought to remind them and as the moon tumbled from view behind the treetops he threw back his head and howled and from now on whenever the ferenczy brothers heard the howling of a wolf they would automatically tremble and reach for the nearest weapons in the western foothills well away from the camp of the zirescus radu cut the flights from the bolt that transfixed his thigh and drew it out headfirst at first there was pain but as he gritted his teeth the pain faded to a dull throb and in another moment all that remained was an insensitive numbness as if his thigh were asleep there were medicinal leaves radu knew of that would help in the healing but he didnt bother with them something told him they werent necessary it was his leech already at work on him with its vastly superior metamorphic processes radu was a changeling creature now but in the main his mind remained the mind of a man and in his sleep he was visited by nightmares he dreamed of the thing that hed become and woke up cold and shivering unwilling to accept the fact that he was no longer entirely human his vampire of course worked on him to subdue all such fears and regrets dimly he was aware of its influence the small urging voice of some subconscious conscience that nagged or advised him no voice at all but in fact chemical agents and catalysts in his blood and his brain changing the way he thought eventually he succumbed to suggestion stopped fearing and lost interest in it finally he accepted that he was what he was without considering that he was what his leech wanted him to be when the moon was down or on the wane he was a man a wolfishlooking man by all means but a man when the moon was up and full then it was hard to remain a man but at all times he was wamphyri even though he still didnt understand or recognize his condition he dwelled for some years between the foothills and the barrier mountains sleeping in deep caves or crevices by day and wandering gradually eastwards by night and despite that his work wasnt finished in the camps of the szgany zirescu by now the szgany ferenczy and that it never would be while rakhi and lagula lived still he put distance between he knew that to return now would mean certain death the entire tribe would be watching out for him doubtless with orders to shoot on sight and in any case he needed time to explore his amazing powers his mentalism metamorphism and the source of his boundless surging energy as for the wound in his thigh that had healed in a night and a day there was scarcely a scar to show for it adept at avoiding the encampments or settlements of men he continued to do so alas that they couldnt avoid him but the farther east radu journeyed the more surely he was aware of a change not in brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i himself this time but in the szgany in sunsides people themselves thus far avoiding men he had also avoided their challenge or rather the challenge of his bloodlust he had slaked his thirst on the raw red flesh of creatures of the wild in this respect and without even knowing it radu had pitted himself against his leech but as well as tenacity the vampire has all the patience of centuries of life as yet unlived with a vampires longevity its not too hard to be patient and meanwhile radu was allowed to believe that the pleasure hed derived from slaughtering ion zirescu and drinking his blood had lain in the killing while in fact it had lain in the drinking revenge that had been his motive but necessity had been his leechs well radu would learn in time and meanwhile his vampire must be satisfied with the blood of beasts except and as has been noted there are beasts and there are beasts and indeed great beasts had come among the szgany of sunside which was the reason for the changes that radu had noted in them for now during the long hours of daylight there were grimfaced determined men on the flanks of the barrier mountains hunters who pursued and butchered men aye and it was butchery for with his own eyes radu was witness to it it happened at a time perhaps two years and nine months one hundred and thirtyfive or thirtysix sunups after hed taken his revenge on the zirescus in the westernmost woods it was the twilight before the true dawn and the tumbling moon was already reduced to a pale stain of a disc high in the amethyst sky over sunside soon the furnace sun would be up but it wouldnt find radu wanting for by now his photophobia was fullfledged he knew that direct undiluted sunlight would kill him even if he still didnt understand the reason but no sooner was he settled in the back of a shallow cave where a single stratum of soft rock had weathered out from the face of the cliff than he heard a panting and scrabbling from beyond the rim of his shelter it was a man in full flight exhausted from his exertions and hoarse from the terror of pursuit dried up and beginning to blister even in the first faint rays from the southern horizon he came stumbling croaking his relief into radus cave hidden in a dark corner radu shielded the luminous yellow glare of his eyes and waited until the man a raggedlooking sunsider possibly a loner had himself under partial control at least and when the others panting had slowed and his whimpering ceased then speaking softly radu asked who pursues you and why at the first word the other had jumped a foot gasped out loud spun about where he sat upon the dusty floor what he croaked who and then he saw radus eyes and the dark shape of a man sprawled on a bed of heather in the back of the cave radus crossbow was loaded aiming it at the man he eased himself erect or partly erect because of the low ceiling and went to where the newcomer cringed against the wall of the cave the man seemed speechless his throat throbbed and his adams apple went up and down but he merely gurgled and finally he pointed at radus face at his eyes eh radu growled rapidly losing his patience he wanted to know what was going on here if this man was a fugitive he wanted to know why from what cause are you deaf or daft or both i asked why are you running yyou ask that finally the other had found his voice and perhaps radu understood at that he narrowed his feral eyes sniffed his suspicion are you a ferenczy is that it have you heard about me and what ive done and what ill do he pointed his crossbow direct at the others throat but even in the act of speaking the words he knew he was mistaken the ferenczys had become an obsession with him that was all a fferenczy the fugitive frowned no im a romani bela romani of the szgany mirlu or i was and now the sob was back in his voice are you an outcast then what a leper the zirescus had used to banish anyone even suspected of leprosy and theyd put a bolt through him and burn his body if he tried to return leprosy the other looked at radu through haggard redrimmed eyes ah no worse than that radu backed off a pace what could anything be worse than leprosy explain he barked who what are you now it was bela romanis turn to be curious a loner a wild man of the mountains where have you been that you dont dont know of these things of what things radu was exasperated enough of riddles cant you explain yourself the other crouched back away from him im speaking of of the wamphyri but the way he spoke that last word or name wamphyri radu repeated him and frowned who are they the other licked his lips and shook his head but you your eyes are you saying that youre not not one of them and for the first time radu pondered it he was more than a mere man for sure but wamphyri tell me about them he gave a nod of his huge grey wolfish head and bela romani told him it had started in the east beyond the great pass into starside and the barren boulder plains there were rearing stacks out on those plains vast carved buttes some a kilometre high either weathered from the necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley mountains over countless millennia or thrust up from below by some colossal forgotten prehistoric upheaval the boulder plains were empty of life cold and dead for which reason men never went there or at least that was how it had used to be neither the szgany nor any other beings had dwelled there except leathery trog unmen in caverns under the barrier mountains but for some years now thered been rumours of lights in those rearing rock castles and grey smoke issuing from fissure chimneys and flying things that soared in the winds off the northern icelands around the summits of those mighty aeries of of what and a hundred sunups ago the first of them had come raiding on the szgany camps they came in search of provisions for their manses in the towering stacks thrall recruits for their aeries and fodder for their beasts but they themselves the wamphyri were the greatest beasts of all blood beasts out of starside huge men all the wamphyri looked human but were mhuman their strength was unbelievable they took strong szgany youths for their lieutenants and thralls and beautiful girls as their odalisques chiefest among them was one whose nature had rapidly become a byword for everything evil shaitan the unborn he was beautiful as a golden man but deep and dark as the swamps that spawned him and his lust was insatiable at first shaitan had restricted his raids to regions east of the great pass and had set up tribes of szgany supplicants there but as other monstrous lords had ascended to their aeries and the needs of the wamphyri had doubled and redoubled so the raids had spilled over from the eastern lands into zestos lidesci tireni and mirlu territories west of the pass and sometimes to points even further west but the szgany zestos the lidescis tirenis mirlus were not supplicants they fought back and now during the daylight hours they travelled they had become travellers as a matter of survival and not merely to beat the bounds but during the nights we hid in deep caves or in the woods with never a fire for comfort or light bela continued but still the wamphyri would find us last night following immediately on the evening twilight they found us again there was some fighting but what can men do against them the szgany mirlu scattered i ran too into the woods but i was caught anyway hengor the gust hagi a bloodsoaked barrel of a man got me clubbed me unconscious drank blood from my veins and infected me with his poisons when i came to in the twilight before the dawn i remembered his instructions as in a dream that i must go to him in starside and be his thrall in hengstack never i would return to my wife and children and be a mirlu oh really hah i was am a vampire creature in thrall to hengor the gust the sun is my mortal enemy the night my only friend as the poisons take hold so my condition will worsen i tried to return to the mirlus they saw the mark of hengors bite on my neck now if they find me theyll kill me but you your looks bela turned imploringly to radu we are the same im sure except you seem to have learned to live with it radu shook his head i dont know but one thing is certain i wont die with it while you were talking i was listening but not as you listen and youre right mirlu hunters are coming and this cave is mine i was here first belas eyes went wild in a moment drawing his lips back from snarling needle teeth he made to spring at radu who simply caught him up in one hand dragged him to the mouth of the cave and tossed him out the entrance was fringed with a little undergrowth and a few trees and the sunlight didnt strike at bela immediately he tried to stay in the shade searched for a way up the cliff there was a goat track he might even make it he scrambled up above the tree level and so came into view of the men who had followed him up through the scree jumbles of the foothills crossbows twanged and bolts buzzed like angry wasps radu saw it all the way the fugitive was swatted like a fly against the cliff his feet sliding on the narrow track his back arching like a bow as he was struck time and time again his body crumpling then toppling and turning lazily end over end and slamming down hard into the sharp rubble and scree at the foot of the cliffs anyone would think that would be enough that belas pursuers would be satisfied apparently they werent they took his body drove a stake through his heart and cut off his head and built a fire to burn him to ashes which apparently was enough it would have to be for there was nothing left of him it took a while but finally the men left and radu crept back into his cave to sleep in safety from the sun getting to sleep took a while too for there was a great deal on radus mind yet somehow while he slept a good many problems were resolved and it might even be said that he resolved some of them himself in the twilight before the true night radu awakened felt the lure of the fading moon and left his cave to worship a while and as his eerie ululant howling echoed up into the mountain heights and down into sunside he knew knew finally and for certain that he was wamphyri an eater of men aye a great vampire but more than this he was a werewolf a man halfhuman halfwolf with the brain of the one and all the speed and cunning and killer instinct of the other and if changeling men mere men could make it on starside where the sun never brian lumley shone and be lords and masters of the great aeries there then what of radu and so turning his back on sunside he climbed for the peaks and headed for starside and the destiny that waited for him there and there was such a monstrous joy in radu the joy of darkling knowledge the hideous anticipation of living off the lifeblood of others that he could scarcely contain it for bela romani had had it quite wrong and radu wasnt like him at all oh the same fever was in his blood certainly but where bela had been a mere thrall infected with the disease of vampirism radu was that disease by virtue of his parasite he was lord radu lykan and he knew it for welling up from deep within his werewolf body and vampire heart it was as if he heard the first discordant notes of a strange savage and wonderful song and how that silent song of blood and eternity thrilled him to his core when at last he came padding panting through a high mountain pass and finally gazed down on starside starside aye and faint with distance yet darkly foreboding against a backdrop of writhing northern auroras there in the cold blue light of the northstar the mistwreathed stacks of the vampire lords but however awesomely bleak the scene wasnt weird or cold to radu indeed it felt familiar no much more than that it felt like home and as he turned his face to the sky and vanishing moon and gave voice from a throbbing throat it seemed to radu that even his howling carried a new note and was more surely a song albeit a song that was awesome and terrible wamphyri wamphyyyyri iv exiled to earth going down from the heights of the barrier mountains into starside radu came upon a ragged handful of pitiful survivors of last nights vampire raid men of the mirlus like bela romani and of the szgany tireni and szgany zestos he told them who he was and what he intended to do lay claim to an aerie among the several as yet vacant stacks and people it with thralls of his own they were reluctant to join him they belonged to hengor the gust hagi or lord lankari or the drakul brothers or lord lagula ferenczy what lagula a lord of the wamphyri but the same lagula well radu must wait and see but meanwhile he offered the vampirized group a choice he would guarantee them his personal protection swear them to his service and proceed with them across the boulder plains or they could die the true death right here in these barren foothills with crossbow bolts skewering their poor decapitated bodies and without more ado they went with radu their presence was observed giant desmodus bats from the various aeries reported their progress they were in any event poor quality thralls who had not warranted transportation on the backs or in the belly pouches of their masters flyers but when they headed for a middling unoccupied stack in the outer circle of great upthrusting aeries that attracted rather more attention too late to do anything about it however for radu and his followers had taken all of the long starside night to come across the mountains and boulder plains and already the sun was burning on the higher ramparts of the greater stacks this was the time when the lords slept normally in northfacing rooms on the permanently dark sides of their aeries it was not a time when they would launch out on their flyers simply to investigate the odd behaviour of a handful of branded thralls perhaps the thralls themselves were merely being cautious and taking shelter from the sunlight all well and good this was a sign of some intelligence among them at necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley least come sundown theyd doubtless proceed to the stacks of their rightful lords who had recruited them in sunside but they didnt radu less fearful of the sun than most vampire lords had put his men to work at once they had inhabited a cave near the foot of the stack fortified its entrance found bolthole passageways onto other levels and down onto the boulder plains and generally made themselves as comfortable as possible cold comfort true but radu was still learning the way of things and a lot more to learn yet be sure sundown and lord egon drakul sent a thrall and flyer to see what was what he had beasts to feed and two of these errant thralls were his destined for the provisioning of drakstack the thrall landed his mount at the foot of the suspect aerie went striding into the scree jumbles and disappeared and in a little while a strange longhaired figure was seen seated awkwardly astride the flyer putting it through its paces over the knobby dome of the new aerie but what was this some raw recruit fresh out of sunside who yet fancied himself a lord klaus lankari sent two thralls to investigate these were bold burgeoning lads who aspired to lieutenants the result was the same by now shaitan the unborn himself was interested he watched and listened keenly from afar as hengor hagi flew out with his chief lieutenant from hengstack ah but the gust was careful to remain airborne as his man emil landed in soft sliding scree at the base of radus aerie and continued afoot to put matters right but shortly my lord emil hagisman sent with a slight but patently nervous tremor in his gustorientated feeble mental probe aye the gust circled on a flyer that was all muscle and manta wing to take his great weight whats the word my lord a man is with the recruits who says he is wamphyri in fact he has the looks and i smell it on him this one has a mature leech oh really swampbom was he with no eggsire so hes wamphyri so what he hasnt ascended we havent accepted him not yet anyway nor are we likely to since hes a thief the recruits you speak of belong to me to the ferenczys to klaus lankari and the drakuls what is he herding them for us if so well thats damned kind of him but its another matter if he intends to keep them for himself but now a different voice joined in that of radu hengor i can do many things for myself including speak i dont need an interpreter i have a leech im swampbom aye if thats the term but that was some time ago oh i know this stack ive chosen for myself isnt nearly as grand as some of your soaring aeries but its a start and i will ascend if i need your recognition then ill wait for it if its not forthcoming well im here anyway meanwhile whats mine is mine nor ami a thief in respect of these thralls a middling lot at best i need them for now thats all but in due time ill gladly repay whatever and whoever i owe with interest oh indeed the gust sent back so you take and then say youve merely borrowed eh and the flyers youve commandeered are those yours too for now until ive learned the way of making my own and that includes this one of yours but ill give you your man emil back hes loyal to a fault and therefore useless to me really hengor couldnt make up his mind to roar his rage or laugh out loud but he found himself liking this one his audacity anyway without that hed even met him as yet and if i sent another flyer for emil hagisman will you keep that too he can fly or he can walk thats your problem do you know said hengor beginning to enjoy this now in the perverse fashion of the wamphyri but without ever meeting you in the flesh already i like your colours and i fancy ill like them even more when i use them to decorate the walls of my great hall in hengstack have i slighted you then come down and lets settle it well bugger me backwards the other burst out but he was no longer amused a challenge is it listen upstart between the ferenczys drakuls klaus lankari and myself we have four hundred men thirtytwo flyers and seven fighting beasts how do you think you and your handful of fools would fare against those odds eh badly radu answered which is why ive taken the time to parley but here yet another mental voice in starsides aether a voice as powerful and authoritative as it was sinister interrupted and came between the two the voice of lord shaitan the unborn the devil himself whats all this about a swampbom lord hengor hagi do you frown on a man because he had no eggsire is a spore any less than an egg or a leech now lets face it whether a vampire is born of a woman or changed by a spore or a leech or by a bite were all of the one source the one origin which is the swamp its not the route we take which is a decision of fate but the getting here that counts well so this one has got here hengor seemed more than a little surprised what and do you accept him lord shaitan on his word alone why we dont know what we have here but a thief and a loudmouth upstart we know these things for sure oh but arent we all thieves dont we all steal out of sunside as for his braggarts mouth is it any bigger than your own or mine or anyones nor is his status suspect we most certainly do know what we have here a lord of the wamphyri and one to watch out for its obvious but if you disagree take necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley a look at the evidence he plays a decent wordgame better than you hengor for it was you who lost your temper also your own man says he has a leech neither spore egg nor mark on his neck but a mature leech and he has made his way into starside to occupy his own aerie oh a hovel of a place granted as yet so there you have it he must be a lord moreover he has mentalism which many of our colleagues lack or possess to a lesser degree but this ones mentalism is a power i felt it shaitan grew thoughtfully quiet perhaps inviting comment and the telepathic aether came alive in a moment klaus lankari now speaks said a wooden almost mechanical yet somehow doomfraught voice whats to be done something must be done for this newcomer appears to have taken a thrall of mine which i recruited in sunside klaus was an exloner not much known for quickthinking but he was a great and monstrous destroyer of life and drinker of blood he has men of ours too the drakuls spoke up in voices that hissed their telepathic venom is he to simply keep them and get away with it we say lets take them back right now and him too so he has a leech so what all the better in fact said the gust for theres nothing quite like the juice of another vampire especially his leech and since im closest i lay claim to it and finally radus turn again what dont the ferenczys have anything to say dont they want their peck at me too if so well fine for i certainly want my peck at them there it was out in the open his hatred the blood feud between him and the ferenczys and better to do it this way bold and swaggering as befitted the image radu would convey for there was that in their voices that told him it was their way the way of the wamphyri they seemed to take pleasure in words perverse convoluted argument and contradictions not so strange really why they were themselves contradictions of nature but so was radu and just as devious as the worst of them he had flyers now and could ride them in a fashion if he were attacked in force he could flee to the barrier mountains find a place to hide and consider his position and he would take a handful of thralls with him and so retain at least the nucleus of an aerie thus his braggadocio wasnt all it might seem he wasnt about to stand and fight a veritable horde of wamphyri lords and their followers but he was ready for flight at a moments notice as it happened the way hed acted was the best thing he could have done said thought shaitan the unborn was fascinated intrigued it set his own more than devious mind working overtime what some bad blood between this one and the ferenczys the brothers were fairly recent among the wamphyri true but already they posed a threat they were like stormclouds on shaitans horizon roiling and issuing stabs of lightning and inevitably heading his way for one thing there were two of them and as a team they were closer far than the drakuls shaitan remembered how they had ascended two years ago lord petre stakis had taken a small party of lieutenants thralls and an aerial warrior west along the spine of the barrier mountains and down into previously unexplored regions of sunside unexplored aye odd then that he should receive such a warm welcome but such appeared to be the case for it seemed that the szgany of those western parts had been ready waiting and prepared for just such an invasion or for something in the nature of an invasion at least the ferenczy brothers had been members of the same tribe formerly the szgany zirescu and that night well lord stakis had been unfortunate to say the least his warrior had developed a temporary fault which caused it to land badly in the mountain peaks leaving two of his lieutenants to see what could be done stakis had gone on with his reduced force homed in on the smoke of a szgany campfire and landed in the lower foothills on foot and engaged by a ferocious fighting force under rakhi and lagula stakis had been shot once through the eye and twice through the heart his leech had reckoned he was done for and made ready to exit his body the ferenczys had been on hand and would make perfect hosts but even in his death throes still stakis was a force to be reckoned with grabbing rakhi when he drew close to inspect his body stakis savaged him transfusing essence of his blood into rakhis system lagula seeing his brother grappling for his life with a dead man set about stakis with a machete and decapitated him and likewise fatally injured his leech which at that very moment was attempting to make an exit through its hosts throat dying the leech issued an egg which transferred to lagula thus lagula was wamphyri and his brother a vampire in the making two birds with one stone as it were so much lord shaitan had had from a spy of his among stakiss thralls the rest of the story how the ferenczys had holedup in the dark woods slept the sleep of change and the next night set about recruiting as many of the former zirescus as they could find and how theyd then made their way back to starside in a body was unimportant the rules of the game were as simple as shaitan himself had made them it wasnt the route men took but the getting there that counted well they had got here since when theyd made their presence felt almost as a thorn in shaitans side he was sure they worked against him or would if given the opportunity he was glad that they had no mentalism to speak of which was the reason of course that they brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i hadnt been privy to what was going on here and now the coming of this one and bad blood between them or so it would appear all in all an interesting situation and something to be fostered for if the newcomer and the ferenczys were at each others throats they wouldnt have the time to be at shaitans which was why he now proposed a solution to the problem posed by radu hear me out he said lets give this one the benefit of the doubt he says hell repay your losses very well and if he forgets his promise time enough then to sort matters out and take back and take all of what hes accrued except we cannot continue to think of him as he among the wamphyri i am the only he the first and only lord of lords you stranger do you accept that if so tell us your name and how you come to be here and radu answered my only desire is to be accepted among my peers since you appear to be the greatest of them be sure ill agree to anything you propose on the understanding that you leave me the means to live and prosper of course my name and status im lord radu lykan who fused with a leech in the swamplands far to the west all of which seems only right and reasonable to me the unseen shaitan answered eager to be done with the preliminaries very well then we will trust you but its a trust you must repay in kind if i were to offer you audience in shaitanstack would you attend me come up to my manse and enter of your own free will previously there had been a subdued but very real background babble in the psychic aether now as shaitan made his invitation this faded to an almost electric air of expectancy a hush as of held breath and radu sensed that the question of free will was of vast importance to the lords as indeed for some illdefined reason it was to him in effect lord shaitan had offered him the ultimate test and if nothing else radus answer would decide his suitability one way or the other which was why he said my lord merely tell me the hour of my audience guarantee my safe access and egress and give me a route and a lot ofmerelys shaitan answered but so be it and so it would be the time was set three hours before dawn that was shaitans choice of course and a good one for him that close to sunup he could be sure that the affair wouldnt be a long one therefore that it wouldnt get too heated for of course this was to be more than any mere audience it would be in its way a reception for the newly ascended lord lykan while shaitan had failed to mention it to radu the other principal lords and at least two of the ladies would also be there indeed they would demand invitations ostensibly as a matter of protocol but mainly to ensure that no deal would be struck between shaitan and the stranger without their knowledge with the wamphyri suspicion was a way of life not to mention a way of undeath and true death radu still didnt know too much about the wamphyri since hengor seemed reluctant to send down another flyer for his lieutenant radu used the long night hours to question emil hagisman and familiarize himself with vampire codes and customs and oddly he approved almost everything he learned of them for after all he was wamphyri too but in fact their nature was much as hed expected it to be as he was or would be himself in the fullness of time they were proud vain lusty greedy and devious and they were bestial beyond the beasts cruel beyond human cruelty and bloody beyond the deepest gutters and vats of the worst possible charnel house their conceit and various vanities were perhaps their weirdest aspect every one of them considered him or herself handsome or beautiful to a fault except they had no faults not to mention and certainly none of their own making any shortcomings were blamed on their worthless eggs or leeches while every triumph however small was as a direct result of their own efforts it was an utter contradiction of the socalled freewill code that governed their every interaction with and treatment of their contemporaries thralls beasts and victims since the wamphyri themselves enjoyed no free will as such the ideology or concepts of freedom and selfdetermination in others was paramount if lesser men controlled their own destinies then surely the mighty vampire lords controlled theirs why of course they did the wamphyri were bloodbeasts the blood was the life and the life was or could be eternal as far as was known youth and blood went hand in hand if a lord wished it he could keep his looks hold back the years and retain his sexual potency forever lesser men could indeed must shrivel under his bite and die the true death if nothing of him got into them or rise up again undead and renewed vampirized and enthralled by their lords essence while he would go on unchanged except he would be stronger and so continuously evolving through his victims devolution always and people the szgany of sunside and their produce were for using they were no more than very temporary vassals from which all the good things of life including life itself might be taken wholesale as by right or gradually siphoned off as was more frequently the case and the wamphyri could do no wrong not in their own red and rapacious eyes for they were mainly without conscience perhaps the first handful of changeling lords with the exception of shaitan wondered about it from time to time how they who had been szgany could now live like parasites off their former kith and kin and put them through such travails of terror brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i perhaps they pondered it but infrequently for while their own parasites held sway the host bodies would be and do as their leeches willed it next radu learned about the individual lords and ladies about shaitan the unborn so called because he had neither father nor mother not that he remembered but seemed to have bred himself out of the vampire swamps and why not since he was the original vampire lord no such creature before him and none since except he made them or made those who made them or they had followed him out of the sporeladen western swamps he alleged that he was the victim of some great expulsion but from where or when he knew not his persecutors had robbed him of all memory of previous existence but he believed that his crime had been his pride and awesome beauty he had dared to be more beautiful than the masters of that unremembered place which to them was unforgivable and in fact shaitan was beautiful as handsome a lord of vampires as could be imagined judge for yourself emil hagisman told radu when you go up to see him why shaitan is so goodlooking you just know he has to be the worst he makes no pretence of it but calls it the perfection of evil when the external or visible image reaches a peak such as his then the rot must commence invisibly from within and lord shaitan has been rotting since his very first moment of being shaitan was the overlord here the uncrowned king of these beings but among his closest contemporaries it was generally suspected that just such a crown and a throne were his ambition therefore because he was so powerful his allies were few perhaps that was why he seemed so eager to accept radu as a future ally but in any case lord lykan would do well to watch his step in shaitanstack as for the rest of the wamphyri radu paid some attention to what emil hagisman told him especially with regard to the ferenczys but their descriptions habits and origins could only come as something of an anticlimax after shaitan himself there was hengor called the gust for his girth thunderous outbursts and bellowing laughter not that there was very much of merriment in him his angers were frequently as violent as his mirth while his vampire appetite for anything unholy matched the size of his belly hengor was not a true hagi he took his surname from the szgany hagi the first sunside tribe visited by shaitan the unborn during his journey of discovery from the western swamps into starside among the unsuspecting hagis the lord of vampires had seduced a girl who later converted hengor among others before the tribes leader heinar hagi put her down hengor had dwelled in starside only a year less than shaitan himself his aerie rivalled shaitanstack in its colossal if morbid grandeur and meanwhile the szgany hagi were probably no more klaus lankari was a mountain man a loner and dullard who had thought to explore the swamps only to return from them something other than a man less scrupulous than shaitan and the others most of his thralls were trogs recruited from caverns under the barrier mountains he kept trog odalisques too and was pleased to admit that during his years in the wild he had shagged far worse than these as for thereza threeeyes lugosi she would be a gross mistake in any world born a freak as a sunsider child shed been fortunate to escape with her life the szgany had enough to do in those days of restructuring without the extra burden of caring for monstrous children but her parents had pleaded her case however grudgingly they had been granted the right to care for her fearing for her safety anyway theyd become loners in sunsides foothills and mountain passes the source of her eventual vampiric contamination was unknown except to thereza herself but that her doting parents had paid in full for letting their deformed ogre of a child grow to full maturity was scarcely a matter for conjecture she kept their teeth and finger bones on a gold chain around her neck therezas deformities were several one shoulder appeared to be missing entirely she held the good one high which gave her the appearance of a hunchback her left arm was of normal length but the right dangled to her knees her breasts were dissimilar flaccid dugs and all of her skin was mottled with purplish blotches and birthmarks but her third eye was the worst of her blemishes shed been born with an extra orbit in the back of her skull and a rudimentary eye skinned over in its socket since her change thereza had developed this abnormality into an actual optical receptor an eye which gazed out lidlessly if not vacantly from the spot where she kept her hair shorn which was perhaps a measure of her real monstrousness that with her metamorphism while she scarcely required to remain ugly at all but might easily remodel herself she preferred it that way as to the eye she declared that of all the wamphyri she alone possessed the means of watching her back at all times then there was the lady rusha basti by all accounts gorgeous as a peach except by whose account to emil hagismans knowledge no one had ever seen her entirely what exposed not even her occasional lovers rushas hair was red as flame and longer than her ample body and she wore it in several sensuous designs strategically bunched or shaped with clasps to cover or expose her various parts according to her mood sometimes she would leave a breast bare now and then her back and buttocks or her long and alluring legs but never her face perhaps she was a hag after all rumour had it that she detested her eyes which were red as her hair of course and her brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i nose which had a flange and was convolute beyond her ability to mask it with vampire metamorphism a rarity rusha actually admitted to these small flaws or rather she would not admit to them and so must keep them covered with luck radu might find himself on a good thing with the lady rusha basti with the exception of lord shaitan the unborn who preferred absolute control over his odalisques and hengor hagi because he had the bulk of a bull shad and rusha would not suffer the necessary bruising of such an affaire shed had all the lords worth mentioning as lovers indeed she loved them and left them as easily as snapping her fingers but on the other hand rusha was not so easy as might at first be reckoned stolen out of starside just four or five years ago she had ascended in very short order and the young lord who had taken her well where was he she had his egg be sure but did she also have his head according to rusha he had died of some wasting disease in her loving embrace and if so then hed probably expired happy but expired definitely emil hagisman had heard of certain female spiders who but hed made his point and radu assured him he need say no more then there were the drakuls karl and egon they had been among the firstestablished in starside the younger bloodsons of a loner family vampirized in the swamps theyd been obliged to care for themselves almost from infancy for the drakul family had dwelled in the mountains where as long as they stayed starside of the peaks theyd been able to eke out something of an existence but allegedly in those days there had been doglords in the hills men much like radu but with a great deal more of the wolf in them and far less of intelligence and these and the drakuls had feuded one night hounded by these wolflings the man his wife and one older son had been driven over into sunside in the twilight hours before the dawn unable to find shelter theyd perished in the blast from the rising sun but the infant brothers twins which were not uncommon among the szgany had been left behind and raised half by the wild doglords half by a pack of common grey brothers when they were old enough and they were only youths even now perhaps seventeen or eighteen years old but precocious far beyond their years then they had come down into starside to build an aerie among the menhirs of the wamphyri demoniac fighters both of them were viciously territorial even more so than the wamphyri in general perhaps it was only natural for after all their mountaindwelling parents had had nothing currently the brothers occupied drakstack which egon had claimed as his own wherefore his twin was already at work on nearby karlscar both of these stacks would make tremendous aeries which together might house vampire armies to rival anything of shaitans making shaitan however was aware of drakul rapaciousness needless to state the brothers were not his favourites among the lesser lords nor were they anyones for even by wamphyri standards their ways were dark and finally the gusts lieutenant went on to tell radu of turgo zolte shaitans socalled son but discovered by shaitan in an act of black treachery turgo had been thrown out of his fathers manse onto the boulder plains to exist as best possible in the scree and the rubble and the dust it was said he dwelled now in sunside sleeping out his days in deep caves where the sun couldnt find him and constantly on the run from the szgany if so then he was fortunate indeed and far more so than his coconspirators one of these had been tossed into the starside gate and so banished to unknown hells the other lay undead in a deep grave on the boulder plains slowly stiffening to a stone among stones as for the lesser lords and ladies they were diverse as all of the aforementioned but emil hagisman would gladly say on if radu wished it he didnt for in the newfound conceit or selfassurance of his own strengths and talents he wasnt much interested in the lesser personages certain things however continued to puzzle him not least how for so long hed been ignorant of the wamphyris presence here the lords lived on trogs for long and long his informant told him until their stacks were established and its only recently that lord shaitan bred his first flyers and warriors thus prompting the others to follow suit but now theyre moving that much faster theyve organized supplicant tribes east of the great pass who make their battle gauntlets for them and other supplicants who are simply flesh they take tithe from the poor bastards even as i was taken raids west of the pass have been few and far between certain of the szgany tribes fight back the lidescis in particular are vicious in their defence of sunside and you say you were a loner who dwelled in the mountains and kept apart from men plainly you were for theres that of the great wolf in you but the barrier mountains are a mighty range its not surprising you didnt sight the wamphyri on their infrequent raids ask yourself this why should they raid west of the pass when theres easy meat in the east also why should they be in a hurry to show themselves what is time to them but that was then and this is now sunside will come more and more under attack and one other subject mentalism said radu do they all have it who is the craftiest thoughtthief whom i must watch out for and who is least talented that i can spy on his mind you could get me killed emil hagisman protested perhaps ive said too much already and why have you something about your eyes their penetrating stare or your open necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley attitude your innocence perhaps you treat me as a man not as a slave i suspect its because you are new to all this ah but youll be a true lord soon enough perhaps its because you have more than mere mentalism they say that rusha basti is a beguiler too a beguiler hypnotism radu hadnt realized it not in himself theres that in your voice that lulls said the other it makes me weary and lures words out of me radu held him close and stared deep into his eyes which were feral even as radus own but without his scarlet cores then say on and tell me what i would know he said and emil hagisman told him or would have but at that very moment one of radus thralls came scrambling down from a high vantageviewpoint looking northeast on the greater stacks of the wamphyri he was pointing back over his shoulder gabbling lord lykan there in the sky around one of the mightiest aeries aerial warriors and flyers bearing armoured men they swarm even now perhaps against us in moments radu and the gusts lieutenant had climbed up into a viewing niche where they gazed out through a wide and jagged crack in the stacks outer sheath upwards and into the heart of the nest of skyscraping towers and in one sense at least radus thrall was correct a swarm of men and creatures were massed about one of the central aeries except they were not descending from it but attacking it shaitanstack emil hagisman gasped shaitan the lord of vampires himself is under attack radu looked at him in two more hours i was to meet with him now it would seem not it was probably his invitation to you that started this going the other told him shielding his eyes from the northern auroras as he tried to identify the shapes darting around shaitanstack oh how so a distraction of course the perfect time to launch a preemptive strike what a reception in shaitanstack why the lords are all busy prettying themselves up not to mention the ladies proud aye and shaitan himself proudest of them all hell want his place to look its very best oh they dont get their heads together very often these vampire lords but when they do its a grand contest of words and gestures poses and postures all for me for them halfhinted taunts and challenges threats and insinuations they thrive on it but at a reception no weapons allowed they can crow preen and bluster all they like and no harm done until later possibly you make them sound what like fools buffoons among themselves so it would ofttimes seem for they have each others measure after all well more or less but among humankind ah no great bears play roughandtumble in the foothills of sunside and no harm done but if they played with men like that theyd break all of their bones emil saw something and pointed excitedly ah see radu looked see what more flyers going up from kirkscrag antonstack and wenskeep reinforcements and look a crippled flyer heads this way it is one of lord ehrigs creatures i cannot be mistaken for his sigil adorns its flank lord shaitans enemies are kirk nunosti anton zappos and ehrig the wen lesser lords all aye emil nodded his head in great excitement all lesser lords all joined together now against shaitan and all losers too losers he has their measure emil pointed again and radu saw with a stuttering and coughing of biopropulsive orifices things had emerged from shaitanstacks launching bays and even at this distance they were far more awesome constructs than the ones ranged against them other bays issued flyers with lieutenant and thrall riders their polished leather armour and iron weapons glinting blue in the sheen of the stars there followed a scattering as of leaves in a sudden gust as shaitans forces fought and tore and ravaged amongst their enemies and shortly in the space of only a minute or two the debris of lords nunosti zappos and ehrig the wens shattered forces began spiralling drifting or plummeting down onto the boulder plains some survivors a very few the merest handful all of them in wild disarray made to fly home to the lesser aeries of kirkscrag antonstack and wenskeep shaitans superior forces harried them all the way if the errant lords themselves are among the survivors emil husked shaitan will hang them in silver chains from his ramparts and fry them in the golden fires of sunup suddenly there were flurries of activity in the launching bays of the other manses and aeries where previously the greater lords had looked on perhaps even wagering on the outcome of this insurrection now they seemed eager to show their solidarity with shaitan flyers launched as anxious wamphyri lords and ladies made to attend their overlord but he would have none of that radu jerked back from his natural viewport as great gonging thoughts rang in his vampire minds keep back who dares come here now comes at his own risk my blood is up i am betrayed and who can say but that these were only dupes playing out the moves of some sneaky cowardly gamesmaster is there no honour among the wamphyri brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i of course not and shaitan knew it knew also that the others would protest his insinuation indeed his accusation anyway but before their denials could get underway shaitans voice rang out again shaitanstack is now inviolate i shall not suffer any of you to come here all invitations and engagements are cancelled now i go to make assessment of my losses and my not inconsiderable gains also to think what must be done and against whom first however i require a show of allegiance answer me now who stands with shaitan recognizing him as his one and true liege lord radu answered at once radu lykan stand with shaitan in truth he didnt care who he stood with just as long as he was accepted with a minimum of trouble from the others there was momentary silence until the lord of vampires said any who do not stand with me naturally stand against me at which there was a concerted babble of nightmare voices as they sought to guarantee their allegiance for if not why shaitan could pick them off one at a time and they had already seen what lesser alliances were worth the mental gabble picked up until again shaitan broke in radu lykan lord lykan as you are now you were first to side with me since it seems i now hold sway i hereby testify to your ascension you are lord lykan moreover he who would harm you harms me except i would hazard from your wolfish ways and the bark in your mind that you are a doglord just so well and as the dogs of the szgany are faithful so shall i expect faithfulness of you so be it but from the other lords what he has ascended just like that this bold thief of a wolf out of sunside and shaitan laughed and told them aye and he keeps what he has taken no payment or repayment due what but your losses are small for only think what you might lose should i pursue certain investigations as it stands the uprising has been put down those lords who were caught redhanded will pay for it and let that be the end of it shaitan is merciful as the psychic aether fell silent radu said to emil hagisman now you can take your flyer and return to the gust if he asks you what transpired tell him you told me nothing and be sure ill never give you away also if at any future time something should befall hengor hagi you know theres a place for you with me only tell me one more thing before you go name it the others relief was plain to see in all of this so far ive havent heard a single word out of the ferenczys are they without mentalism or what apparently emil nodded it will doubtless come with time as all wamphyri talents do though slower in some than in others but for the moment the ferenczy brothers are deaf and dumb in the art of telepathy theyll know nothing of my presence here oh be sure theyll know youre here if not who you are and theyll know that soon enough for others are bound to tell them then theres the question of lagulas stolen thralls but you have shaitans protection for now at least hes changeable as the wind off the icelands aye the wind off the icelands radu repeated him nodding thoughtfully and stroking back his mane but then he grinned in his wolf fashion clapped emil on the shoulder and barked which currently blows in your favour so be off now to hengstack and give my regards to the gust tell him i admired his wordgame and that i look forward to taunting with him again sometime thus radu lykan ascended to wolfsden in starside in those earliest days of the wamphyri the rest is known radu rose in the ranks of the wamphyri and acquired all the natural monstrous instincts of a lord almost as a vampire born eventually he incurred the wrath of shaitan by which time he was equal in stature to even the greatest of the lesser lords and wolfsden was insufficient to contain his army territorial he looked at the other stacks all of them occupied now but especially he looked at ferencscar let the bloodwars commence radu allied himself with hengor hagi klaus lankari and thereza lugosi against the ferenczys who were now legion lagula ferenczy had sired a bloodson nonari the gross and a daughter freyda ferenc both of whom had ascended in their turn to occupy their own aeries rakhi ferenczy had likewise ascended to a lord for petre stakiss last bite had been virulent indeed transfusing or conferring upon rakhi all the ingredients of a lord in short he had developed a leech of his own still rakhi fell first radu beheaded him tore out his parasite and devoured it rakhis men and beasts were divided between the victors straws were drawn for rakstack which went to the gust who at once gutted the place radu and his allies again turned their eyes on ferencscar nonspire and freydastack but freyda a socalled mother of vampires was no more she had died spawning a deluge of eggs all of which save one were diseased and likewise expired ferencscar fell and finally lagula ferenczy the lone surviving member of that band who had ravaged radus innocent sister must pay the price a hundred and seventy years had passed since then but brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i radu had forgotten and forgiven nothing the wamphyri do not forgive he cut through lagulas tendons to weaken his joints put his neck in a silver noose skewered his limbs with iron hooks and had him drawn and quartered between straining flyers so that his blood and his bits fell like red rain down onto the shuddering boulder plains and that would have been that except now lagulas bloodson nonari the gross swore vengeance on radu and death to his kith kin and spawn for all time to come the impassioned vow of a lord of the wamphyri which might outlast eternity itself they would have gone at it at once except a greater peril now united all the lords even radu and nonari against a yet more pitiless foe whose name was shaitan the lord of vampires had stood aloof from the bloodwars until now but finally when all the others were weakened shaitan swooped on the lesser stacks and ate them up in a veritable frenzy of conquest until shortly only two camps left shaitan on the one hand and his great enemies on the other the stacks under shaitans control were many flesh of his flesh his own bloodsons and daughters inhabited them but one of these shaitans true son or eggson the onceturgo zolte long returned from banishment and grown mighty in starside joined now with his fathers foes in the longest and bloodiest bloodwar so far which in the end shaitan won then the reckoning when hengor hagi klaus lankari and thereza lugosi were buried alive out on the boulder plains to stiffen to stones and turgo zolte was banished into the northern icelands except he reneged on his punishment and fled east over the great red waste out of his fathers jurisdiction and presumably to his death and the drakuls nonari the gross and radu were hurled along with a handful of surviving thralls and supplicant szgany into the helllands gate many of whom resurfaced in a land called dacia by its roman overlords on a great river called the danuvius in a world an entire dimensions remove from starside in the year ad they emerged close to a harbour where roman merchants and the soldiers who protected them along with local dacians gathered to buy or barter and to trade in slaves and because they arrived by the light of the full moon it was a joyous time for radu when he and his ran free and amok among the sparse local populace eventually the drakuls and theirs went up into the mountains to find or build an aerie nonari the gross ferenczy fled east from radus wrath and took a new name and radu crossed the river with his followers who spread out into all the lands around and in an age of legends it was the beginning of a new legend indeed of several the legends of the vampire and the werewolf and the dark things of night as for the place of radus resurgence the bartercamp of the romans and dacians it would have many names down the centuries but to the superstitious people of that region who had long memories it would always be known as radujevac where radu came forth of course necroscope the lost years vol i v dreams in resin radu dreamed his olden less than vivid dreams and strove to reinstate restructure them in the eye of memory he dreamed of ages past and of the life hed known then and of the many lives hed consumed since then crimson dreams of his genesis as a man in a far vampire world of his monstrous conversion into something other than a man during his time of banishment of his everlasting revenge on those who had dared to rape and ruin what little he had loved less than vivid these dreams of his aye unless they were recounted reinforced revisited time and again to bring them into nightmare definition in a yet more nightmarish mind for time has the power to blur and even erase and these were things that radu desired to remember forever during his sleep of centuries they had been his one recourse his only means of keeping his hatred alive while he waited out his time undead he recalled names out of the fading past names that were cursed for all time to come such as the zirescus giorga ion and lexandru and the ferenczys lagula and rakhi once lords in olden starside except all were dead in another time even another world dead by his hand aye and radu relished resurgent memories of how he had dealt with them who had borne those names and how he would next deal with any survivor any descendant when once more he was up and abroad in this new world where his dreams would become the new reality true the resolution of ancient bloodfeuds was but a very small part of the overall schemes hed schemed in his immemorial sleep but a delicious part and it would be for any survivors just as it had been for their ancestors or worse his immemorial sleep well immemorial to those hed left behind szgany supplicants thralls to remember and restore him when his time was nigh but not to him for despite the fact that radus dreams and memories required constant restoration still they remained his one true anchor on the dimly echoing past his one guide to an everexpanding future and still they were red he saw it even now in the eye of memory how it had been in another time another world and how it was yet to be in this one giorga that cruel old bastard bah for his death had been too easy flopping about in his own blood awash in a crimson flood that pulsed from his gaping throat and punctured gut air whistling in and out of his sliced windpipe forming bright red bubbles into a livid froth that stained his beard and speckled his madly puffing face but the spurting of his lifeblood and all his jerking and twitching quickly slowing down as life ebbed much too quickly and giorgas son lexandru who had raped radus sister sharing magdas body even when life had fled it with his brother ion and the ferenczys he too had died far too quickly with a bolt from radus crossbow buried in his black heart and radus name spraying in red from his disbelieving lips and ion last and most loathsome of a brutish line ion with one bolt through his right arm and another in his shoulder pinning him to a tree but radu had promised himself that this time the payment would be cruel as the crime even so cruel just so cruel magda had been raped deflowered even unto death her innocence crushed and ravaged from her as if torn out so be it ion hanging there helpless from a crossbow bolt while radus taloned hands caressed him in his bodys most delicate parts then a of radus rage and wamphyri passion flowing in a single moment into his arms and hands in that same moment ion zirescu had lost everything even the lower pipes of his body dislocated wrenched out of place and left dangling like lumpy red rags not surprisingly he had lost consciousness too and would have gone on losing enough blood that he would never wake up except radu would not let it go to waste not all of it and while there was yet a pulse in his victims jugular he had buried a wolfs fangs in it to draw off the remainder of ions life ah how he had slaked his awful thirst giving nothing of himself but draining all from the other even to the dregs blood it was what radu had needed what his parasite vampire leech needed it was the nectar of life it had been the life and would be again when he was up up up from his gluey grave no not a grave but a refuge a sanctuary from men and from ancient enemies who were other than men and from time itself but especially a sanctuary from that greatest of all destroyers which had finally determined his fate black it had been brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i and black its name black as the swarming rats that brought it out of the east as for men theyd been naive as children when first radu and the others out of starside came among them their sciences were young their superstitions many and their blood sweet as any to be found on sunside in that far vampire world of radus youth even so their weapons had been deadly and their courage unbelievable in the first hundred two hundred years the vampire and werewolf had flourished aeries and lairs had been erected or excavated in the mountains and men had shunned the wooded foothills of the carpatii meridional and lands around in the beginning ranging far and wide radu and his various packs had ravaged among the colonial settlements north of the danube even to the point of harassing a roman garrisons three cohorts which were permanently stationed there to man forts strung out between the river and foothills protection for the trade and supply routes a fairly easy target the garrison was residual of a much earlier xihth legion its soldiers had mainly settled the land around they were as much locals as the dacians themselves but despite that they were only three cohorts of the original legion the title the th stuck and the troubles radu brought them quickly earned them a prefix the unlucky th from which time forward that number had been known as a symbol of illfortune among the romans and others and eventually the entire world even as it had been in sunsidestarside nightskirmishing with legionnaires along the river and in the dacian hamlets ah but that had been a grand and dangerous game one time radu had been taken in an animal trap given a knock on the head that nearbrained him hed come to on a roman ship on the danube on course for the black sea and eventually rome itself and doubtless the games several of his pack were with him taken with common wolves in nets or pitfalls perhaps their captors considered them a new species well so they were in a way there were also caged bears and wild boars from the woods of eastern pannonia chests of local gold in thumbsized ingots barrels of spices and wines galore in racks of amphorae a varied cargo but the wolf is a wily beast and the werewolf even more so while the sheer physical strength of a lord of the wamphyri is awesome the oakstaved cages were like so much kindling in radus hands and above decks a full moon rode high in the dacian sides and the night was by no means done the ship had beached itself near zimnicea its crew and a handful of legionnaires retiring out of the army and returning to their homelands were found hanging by their heels from the rigging naked pale and bloodless but despite that their bodies had been ripped apart and their throats torn out there was little of actual blood to be discovered later local dacians had paid for this atrocity a hamlet in the foothills well known for the rebellious nature of its citizens was put to the sword and razed to the ground it still amused radu to think of it how he had freed the wild creatures to swim ashore stolen much of the wine and destroyed what couldnt be carried away as for the gold well in his way lord radu too had been naive in those early times and gold had been common in starside hed seen no use for the heavy stuff his thralls had thrown a fortune overboard there it had stayed for all he knew in the silt of a shallow reach of the river for over fifteen hundred years if ever he revisited those parts he would know where to find it again but there had been two other items of cargo that radu had found much more interesting which years later he had cause to remember and utilize several amphorae filled with a glutinous golden liquid at first mistaken for honey and a chest of yellow stones the first was resin used throughout the mediterranean as a preservative in wine and the second was fossilized resin turned hard as rock and rounded by the baltic into polished amber pebbles and lord radu originally an untutored nomad little more than a savage from the woods of a parallel world then a mutated lord on the dark side of that world now finally a werewolf in this world had seen the connection between the two and might well have been one of the first men ever to see it for on starside it had been the practice of certain lords of the wamphyri to bury defeated enemies alive out on the boulder plains to stiffen to stones and fuse with the earth in their deep and inescapable graves but in this case it was different here the preserving resin itself had stiffened keeping intact whatever was caught within for the translucent softly glowing pebbles had contained flies and beetles trapped in the exuded lifefluids of coniferous forests dead and gone for countless years radu had no idea of the span of time of the aeons it had taken to turn resin to amber but the principle had astonished him all the same especially when he examined some of the specimens locked in the amber such as a perfectly preserved dragonfly or an ant with a fragment of leaf still clearly visible in its mandibles these creatures were dead of course and in the terms of men might well have been dead forever but what if a lord of the wamphyri should choose to preserve himself in this fashion what a metamorphic vampire with selfregenerating flesh and from that time forward radu had worn an amber bauble with its captive insect intact on a slender chain of gold around his neck amber the ultimate end product of resin resin the blood of great pines which fifteen hundred years ago and indeed in far more recent times had covered the mountain slopes brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i like winter fur on a beasts hide not only the granite mountains of inhospitable scottish regions but those of far foreign parts as well no shortage of resin no two centuries after radus coming all the greeks in the mediterranean had been using countless tons of the stuff just to cure their wines and if radus contemporaries the drakuls for instance had thought to bring native earth from their aeries in starside for their beds here in this world then why not a bed of amber for a sleep of centuries for long and long years without number the idea had lain dormant in radus head without his even suspecting it was there but when hed needed it resin a preservative with medicinal properties a shield against the ravages of time perhaps even a cure for a terrible curse that in this world was as devastating as leprosy in starside well that last wasnt proven as yet but what was that radus dreams were more nearly conscious thoughts now so that the very slightest of tremors which hed felt through the walls of his sarcophagus and the nearsolid matrix of his resin cocoon had seemed like a presence entering the room of a man on the verge of waking he had sensed something or someone or perhaps it was merely the mountains settling onto their foundations as they had been doing for all of the six hundred years hed lain here he hadnt called had he it wasnt time yet was it soon but not yet so could it have been his creature stirring with hideous life where it waxed in its own great vat possibly he would feel such motions certainly for its mind and flesh were of his making and so gently little one gently radu sleepily sent your time is soon be sure but not before mine so have no fear for your master shall be there to bring you forth there was no answer and radu hadnt expected one it was simply a tremor in these old and fractured rocks that was all he could go back to his dreaming of men and monsters time and the plague and of his eventual flight from all these things men the romans but the empire had been on the wane at least in the parts where radu and the others came forth aye for the goths were coming and they were only a very small part of what else was coming such wars such battles such blood the blood was the life and the diversity of blood in this new world no wonder that at first these helllands had seemed like some sort of wamphyri heaven or paradise oh really men and their wars during long years of upheaval the wamphyri had moved into the mountain heights and spread out into the lands around even into other lands across the sea indeed into all the shores of the mediterranean and its islands for they had seen the folly of their ways when first they came here they had been too bold and had become legends which would not fade quickly in the memories of men but if they desired long lives here they must be or at least appear to be as one with the world and its people and not apart from them and slowly but surely they had come to a mutual understanding that in this bloody and wartorn world they would use to best advantage such cover as the wars established for them and indeed a cover had been required for already it was seen how men reacted to the wamphyri presence fearfully at first in a world rife with superstition but then like the szgany of sunside they fought back for while men may suffer their lands to be stolen their children to be eaten and their wives seduced away when finally they have nothing left then theres nothing left to lose and then any man will fight that was how it had been the alien invaders of earth had thought to rule by terror as they had in sunsidestarside but even there they had not had it all their own way through seemingly endless days the sun had forbidden entry into sunside in the dark of misty nights the szgany had hidden themselves away or if they could not hide had taken up arms likewise in this world except here it was worse here the nights were fleeting things and allowed so little time for the vampire lords to establish themselves and the days were terrible the furnace sun passed directly overhead and there were no barrier mountains to contain its searing rays or the rage of vengeful men oh there were mountains to be sure and such mountains the vast horseshoe of the carpatii in the east and the mighty alps in the west but unlike the barrier mountains of sunsidestarside the solar orb was not restricted by them and at its zenith burned down on all and everything indiscriminately as for the great armies of nomad tribesmen that were sweeping the world at that time where mountains could not be climbed they could always be circumvented and they were by warriors by men who had known how to destroy their enemies even the wamphyri and destroy them utterly known how a bolt or a lance through the heart would kill a man and how his head on a lance would guarantee he was dead then how to reduce his castle and its contents to ashes until nothing of him or his survived such methods were simply the way of the warrior and by no means reserved for the wamphyri and their followers for in a majority of cases the invaders who used them first the goths later the visigoths and avars did not even know they went up against the wamphyri no for they were merely murdering rich dacian landowners in their gloomy castles or strange savage grey halflings in their foothill keeps and caverns brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i and because of the times times of change tumult and crisis indeed the crisis of an entire classical world the as yet young legend of the wamphyri of the bloodcrazed vampire and werewolf was almost eradicated what need for monstrous myths in a world that was in reality a bloodbath forty years after radus coming the visigoths had sacked rome itself and fortyfive years later it had fallen again to the vandals except on that occasion radu had been part of it for like most of the wamphyri exiled from starside by shaitan he was unable to resist blood certainly not in such copious amounts war to which he was drawn as a lodestone is drawn north and such wars to be warred as nothing conceived in starside by even the mightiest of the old lords and down all the years and decades radu was a great mercenary washed hither and to by the tides of war and blood he used his gift of oneiromancy not uncommon among doglords to scry on future times and know in advance which side to join in the great wars to come and likewise he remained alert for word of those olden enemies who came through the helllands gate with him and time and again radu cursed himself that hed not dealt with them then on the very threshold of this new world when they were at their weakest but then he had been at his weakest too for a time rumours found their way to radu employed as a mercenary warlord by the vandal gaeseric who dubbed him radu hound of the night because he preferred guerilla warfare by the light of a full moon he learned of the alleged death of one onarius ferengus a provincial senator what roman murdered by pirates in his villa at odessus on the black sea ten years earlier this he had from a numidian slavegirl ulutu set free when gaeserics forces sacked rome upon a time shed belonged to onarius but she had fled from the fire and the fighting on the night he was killed and from ulutus descriptions of her exmaster radu had little doubt but that he had been none other than nonari the gross ferenczy and in radus keeping where he and his pack spent their days in a den under the colli albani twelve miles out of rome ulutu fell under her new masters spell and radu to a lesser degree under hers and they were lovers but because he had enough of pups up in the mountains of dacia now goth territory and because he had learned that anonymity and insularity were synonymous with longevity he made sure that ulutu stayed entirely human which is to say that for all that he was into her nothing of him got into her and at times lying spent on their bed of cured furs at radus request she would tell him various things about her former master just how nonari the gross had gained elevation to the rank of a roman senator in absentia during the eightyodd years sped by since the coming of the wamphyri into dacia that was anybodys guess but the way the girl described his castle backed up to a great cliff with his private chambers facing away from the sun and always in the shade and his servants like mists over a bubbling swamp drifting pale and ghastly yet smiling with strong white teeth all wafting and weaving hastening to onariuss beck and call yet shuddering to his touch so cold and menacing and his right hand like a club with its fingers all welded into one he had called her his little trog and had told her that hed known trogs before in the dank caverns of a far forbidden world except they had been shambling leathery creatures while ulutu was graceful and her skin so soft it had never ceased to amaze him that shed been browned by the sun but yet was not burned up but onariuss odalisques were white arabs britons and syrians and he had no time for dalliance with trogs even if they were as beautiful as ulutu and so she had carried water cleaned onariuss chambers and been grateful for she knew how he dealt with them with whom he dallied or rather she did not know for he was wary of prying eyes but she had seen the evidence of his passion apparent in the feral yellow eyes of his male and female thralls alike and in their wafting and weaving after only a very short space of time spent in his service even in certain of the villas children which were gross she had seen how rapidly his odalisques aged and his thralls were worn down sucked dry until they were no more and how when they died he buried them deep in the earth where the rocky land sloped down to the sea with the rush and roar of breakers to deaden other sounds onarius had a son in the mountains far to the north in a place called the khorvaty in moldavia he was called belos pheropzis and kept a great castle in the heights on the very borders of the empires territory all secret from romans and nomad invaders alike the place was to be onariuss bolthole in the event he should need one as to how onariuss little trog had known these things she had feared this belos mightily when he visited his father because of the way he looked at her the way he looked at all females even his fathers thrall mistresses yet at the same time she had been fascinated by him his dark good looks hawkish features massive yet proportionate stature keeping well out of sight shed listened to their conversations mainly to ensure that belos did not ask for her for if he had then she would have run away but when radu had queried her one time about this attraction that shed felt towards belos no my lord ulutu had told him lying sprawled between his legs and fondling his now flaccid rod squeezing its glans between her dark brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i breasts and kissing its tiny lips perhaps i have given you the wrong impression it was not so much fascination as terror that i felt for this belos was like one of the great warhorses that draw the roman chariots and what was i but a tiny black mare i was a slave and if this son of onarius had wanted me i scarcely believed i could contain him in my small body at which she had seen her mistake at once for radu was fiercely prideful but since it seems i contain you well enough my lord obviously i was mistaken whichever this belos frightened me seeming more creature than man more animal than human what even as i am more creature than man more animal than human radu had reached down to fondle her soft breasts and draw ulutu effortlessly up onto his belly where he could squeeze her dark and rounded buttocks you are a wolfling as ive seen she had told him then but belos was other and radu had felt her small shudder aye and ulutu was right belos was other no slightest shadow of a doubt he was this onariuss eggson wamphyri which perhaps explained his looks and appetites and the reason why he and his damned father were so close or maybe that last was as a result of the wars the shaken perhaps even crumbling roman empire the unstable skein of things in general for even the best wamphyri relationship could scarcely be described as close not in normal circumstances but that apart quite obviously this this scum of starside had bred one of its own here in this world an eggson for nonari a ferenczy well so be it it simply meant thered be one more ferenczy for radu to hunt down when all wars were won and times were right and the world was quiet again and as for this socalled onarius ferengus dead was he radu didnt think so more likely it was some grand contrivance the entire scenario some scheme of nonaris to vanish a while and come back later under a new name and in a different guise the idea was interesting something radu could even try for himself in some future time when it might seem to some that he had lived too long radus dreams had set his juices working however sluggishly dreams of his undying hatred for the ferenczys his charnel love of the battlefield but especially his carnal memories of ulutu ah ulutu she had loved his horn and it had been hard to will his spunk lifeless when he spurted in her but if she had fallen pregnant then she had also fallen dead be sure for radu was not like nonari making vampires left right and centre to plague him in a later age his pups were enough for him they had known his bite and bore his curse that of the moonchild the changeling the werewolf but not liis seed there would be time for bloodsons and eventually an eggson later when he could afford the time to train control and bend them to his will but in that savage world of fifteen hundred years ago radu lykan had control over nothing even kings and emperors had controlled nothing only the restless forces of nature change and chaos had any control at all but ulutu radu had bitten her during intercourse a love bite but much too deep she would never be wamphyri well not for a long long time at least if she lived that long but she would be a wolfling bound to radu as his thrall very well she could run with the pack and be his mate for as long as it lasted alas but that hadnt been long gaeserics advisers who earlier in the campaign had welcomed radus pack as mercenary warriors without peer men who fight like dogs of the wild now gave their lord different advice oh it had seemed a grand irony at first a marvellous jest that a great city founded by wolfsuckled brothers should be brought to its knees in part by a wolfish man this socalled hound of night with his band of howling berserks but the city had fallen now and radu and his lot had been paid off and who could say perhaps they had even been paid too well for what were they after all but mercenaries and only a handful by comparison with the true vandal army no match for gaeseric if he should decide to take back what tribute he had paid them aye and these wolves of war kept many comely women plundered out of rome and measures of good red wine likewise sacked from the city which they held in their cavern lair in the mountains with the rest of their loot a man of gaeserics had come to radu in the early evening with news of a legion mustering in the north and roman galleys from the eastern empire putting men and ordnances ashore south of the tiberis and these were gaeserics orders radu was to send onethird of his men to spy out the land to the north and he and the rest were to harass the seaborne invasion at the mouth of the river which in the same night he set out to do only to discover that there were no such reinforcements for the ravaged city nor had there been then he remembered how hed dreamed dreams of treachery and saw when he rushed back to his lair under the mountains how his dreams were true smoke and fire issuing from the great caverns outlets and the ravished bodies of the packs women strewn among the coarse grasses at the mouth of the cave even ulutu with blood under her nails from the fight shed put up at which it was as much as radu could do to keep himself from screaming aloud it was not that she was dead he might even have killed her himself had circumstances required it but more the way of her death for it brought back to him memories of his own sisters rape and murder at the hands of zirescu and ferenczy scum in sunside in a different world necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley and finally he did scream except it was a howl that went vibrating up to the sinking moon and a full moon at that there were vandals in the heights around the cavern and in the defile that led to it they had thought that radu would not be back until full daylight which would be to their advantage for he was a night fighter yet here he was albeit weary from his abortive journey to the coast and back by comparison radus hundred was a handful while gaeserics ambush party a formidable assault unit outnumbered them four to one but despite that the two sides were unequal and that the vandals held the high ground still their advantage was not so great as might be reckoned not against furious vengeful men and men who were werewolves at that so the battle was joined as bloody as might be imagined it was the twilight before the dawn when the eyes of men may not be trusted but the eyes of wolves are feral they see in the twilight just as well as in the night also a mist was rising a vampire mist conjured out of radus pores and up from the bonedry earth but all in vain the pack was beaten from the start almost before it began for they must strike up at the ambushers while the vandals need only strike down and radus wolflings fought in ragged clothes with staves knives axes and their bare hands and fierce teeth while the vandals had leather armour lances bows and primitive crossbows and that last was an irony in itself for it had been the wamphyri who brought the first crossbows with them out of sunsidestarside in their world the crossbow had been a traveller weapon which the vampire lords had neither the skill nor the patience to duplicate or manufacture for themselves in this one as for the few entirely human szgany thralls they had brought through with them they had become scattered among the peoples of this new world aye and all their skills with them hence that the vandals had crossbows yet still radus pups slew three to one except there was always a fourth to come and pierced by lances feathered with redstreaming shafts one by one they went down and all their tribute stolen their women raped and butchered finally their very lives forfeit to the treachery of the vandals the sun rose on a hillside that seemed to smoke from all the blood and urine all the sweat and guts and foulness that had been spilled there four hundred and ten bodies reeking under the hot sun but radu and two of his lieutenants had survived seeing how all was lost theyd crept away through radus mist to find refuge in a deep dark crevice till nightfall and coiled like a snake in the cool dank of their hiding place and willing his leech to heal his several wounds radu had vowed a wamphyri vow where he sheltered not only against gaeseric and the vandals but against mankind in general for so far radu had been the most lenient of all the lords the most human of an inhuman lot but that was over now what treacherous the wamphyri hah for now it seemed to radu that those old starside lords had been the veriest beginners in the ways of the traitor and as for cruelty the lust of the vampire was that of a man increased tenfold by his parasite when he raped it was because he must his passions rages delights all of his emotions were larger than life or even undeath he could no more turn away from a shapely woman than a drunkard refuse a jack of wine or the furnace sun hold still in the sky he could no more resist blood than a fly avoid fresh dung or the tides resist the pull of the moon for the blood was the life but the men of this world romans and barbarians alike they fucked simply because it was there not because they were driven to it but because it was right of the conqueror to the victor the spoils and while the vampire as often as not created life or undeath the men of this world invariably destroyed it radu had seen how it was when gaeseric and his vandals stormed rome he had seen how inhuman were these humans and as for the civilized romans why in the eastern empire they would crucify a man for stealing a loaf of bread well radu was halfway between the two or so hed liked to fancy as much wolf as man yes but more wolf than vampire that was how hed seen himself greater than a mere man by virtue of his strength and awesome vampire powers yet superior to the wamphyri by virtue of the last lingering traces of his humanity a paradox but a fact oh really and again hah well so much for humanity and this was the final change the true change the last straw that turned a man to a pitiless monster but naive aye hed been that in sunside naive looking back he knew that hed always had the measure of the ferenczys and zirescus but hed been a mere youth and inexperienced and in his starside aerie naive to believe he stood the slightest chance against shaitan the unborn yet still hed gone against him finally in this world oh so naive the golden ingots hed thrown in a river believing them worthless while in fact men would kill for them the way hed made werewolves to run with him when he should have stayed a loner last but not least to have sold himself to a warlord and think hed actually be paid for his services and accepted as an equal what an equal radu lykan but he had the measure of all these socalled warriors their only advantage was that they were men and could live here as men ah but in the long term time was on radus side he could outlive them all if only they would let him and so with all such notions as honour trust and faith put aside forever a new strategy was needed from now on radu would honour neither man nor creature but only his own vows he would trust no necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley one not even his pups but continually assert his will and ensure that his word was law he would have faith only in himself and in the blood which is the life and above all he would be the most secretive and watchful of men so that no one could know him or come upon him unsuspected so perhaps old onarius ferengus had got it right and radu should find himself a position elevate himself and prepare bolthole dens and lairs along the way with caretakers to keep them in his absence then like nonari the gross ferenczy he would be able to venture forth in the world as before indulging himself as never before but always knowing there would be a refuge jn needful times or when the number of his years was such that he should retire a while or perhaps he misjudged nonari and that one had not gone into hiding since his murder as a roman senator but was out and about revelling in all the great reel and roil of things if so no doubt hed come to radus attention again when the time was ripe for him to rise up in other parts and who could say perhaps then the time would also be ripe for onarius to vanish forever likewise his eggson this belos pheropzis these were some of radus thoughts and some of the plans he made while hiding the day away in a hole in the ground came the night one of radus pups had died of too many cuts in his side which had leaked all his blood away he had gone uncomplainingly simply stiffening where he crouched the crevice would make as good a grave as any radu and the other survivor of gaeserics treachery had dropped stones on him from on high to block the crevice and keep away any lesser wolves and wild dogs from the body of their excolleague then away into the night under a moon that was still full heading north for the appenino heights that stretched the full length of italia for in a land overrun by vandals that would be the safest route out werewolves run swift the next night up in the mountains the pair met up with other survivors men of the pack that radu had sent north to spy on the alleged legion massing there they had their own story to tell of a vile ambush not twenty miles along the river north of rome which had left fortytwo of them dead only eight had been lucky theyd somehow managed to swim to safety across the river and left gaeserics lot bogged down in their armour with all their weaponry after that like radu the eight had made for the heights for theyd known that they were dupes so ten of them now ten of a hundred and fifty well and that must suffice for radu would make no more werewolves for a while he started a nervous twitch of his limbs that spent itself uselessly in his resin matrix not enough to wake him entirely but enough to make certain subconscious connections so that he dreamily wondered what but is there someone here someone coming what was it he thought he had heard footsteps but footsteps in this riddled rock which barring the furtive creep of spiders and flutter of bats had been so long silent perhaps a stone had rotted out of the high ceiling and the thunder of its fall had caused him to dream of a past age when he had piled boulders on the body of a dead colleague and secondary shocks had caused him to start yes that must be it yesss that must be it after rome radu had taken his much reduced party north to the danube then east through the forests and mountains and eventually down into the dacian territories that they knew so well this was lombard ostrogoth and hun territory now but south of the river the people were mainly christian radu himself had no religion except blood the superstitions and beliefs of local dacians made little or no difference to him except christianheld land made safer journeying than land under the control of the barbarians in any case it wasnt his intention to stay south of the river finally he headed north again for the mountains of what would much later become wallachia for he believed that in taking the high ground he would be secure a while from the bloody tides of war washing all around on the fertile plains below in this he was correct the mountains were mainly barren and inhospitable unattractive to invaders they contained little or nothing of value radu knew he could safely recruit the hardy locals for the building of a castle an aerie of his own in a place as high and inaccessible as he could find that would require funds of course but he had learned a valuable lesson that while wine and women can do a man a power of good gold can do him even more and on his way from rome to dacia he had not been remiss in accumulating monies there had been romans fleeing the barbarian slaughter of their land radu had slaughtered them for their wealth thered been parties of vandals scathing in the land around hed done some scathing of his own taking back what they had stolen finally on the danube there had been a last handful of roman merchants and traders radu had traded death for their blood and their gold and journeying through the nights and paying his way during the days in christian camps and villages hed listened to rumours and learned a new word which the local folk associated with the devil and every evil thing but this word was in fact a name one that had filtered through the high passes and from far across the mountains it was the name of a family or of a curse now and one that was by no means new to radu the drakuls brian lumley upon a time karl and egon had been radus allies against shaitan the unborn now they were his greatest threat in that they continued to scourge among the horseshoe of the high dacian mountains so bringing themselves into unnecessary prominence unlike radu who had developed a certain tolerance for weak sunlight until he could abide to venture out in a hooded cloak the drakuls were true children of the night sunlight would kill them instantly but theyd developed their metamorphism to such a degree that like shaitan the unborn they could shape themselves into bats to fly out in the night and so take their prey and theyd been doing it ever since moreover in starside they had been reared by wolves they knew wolves and in this world kept grey brothers as familiar creatures wolves of the wild kept watch for them by means of which the drakuls were secure in their aerie and feared no man for the moment it worked for them hence the rumours now finding their way to radu for the barbarian invaders who were settling the plains north of the mountains were no less superstitious than the locals they usurped and when their wives or children died mysteriously or vanished in the night then they knew who to blame the winged devil in his mountain retreat the obour or viesky the vampire the drakul the brothers had long since built a castle or castles in nomans land at least one of which aeries stood on a rocky promontory over a chasm this much radu learned and no more sufficient to determine him to avoid the error of bringing himself into prominence and he kept reminding himself anonymity and obscurity are synonymous with longevity the drakuls were true legends now when all the fighting was over and done with and dacia was united as a single tribe or country then the people would remember these monsters and go looking for them but even if the locals should forget be sure that radu lykan would not territorial the wamphyri aye and this place was where radu had come forth and anyway thered never been much love lost between him and karl and egon in the first place ever vengeful and smiling grimly if only to himself radu dreamed part four wamphyri ancient and modern i more of radus story bonnie jean she visits her master in those days if you would live the high mountains were most probably the safest place to do it and for the time being the werewolf radu lykan had had his fill of war in the last quarter of the year ad he and his small pack wintered down in what was to be their lair for the next sixty years the place was a great cavern in the mountains of western moldavia not far from a scrabbled together town or village more properly a makeshift encampment of refugees called krawlau by its one hundred and fifteen polyglot inhabitants as to why he chose this place radus reasons were several for one the heights were inhospitable and almost inaccessible to gradually establish oneself there would be one thing but for any wouldbe invader to launch an attack or even want to that seemed unlikely two being simply a hollow crag the redoubt would not invite attack in the manner of an aerie or castle and at its rear its lowest crevice exits opened on the shore of a broad bitterly cold lake in the event that he was attacked radu could easily slip away by boat to the far shore for while it was a time of relative quiet there would continue to be sporadic invasions from the east radus dreams were full of them three while a true aerie would be his first choice for a permanent dwelling place its construction would prove prohibitively expensive the cavern on the other hand required no actual or external building as such but only some interior works and what monies radu had amassed were better put aside against the vagaries of an uncertain future his precognition was by no means infallible four an entire workforce with which to make the crag habitable was immediately to hand in the shape of the folk of krawlau these former farmers driven into the mountains by war and the collapse of the eastern empires borders in the face of invading asiatics had no work like brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i radu they were simply wintering out the bad times in order to survive theyd become scavengers hunting the land and fishing the lake for food which was why when first radu found them they saw him as a godsend at first aye and when he was established then they saw him almost as a god oh it was in his bearing when he walked among them his penetrating gaze and lordly mode of speech his attire and generosity obviously with his dark wolfish good looks standing tall and lean as a tree and equally strong this was no ignorant guttural farmer born in the fields but a gentleman landowner a boyar removed from his own place by those same savage forces that had removed them and he had gold and the wit to fashion himself a fortress from a raw crag his money was of little value now not in these naked mountains where there was nothing to buy but it would be when the land was quiet again as for radus cavern when all of the work was finished and if the winters were hard then it would provide refuge for all of them this was his promise oh radu knew he shouldnt bring himself into prominence but up here in the heights that was in any case a nearimpossibility who was there to see him or his or know what they were about no one but these low persons in their sodroofed timber huts radu hired them by the dozen and chose men to watch over them while they turned the great cavern into a lair when a man joined him radu would state his wages and promise him a bonus if he should later decide to go his own way perhaps back down to his ruined fields to start again in that first winter when the snow lay deep a good many of them did just that approached radu and told him theyd left families in moldavia and would now return to see if they survived and if so provide for them out of the monies radu had paid them and the bonus he still owed them for his part he would always require one last days work of them before paying them their due wishing them well and seeing them on their way in the dusk of evening but in the dark of night he would send members of his pack loping after them to make certain no word of him and his works and none of his money found its way down out of the mountains and because new refugees were arriving day after day and others trying to leave there was a steady turnover of workers and no lack of provisions likewise there was no gradual trickling away of radus funds the keep took shape he would go among the workers directing them so that every stone was laid in accordance with his design massive timber lintels for the several doors that he left open and piled boulders in other holes that radu desired closed archways with keystones to bolster the dripstone ceilings where they were eaten with rot and stone staircases leading to ledges lesser caves or high window observation ports in the rough outer walls the levelling of various floors and laying of an uneven but serviceable paving of slate slabs and so to the fireplaces and ovens and the flues to channel smoke to the rear of the crag there to drift with the mists rising off the lake and while all such works were in progress to make the cavern liveable if not comfortable lord radu was not remiss in seeing to its defences outside between the natural spurs of the crag he built awesome deathtrap gantlets for wouldbe invaders on high he piled rocks behind logs stopped with chocks that were easily knocked away in the event of an invasion and at last radu saw that his lair was safe but in any case these were no puny castles walls to fall to the first assault of an enemys battering rams they were the walls of the mountain itself and as each external work was completed so radu would disguise it as living rock in imitation of its surrounding formations but inside in strategic places radu buttressed certain works of stone with good timber which would seem odd to some for obviously the wood could not outlast the stone but radu reasoned that when the time came for him to leave his mountain fastness then by lighting a handful of fires behind him he could easily topple it or at least reduce it to the original shell wamphyri and savagely territorial he could not bear the thought of another dwelling in a place that his hands had wrought but by the same token he also knew that if ever he desired to return then that he had the knowledge and skill to put the place back to rights radus pups worked side by side with the men of krawlau showing never a sign of their lupine natures except perhaps in their silence and the feral intelligence of their eyes the exfarmers saw nothing peculiar in it theyd seen wave after wave of slanteyes and of yelloweyes and skins too long before radu came on the scene he and his retainers were from foreign parts that was all plainly this rangy boyar in his fur boots and jacket with his long greytowhite hair falling on his collar and golden crescent moons in his fleshy ears was some rich expatriate certainly he was lord radu to his men and he was fair to a fault when his hunters went out and killed a pig in the night though where they were able to find such game up here in the mountains was a mystery then thered be meat off the bone for the common workers too be sure and lord radu laughing and joking with them as they sucked at the sweet smoking flesh radu recruited the strongest of them but by the light of a full moon and not as workers for while earlier hed determined to make brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i no more werewolves still he was on the lookout for men of quality the ones he chose from these exfarmers were hard as men come theyd make superb lieutenants when next he went out into the world so the doglord proceeded a long hard winter came and went and several more like it before finally wolfscrag was finished to radus satisfaction but only radu himself and those who were his knew what hed named it by then the men of krawlau were much reduced in numbers they worried about the fact that of all their fellows who had left radus employ not a one had been known to return to it they went down from the mountains to the steppes aye allegedly but they never came back not a one and this socalled lord in his lair of a cavern why his looks were more wolfish than ever and his men their looks too the way they loped like upright dogs as for the three or four exkrawlau men who had actually joined radu and dwelled with him now in his great cavern why they were visibly changed as quickly as that they had become indistinguishable from the rest of his retainers loping longhaired and wild their eyes were feral in the night and when they grinned their upper lips wrinkled back curling like the muzzles of snarling wolves thus legends that were already one hundred years old which had been almost but not quite forgotten were reborn and lived anew radu heard their whispers where the men of krawlau crept about like so many mice putting the final touches to his den well let them whisper he had other problems the sixth winter was on its way provisions were low and the doglord had no more use for clods such as these no not so there was one more use for them yes as to why theyd so suddenly become aware or at least suspicious of their danger radu had relaxed certain strictures on himself and his pups both until they went about more nearly as nature intended now it was plain to see that nature had not intended that these were by no means natural men yet in some respects they were all too natural for years now they had gone without good wine and womanflesh and all the other small comforts that men even men of war might easily grow accustomed to when they are not about their business radu was scarcely ignorant of his mens needs for he felt them too but now that he was set up earlier in the year aware that the huns had had the run of the moldavian steppe for decades and wondering if their supremacy was holding radu had dispatched scouts east to discover the state of things he had also sent men west through the high passes and all along the twin spurs of the horseshoe range and a spy into a handful of villages where they clung to the flanks of the mountains not too far removed from wolfscrag these latter places were small isolated selfsupporting townships but if radus longterm plan was of merit in time they might also support him now he waited for his scouts to return and report to him when the first snows came radu went down into krawlau personally to invite the last halfdozen of his former workers into the great cave for the winter they thanked him however cautiously and told him they would take advantage of his offer perhaps tomorrow radu sat by their fire a while long enough that they noted the red cores of his eyes and his talon hands which he made no effort to hide and when all grew silent he left but within the hour panting as they dragged their scant belongings behind them on makeshift sledges the ragged survivors of krawlau were off down the mountain trails except they were survivors no longer they got to the first pass where they found radu and the pack waiting for them which saw to the provisioning for the next week or so at least one by one as winter laid its white cloak on the land radus scouts returned utterly in thrall to their doglord they had given him away neither by word nor deed but they brought home to him various items of information and all manner of rumours information there were trappers at least four teams of them working along the river where it wound to lasi in the east these were good clean hardy folk theyd make for good recruiting or eating whichever theyd made their winter camps and because the moldavian steppe was still volatile they had brought their families and more especially their women with them there was a man with his two sons aye and a fine fat daughter too another couple had two grown girls who helped out with the skinning curing and what all oh and there were others eating good red meat and taking pelts for the trading radus informant had seen these people from the treeline over the river he had noted their locations discovered their rude lodges in the rocks but done nothing to alert them to his presence they were only a few miles away seven at a guess why he could lead a party back there this very night radu himself led the raiding party and at last there was womanflesh in the doglords cavern manse naturally he took first fruits of the women he had all of them that were worth having kept the one he considered best for himself the only one whod tried to have his eyes out at first anyway and gave the rest to his men theyd fight over them he knew that but it was only to be expected indeed radu brian lumley watched the roughandtumbling with great interest in order to discover the most worthy fighters these were his lieutenants after all another scout came in bringing more information he had gone into the mountain hamlets in the guise of a beggar and seen how they were ripe for conquest and destruction why the people were so soft he had no doubt they could even be herded like so many cattle isolationists pacifists they had cut themselves off completely from the outside world from all the surrounding wartorn regions of dacia and the great battlefields under the mountains radu couldnt really say he blamed them and in any case it wasnt conquest that was on his mind or perhaps a very subtle conquest no these people didnt need a conqueror but a saviour he would not kill them not yet but instead offer them his services as a mercenary warrior their voevod against who or whatever might brave these mountains and attack them a grand scheme and a safe one at that for indeed it seemed that the doglord had been right and the mountains were impregnable what but only thirty years earlier attila himself had had his headquarters at the foot of these very mountains but even he had skirted them to continue his assault on the west and since radu first commenced building wolf scrag here six years sped by and not a single invader had ventured into these heights or perhaps could it be that the threat from the east was finally over uneasy precognitive dreams told him no not yet but radus dreams werent always right or they were but rarely worked out the way he thought they would the future seemed a very devious thing and just how long was the future anyway finally all of radus scouts returned including the man hed sent down onto the steppes to see how things stood and now it was known for a fact the last of the huns had either retreated back into the east or settled the plains to the north for the time being locally at least the fighting was over wherefore it seemed a good time for expansion now radus wamphyri territorialism could come into play obviously these mountains belonged to no one they might be temporarily annexed now and then by this or that regime but no one held physical sway over them it could be said that they belonged to the dacians the ungars the romans whoever but who was there here to protect them no man except radu lykan and what is a mountain if not an aerie and these horseshoe mountains rearing like a buttress against the east inhospitable were they what like the colossal stacks of starside ah but theres inhospitable and theres inhospitable by comparison necroscope the lost years vol i these mountains were sheerest luxury and inaccessible aye to an invader but not to a man already in residence and radu was that man very well hamlet by hamlet village by village town by town these unconquered dacian mountains would come under his control at first hed be the voevod radu then a princeling finally a king of his own land this land it might take all of fifty years even longer but what was that to radu wamphyri he had hundreds of years behind him and an incalculable number ahead his original men those thralls and lieutenants who had come through the gate with him where were they gone down into the earth or gone up in smoke and reek on some battlefield thats where why even the longestlasting of them had been dead for twenty years but radu he looked a young thirty younger if it so pleased him anonymity bah to anonymity for now anyway but insularity ah yes he would protect the mountains and the mountains would protect him so be it rumours one of radus scouts had heard it that a ferenczy was in league with the vandals hah well good luck to him whoever he was be it nonari the gross if in fact he still lived or this son of his this belos pheropzis for if that bastard gaeseric dealt as badly with all of his mercenaries as hed dealt with radu well that was one ferenczy he neednt hunt down as for the drakuls they held fortress castles in the western reaches of dacia in the zarundului mountains and the northern carpathians perhaps they were enemies now certainly they had put space between them all the better when the time came for radu to deal with them he could take them out one at a time and because theyd brought themselves into prominence and were become legends viesky or vrykoulakas who descend like bats in the night to drink their victims blood or steal his wife and children it shouldnt prove too hard to recruit an army of locals to go against their castles oh radu looked forward to it but all in good time and meanwhile he had work to do radu had reckoned on fifty or more years to make himself lord or king of the horseshoe mountains it took all of that and would have taken more if ever hed been able to complete the job but fate history and ancient enmities intervened despite earlier vows he brought himself into prominence became less than anonymous set himself up as a target fifty years to spread out into all the mountain hamlets villages towns a halfcentury to become voevod of the horseshoe range in its eastern reaches anyway during a period in history when warlords or brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i princelings were the last thing it needed he had werewolf lieutenants in every town with dozens of thralls to back them up he knew every pass track route and shortcut through the eastern heights and could move his men with incredible speed from place to place of course he could for there was that of the wolf in all of them and indeed radu and the pack were fearsome warriors or would be but where was the war never up here and radu had been wrong too in his belief that the drakuls would be hated they were by those they wronged but they were worshipped by others indeed in a hundred and fifty years they had infiltrated corrupted and vampirized the populace of their own western mountain areas to such an extent that entire townships were now in thrall to them including all of the hamlets on the approaches to their aeries moreover the drakuls had recruited and turned loose many thralls to become their emissaries or servants abroad in the world these had become wanderers gypsies and travellers here no less than in starside in another world and the drakuls had engineered all of this a hundred years ago when the empire held sway over these dacian parts why men of the drakuls had even crossed the borders to become true citizens of rome sleepers as it were in the socalled civilized regions of a barbaric world romans aye or romani romany the source of yet another legend and so the drakuls had become almost invulnerable impervious to attack except perhaps in the drone of hot summer days when they slept in the deeps of their castles in native soil brought with them out of starside but radu knew none of that not then he knew where they were situated but not their situation how powerful theyd become he might have guessed something of it when well past the fifty years of his earlier reckoning he sent spies to map out the land in the heart of drakul territory and they never returned but radu had grown powerful in his own right until he believed that he was invulnerable and perhaps this had made him lax meanwhile in the outside world beyond the mountains beyond dacia beyond the danube history was passing him by the western empire had crumbled away entirely an ostrogothic kingdom had been established in italy only the eastern byzantine empire with its capital at constantinople survived intact he knew of these things for he was not without external intelligence perhaps he even pined a little for all the blood spilled on the reeking battlefields of the world and all gone to waste without that hed been part of it and gaeseric the vandal king dead and gone these fortyodd years and radus wamphyri vow of vengeance gone with him for hed not been a part of that either oh it was maddening which was when he realized how bored hed become well enough of all that and he promised himself that when finally he was established throughout the mountains and not just in the east then hed find time to venture forth and play the warrior again but now in order to bring that time forward also as an exercise in preparation for it now it was surely time for a grand expansion west against the drakuls except the drakuls moved first against him there had been warnings in retrospect looking back on the far past still dreaming his unquiet dreams in the semisolid matrix of his resin tomb radu knew it well enough that there had been unsettling occurrences in his many outposts strung out north and south along the legs of the horseshoe range in the northern carpathians the voevod radu held sway in villages as far removed as rakhov and in the south as far as turnu rosu where the hurtling waters of the oltul had long since carved a pass through the mountains on their way to the danube more than a hundred miles farther south but many miles inside these far boundaries deep in the wolfs heartland even there his outposts had had their problems and not hard to guess what sort of problems he prepared expeditions to lacobani in the north and ruckar in the south to see what could be done radu himself would lead the southern expedition it would consist of some forty of his men and one hundred more to be gathered along the way two of his bravest lieutenants true werewolves or pups would head north for lacobani and likewise collect a small army enroute these detachments of radus main mercenary force whose nucleus was still centred in wolfscrag and the hamlets around should suffice to sort out the problem which was this villagers and their wives and children in ruckar lacobani and neighbouring towns were being picked off by the viesky the drakul who fell upon his prey out of the night sky people mainly women but occasionally children had vanished without trace other victims had been found drained of their lifes blood mumbled prayers were said over them before they were put down into the ground but they would not stay down those of radus lieutenants who were permanently stationed in the plague towns knew well enough how to deal with these undead droppings of the drakuls the stake the sword and the fire but were at a loss as to what to do about the nightly attacks they were werewolves and ran on the ground while the drakuls were flying creatures who struck out of the sky and so it was seen how the drakuls methods were the very opposite of radus for despite that he was no longer anonymous still he kept the facts of his vampirism the fact that he was wamphyri and necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley especially the fact of his lycanthropy fairly well hidden whereas the drakuls scathed openly abroad as vampires and revelled in their power and where he used his military might and prowess to keep a tight rein on the peoples who came under his control and within his sphere of influence they used fear pure and simple also where radu recruited men only in such numbers as were sufficient to resupply or complement the pack and killed only strangers wanderers outsiders and beasts of the wild for the provisioning but never people under his protection or rarely when they were rebellious or openly suspicious of him the drakuls not only recruited their thralls in outrageous numbers but were using their vampirism to infiltrate the enemy camp and destroy opposition from within so that in a way their blunt methods were subtle after all first convert radus people and when his power base had been destroyed then attack him these had been the wolfs thoughts on the matter and in his minds eye hed seen the gradual eastward creep of the drakuls their eatingup of his towns and villages until at the last as leaders of two vast vampire hordes theyd join forces in a mass attack on wolfscrag itself and discover radu and the remnants of his pack trapped in the cavern manse then perhaps it was only the morbidity of radus old memories for in their subconscious minds even creatures who are grown evil and monstrous beyond words may be terrified anew by nightmares out of their past even the horrific may be horrified but suddenly he gave an involuntary shudder a tremor ran through him in the semisolid resin of his vat or was the tremor in the resin itself what a sound a reverberation however faint or furtive now surely the drakuls were upon him but no no for that was only an old dream out of the distant past while the sound had been here and now immediate and threatening and this time he could not be mistaken there was someone here or someone coming well of course someone was coming eventually a delicious someone who always came so perhaps that was it anticipation or wishful thinking imagination ah yesss but it was much too early she wouldnt be here yet awhile anticipation yesss but not yet awhile no not yet a while slowly radu relaxed into resurgent dreams allowing them to foam up again over his anxieties to drown them and however uncertainly however reluctantly having come that much closer to a true awakening this time his mind returned to its state of hibernation its contemplation of bygone centuries at that time in the mountains of moldavia radu had scarcely realized the urgency of his situation he had seen the gradual encroachment of the drakuls across the transylvanian mountains into moldavia as just that gradual but in fact their plan had been more immediate and their campaign not merely one of territorialism but also of destruction radus destruction and now partly it was the enmity which exists between all great vampires a hatred which had existed since the building of the first starside aeries which had been wrought in all the bloodwars of a parallel world and which would now continue in this world until the end of time or until no one was left to carry it on it was the knowledge in the dark heart of every lord of the wamphyri that if he would live he must do to others of his kind before they did to him but from the drakuls point of view it was also the need to clear the way for expansion for it seemed to them that they had proved a point that they could live as vampires here without hiding themselves away anonymity was no longer a requirement no longer synonymous with longevity but invincibility was they were not visionaries the drakuls no but planners certainly for the time being for now these soaring mountains were vast but in some future time would there be room for all the wamphyri yet to come those as yet unsired out of women or brought about by transfusion of vampire eggs or poisoned blood which of them were destined to inherit this earth these gaunt and gloomy mountains the egg and bloodsons of noble drakuls or the spawn of miserable dog lords and what of the ferenczys well for the moment the ferenczys were not part of the equation but radu lykan most definitely was radus expeditionary forces were ready he was on the point of sending them westward through the high passes when he heard a rumour but such a rumour that it at once rooted in his imagination and grew there until he couldnt ignore it then sending the lacobani contingent north he took his own party with him down into the steppe to bacau where this whisper had its origin and now the truth was learned how the emperor justinian had commissioned a fleet under the general belisarius to strike at the vandals even across the mediterranean in north africa and other parts and take back the western empire the vandals and radus old vow still unfulfilled and a ferenczy among the treacherous scum at that old gaeseric may have gone the way of all or most flesh but at least one ferenczy remained and even after all this time any surviving member of the ferenczy dynasty was far and away radus direst enemy spawn of those olden destroyers necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley of his dearest love in another world another time and all of it like yesterday to radu his blood was up at once he saw all kinds of possibilities join with the byzantines as a mercenary under belisarius distinguish himself in the field of battle eventually return to these desolate heights but as voevod of all dacia and all with the emperors approval and then see to the drakuls with an entire legion perhaps to back him up grand schemes except no it could never be for his plans were made and his mind set and in the west the drakuls were waiting even now also who could say how the byzantines would come out of this new venture what if they should lose indeed it would be to radus advantage if that were the case for he would rather protect his mountain territories against some future invasion by vandals than the reborn restructured might of rome and so torn two ways radu returned to wolfscrag in the heights or to what had been wolfscrag but now it might easily be a different place radu scarcely recognized it but he did recognize his error or something of it his dreams of warfare in these mountains not against invaders out of the east but the drakuls not against a horde of nomad warriors but a swarm of vampires under the grey cloud ceiling of early winter there had been no sun to fear they had flown by day attacked by night and but for the fact that hed gone down into the plain radu would have been part of it but from the sheer scale of the devastation he knew that even he could never have survived it the gantlets were undermined toppled inwards in several places the ceilings even the sides of the crag of the mountain peak itself had fallen in where black smoke roiled and the occasional tongue of flame still belched up from the fires within fifty years work gone up in smoke the scene was very nearly volcanic certainly it burned in radus heart the drakuls evidence of them and theirs was everywhere but they had not had it all their own way a halfdozen common thralls stood gaunt as sentinels in the early morning light like mindblasted yelloweyed totems on the slopes of ruined wolfscrag but a handful of grim grimy surviving lieutenants tumbled mangled vampire bodies down into the fiery vents the while inhaling gustily on the reek of their burning ah radus dream was real as life as death as undeath so that he sniffed too with his mind for his great wolfs nostrils were plugged with resin and for a moment he could even smell the roasting meat until he smelted something else smelled heard sensed something else a presence an intelligence and this time he simply could not be mistaken footsteps running a mouth gasping a heart pounding radus heart pounded too but just once a single great throb in his breast finally bringing him awake bonnie jean came to the place of her master she came panting with pictures of the vatcreatures slit of an alien eye still burning on the eye of her own mind and she came pondering the question of her own presence here it was hardly the first time shed so pondered and it wouldnt be the last but did it constitute uncertainty making her unworthy surely not surely it was part of the ritual not only to perpetuate him but her own faith in him for after all she was of rim however many times removed and the creature in the vat was that ohim too bonnie jean knew that it was and once more was set to wondering what sort of a future world would it be when he came up to elevate mankind into his kind what part could a thing or things such as the vatcreature play in the dark and deadly future world of her masters forevisioning his guardian creatures but against what in a world where the doglord was the ultimate power at the western extreme of the lair she recognized her location came to a halt controlled her breathing it would never do to approach him in this agitated state showing signs of her uncertainty but as she waxed more and more like him the more fearful she grew and that was a thought to give pause too what bonnie jean mirlu his from birth fearful and of him ridiculous it was this place playing on her nerves her mind it was the creature in its resin vat it was anxiety yes the advent of harry keogh and the watcher in edinburgh and recent events in general but most of all it was awareness of the fastapproaching time of her masters awakening when he would be up again a time of change when her ohsolong established way of life must of necessity change to accommodate his for at present he was only her master in absentia and she was the wee mistress but how much influence would bonnie jean retain when the master was back and if its true that when the cats away the mice will play how playful the cub when the wolf is not to house would her master have given thought to such or was it beneath him could he consider such things in his long sleep and why did she give thought to it had she been unfaithful if only in her mind in her thoughts bonnie jean didnt think so but in any case never seriously and never maliciously but then she would be wamphyri and they were ever prideful territorial and this had been her territory for close on two hundred years what brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i she couldnt go to him thinking these thoughts she hadnt intended to think them it was this place her mood the question of her own continuity when all that should concern her was his how would it be when he was up what would be allowed and what disallowed men oh shed known men over the years but that had been entirely compatible with her faithfulness to him indeed he had required that she know men so that she might be experienced in all things he wished no wilting virginal handmaiden sitting at his right hand in that dark future world of his visions but an experienced woman no naive blushing bumpkin but a scholar in all mans ways in his emotions as well as his sciences for the more a man or a woman or a changeling creature out of the myths and legends of the past knows his enemy the more easily he may dispose of him intelligence aye intelligence that was it to gather knowledge of the world around for his sake and surely to have intelligence was to be intelligent and to question things even such questions as bonnie jean had asked herself but they were not symptomatic of treachery never that intelligence a presence bonnie bonnie jean a grunt almost of pain finally of recognition but sounding in her mind and then bj reeled as if struck in the forehead as she knew that the words in her head were not hers but his she was the intelligence that presence he referred to for her master had sensed her here but how long had he been listening while she thought such thoughts she cleared her mind indeed her thoughts were driven out if only by her utter confusion and master i am here she gasped the words out concentrating only on him bonnie bonnie jeeeeean a grunt a snarl finally a sigh then a vast and terrible sniffing like that of a great hound the great hound as he tracked her essence through the shuddering vaults of her mind and echoing there but i had thought an intruuuuder she was in control of herself now no intruder no she shook her head then lifted her gaze up up taking in the outline of his great stone sarcophagus like an altar at the apex of a granite jumble the source of these his thoughts no intruder my master just me another rumbling sigh and his thoughts coming clearer to her as the mental connection strengthened as his concentration centered upon her ahhhh bonnie jeeeean but did i call you it seems too soon you did not call me my master bonnie jean had caught her breath now she was fully in command of the situation of her words and thoughts alike but i came in a hurry before my time if i have disturbed you then i am sorry but events were such eventsss yes she nodded climbing the crazilyangled jumble of the steps yes there have been occurrences a watcher in edinburgh some kind of spy perhaps and a mysterious stranger perhaps these things mean nothing i cant yet say but i thought it best that you should know but just as quickly as bonnie jean had regained command of her senses so radu had come fully awake and as she stepped up onto the platform of his sarcophagus so she felt the intensity of his thoughts his mental frown right through the stone slab walls of his coffin a spy in edinburgh and a mysterious stranger and yet you saw fit to come here what and would you place me in jeopardy bonnie jean never that my master she shrank back from his severity for am i not your guardian set to watch over you and i have watched most diligently i have served you faithfully why my blood is in you as yours is in me but now i need advice and who else can i go to first tell me about this watcher this spy could it be them do you think they seek me out i think it must be them yes she answered and she told him what harry keogh had told her it wasnt much but it worried him nevertheless when she was done but what if you were followed on your way here how do you know your precautions were sufficient at least one drakul survives so i believe for i have dreamed it aye and more than one ferenczy and here am i a weak shrivelled old thing like why like a fly in amber i am not ready to be up bonnie jean i cannot protect myself and you are only a girl at which she bridled a very little and knew that he would sense it as surely as if they were face to face then climbing onto the piled slabs towards one end of the sarcophagus she leaned over the rim to gaze down on him so that now they were face to face but his form was indistinct obscured by the resin where dust had settled on its crusted wrinkled surface she stared harder until slowly the thing in the resin took on an awesome outline his eyes were closed of course as they had been for all of the two hundred years shed known and served him but behind them as ever bonnie jean saw sensed but couldnt quite feel their heat oh but it was there subdued but not quenched the nickering heat of life or undeath suspended to the limit moreover it was as if something of the fire of those eyes had spilled out onto their sunken orbits to turn them and his hollow cheeks ruddy against the sickyellow pallor of his face in general her master despite that he was not all man was a veritable giant of brian lumley a man he must be almost seven feet tall and in his heyday fullfleshed he had been more physically powerful and more dangerous certainly than any intelligent creature the world had ever known hed had the speed and cunning of the wolf the intelligence of man the strength of the wamphyri and will again bonnie jean and will again he told her and in a moment very well i can see that i have offended you and i accept that you came here in all good faith and that you have taken all necessary measures to keep me safe and truth to tell i have been feeling weak which has made me impatient and less than agreeable is that so hard to understand i think not the years of waiting have been long and what am i become but a wraith of my former self and you are right your blood has kept me warm kept me alive so this time you are early perhaps it is as well for my spark flickers low bonnie jean but you shall rekindle it yet again at that last radus voice had fallen to a low guttural almost a lustful growl which bonnie jean had answered with an involuntary shudder of immeasurable horror or unthinkable pleasure she couldnt say for his meaning was clear enough that however will have to keep for now the thing in the resin quickly went on and his voice was normal again aye for we have other things to do to discuss problems have presented themselves but until i know their extent i cannot know how to counter them and there have been other problems which remain unresolved what about the girl a whole year bonnie jean is she still missing is there no news of her if not we must assume the worst that they took her wherefore they could be that much closer to you and to me but no bj shook her head and knew he would sense it she didnt know this place shed never been here nor did she know you my master but she knew of me and certainly she knew of you she was sworn to silence bj countered she was beguiled hypnotized she could not speak none of us can and myself least of au you vowrself have seen to that my master an enemy might contrive to steal me away though not without a fight but he could never make me talk huh but you do not know the wamphyri bonnie jean with them you must always assume the worst however let us put that aside for now and go on to this other thing you have told me about the watcher we will talk about him what to do about him again but you also made mention of a mysterious stranger what and have you let a man into your life bonnie jean into our lives ah and you seem to consider him important i can even feel your what excitement very well and now perhaps you will tell me about him yesss tell me all about your mysterious stranger necroscope the lost years vol i or better still show meeee and she did for long minutes the story flowed from her mind to his just as she remembered it and while it answered certain questions he hadnt yet asked such as the result of her quest for a bogus werewolf in london which she had undertaken on his behalf it prompted others which hed scarcely conceived ever to ask her and now radus excitement was as great as hers necroscope the lost years vol i ii bonniejean her duties the doglord his solution this man this harry keogh i have seen him with your eyes and know how he strikes me but how did he strike you bj didnt quite know how to answer as mysterious she finally said and tried to suppress her involuntary shrug as if he hid secrets where there couldnt possibly be secrets because he was beguiled he struck me as a man who has seen and experienced things no other man ever saw or experienced he was warm gentle human and yet he was cold hard and inhuman yet still you tell me that hes not one of them he is human my master she told him i would stake my life on it oh but you already have he answered with a low rumbling growl but as bj recognized the threat he quickly added all of our lives which served to relieve something of the onus he had seemed to place on her master she set out to convince him this man had me in his power however briefly but long enough to kill me certainly instead he kept me from trouble from harm he admits to skills that would be of great benefit to you he has worked for a covert agency she was finding difficulty in describing harrys duties and no wonder for she scarcely understood them herself he was above the laws of the land now as your agent he could prove invaluable as a fighter hes quick and strong and as a thinker deep i think if theres more to him than i have found i know you can find it where i have failed there was nothing more she could tell him after a while as to how he struck me forcefully bonnie jean he struck me powerfully and with more than any normal power why i felt it in your mind he was beguiled aye but he likewise beguiled you you were attracted to him as a man not so dont deny it for even though you wont admit it to yourself you cannot lie to me i have felt it your fascination for this this mysterious one aye but but bj sputtered because her master had seen what she had not or what she had refused to accept oh hahahaha radus laughter was a staccato barking that stabbed briefly harshly in her mind before coming to an abrupt halt and is that why hes still alive bonnie jean because you desired to feel him in your body his root burrowing in your soil seeking to seed itself in the garden of your sex is it so did you desire to fuck him bonnie jean or for him to fuck you my master i then you should have for there are more ways to enslave a man than by sharing your blood your essence better ways to enthrall him than by a bite other ways to seduce than by addiction to poisoned wines his voice fell to a whisper a whine a fetid panting and it seemed that he stripped her to the soul as he informed why your womans body would more than suffice to enslave a man any man or creature i am sure your soft breasts and thighs would enthrall enfold him and the suction of your sex would be a greater addiction a sweeter poison by far than any wine however strange and rare bonnie jean got down from the rim of his sarcophagus stood with her head bowed and stared at the buckled flags supporting his great coffin she felt shame for plainly her devotion had been to other than her master but it had taken him to identify emotions that she had rejected radu felt bj s confusion her dejection and said no bonnie jean you are not at fault youre a woman destined to be more than a woman and you have suppressed emotions that are instinct in you as they are in me in so doing youve also proved a point that you are not yet wamphyri for the wamphyri may not suppress their emotions if they could then were they unstoppable unbeatable aye and that is important to me bonnie jean that you are not yet of that high station for the condition of the great vampire is such as to make it well let us say undesirable at this time he fell silent but his meaning had not escaped her after a while if only to change the subject and divert his thoughts bj felt it prudent to prompt him master i am here early thats true but in any case it is close to the time of your renewal while you give thought to the things ive told you we should see to your replenishing also to the needs of your creature my warrior he was at once interested is the beast well does the great vat support him does he wax and quicken surely it is so for since he is of me he too must feel the time narrowing down he waxes my master he quickens in his vat yes brian lurnley necroscope the lost years vol i see to it then he told her tend the beast first while i lie here and think and consider oh a great many things but hurry bonnie jean for you have awakened me and my time is nigh and i hunger like a helpless child stirring in his crib but the faithful little mother is at hand to bare her breast bj went out onto the bald domed roof of radus redoubt and followed a southwesterly route that shed known for the better part of two centuries indeed to her keen eyes and senses there was now a clearly discernible track between scattered boulders across gaping fissures and through the treacherous scree jumbles of the high narrow passes her camouflaged denim suit was craggrey and lichengreen matching her surroundings over her left shoulder tied across her back she carried a rope also on the left two small grappling irons dangled from her wide leather belt a crossbow hung on her right thigh and was strappedjust above the knee so as not to swing with her movements these things plus a knife in a leather sheath were all that bonnie jean carried to her relief the sun was hidden behind bank upon bank of clouds sweeping in from the west across the monadhliath mountains and the spey it was midafternoon creeping towards evening the shadows of the crags beginning to creep too but that meant nothing to bj her eyes were feral as the wilds she traversed they saw the wildcats sporting in the heather before the cats saw her only the eagles circling on high had any great advantage but she wasnt interested in cats and eagles both were difficult and both dangerous until stone dead but on the penultimate falseplateau of a series of mighty terraces east of loch insh bj knew there were nearinaccessible woodlands and copses in the lee of the upper heights knew too that shed find deer there indeed a small herd of deer her kill would not be missed these were creatures of the wild she was the only one who had ever culled them and she required just one a faun not for sweetness but size it must be easily portable back to the lair she came to the rim the forestbelt sprawled a dark misted green all of seven hundred feet below and the chimney of a teetering stack was her route down at the top of the last stage of her descent bj used her rope to form a hoist and lowered the grapples and without further pause went hand over hand to the bottom her prey had long since sensed her and fled of course in this place there were no sounds extraneous to nature any sound that was strange was also dangerous so she tracked them through the woods and from then on never a snapped twig or the swishing recoil of a brushedaside branch to give her away until the last moment when the gut of her crossbow thrummed and the lethal bolt hissed unerringly to its target paralysed with its spine almost severed at a point one inch forward of the flanges of its shoulders the buck merely trembled as bj used the rope and grapples to hoist it by stages up the cliff the animal had voided itself in the woods and so didnt foul her then the fourmile trek back to the lair with the shuddering buck on her shoulders and bj hoping against hope that it wouldnt die along the way no for at the vat of radus beast she would require the engine of its pounding heart to beat to the very last at the lair she lowered the animal into the vent closest to the great vat followed it into darkness shortly she ascended the ramp to the rim of the vat and tossed the buck down onto the yellow semisolid surface then back down and around to the rear of the vat where a copper implement was stored in oiled wrappings it was a hollow tube three feet long threequarters of an inch in diameter with a trumpetlike funnel at one end the pointed end had been cut through diagonally like the tip of a hypodermic needle back up the ramp to the buck where bj moved the paralysed animal aside in order to drive the sharp end of the funnel down into the resin at which the obscure outline or silhouette of radus creature stirred visibly however sluggishly in the gelatinous soup of its vat womb for the fluids in the saclike core were not alone of resin and therefore less resistant she saw the sudden movement which caused her to start it was the first time in all bjs time that this had happened and it meant that her master was right his beast was indeed quickening then without further pause she worked the copper tubing down into the gummy resin a good twothirds of its length until the funnel stuck up like a pouting mouth and grimacing a little but with no other sign of reticence she cut the bucks throat and held its body steady on the rim watching its lifes blood spurting into the obscene bellmouth of the funnel from there to gurgle its way to the thing in the vat down there there might be a rudimentary mouth or mouths bj didnt know couldnt say she only knew that the living blood of the buck would be absorbed into her masters creature a quart of blood maybe so little for so much but enough and only a little less for radu despite that he had only onetenth of the vatthings bulk but then radu needed or demanded so much more and not deers blood in a while bj dragged the bucks body to one side and drew out the long funnel taking it to a place where water fell vertically from above and cascaded into conjectural depths below she washed the funnel out replaced it in its wrappings returned it to its niche behind the vat brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i then she cut out the raw fresh heart of the buck to take with her and toppled the stiffening carcass down the dark and unknown course of the waterfall and now it was time to attend radu the day had seemed very short it was the season and bj had had much to do outside the sun was setting the light fading her eyes readily adjusted to the gloom of the cavern complex as she returned to the sarcophagus kindled a fire of bonedry faggots from a pile of prepared wood boiled water on a tripod and brewed tea hungry herself now and succumbing at last to her own needs she ate the bucks heart raw with teeth that formed razor cusps even as they worked at the wild flesh jaws like a steel trap finished the job in short order not much by way of sustenance but the hearts dark muscle had been strong and bjs system would make best use of what little there had been she could have saved more of the buck but hadnt wanted to glut herself no for now she must stay alert and not give in to the inevitable drowsiness of her imminent depletion her depletion yes for her master would have it no other way how often had he told her the flesh and blood of ones own must always be the dearest as it is always the sweetest his meaning had never been entirely clear at best it sounded sinister but bj had taken it to mean that the blood of men and women human beings was the natural fare of the werewolf and apart from a handful of occasions when shed brought various thralls and recruits here this perhaps dubious duty had been hers alone fortified by her meal now it was time radus funnel was of soft beaten gold only its needle tip was of copper bj took it from its secret place carefully wiped it clean carried it up to the rim of his sarcophagus and gazed down on him master i am ready as am i bonniejean his answer rang at once in her mind as am i yesss and i have given thought to everything youve told me now as you attend me i shall tell you what must be done for time is narrowing down and my dreams scan ahead of me to strange new tomorrows nothing must be allowed to interfere with my my resurrection and everything must be done to enhance it for while i have seen to that point beyond it lies uttermost confusion the future of all men and creatures was ever a devious thing bonniejean and mine and yours no less but for you have seen a full and glorious moon a wondrous good omen yesss while for myself i shall be bright as a star and so our places in tomorrows firmament seem fixed which is the where and the when of it but as to the how of it that remains to be seen while he talked to her bj busied herself she pushed the feeder into the resin crust of radus sarcophagus and used her weight to drive it slowly but surely deeper into the semicongealed stuff within a gaugemark scratched into the golden tube coming level with the surface of the resin told her precisely where to stop any deeper and the sharp hollow knife point of the funnel would drive right into radus face about the watcher radu continued as she prepared a tourniquet on her left arm but left it slack if this is no innocent or coincidental thing then it can only be one of extreme menace and indeed i feel menaced this watcher is a thrall a ferenczy or a drakul aye he watches you to discover me and he will discover me if he can and lead his master here to my lairthrough you bonniejean through you and so there is only one answer to it dispose of him but not now not yet first learn all about him know him as you know yourself if that is at all possible so that he may not creep up on you unannounced then closer to the time but only when i give the word then see to him for if he were to suddenly disappear now immediately why his master would surely understand that he had found me and that i had found him and shortly thereafter there would be two watchers then three until in the end i would starve up here because you could not come to me or if and when you did my enemies would follow you and find me helpless here and be sure bonniejean that they would deal just as cruelly with you as with me for you are a woman and comely and they are wamphyri bj sat beside the rim of the sarcophagus with her back to an angled slab of stone but not too comfortably and without glancing away made one slicing cut through the arteries of her left wrist with the razorsharp blade of her knife indeed it was so sharp that she scarcely felt its bite or only very briefly and the cut was so clean that for a single moment it remained closed long enough for her to lean forward over the rim and direct the first sudden spurt into the golden funnel but radu had heard the hiss of air between her clenched teeth felt the sting in her mind sensed the tightening of her stomach and knew what these things meant and ahhhh he said as the hot red salty stream commenced to flow down the golden tube to his encysted figure then to cover the unmistakable lust that suddenly burned like fire in his thoughts and must surely burn its way into bonnie jeans he forced himself to continue with his instructions so then he barked we have dealt with this watcher or we will eventually but always remember bonniejean that revenge is a dish best served cold revenge oh yesss for i have seen in your mind how he has worried and angered you with his snooping and i know that you would be avenged even as i must avenge myself against his master one of mine own enemies out of ancient times but attend me well bonnie jean it can be nothing dramatic nothing spectacular when the time comes this watcher should simply yes disappear let his master wonder but never know that way by the time he must know the way of it and when brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i his curiosity brings him to seek me out i shall be up and about in the world time then for my revenge aye but only think bonnie jean if such as you have felt the urge to strike at our enemies and for what good reason eh the small irritation of covert observation the shuddering anticipation of some unknown unspecified doom waiting just around the comer then what of my passions whose torment has lasted for two thousand years huh well let me tell you there were bloodfeuds before mine and bloodwars since but the next one will be hot be sure as hot as every hell that men have ever dreamed then a pause so sudden so sharp it was almost a gasp in bj s mind as the first drop of her blood then a gush a crimson bloating bubble in the yellow envelope of fluid surrounding him stained and suffused the area of radus weird wolf head and ahhhh it was almost a sob of pain but an agony so sweet that it vibrated like some unbearable note struck on the chords of the mind and in bjs mind it was the rushing irretrievable cry of climactic sex the nervewrenching howl of a shovel in claycold ashes the joy of the full moon when its call can no longer be denied it was all of these things and more it was the blood that is the life her blood and radus life as the influx the monstrous infusion commenced and it was always the same as if her master were a live alien current which the conductor of her blood carried back to bonnie jean for once the connection was made the current came flowing back up the lifestream and into her it leaped to her quick as light with the speed of an electric arc the incredible terrible fact of him and as always if only for those first few unutterable unbearable seconds she knew the truth of him that there was no truth in him it came and it went and left her floating drifting on a sea of unknown emotions no less than his bite would have done for one brief moment the agony of truth and for the rest of time the inescapable acceptance of a great lie and before she could consider the difference or even the existence of a difference yesss ah yesss child of my children my life is in you as you were in me my life is you as yours will be mine but not yet awhile not yet and as something of his unthinkable pleasure receded and he accepted the renewal of his hideous life as for the girl gone for a year and never to return we must accept that she is no more at best she has become one of theirs a drakul or a ferenczy aye more likely shes a husk drained of knowledge and life both let us assume that you are right and she could not talk still she told enough to interest them hence the watcher or has he been there a long time bonnie jean longer than you suspect even years decades the latter i think if not then how did they know to take one of yours in the first place what came first the egg the spore or the leech it is a riddle it moves in a circle and is best left alone likewise the girl forget her she is no more bj listened with the one part of her mind that remained alert as for the rest her eyes were closing her head nodding until she struggled to keep it upright drowsing she was carried on the current of radus life and was nothing without that she belonged to him it was his art his hypnotism the beguiling she had it too but by comparison was an infant where he was the old old master but a master of more than mere hypnotism and bjs heart thudded her blood pumped and her mind listened finally we have this this mysterious one of whom you admit to wondering perhaps the mysterious one yesss bonnie jean and you have set me to wondering too for i have seen him in my dreams these many ages and the one whom you have shown to me is not dissimilar but in my dreams strange but i never saw him clearly while i was given to know of him i was never permitted to know him he was blurred aye or at best illdefined as all dreams of the future are only more so and so i came to think of him as the man with two faces because while he remained the same his face changed not that he was twofaced as in the common usage of that term you understand no for this has nothing to do with simple treachery so what does it mean for i have read it in your mind that you too bonnie jean have seen another side of him as if some other were looking out through his eyes but could that other be me in some future time if so then indeed he is the mysterious one of my dreams or is it all a trick a trap a clever subterfuge radus mental voice was suddenly sharp as bjs knife he helped you when he could have killed you you say but i remember how in the greek sea the fishermen would bait their hooks with little fishes to catch big ones and this covert agency he worked for whose agency ask the powers that be you say for what good purpose i ask to which you answer to usurp the laws of the land and supplement them where they will not suffice eh usurp the laws i am astonished for this agency must be powerful indeed that it works outside of governments and laws very well then who were this mysterious ones masters alas here we have no answer for this was a line you did not pursue ah but be sure that i will radu paused probed a moment with his vampire mind and immediately worriedly inquired is all well bonnie jean do you hear me best attend me for my needs shall go on beyond today and i would that you go on with them bj jerked awake she had been awake the part of her that listened at least and she saw that the funnel was overflowing into the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i sarcophagus where her blood pooled on the crusty resin like the gaugemarks on the stem of radus funnel this was her warning telling her this far but no further it was not the first time that this had happened nor that her master had saved her life but then what would become of him without her she tightened the tourniquet on her arm watched the spurting slow to a sporadic spatter willed her metamorphic flesh to action heal me then as she got stiffly down from the sarcophagus a last twist on the tourniquet which she taped in position and finally the slow awkward business of bandaging her wrist with dressings from her pack while she worked radu talked to her how many times had i expired without you bonnie jean how often haw i escaped the true death but the sweet hot spark of your lifes blood rekindles mine and i live anew if such as this may be considered life a creature of moods now her master was sour again and bj knew why it was always the same when his needs had been satisfied or his immediate needs at least ah you read me well he told her for i would be up again and abroad in the world of men i would be up even now except pestilence put me down and so i stay here waiting out my time and i keep myself quiet lest my thoughts go out into the world and others hear them and i dream my red dreams and keep them quiet too for the same good reason and my bones stiffen and my flesh sags and even my memory fades a little for time is a long long thing so that sometimes i wonder at the purpose of it all until you return to me and then i know the purpose of it all for once i was as men and lived with men i fought side by side with men as were they my equal i tried to be the same as men but was different i reined back on my spirit which is a roaring fire that devours and i quenched it as best possible but i was wrong to try bonnie jean aye for to be wamphyri is to be other than men more than men oh i have a mans appetites be sure indeed i have them tenfold i do not love but lust which is better than love for when love lies spent lust drives on and the strength of a man why in these hands of mine strong men have snapped like twigs as for the span of a man what mere man has survived for thirty lifespans and as for a mans passions who before me has hated for twenty long centuries and will continue to hate so long as his enemies survive even to the end of time and my thirst my thirssst ahhh do you recall how it is when the day is hot and the way is long and there is no water and then the sparkle of a stream your hand trembling as you lift the water to your lips well i have thirsted for six hundred years bonnie jean ah no i am not ungrateful and you have sustained me but a quart sometimes i think i know the source of these measures for is not a quart one fourth part of all your blood close enough i think but a quart why i have bathed in blood the blood of whole men and women and babes and still wanted more men with their puny needs they are as ticks on the back of a goat but i am a wolf and the field is filled with goats except i am crippled trapped immobilized why i lie so still they dont even suspect im here at all only the other wolves know only my own sort aye he rambles bj thought unmindful of her own thoughts as she rekindled her fire with which to warm a can of soup he is delirious on my blood like a man who has drunk too much strong liquor these are only his frustrations coming out of him and nothing more this is not the way he will be what her master at once shouted or snarled in her mind and is it for you to say how i will or will not be forgive me bj answered wearily from where she sat by her fire i i think i must be delirious too for it seems youve had more than a quart my master and i have rarely felt so tired he was at once solicitous ahhh bonnie jean bonnie jean it is my fault my fault but hungered so i let it go too long too long no harm done she sighed i have auld johns soup his strong tea ill stay here the night and rest aye he answered aye the way down is hard and you must be strong for it the way is nothing bj shook her head the climb is childs play but in the dark i could slip and the way i feel right now best rest he told her best rest but in a little while spooning soup as she huddled beside her fire in a blanket bj was curious to know something my master how would it have been what would be the result if you had not roused me up not death i know not the true death indeed no my bonnie he answered so low it was a coughing rumble in her mind never the true death not for you for you undeath but with you quite unnecessary you are what you are a throwback no a throw forward that is the way of it blood tells bonnie jean and in you it runs true i would be wamphyri will be perhaps perhaps her master at once came alive again and the darkness receded time will tell my faithful one he said aye time alone will tell bj gave herself a shake as the doglord abruptly enquired where where was i for it appears you were right and i rambled certainly my mind has wandered brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i it was as if he too had been asleep his thoughts were dull uncertain groping in her mind the lair was so much darker now bj s fire burned low a sappy branch crackled and popped and sent a few last sparks flying through the rocky tangle of the high crystalline vaulting a lone star glittered like an eye frozen in a stony orbit the mysterious one bj reminded her master have you reached a solution remember radus tone was more focused now but you are mistaken i had already reached a solution but i had not voiced it i must see him talk to him with my own voice have him here where i can decide for myself his value or his threat but not yet not yet a while so my solution he has things to do you say then let him do them for a year even two years he would search for his missing wife and child good let him search ah but he is resourceful he has talents excellent let us put them to use we are agreed that my enemies seek me out very well let this mysterious harry keogh seek them out let him locate them for us then when or if they do not see fit to come to me i can always go to them so how is that for a solution and if he draws attention to you what then huh but their attention has never been absent they have sought me for long and long and as always i shall rely upon you to hold them at bay and if he places himself in jeopardy maybe gets himself killed what is that to us or should i say to me for plainly it is a great deal to you but i take your point you are asking why sacrifice a valuable ally is that it well for one his value is not yet proven this could be the ultimate test and for two if he is indeed my man with two faces the mysterious one of my dreams then hell suffer no harm how can he and still come to me at the time of my coming forth but before he can seek them out the drakuls and the ferenczys he must know of them and you have always forbidden me to speak of them as you lie secret in the world my master so must they else alert men to the presence of us all a good argument but a false one do you think i would let someone loose in the world with that sort of knowledge without that we place certain strictures upon him of course not you have told me he is in thrall true beguiled she nodded and by now addicted to your wine he knows nothing at all of you nothing of me except that i am an innocent a friend and possibly a lover bjs silence answered for her all to the good for i tell you bonniejean that if he is not your lover or does not at least aspire then he is not a man by my books which means he is not my man and if he does aspire what and should i send you out to whore for me oh hahaha and now you would tell me you have no mind of your own and that you are guided in all things by me huh and you know how i cannot abide a liar you youre playing with me she stuttered this this has to be a word game it must be indeed radu growled and if you cannot win them then do not play them certainly not with me bj waited tried not to tremble and eventually he said very well and did i not hint and more than hint that you should use your womans ways your female wiles on him better ways than poisoned wine other ways to enthrall a man aye but use them on him bonnie jean not on me yes my master she bowed her head see to it then and when next you come make report yes my master she curled herself up and bonnie jean do without the wine if you have weaned him on it now wean him off doubtless it served its purpose but an end to that now i want a man not a sot and finally in the event that you do seduce him or he seduces you whichever one last thing be sure absolutely sure that nothing of you of us gets into him above all else be sure of that for when he comes to me he must be human all of him i understand so be it and now sleep well my bonnie and you my my my master his final words had been a command and she was his thrall already bj was yawning her eyes closing and as he felt her slipping away and knew that she would not hear him aye sleep well bonniejean for if i was up or when i am upthere shall be no sleep for you but a night such as you never imagined indeed a night to die for one of us anyway in the grey dawn bj woke up changed her dressing saw that the scar was knitting and no fresh blood flowing there was a cold cut of cooked venison in her pack courtesy of auld john washed down with strong tea it served as breakfast then she saw to the cleaning of radus feeder and stored it away she should have attended to it last night but had been too weary and finally she took her departure as she left the lair the psychic aether was empty of her masters emanations he continued to sleep his sleep of ages coming up her spirits had been high she had revelled in the climb necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley going down she took the easiest route her mood was different and she must think things over about her masters instructions of course oh yes for she was still too close to him to think other things confused disorientated in all manner of ways finally she did little thinking at all but concentrated mainly on her climbing she was not naive bonnie jean with so many years behind her how could she be but she was enthralled beguiled radu held her in his spell no less than she held harry keogh and as his thrall she must always obey him but as a lady of the wamphyri except that was a thought she must never think and so she didnt until midday back at auld johns place when he noticed a spot of blood on her dressing and changed it for her then he had cause to remind her why bonnie jean he exclaimed its no more than a wee scratch ye must have stretched it a bit thats all but i never saw healing like it surely ye couldnae hae gone so deep this time deep as ever john she told him and in the next breath but we all heal quickly its part of us part of you too aye but never like this for a moment in awe of her he stepped back and gaped and then eagerly but he did promise ye after all and weve always known that sooner or later later john later she hissed suddenly angry but with herself as much as with him when hes up when he says so and not before so dont you say it nor even think it no no he blinked rapidly licked his lips peered at her yere right of course ye are but no buts john she cautioned him there can be no buts i told you dont even think it because i darent think it but later in his tiny bathroom after she had bathed and when she applied a minimum of makeup bj paused then stood stock still in front of the small mirror mirrors hadnt much bothered her before they had never been a problem but now for the first time was there something wrong or not wrong but different she stared harder at her own image the grey in her hair not a premature grey but the natural colour of wolfish fur it wasnt fur but hair but the colour was all wolf much more so than before and her eyes their slant the golden rim of their cores and her ears elfish before but now longer and when she put up a hand with a square of tissue to dab pale lipstick from the tip of an eyetooth surely her teeth were longer too and behind her teeth bj held her breath bared her teeth all the way then flicked her tongue over them or flickered it like a snakes tongue her cleft tongue not all the way not yet but indented at the tip beyond a doubt and suddenly her blood was singing in her veins singing a strange savage song but one that she must not dare not sing she remembered how easily she had changed for harry keogh and how she had known she could do it oh she had known before him but always at the time of the full moon now apparently she could do it any time it was simply a matter of will and standing there before the mirror she willed the grey from her hair willed her tongue to its human shape willed her eyes and her ears back to normal and they were normal well yes for a normal human being anyway that afternoon she slept she didnt need it but made herself sleep that way she was out of auld johns way he couldnt ask her things and she wasnt tempted to think or experiment as night fell she set out with john as backup in a battered old car hed owned for years doing the same job her girl had done two nights past through pitlochry she saw his headlights blink twice and his car quickly faded in her rearview then she was on her own on her way home and no time to spare because bj had given the mysterious one harry keogh specific posthypnotic instructions to call her early tomorrow morning before the threeweek stricture shed placed on his departure was up she had supposed that by that time she would know better what to do about harry which she did courtesy of the doglord radu now she had other more important orders to pass on and she must speak to keogh before he commenced his search abroad which from now on would be that much more important and so much more dangerous but she darent miss his call in case this close to the full of the moon harry took this to be his obligatory call in which case it could be the last opportunity she would have to speak to him for more than a month until the next full moon full moon aye in just a few days time bj could even feel it tugging at her mind but these sudden complications in what were once longestablished uninterrupted routines harry keogh and radus what churlishness his impatience anyway the changes taking place within herself of which she was ever more aware and the unknown watcher this drakul or ferenczy thrall and all of it weighing on bj s shoulders upon a time no problem she could have dealt with all of this and much more she had dealt with many problems down the decades but her system thought processes mutating emotions were badly out of kilter and even if radu hadnt detected it even though he might deny it still bj knew what was happening to her but she too must deny it or deny him and after all this time that last was unthinkable brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i she wasnt giving her best concentration to the road her driving her hands were too loose or occasionally too vicious on the wheel her speed was too great for the bends and uneven camber when the front offside tyre blew it was as much as she could do to hit the brakes before the car skidded off the road smashed through a fence nosedived down a grassy decline and slammed to a halt in the pebbles of a sluggish beck on impact bjs head snapped forward banged down hard on the centre of the steering column and for quite some time that was all so maybe radu was right after all for would a little knock like that have put a true lady of the wamphyri to sleep even as bj realized that the thought was her own she felt a hand fumbling on her shoulder through the shattered mess of the drivers window and as the hand went round her neck seeking her pulse she wrenched herself free and snarled what and then in a more reasonable even a pained voice feeling the aching in her neck and head and turning the latter to squint into the early morning light wwhat it had to be six or sixthirty in the morning she must have been out for hours a policeman stood beside the car ankledeep in the cold water of the beck his face was full of concern dinna try to move miss he told her were calling help right now yell be out o there in no time he was right and sooner than he thought im okay bj said unfastening her seatbelt and wrenching at the handle of the door which at once sprang open im all right just a bit shaken thats all there were two of them the second one leaving his vehicle to come scrambling down the bank they assisted her back up to the road and into their police car how long were ye there we wouldnae hae known if not for the broken fence well take ye into town for a checkup the driver glanced back at her that bruise of yours is just a bruise she told him then smiled look the last thing i need is a checkup im fine as for my car a tyre burst but if you really want to be helpful you can take me on to perth where i can get a taxi ive an important appointment in edinburgh and im late already they looked at each other bj dug in a pocket produced documentation details of the car she said insurance documents for your notebooks i hired the car you could do me a favour and let them know its their junk after all their problem to recover it my name and address are on the agreement there if you should need to contact me later one of the officers scratched his head yere an awfy cool lassy for someone just out o an accident accidents happen bj snapped then bit her lip look i really am in a hurry im sorry if i appear ungrateful too late her attitude had been all wrong and sorry wasnt going to put it right in the police station in perth they recorded her statement and had a doctor look at her anyway if only to cover themselves which meant it was after ten before she could call a taxi and get under way again necroscope the lost years vol i ill a picture of the mind a photograph of the future in case her place was under observation bonnie jean rode the taxi to within a quarter mile of bj s paid her fare then walked or was blown the rest of the way it was a little after midday raining and blowing a gale buffeted along the slippery pavements she thought the windy fucking city indeed furious by the time she arrived at the bar mainly with herself but also with the way things were or were not working out she had to call one of her girls down from her bedroom from where she was supposed to be watching the street outside to let her in didnt you see me arrive i i was using your toilet the girl told her two other girls who were in the vicinity and witnessed bj s arrival reported to her in the bar as she was towelling her hair and trying to dry out any luck she glared at them what of the watcher has he been back and harry keogh have you found him but seeing the negative look on their faces lets get this place tidied up sorted out we open tonight if we stay closed any longer it will only attract attention ill make adjustments to your duties as soon as i get the chance and finally as she made to head upstairs any calls a few the girl from her bedroom told her theyre on your answering machine i didnt monitor them you didnt tell me to bj rushed through the bar and up the stairs to her bedroom there were three calls from regulars wanting to know when the bar would be open again and two more from someone or ones who said nothing but the next and last was from harry bj i said i would call you before i went off so im calling tried to get you twice already nothing doing too early i suppose sorry about that so ill be away maybe a month im not sure about a month yes i dont know why im bothering you really thats it then but after a long pause oh and by the way that greek wine of yours is good stuff well lets say its an acquired taste eh but a damn good way to get to sleep nights when your mind just cant stop ticking over know what i mean no i dont suppose you do til be in touch and again a long silence before the phone went dead and damn bj said under her breath expelling all of her air in a heavy sigh before taking her first deep breath for what seemed like the first time that day she breathed in and held it now what in all aftershave old spice harrys aftershave it must be but lingering on all this time since hed been here except he hadnt been here not up here not in her bedroom or was it just his voice that had set it off but damn it all she could smell him him and not just his aftershave he was that real that vivid tantalizing in her mind and in her room bjs eyes were suddenly feral in the gloomy quiet of her room with the curtains drawn and the rain pattering on the window panes her nostrils gaped she turned her head sharply this way and that she sniffed as she tracked the essence of a man his scent his odour but here in her bedroom where he had never been oh really she flew down one flight to her livingroom nothing his scent wasnt here or if it was it was just the merest trace he may have been here but he hadnt lingered here hed gone up to her bedroom she bounded back up the stairs and there it was again like a familiar perfume hanging on the air his scent and the sweet human smell of her girl hers and his bj called for her screamed for her down the stairwell moreen come up here come now she came looking confused frightened astonished bj took her by the shoulders and shook her he was here he was here with you he what who moreen was a stunning redhead twentytwo or twentythree years old her green eyes were wide amazed disbelieving finally she broke free bj no one was here not while i was here anyway and she shrank away from the other especially from her looks you look like like a wild thing and bj knew that she did that she was but at least it was controllable she pulled herself together willed the thing hiding within her to subservience then slumped on her bed he was here she said necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley mainly to herself maybe not with you if you say so but here certainly the watcher moreen was genuinely mystified you think i would invite bj shook her head not the watcher no damn we dont even know if the watcher exists not for sure im just taking harry keoghs word for it hes the one im talking about him harry keogh himself who tossed big jimmy about like a sack of coal that night the one were looking for bj bared her teeth i can smell him right here then youre mistaken the girl tossed her head almost defiantly and sat down beside the bed on a chair bj sat up took hold of moreens shoulders again more gently this time look this is important were you here all the time why no of course not how could i be the other said and gave a defensive shrug i mean i had to eat sleep attend to various other things but when it was important to be here then i was here when it was important when exactly i sat at that window the girl pointed oh until two or halfpast two each morning just watching the road outside and you have no idea how boring that can get to be bj but i did it anyway for you and then you slept where and how long wrapped in a spare blanket in the barroom beside one of the big radiators downstairs youre sure yes and if someone had got in but thats why i slept down there moreen was close to tears any burglar or intruder would have had to get past me im usually a light sleeper and would hear him but i was up each morning by sixthirty so as to come up here and check if anyone was watching us in the early mornings this morning especially bj was quick to catch that one why what was so special about this morning there were two calls i heard the phone ring before your answer machine took over i seem to remember checking the time the first call was oh about fivethirty i think and the second maybe fifteen minutes later that one woke me up more yet i tossed and turned a bit then must have dozed for a few minutes but about six oclock i thought i heard something what did you hear bj tightened her grip i heard the boards creak somewhere up here but it was windy and raining it was just the old house protesting bj thought about it harry could have called from any telephone a telephone box in the street even hed called twice got no answer given up and come here personally but how had he got in past moreen and more importantly what did he want suddenly the answer was clear in her mind as clear as his voice on her answering machine go down and help the others she said standing up i im sorry i was so excited sorry i shouted things could be working out better thats all you understand the girl looked worried now bj are we in trouble not if i can help it she shook her head do as i say and dont worry about it but as soon as the girl was gone she turned to her bed stooped and reached underneath and drew out a threebyfour cardboard wine crate there were three bottles of her greek wine sitting neatly in their sockets in the last row three yes but bj knew there should be four oh shed weaned him on all right this ohsotalented harry keogh this mysterious mr keogh and the longer she knew him the more talented and mysterious he got to be it wasnt quite a month before harry was back in fact it was twentyfive days and bj neednt have worried about weaning him off her wine radus wine actually for harry had been doing that or trying to do it for himself and fairly successfully a single shot on a night before sleeping was all hed allowed himself and hed tried tempering the stuff with other brews jack daniels old no had been one such a topquality liquor whose potency should leave any mere wine standing at the post but that stuff of bjs was definitely oh something else it was very much to harrys taste or alec kyles taste whichever its only drawback was what it did to him his stinging eyes dry throat fluffy head all the symptoms of a heavy cold for which it seemed to be the only cure there was a word for it addiction which harry realized well enough it was why he would only take it on a night and then only one small shot even so it interfered with his search except as he had come to realize by the end of his three weeks and four days in seattle washington usa his search was a joke and a joke that he was playing on himself of course with the mobius continuum at his fingertips his to command he hadnt needed to stay in seattle he could come and go as he wished spend every night at home in bonnyrig if he so desired but he hadnt desired truth to tell the old house where his beloved ma had died and his murdering blackhearted bastard of a stepfather viktor shukshin had continued to live until his past and harry had caught up with him at least was a cheerless sort of place ominous and full of evil memories necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley it would be a long time if ever before the necroscope could think of it as home in the truest sense of the word which was why hed hired a socalled houseboat down on the waterfront in seattle paying a months rent in advance for far less comfort and only half the space hed been used to even in his and brendas tiny garret flat in hartlepool in the in the old days but the flat had worse memories than the house in bonnyrig which was one of the reasons he had got rid of it hed thought about taking a hotel room or a suite why not he could easily stay at the citys finest if he fancied and just as easily skip out without paying the bill when it was time to mobius on except hotels werent him but the old days funny that it seemed so long ago funny yes for a man whose incorporeal metaphysical mind had once had access to all of the past and all of the future and as much of space as he or any man could live in or explore even in an eternity of lifetimes and the funniest thing of all or the most ironic was that he still had it but couldnt use it not to its or his best advantage not until hed found brenda and the baby the past that was over and done there was nothing there to help him now even if he had access to it which he didnt and that too was funny incorporeal hed been able to immaterialize in the past but now if he went there hed be like a toy man on a toy train that went in a circle or figure ofeight loop and never stopped with all the stations passing him by but never able to get off and as for space which in this case meant the total of all the places the geographic locations in the world well he had access to those certainly but there were millions of them and brenda and the baby were only in one of them which one was anybodys guess the great majority couldnt help him because they had no contact with the living except harry himself and the living of all living people the ebranch specialists darcy clarkes espers should have been able to tell him something yet theyd told him nothing and he believed them they simply didnt know so where did that leave harry what chance did he stand a very slim one at best yet there hed been in seattle washington usa allegedly searching for two people who were or should be very dear to him and he wasnt even sure about that last part either love brenda but she didnt love him didnt even know the him he was now and love the baby what little harry who knew more than he did about everything that made him what he was and yet harry must search if only to find out why theyd left him no not even that for he knew why because he wasnt him and because the things hed done and others he might yet do were dangerous the baby loved his ma that was all just as harry loved his ma except this baby wasnt about to let anything happen to brenda and so back to that word search big joke in england it had seemed to make sense close to brendas source she had felt more real shed seemed feasible here she seemed impossible so what it boiled down to was harry wandering about in a strange body in a strange city in a strange land praying hed somehow collide with someone who was trying her best to avoid him and she had a million other places in which to do it and things were mainly a blur anyway because he felt like hell maybe if he hadnt run out of bj s wine he would have stayed on even longer doing nothing much but it was starting to look like the wine wasnt the only thing that had him under its spell b j herself kept coming back to mind some beguiling thing about her some promise hed made or shed made or maybe some unspoken promise that he wished theyd made harry wasnt too pleased with himself that he had stolen bj s wine but whatever else he did he knew that he wouldnt have to steal any more with any luck it was out of his system now and truth to tell his problem his or alec kyles alcoholism had narrowed itself down become specific for it was now an established fact that the necroscope couldnt or didnt want to drink any other kind of liquor what was the point when it had little or no effect on him except in massive doses so maybe that was why hed come home at this time to be closer to bj and to her wine heu of a note and what the hell kind of alcoholism was this anyway was it possible for a smoker to be addicted to just one brand what if they stopped making it after hed finished his last pack of brand x what then hed never smoke again the necroscope had never heard of anything like it and neither had his ma have it analysed she told him see whats in it maybe it has an antidote harry was sitting on the river bank where he had materialized his first port of call upon his return it had been just after six a m in seattle when hed woken up lifted his head and looked at an empty bottle sitting there on a shelf at the side of his bookcase headboard an empty bottle and an empty glass and his first thought had been that he had used up the wine and thered be none for tonight that had been some twenty minutes a wash shave and a good stiff toothbrushing while he was still brave enough to put something in his mouth ago plus a minute or two to get dressed while here in scotland it was midafternoon a decently warm spring day the sun shining birds singing and all and harry feeling rotten mobiuslagged he grumbled and at once bit his tongue he shouldnt be talking about that stuff to anyone or even thinking about it where the dead were concerned even his ma hed have to learn to guard his thoughts about about that sort of thing brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i nonsense his ma answered but she was talking about his comment not about his regretting it youre not any kind of lagged youre hung over thats all he was glad to change the subject yes probably except it doesnt go away so do as i tell you and anyway if thats the end of it its the end of it thank goodness for that but i know where theres more and again he could have bitten his tongue for she was on him like a ton of bricks leave it alone harry thats all i can do advise you you have a mind and therefore you have a choke be an alcoholic or dont be its one or the other to be or not to be its up to you no one can order you not to drink but by the same token no one can make you drink but in the back of the necroscopes head a voice seemed to say oh really harry didnt know what it meant and so ignored it anyway he said out loud credit where credits due im fighting it its just this last wrinkle in my or alec kyles grey matter it needs ironing out thats all its something thats residual of him like his precognition but i can feel it adjusting to fit me i think and if i dont use it dont pander to it it will i dont know atrophy its just a matter of time im sure his precognition she repeated him as glad as he was to change the subject have you been having more visions then no harry shook his head and at once reeled and grabbed at the root of a tree to keep from toppling from the bank for his mas question had seemed to bring something on a scene obscured by what appeared to be mental static until the necroscope realized that he was seeing it through a blizzard a frozen monochrome landscape like the roof of the world and a gaunt range of mountains marching against grey skies that went on forever it was cold a biting cold that was so real harry could even feel it gnawing at him and the snow slanting down like a million white spears piercing his warmth as they landed and formed an everthickening layer on his being his mind his psyche it was gone leaving him shivering and reeling while his mas dead voice cried in his mind harry what on earth but what she should have been asking was where where on earth for harry had seen nothing like it hed never been in or imagined being in such a place he gasped for air could scarcely believe that he was warm and the sun still shining down on him it had been so very real and damn it he could feel it coming back again he had let go of the root but now clutched at it again as the thing invaded his senses and tore him from his reality into its own the irongrey mountains snowcapped ridged with carved drifted snow and the valleys and passes between the spurs and peaks full of it like white dunes rolling to rearing horizons of stone but to harrys right what a city a walled city yes protected in the lee of the mountains and by a long snaking wall like a miniature version of the great wall of china with gaunt square towers battlements mighty gates but the old cold city was dead and empty it huddled down into itself behind the wall and kept its secrets it was much like a scene from some old geography book in harrys secondary modern school at harden and once again the thought struck him the roof of the world yes but tibet why was he seeing a scene out of tibet the blizzard had fallen off a little but he also felt the cold of the snows gnawing in his bones and saw a scene from incredible distances of space or even out of future time enacted on the screen of his mind but harry was the necroscope and could handle it perhaps even better than alec kyle himself and finally accepting it no longer fighting it he shielded his eyes against the falling snow and stared harder out there on the white waste movement single file a line of seven people antlike figures at this range were making their way across the snow they were robotic in their movements like a military drill routine left right left right leftbut rapid and shuffling the three in front were dressed in red also the three bringing up the rear but the one in the middle was all in white and as if from a million miles away the necroscope could hear the chiming of tiny golden bells the cold receded was gone from mind and body in a moment the river swirled below harry swayed like a drunkard and his ma had time for a single word son before alec kyles talent struck again it was no longer snowing harry saw the six what monks and one initiate out on the snows tramping singlefile as before but the walled city was no longer in sight the location was different this time in front of the six the base of a sheer cliff reared like a titan face it was a face carved out of the rock but if the location was cold that great grim visage in the rock was colder still it could only be a temple with huge steps carved from the bedrock leading up to the entrance the yawning mouth of the great face and up the steps the seven went to where a portcullis was lifted and the throat became a passageway into the monastery then sheer fantasy for as the seven disappeared inside so the face became flesh the great jaws snapped shut and the eyes opened wide to burn crimson as hell and suddenly the nolongerstone face was smiling the devils own smile harry couldnt believe his eyes he blinked and stared up at a blue sky where wisps of cloud drifted across a blinding sun hed toppled over onto his back and was lying there on necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley the river bank with his mouth wide open dazzled harry blinked again and at once gritted his teeth cringing down into himself in anticipation of another shift but no it was over now and it gradually dawned on the necroscope that he knew it was over then struggling to sit up and gasping the words out he began to ask his mother ma did you of course i saw it she cut him short were in contact i saw what you saw but harry what does it mean what was it harry stood up and shakily absentmindedly brushed himself down finally he shook his head whatever it was it certainly wasnt delirium tremens but its all tied up isnt it its all one and the same harry are you into another of these these things of yours her dead voice overflowed with concern things harrys mouth was dry he hadnt quite given up expecting something else to happen you know what i mean his ma insisted are you in trouble again son and for the first time the necroscope wondered am i but out loud without really considering what he said he answered ma to the best of my knowledge im not in any real trouble trouble i dont think so anyway and thats fine by me because ive got enough problems as it is so dont you go wishing any more on me okay and yet again he could have bitten his tongue because what hed said wasnt nearly what hed meant but too late now well his ma said in a certain way she had making that one small word an entire statement on its own following which she wasnt much inclined to talk to him any more harry walked the river path to the archedover gate in the garden wall and letting himself into the garden became aware of a cars engine fading to silence at the front of the house since the rest of the houses in this once select now neglected location were derelict this could only be someone visiting or delivering to him avoiding the brambles as best he could harry ran up the garden path and quickly let himself in he could have taken the mobius route of course but the more sparing he was in his use of the continuum the less likely hed be to give away its secret inadvertently in a few seconds he was through the house to the front where it took only a moment or so to unlock and open the door outside a tall slim young man was already halfway back down the walled yard to the gate that he had left open in his hand was a large manila envelope beyond the gate a black car stood waiting on the rutted service road hearing the door of the house open the man turned and saw harry delivery he said showing harry the envelope and trying hard not to show too much interest his keen curious eyes looked the necroscope over harry returned the others cautiously appraising look and said you dont much look like a typical postman and it was true he didnt no uniform for one thing and the car outside wasnt a post van and the envelope had no address or stamps the other shrugged well then lets say its special delivery or better still ebranch harrys mouth turned down at the corners as the man started back up the path do i know you he held the house door open to let his visitor in they both had to avoid trampling a months worth of mail most of it junk on the coconutfibre mat just inside the door the other shook his head held out his hand which harry pointedly ignored hed told darcy he was finished with all of this munroe the stranger let his hand fall james munroe and no we havent met im usually on embassy duties here and abroad checking out the talent so to speak im a spotter only recently returned from italy to home duties rotation of embassy staff and what have you today i sensed you were back at last he paused and frowned but im puzzled you didnt answer the door sooner is there a problem mr keogh no problem harry led him through the house to the room hed designated as his study whose patio doors looked out over the garden directed him to a chair and seated himself i was out in the garden thats all but did you say back at last how long have you been waiting for me then for a fortnight in edinburgh coming out here each day to see if you were home yet as they talked harry had checked james munroe over he would be six foot one or two twentysix or twentyseven years old one hundred and fortyfive pounds maximum his fare was angular jutting chin pointed nose and ears and jetblack hair swept back and lacquered down his eyes saved him from looking cynical or even sinister they were wide brown penetrating and honest the sort you could look into and not worry about what was going on in there a fortnight coming out here every day its that important to you i believe munroe shrugged and possibly beneficial to the branch too but im just guessing its the way we work as you know he was staring and harry was suddenly uncomfortable is there something he snapped eh the other sat up straighter was at once startled oh im sorry i was staring right its just that when you asked if you knew me i almost answered no but i once knew you but darcy clarke has told me youre touchy about that harry sighed nodded and said alec kyle yes im sometimes brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i touchy about it but im getting used to it to him to certain aspects of him anyway hewas nervous this was getting too close to stuff he couldnt talk about its funny the other said but on you he looks oh i dont know younger oh well he feels ancient i meant younger overall munroe hurriedly corrected himself i mean its like i can sense a younger man shining through but shining too brightly maybe burning up what are you an empath too the others turn to sigh im sorry but im really fucking this up right but ive read your files youre the necroscope and i expected no i didnt know what to expect and i didnt mean to say that either i mean you know im not usually a rude person mr keogh and now there was an awkward silence until harry the necroscope said at last his unnatural antagonism collapsing call me harry please and im afraid i have been rude so dont you go apologizing just recently ive been doing more than my fair share of tripping over my tongue and changing the subject so whats in the envelope munroe shrugged i wasnt told whats in here he handed it over and harry looked at it with an almost accusing expression this could be some kind of hook and him the fish but on the other hand it just might be news of brenda and as he tore it open i imagine darcy tried to get me on the telephone right and when he found he couldnt get me then he sent you your listed number munroe shook his head and smiled but were ebranch harry no such things as listed numbers not to ebranch darcy clarke could phone you if he wanted to i suppose hes doing his best to respect your privacy the necroscope said huh he took out a single doublefolded sheet of a from the envelope a letter probably but there was something stiff inside it a photograph maybe and because it might be about brenda he wanted to open it at once but because it mightnt be he didnt it doesnt make sense he finally shook his head darcy can get me on the phone and doesnt or he could just write me a letter asking me to contact him but he doesnt instead he sends you he glanced at the contents of the manila envelope the letter or whatever still folded in his lap so what do you reckon james was your journey really necessary the other raised a querying eyebrow im sorry but see harry cut him short im not going to look at this this whatever it is until i know why you had to deliver it personally in fact if you dont tell me and in the very near future at that say the next five seconds ill simply set fire to it and dump it in the fireplace there and youll have to go back down to london and tell darcy clarke what happened he looked around for his tablelighter began to stand up and munroe said okay youre right darcy wanted me or someone to see you personally yes harry sat back again why just to see how you well looked hes what worried about me maybe about how youre taking things maybe he feels responsible guilty harry jumped on that guilty and maybe youre right so what would he have to feel guilty about munroe shrugged again perhaps desperately this time and said harry im just a messenger thats all but mr clarke did say he was concerned about your general health i mean he knows your problems better than i do right so why dont you read the letter maybe its all in there and in any case despite his threat to burn it the necroscope had to know so he unfolded the single sheet of a laid the small envelope inside to one side for the moment and read what was written in darcy clarkes spidery script harry first things first still nothing on brenda im afraid and i suppose if you had heard anything you would have told me dont worry were still on it last time we spoke you said you were thinking of taking a long holiday except you were short of funds so it could be you would take a sort of working holiday you asked if id check a few places out for you well ive found a place you might like in the mediterranean the weather would be beneficial im sure and the deal could work out really cheap oh and you asked about exchange rates well they are pretty good too so why dont you contact me and well talk i enclose a photograph nice place i think youd enjoy working there all best darcy the necroscope knew what darcy was talking about he remembered how hed suggested doing a job on the russian repository in moscow or maybe on some other outfit or organization in the branchs bad brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i books for monies to fund his search damn was that all this was darcy scratching his back and maybe hoping to get a job done for free all the time knowing it would put harry in his debt so that at some future time the necroscope might feel obliged to do a little backscratching in return a sort of twobirdswithonestone scenario so why dont you contact me and well talk indeed ebranch it was typical the nerve of the doubledealing he almost ripped the photograph from its envelope and then sat there frozen staring at it for a moment harry thought it must be one of alec kyles things again his precognition hell it was one of kyles things but this time it was real as real as this photograph anyway the stark yellow and white cliffs coloured by sunlight and the squat whitewalled castle mansion chateau whatever it was perched there on the edge of oblivion a fortress on a mountainside at the rim of a sheer drop the scene was mediterranean yes of course it was and harry had seen it before all sunbleached rocks brittle scrub a few stunted pines he could almost taste the salty tang off an unseen ocean finally he moved rocked back in his chair and james munroe was at his side in a moment harry are you okay i mean your face you looked stunned harry got a grip on himself he didnt know what all this meant but he would soon damn well find out i im okay he said its something you wouldnt understand because i dont understand it look you get on back to london sorry i cant be more hospitable but ive things to do especially now and dont worry youve done your job ill be getting in touch with darcy clarke and ebranch yes and after hed seen munroe off he did just that the necroscope could have just telephoned darcy but there was a better almost an easier way and anyway face to face darcy wouldnt be able to hide too much that is assuming there was anything to hide not so long ago using the mobius route to ebranch would have been much easier but harry couldnt do that now part of him realized that darcy knew all about it anyway but he still didnt like the idea that he knew darcy or anyone else for that matter and so he was restricted in his use of the continuum he couldnt do it in front of people so there was no way he could simply materialize in darcys office but that was all right for there was another way harry doubted if they would have converted his room just yet darcy had told him theyd keep it for him just the way it was even if he never had cause to use it again so he couldnt see any reason why he shouldnt use it now one last time he did used it as one of his mobius coordinates and a moment later stepped out through the door of his old room into the main corridor of e branch in central london about halfway to darcys office situated at the far end of the corridor two branch agents were talking to each other harry headed their way and for a moment they scarcely noticed him but as he passed the open door of the duty officers room he heard someone say holy shit and guessed hed been recognized so in another five seconds maximum darcy clarke would know he was here too then as he closed with the two espers they finally saw him snapped erect as soldiers on parade and slid to one side out of his way harry was aware of their surprised glances at him and at each other as he passed by darcys office was full of security gadgets the necroscope knew that if he just barged in he would probably set some of them off so he went to knock but before his fist could strike home the door was yanked open from within and darcy was there in his shirtsleeves openmouthed beckoning him to come in harry its really great to see you in fact i was just talking about you with munroe on his carphone the necroscope nodded or with the duty officer he tossed darcys letter and photograph down on the head of ebranchs desk and without further ado would you care to explain this darcy moved to close the door before he could close it all the way harry looked back down the corridor and saw halfadozen faces peering from their respective offices darcy saw his raised eyebrow and knowing even scornful expression gave a shrug and said er word travels fast around here in some cases as fast as thought harry nodded especially around here he placed extra emphasis on the esp of especially so how will it be can we have some privacy for once i mean complete privacy he sat down in a chair facing darcys desk you have more than your fair share of listening devices around this place darcy gadgets and ghosts and whatall but your people would do well to remember how curiosity killed the cat maybe the twolegged variety could use a reminder now and then darcy sat down in his own chair flipped a switch on the desk and said all stations we have a guest whos a personal friend of mine and of the branch you all know who he is and of course hes to get the same degree of respect that we give each other so this is private and thats a capital p as he switched off again harry nodded and said gadgets and ghosts yes machines are easy to switch off but minds are something else right he glanced about the office well nothing seems to have changed much around here brian lumley er hows it going darcy rubbed his hands in a businesslike fashion he was lost for words if only for a moment so where have you been harry and for that matter how have you been how do i look the necroscope was unsmiling fine darcy answered then slumped and shook his head hey were friends harry he said his tone of voice flattening out a little losing its bounce id like to think so anyway and in that respect im pretty much like ben trask i dont like to lie so dont you look about the same as last time darcy told him youve lost weight gained a few wrinkles and you seem very tired but at the same time i dont know somehow you look more like you too but you dont talk like you i mean ive given a lot of thought to that conversation we had about alec kyle could he have been a secret drinker and so forth that was pretty strange stuff so you know apart from brenda and the baby what is it thats troubling you harry i mean id really like to help if i can and suddenly the necroscope felt he could relax a little darcys friendship was genuine oh there would always be this ebranch thing but that aside darcy was real and harry felt able to talk to him about certain things anyway and he did talk to him told him about alec kyles precognition how he seemed to have inherited it and something about his strange new problem with drink he didnt go into details on the latter but enough that darcy got the message certainly he got the message on the other thing about alec drinking i still think youre wrong darcy said when harry was through and even if youre right its amazing to me that he hid it so well as for this he picked up the picture from his desk you say youve seen it before the necroscope nodded yes a scene or sudden vision in my head but absolutely real actually it was during our conversation about a russian fort knox do you remember of course as a result of which i sent you the picture right but my mind or maybe alec kyles mind the last wrinkle in his grey matter had already sent it to me only i didnt recognize it didnt know what it meant darcy nodded thats how it was with alec too he said he rarely understood anything he saw but simply had to run with his visions to see how they worked out he had to wait until he caught up with the future me too harry said except this time ive been given more than just a precognitive glimpse more than a mental clue i have your photograph too he leaned forward and tapped his index finger on the picture and i know that you know quite a bit about this what target so i wont be going in blind because now that im sure this place necroscope the lost years vol i is waiting to happen to me somewhere in my future youll be giving me all the details as much as we have darcy said certainly but even so its still fait accompli you are going to do it so it would appear harrys face was grim so maybe we can start with you telling me who it is ill be doing it to necroscope the lost years vol i iv darcys target bonnie jean at harrys first the place darcy pushed the photograph back across the desk closer to harry we dont know much about it its history is vague at best but you can probably find out more locally if youre so inclined in fact the probably was redundant for darcy knew that the necroscope could do just that could actually talk to the original owners or builders if he so desired but he didnt want to broach that subject anyway he went on its called le manse madonie named after the mountainous region in sicily where it stands it was built about four hundred years ago on the foundations of a castle dating back to crusader times and like most ancient properties its been added to and subtracted from for centuries as to what it was originally a watchtower looking out over the tyrrhenian possibly the redoubt of some princeling we dont know and actually it mightnt be so easy to find out after all not from books at least because as far as were able to discover most of its historical records have been destroyed i mean utterly the one sure thing we do know is that its stayed in the hands of the same family for centuries their line goes back a long way you might say immemorially but records forget it where they exist theyve been altered updated rewritten from scratch not that theres much we can deduce from that quite a few old families have skeletons in their closets these people have cleared them out thats all or maybe thats not all it could be they were simply making room for a few new ones these people harry sat wrapped in his own thoughts he had absorbed all that darcy had told him which wasnt much so far well it seems obvious to me that youve been interested in these people for quite some time and thats ebranch im talking about keenly interested so who are they theyre called the francezcis darcy told him thats their family name anyway the current owners and occupiers of le manse madonie but as ive said its been francezci family property oh since the year dot theyre brothers twins but not identical anthony or tony and francesco francezci that is who they are but its what they are that interests us harry nodded so what are they first the facts darcy answered let me tell you what we know for sure and then what we suspect and finally well be down to best bets the francezci brothers are the sole surviving heirs to one of the richest families in the world you can measure their wealth well in billions so we believe okay okay he held up a hand i said id tell you only what we know and we do know but it isnt easy to tie these people or their assets down put it this way if you could calculate their wealth in terms of the italian economy if you could find a way to put back half of what they have taken out then italy and sicily wouldnt be in half the shit theyre in now harry could see where they were going mafia he said very simply shhh darcy put a finger to his lips and pulled a mockhorrified face what the francezci brothers but thats akin to blasphemy harry even suggest such a thing in polite italian society youd be ostracised in a moment and later you could end up circumcised too from the neck up no one talks about them in such terms but were pretty damn sure its how people think of them except well its amazing how things get warped with the passage of time i mean look at the socalled legends of robin hood jesse james ned kelly all the murderers and thieves whove become folk heroes as he paused for breath harry said are you telling me the francezcis are heroes darcy grinned or grimaced and said but when youre powerful enough you can be what you want to be ill give you an example of what im talking about some fortyodd years ago it was a francezci allegedly one emilio francezci a shady uncle to anthony and francesco who helped to organize the collaboration of a then underground sicilian mafia in the american invasion of that was a joint effort that came about as a direct result of an old debt owed by emilio to lucky luciano who was then rotting in an american prison cell it was emilios suggestion that in exchange for lucianos freedom and later extradition to italy lucky might like to contact several sicilian excapo friends on behalf of the american invasion force and request that they and their exmafia soldiers who were still scattered throughout sicilys villages tighten the screws on what remained of ii duces armed forces and make them an offer they couldnt refuse life if they ran away death if they chose to remain at their posts except necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley while a clean sudden death as the result of an american blitzkrieg couldnt be guaranteed a very ugly one on the cutting edge of some mafioso guerrillas garrotte most certainly could the reason for all those exs is simple youve got to remember that at the time mussolini was hanging mafiosi from whichever handy lampposts he could find and so it was a very good time to refute or better still cancel your membership in that organization but the mafia never dies it might go away for a while but it always comes back and ii duce by standing against them had put himself in their line of fire they wanted rid of him and they certainly didnt want hitler thus the american invasion of sicily was a walkover and the course of the war and a great many worldshaping events since was altered and so while this emilio francezci might be a difficult man to trace by which i mean that we know absolutely nothing about him still he could become one of those fake folk heroes i was talking about but then im told that there are people who idolize the memory of al capone too harry was silent a while then said but we are talking about italy or more properly sicily which is a place apart surely the way i understand it graft political corruption crime in general these things are almost a way of life just because this one francezci this emilio had bad connections does that mean theyre all tarred with the same brush i mean isnt everyone in that sort of culture tainted or at least touched by it from the politicians down or up as the case may be what else have you got darcy why dont you tell me what brought about ebranchs interest in the francezcis in the first place cut straight to the point right darcy answered okay lets try that ebranchs interest in the francezcis harry i have prognosticators people like alec kyle yet unlike him who are mainly interested in the future the future of this country and its welfare and i hasten to add of the world as a whole but charity begins at home so what do i mean these people are like alec yet unlike him well you were with us long enough to understand that no two sets of esp skills are exactly alike the talents of my precogs dont work like alecs did thats all but they are skilled at making damn good guesses except as any precog will tell you the future is devious as hell and therefore hard to gauge but they do their best the point is as an island and a race were moving closer and closer to europe not in the physical sense no but ideologically politically and financially so it would seem anyway so my precogs my futurologists have predicted well if thats how it will be its how it will be but in a future world where we are tied to europe wed like to give ourselves the best possible advantage just because we happen to be divided from europe by the english channel and the north sea a situation which has given us a positive advantage in the past doesnt mean we have to be some kind of poor offshore relative some sort of barearsed cousin the necroscope was quick on the uptake your futurologists foresee financial difficulties darcy was impressed among others he answered french governments come and go like day follows night and the french franc fluctuates accordingly then theres the deutschmark except there were more worried about the past than the future the old deutschmark may look good now but it has one hell of a bad record harry and as for the lira and the drachma i mean seriously the pound sterling should end up tied to currencies such as those so youve gauged something of the future youre mindful of the lessons of the past and youre now considering the present right harry nodded so that you can discover where the rot has set in and stop it from spreading over here which led you to the francezcis among others right but weve had to tread ohsocarefully the francezcis seem immune from any kind of accusation i can give you several examples in the last decade where italian governments have fallen just because they looked like they were pointing a finger in their direction ebranch is ebranch yes but on an international scale even we dont have that kind of diplomatic clout let them get wind of the fact that weve been checking on them why even our plug could be pulled and the intelligence of these people is awesome darcy had gone too fast hold it harry held up a hand you could get the plug pulled cease to function but surely youre firstline national security darcy sighed were ebranch there are people who should know better who still dont even believe in us and others who want to cut our expenditure and we exist on a fucking shoestring anyway and it isnt just idle flattery when i tell you that you personally have saved our skin time and again you your successes are whats kept us afloat we are ahead of the opposition which means were successful ergo we are allowed to exist but the francezcis are just too powerful for us as a covert organization we simply cant go against them if were right about them we lack the clout to do anything about it and if were wrong and get found out theyd have us by the balls harry was thoughtful two brothers that powerful just the two of them whats their powerbase i mean apart from money well of course thats the most powerful force on earth darcy exclaimed but okay apart from money harry theyre like an octopus with tentacles all over the place in every kind of sinkhole i mentioned their intelligence well in the main thats their powerbase too except the rest of this is really deep and you might find it difficult to believe even hearing it from me even here at e branch hq necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley try me anyway the necroscope answered see i have a very open mind he actually smiled and for a moment looked even more like the old harry darcy had known and darcy could see the humour of it someone trying to tell harry keogh that something might be too hard to believe and that someone just happening to be himself darcy clarke who could walk through a minefield blindfold in snowshoes and come through without a scratch so that darcy smiled too then chuckled and the tension was that much more diminished but in the next moment it was back to business as darcy said okay then listen these people the francezcis arent just a couple of bigtime hoods theyve got the weight of the mafia behind them the total weight of course they have for theyre advisers to the mafia like dons of dons or godfathers of godfathers but thats not nearly the end of it for through the mafia theyre also advisers to the kgb and on occasion to the cia the necroscope looked blank as if he hadnt heard but as it sank in he cocked his head on one side and said theyre what darcy nodded you cant see it well thats understandable but remember the lucky luciano story and then ask yourself why the mob is still alive and well and living in a great many places even today when every straight body in this big wide world would love to put them out of business for good but the cia harry still needed convincing i mean the first is acceptable even plausible naturally mother russia would love to undermine western capitalism and what better way than by the corruption at its root but the cia what kind of advice would the central intelligence agency take what kind would they even want from people in bed with the mob go back a step darcy told him first the kgb i never said they were giving orders to the francezcis i wasnt hinting that they were sabotaging or manipulating financial institutions or anything of that order though they could well be or at least setting up the machinery for it i said the francezcis were advisers the key word is intelligence and as i told you the francezci intelligence machine is awesome which is why the cia uses them their information is that good but as to the kind of advice they offer darcy shrugged the branch isnt privy to that information but it wont be small potatoes you can bet on it as to how it works theyll tell the kgb stuff that doesnt conflict with cia interests likewise theyll offer information to the cia if it doesnt drop the russians in it and the mob benefits both ways by knowing whats going to go down worldwide and everyone involved is grateful to the francezcis thats power harry harry was silent a while then said so theyre advisers of a sort to the mob the kgb even the cia and through them advisers to their governments just as emilio francezci was when he advised that collaboration between the american invasion force and sicilys mobinwaiting information of that order harry mused yes intelligence is the key word the necroscope continued to mull it over okay so what is their intelligence machine how do they organize it whats the source of their information maybe theyre simply the mobs own cia the nervecentre in a spiderweb of international crime and corruption darcy shrugged again possibly but unlikely for lets face it the families arent that well familiar with each other there are mob wars going on even now in the usa probably in italy too theyre not united it isnt in their genes but heres something to think about our precogs tell us that communism is on the wane certainly in russia so maybe the francezcis are preparing the way for the mob or a faction of the mob in the ussr thats a lot of turf harry the point is whatever theyre doing you can guarantee theyre not up to any good and you or the branch want me to throw some spanners in their works darcy held up his hands in protest hey i told you we cant be involved you asked me if there was someone you could hit for funds which suggested to me that maybe there was a way we could both benefit from well from what you do best but if theres any fallout from anything you do the branch cant be implicated we arent part of this scene what if i dont need the money that badly then let it go the fact is i dont need the money that badly or havent so far you asked me to do something for you darcy said what can i tell you ive done it now all im saying is this that place in the photograph le manse madonie houses money treasures gold beyond your wildest dreams because were sure that quite apart from what these characters have stashed away in the worlds banks theyre also magpies they their family have been accumulating goodies for a couple of hundred years a lot of the wealth of europe that vanished into nazi coffers during world war two still hasnt been accounted for hell it never will be while its tied up in that place oh the necroscope raised a querying eyebrow so even now i dont know it all i would have told you darcy said at once thats the whole idea of talking like this surely but so far weve just been kicking it around right what about plans of the place i thought you werent interested necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley harry grinned however tightly but were just kicking it around right no plans and their security is second to none the space centre at baikonur in kazakhstan would be easier thats probably an exaggeration but im sure you take my point the chateau bronnitsy was secure too harry answered darcy nodded but made no reply he didnt want to mention harrys talent for getting into and out of places or the damage the necroscope had done to some of the places hed been into the chateau bronnitsy once the headquarters of soviet espionage was only one of them and bronnitsy was no more but that place was the very seat of evil harry went on while im not yet convinced that these francezcis are anything but bigtime crooks im not asking you to destroy anything the head of ebranch shook his head in fact im not asking you to do anything if you do its your business and i dont even want to know im just pointing out the bulls eye in case you should ever want to do a little target practice thats all and if during my investigations i should discover the francezcis oracle the source of their intelligence wed be grateful of course because if we could tap into that source it goes without saying that wed put it to better use than they do and maybe queer their pitch at the same time harry was on top of it but youre not in any kind of hurry no honestly harry this was for you if you use it then you use it and if you dont well its your choice but as you say if its also of benefit to us so much the better the necroscope gave it another moments thought said do we know what these brothers look like or their people youve told me their security at le manse madonie is good so what do they have up there their own private staff darcy answered not massive by mob standards but as ive said the francezcis arent mob theyre bigger than that they just pull strings others do the twitching and an army wouldnt be necessary anyway not in a place as inaccessible as the madonie they have guards their servants a fourseater helicopter and various types of surface transport locally they like to travel in a stretch limo which is about as close as they come to emulating their nearest and dearest yes harry nodded the mafia and sicily is still mafia hq but definitely darcy said if the francezcis ever required it they could call up a lot of heavyduty help but not in short order it takes time to get from palermo into the madonie for some people anyway with his last comment he averted his face dug in a desk drawer and came out with a handful of photographs which he tossed onto the desk top pictures of our friends he quickly returned to the original subject not very good ones im afraid but the francezcis appear to be the worlds least photographed and least photogenic people can i take these with me when i leave sorry darcy shook his head memorize by all means but that stuff stays right here ill say it again officially we arent even interested in these people we cant be identified as a source of information in this respect harry frowned you make it sound like the francezcis have influence over here too darcy said nothing what with the british government are they advising our intelligence agencies too another reason youre interested in them we dont know what the francezcis are or arent into the other threw his hands wide but with their intelligence there has to be a real chance that theyre players on our side of the pond too not big as yet but up and coming the necroscope finished it for him and i have to admit youve got me interested im not keen on the idea of my countrys strings being pulled by some kind of supercriminal puppetmaster not now or in the future he looked at the photographs three of the five pictures were of the same two men taken from the same angle same location theyd been snapped in grey evening light leaving a typically italian or sicilian building descending a wide flight of steps other people were following on behind them but out of focus in the first picture the two were glancing directly at the camera their eyes unseen behind the dark lenses of sunglasses their handsome faces twisted by shock or surprise in the second picture they loomed much closer one of them pointing at the camera his slash of a mouth barking some sort of question or order in the third picture the pair were almost totally obscured by the five fingers of a gloved hand reaching to cover the lense of the camera in all of the photographs their features while appearing handsome in an almost stereotyped mediterranean fashion were very indistinct blurred possibly by motion or by the nerves of the cameraman dark hair brushed back large ears lying flat to their heads long slender faces also they appeared taller than the average italian harry knew he would retain these lasting impressions of the francezcis and one other their lack of colour for italians or sicilians they didnt seem to have too much colour a couple of coldlooking customers right said darcy his voice reaching harry as if from a million miles away the necroscope looked up hmm he said necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley crawly types darcy pulled a face the result of misspent youths pale as a pair of longtime hustlers spawn of the back alleys and the billiard halls or in their case of the dimlylit echoing rooms of le manse madonie being a bit theatrical arent you harry frowned and his thoughtful or faraway expression disappeared and anyway i thought you didnt know anything about le manse madonie no but i know something about them they have a congenital disorder a kind of photophobia allergy to strong light which means they keep pretty much to home its one of the reasons why we dont have better pictures no one has better pictures another good reason is that they dont like people taking pictures the fellow who took these he was paparazzi at the time of that nasty aldo moro business it seems amazing to me that he ever got these pictures out of sicily anyway thats not all he got oh darcy shrugged but in no way negligently he was found hanging from a bridge in naples a month later suicide apparently harry looked at the other photographs one of a squat man in a flying suit and the other of a cadaverous type in a valets uniform and these people the little stubby one is their pilot darcy said his name is luigi manoza until a couple of years ago he was working for one of the new york families a local war took out his employer and there were threats on luigis life too he fled to relatives in sicily ended up working for the francezcis the other one is their chauffeur mario he doesnt have a second name not that hes telling anyway but hes a dead ringer for a certain mario who was a highlypaid hit man for the scarlattis in rome in the late sixties he was the best at his infamous job just the right sort of chap to be driving for the francezcis nice said harry but something seems wrong i mean for people who want to appear divorced from the mob these francezcis seem to employ an awful lot of exsoldiers darcy shrugged in manozas case he was on the periphery so hes a pilot but he could just as easily be a gardener the mafia employs ordinary people too you know as for mario he has no criminal record was never brought to trial its hardly surprising the best never are the necroscope dropped the photographs back on the desk and stood up he held out his hand and darcy shook it but as harry headed for the door harry darcy said i can still find you some clean money if you want it harry paused id make out he said im not short not yet anyway it depends how long it takes to find brenda and the baby if i find them youre sure theres nothing your end darcy shook his head but were keeping our eyes and our ears wide open he watched harry open the door and step out into the corridor he wanted to call him back but didnt he wanted to ask after his health again were there any other problems inside his head maybe but he didnt it was always the branch first and if the necroscope had looked back seen darcys face right then he would have known something was wrong and maybe darcy wanted him to but harry didnt look back instead over his shoulder he said thanks darcy its as much as i can ask and then he closed the door behind him that night harry called bonnie jean why he could never have said maybe it was the threequarters full moon hanging in the sky over the budding trees beyond his garden wall though why that should be a motive was just as big a mystery or maybe it was simply that hed run out of bj s wine which was probably why hed left seattle and headed for home in the first place but these were arguments the necroscope had had before if only with himself and bonnie jean was just another of the mysteries of his life or was she more than that an innocent harry was sure she was but how innocent can someone who goes out intent on murder be except harry wasnt allowed to think that way and so he settled for innocent also she was a damn goodlooking woman and someone to talk to company yes well if she wanted to be and it looked like it could be a long night spent tossing and turning especially if harry didnt have anything to drink and damn it he intended not to have anything to drink so why call bonnie jean but he called her anyway first he got one of her girls then bonnie jean she was in the bar said shed take it upstairs for privacy he imagined she wanted privacy to talk to him and she must really have flown up those stairs for after a few seconds harry is it really mah wee man himself her voice or words were like warm fingers driven home through his butter brain pressing buttons switching channels conjuring a different him then bj dropped the accent but retained her husky breathlessness funny but ive really missed you harry and whatever misgivings hed had if he had had any at all were at once forgotten well im back he found his voice for the time being anyway and you told me to stay in touch it seemed a weak ineffectual way to broach what was on his mind but the words just necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley slipped off his tongue as if they were someone elses and if anything your call is early bj said without really thinking what she was saying but it was a fact that the full moon was still a week away immediately realizing her mistake why did this bloody man have this effect on her she went to add something anything but harry beat her to it i know what you mean he said without really knowing i seem a bit eager right well maybe its the moon that shocked her rigid so that she found difficulty in answering the moon over my garden wall he explained i seem to have this tune in my head give me the moonlight give me the girl and leave the rest to me well i have the moonlight but she sighed her relief inaudible to harry and said but no girl eh and before he could answer where are you pretty close im home five or six miles did you find them your wife and child no the necroscope answered his voice showing no emotion one way or the other bj wouldnt be able to tell if he was glad or sad and the fact was that right now harry didnt know either its a quiet night bj said well be closing around twelve it wasnt much harry thought but she seemed to be saying so much more and thats more than three hours he answered too long yes no i dont have much to do i mean im alone and lonely i suppose do you want to come here i can if you no dont look why dont you tell me where you are and ill come to you ill take a taxi the girls can take care of things here for one night youll come now he sensed her shrug i could use a break have you eaten not in a while do you have any food in no food he shook his head despite that she couldnt see him no drink either she answered pause for pause and finally said tm sure we can fix that i mean ill pick something up on the way so whats the address oh and harry give me your phone number too in case im delayed the number i have doesnt work and he told her both his address and telephone number why not it seemed the most natural thing in the world to do harrys address was scarcely the easiest place in the world to find it was one of four victorian houses standing in an uneven cluster on a riverbank a mile or two out of bonnyrig with undulating patchworkquilt fields on three sides dotted with dark copses here and there and during daylight the rare hazy view of a distant steeple or square church tower just why any specific area falls derelict is hard to say but this district definitely had three of the onceproud even grand old houses were terraced and stood in highwalled gardens extending almost to the river the two outer houses had been empty for years and were beyond redemption their windows were gaping holes and their roofs were buckling inwards they had been up for sale for a long time every so often someone would come to look at them and go away shaking his head they were not desirable residences the central house was harrys place it was lonely but he could talk to his ma in private here and never fear that anyone would see him sitting on the riverbank mouthing nonsense to himself glimpsed through the trees lining the riverbank bonnie jeans first view of the house was from a road on the far side of the river she had asked the driver of her taxi to halt and sat there a while just looking across the river it was obvious which house was occupied the ground floor lights were on they flooded out and lit the sprawling garden lending the place an eerie illumination the house was alive barely but by comparison the others were stone dead yet oddly enough bj didnt consider the place as a whole at all out of keeping with harry keoghs character indeed she thought it suited him the reason she had caused the driver to stop was simple shed wanted to observe the house from a safe distance but it was what it was an old house on its last legs hardly a safe house as she would imagine such a place to be and in any case since harrys people his exemployers already knew about her or something about her it made little difference but he had told her they were finished with him and that theyd have no further interest in her following which shed made doubly sure by giving him certain posthypnotic commands but he was no ordinary man this mysterious harry keogh and it was something shed have to check up on anyway after a while shed told the driver to carry on and a minute later the taxi had crossed the river by an old stone bridge onto a rutted service road the row of houses lay at the end of the road and bj dismounted and paid her fare outside harrys address number the riverside the one with the lights as the taxi pulled away bj walked the moonlit ribbon of paving stones to harrys door which opened as she reached it and harry was there taking the brownpaper chinesemotif takeaway bags out of her hands as he ushered her inside he looked harassed and was instantly brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i apologetic about the state of the place he had obviously been busy his brow was damp with perspiration but you seem in a bit of a state she said looking all around his spacious if sparsely furnished study the only room that hed spent any time on and that nearly a month ago what on earth have you been doing harry he grimaced er tidying up really she couldnt help but smile then id hate to have seen it when it looked rough he nodded glumly a mess right she shook her head in bewilderment and you live here is it that bad he looked around licked his lips nervously nodded again yes it is that bad well actually the house isnt too bad at all its been a decent old place in its time and was built to last which is as well because its seen some neglect but the site is a mess yes the main thing is this place is mine and i can do it up ive only been here a while after all and ive been busy but the place has had a survey and doesnt seem to have any problems i mean structurally harry opened his arms expansively setting the chinese takeaway bags swinging its just fine ill replace the carpets well eventually and a few floorboards kind of creak er the decor could be improved i suppose and i really dont know where all the dust comes from he sighed and his poorlyfeigned optimistic air disappeared in a moment then theres the paintwork and a handful of roof tiles and shrugging he fell silent but why this place there had to be a reason it was my mas harry said then my stepfathers they are dead now its just a place to be i suppose now that im on my own listening to him bj had felt his loneliness shed been lonely too albeit in a different way for a very long time now outside from across the river i thought it looked like you the house i mean from a distance its still dont know rich im not rich harry shook his head i mean its character she said in the night it looks like it has style do i have style bj nodded and cocked her head on one side well youve certainly got something harry keogh else i wouldnt be here which was the truth however she meant it and before he could answer wheres the kitchen she asked as she took the takeaway bags back from him or dont i want to know but thank god the kitchen had been modernized they ate discovering that he really was hungry harry set to with a will bj watched him mainly and toyed with the smaller portions of chinese food that she had served herself she had also been watching him as shed unpacked and reheated the food in his microwave his keen interest in what there was to drink and his obviously disappointed frown on sighting a bottle of liebfraumilch he didnt want any settling for a can of coke instead but as she poured herself a glass she said the red wine is gone what was left anyway and the pause was pregnant as she stared at him harry was ready for it but still he glanced at her before looking away that was bad of me he said would you believe me if i said i came to see you i mean youd asked me to stay in touch and here i was about to go away and i couldnt contact you but why break in break in as in burglary he shook his head i didnt have to break anything i told you this is what i do best it was my job remember and your place is a walkin believe me from the back anyway oh shed thought she was so secure but the fact was that she had been advised to employ more security at the rear of the premises it was that easy til show you some time he said hoping he would never have to and he carried on eating and you got past one of my girls bj wasnt finished i move very quickly and very quietly harry said knowing that she couldnt argue with that but it was very wrong of you anyway what would i have thought or done if i had been in and you had suddenly entered my bedroom and as for stealing a bottle of my wine harry grinned in what he hoped was a disarming manner i left a calling card thats all you must have seen that ad on tv you know the one and all because harry keogh loves red wine something like that yes but you know that stuff really did have an adverse effect on me and didnt i read something recently about a masspoisoning or some such where certain european vintners were accused of topping up their wines with antifreeze and now you tell me its gone what did you actually sell that stuff what bonnie jean could hardly believe it now he seemed to be accusing her of something also this was beginning to sound a lot like one of radus wordgames and if so then harry keogh was good at them but she kept her temper answering you know you could be right i tried it myself and the next morning felt like you looked that time but no i didnt sell it i gave it to my customers to try and they didnt like it either and so its gone finished yes against his will harry felt himself gritting his teeth he didnt quite necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley know whether to be glad or mad he should have taken all the bottles when he had the chance but no of course he shouldnt it had to be for the best that the vile stuff was finished and with it the afterimage or whatever of kyles alcoholism obviously for harry was damned if he could fancy bj s liebfraumilch exactly how it all tied up he couldnt say but now at last it was over it had to be over because there was no more of bj s wine and as if someone had pulled a plug in his brain most of harrys frustrations anxieties and selfdoubts went flooding away down the drain of his mind leaving him relieved and cool where a moment ago hed been burning up for perhaps after all he was that one smoker in ten million who could only smoke one brand and at last theyd stopped making it yet even now in the depths of his subconscious mind a small voice was asking him oh really but what about greece ill bet you can get it in greece and there it was the question right there on the tip of his tongue making ready to blurt itself out that friend of yours the one who brought it back for you you wouldnt happen to know where he got it would you except he mustnt ask it never not if he would be his own man again she came to his rescue saying all i knew was that someone had been into my place i didnt think of you at first but wondered if maybe it had been this organization you worked for maybe they were checking me out or something for a moment that caught him off guard he had quite forgotten the story hed told her about the branch wanting him to clear up a point or two but now shed brought it all back to mind and since in fact ebranch knew nothing at all about her no bj no ones out to get you he said like i told you the people i worked for arent police and in fact theyre not even remotely interested in you not any longer nor in me for that matter and believe me i really am sorry i caused you so much concern they finished the rest of the meal in an awkward silence just mulling things over but when harry finally sat back he sighed and said you want to know something i think this is the first time in god i dont know how long that ive felt relaxed your choice of food was just great and you are just great too wrongheaded maybe but great and anyway who am i to talk who indeed she said something like his ma might but with an entirely different feel to it was that a compliment harry laughed and rubbed his chin im not sure he answered but it felt like a whole series of them your best line your idea of chatting me up seduction even to tell me that im great despite that im wrongheaded well i have to say ive heard better the way she said well it really did sound like his ma the idea of red wine was now rapidly receding in the necroscopes mind bj had spoken several key words words that had nothing to do with previous posthypnotic commands which harry had picked up on and now he realized what else hed been missing in the last eighteen months other than his own body taking up the used plates and cutlery and fumbling it a little he said do you feel cold is it cold in here there had been a fire laid in his open fireplace ever since he moved in but the necroscope hadnt felt the need to light it normally he didnt like it too warm and perhaps surprisingly the houses oilfired centralheating system was working very well she had seen his eyes rove over the hearth and had perhaps read something of what was on his mind a little chilly yes then toss a match on the fire while i wash up all right she said and id like to wash up too ummm the bathroom is off the landing upstairs he answered the shower is very good but i bet your bedrooms a mess right the direct way was usually the best and easiest even so bj was surprised to find herself breathing a shade too fast actually no harry answered his voice a little husky no its pretty tidy i er tidied it he paused in the doorway and looked back to where she was standing by the fireplace their eyes locked and for a moment it was like it had been in her barroom there was this magnetism which had nothing to do with the art of beguilement or on the other hand it was that entirely natural mutual beguilement the electric moment when a man and woman know that its going to happen but now that the fires lit she tore her eyes from his struck a match and tossed it onto a base of crumpled newspaper and kindling i think i would be just as comfortable down here and beginning to burn as quickly as the fire and just as hot harry husked then after youve showered bring down the quilt and soft top blanket from my bed then he was off to the kitchen and bj licked her lips the doglord was right there were other ways better ways to enthrall a man with the lights off and the curtains drawn in the red glow of the fire it would be just like a warm secret cave in here yes it would be just like a lair necroscope the lost years vol i v one of the other ways truths halftruths and damned lies it was two am before harry fell asleep in her arms but the night time was bjs time and she didnt feel the need she needed oh yes but not sleep and as the time crept inexorably closer to the full of the moon that need was ever more insistent but she had long since learned to deny herself so that harry was never in any real danger especially harry who impressed her more and more as the mysterious one radus man with two faces well his ways werent quite so mysterious now one facet at least had revealed itself to her and in his way he had initiated it shy to begin with his prowess had improved with experimentation and unlike most men the first time they are with a woman harry had felt driven to satisfy her hed quickly discovered her preference a moon child with that of the wolf a great deal of the wolf in her bj had submitted and with her breasts flattened to the soft blanket and her face turned to the red glow of the fire shed felt the delicious thrusting the hammering home of harrys turgid flesh in the heart of her womanhood oh he had gone without for a long time that much was obvious but so had she and could take all that he could give yet despite the fact that she sucked on him desperately with her sex still he had held back until he first felt her shuddering and heard her moaning before firing into her his long hot bursts and bonnie jean mirlu had never felt so well satisfied not in that respect anyway for him their sex was a jammed floodgate finally opened pouring himself into her the rest of his pain his grief and all of his anxieties and frustrations were temporarily suspended time itself seemed suspended in the oblivion of those briefly blazing seconds as bjs sugar the searing and singing of her flesh saturated his psyche and melted in his mind and the second time he came such was bjs pleasure that as they disengaged she turned him on his back and kept his shaft moist and throbbing in the soft sleeve of her mouth until he was ready again but throughout she had been aware of the danger and mindful of radus warning be sure be absolutely sure that if he gets into you nothing of you of us gets into him of course not for he wanted harry for himself to use however he would use him he wanted him pure human at first anyway as for radus purpose with harry bj knew of it but for the moment did not want to think about it for the moment she wanted only to lie here warm and drowsy with harrys arm draped over her and his sleeping no longer intense but oddly innocent face resting against the resilience of her breasts and her thigh between his legs where his rod all flaccid now twitched occasionally perhaps from the memory of its mounting for while he had pleasured her with his body it had not stopped there he now pleasured her with his presence yes she liked being there with him and it was also a curiously pleasant thought that hed shot his seed into her despite that she had been obliged to kill it contraception pills and plastic and sensesstifling rubber unnecessary her body her system was its own protection there was that in her blood the same alien essence that defended her against mans common ailments times deterioration and even physical injuries that would not allow of the invasion of his sperm bj need only call on it think it into being and her system would or had responded to destroy all of harrys myriad squirming tadpoles of generation it had taken but a thought a command issued from bj s mind to her own innermost organs and tissues to the immature leech which she even felt growing within her despite that her master had denied it other than you there is that in me which is alive i do not wish it cleanse me of this infestation so be it and it was done except the other way was much harder to keep that alien essence to herself and not transmit it or allow it to transmit itself into her partner she wanted him enthralled in the one sense but not as a true thrall in the other bj herself she might have wanted him so but the doglord did not no for radu wanted him for himself again it seemed a contradiction that her master would insist she was not wamphyri but at the same time worry about her passing on anything to harry to his mysterious one herself a thrall bj s bite would make him a moon child aye to be stricken by the moon at its full and held in awe of unnatural urges but never a true wolfling only by transfusion of radus blood his saliva his sperm his essence could that be accomplished or by his leech or its vampire egg but surely during all the years that bj had served him sufficient of her master must have brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i found its way into her no not so radu had it that the giving was a oneway thing bj got nothing back oh really then why was it that she always felt what an electric connection an inner awareness anyway as radus funnel filled and he began to consume her lifes blood bonnie jean knew why or supposed she knew but she scarcely dared to admit it not even to herself for if she was wrong how great his wrath to discover that she had somehow imagined herself magically endowed indeed wamphyri without that he had engineered it well he need not worry for it was not her intention to make a vampire a wolf or any other creature out of harry it was her intention to obey her master and eventually have him up out of his resin grave for as much as bonnie jean had been the doglords champion she sensed the day coming when he must be hers the drakuls and ferenczys and their thralls were abroad in the world as yet bj was more woman than composite creature radu must survive at least until she had learned all she could from him and with that knowledge became more capable of managing of engineering her own dynasty and so it was out in the open at last in the open of her consciousness her selfunderstanding at least not treachery but survival her own survival more proof and possibly the best yet that she was or would soon be what shed suspected for the last forty years at least wamphyri so for now radu would continue to be her master and his word law and until he was up again and for as long as the drakuls and ferenczys were a threat she would suppress it as best she could and as he had used her she would now use others and so prepare her own way in the world as for the doglords plans for harry his socalled mysterious one his man with two faces bj could now look at those in a different light from radus point of view for what he would do now she herself might yet be obliged to attempt in some fardistant future time radu had not gone down into the resin of his own volition not entirely he had thought that he sickened he had believed that the black death held him in thrall and knew from experience that he could not beat it with his own eyes he had seen his pups develop those hideous black pustules and die he had felt the disease inside him and knew the struggle his essence put up against it in vain and hed cursed his leech for its weakness its idle inefficiency that it could not combat the creep of this insidious thing but the s was a decade not only of plague but of famine and unrest simple movement throughout europe had been the most difficult thing in its own right even a rich boyars entourage fleeing before the alldevouring scourge from the east could scarcely expect to find it an easy passage radu had got into a fight suffered a sword thrust in his side normally his vampire leech could easily handle quickly heal a simple wound but his parasite was already battling the plague within radus system a fight it couldnt hope to win not as long as he was up and about engaging in other activities he had hated it but there was no other solution so that finally in scotland in the doglords longlaid contingency plan for continuity must be brought into being the pack had built him a makeshift lair in unexplored mountain heights and radu had gone down into the resin a drastic solution perhaps but this was what hed seen in precognitive dreams that he must go down for long and long six hundred years and more and rise up in a future world even in another body metempsychosis the passing of his being and personality into the body of another moreover he had long dreamed of this mysterious one who would be there at his awakening and of himself as the avenger out of time destroyer of his olden enemies burning bright as a star in the final hour of his triumph with these things in mind it had been easier to submit to the sarcophagus of soft suffocating resin the wine of desertbred wizards had helped the coma it induced had been like unto death itself but in fact was the dawn of a radically extended undeath and immobile in his state of suspended animation in a gluey grave in the cairngorms lair he had commenced to dream and now that radu was no longer active consuming energy and making demands on his leech his vampire could concentrate on its real battle directing all of its efforts to combat the virus raging in the doglords heart just how that battle had gone who could say radu slept and even when his mind was awake still in a way it was detached from his body he would not know he was a whole man again until the two came together which would be on the day when bj melted away the resin and set him free and if he was not the whole man if his parasite had lost its light and the fever rose up in him again resurgent after all these years that was where harry keogh came into the picture it was the role that radu saw him playing in that final scene metempsychosis aye because in the year preceding the doglords awakening he would use his superior powers of beguilement that hypnotism which was his art above all others to transfer his detailed memories into harrys mind and if when he arose he discovered his body riddled with disease about to succumb and suffer the true death then he would cause his leech to flee his body into harrys indeed he would scarcely need to cause it for the natural tenacity of the parasite its lust for life would see to that and if by chance the leech itself could not transfuse if it should be obstructed then it would issue its egg swiftest and surest of all carriers of vampirism brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i but in the moment of transfusion by whichever method the doglord would attempt his greatest wonder radu was an incredibly powerful mentalist a telepath without peer and with his own uniformly scarlet gaze he would burn out harrys mind and project himself through harrys own honeybrown eyes into his mentality he would be harry keogh or more properly harry would become him with radus egg or leech all of his memories and his mind entire he would be radu why eventually through metamorphism he would even come to look like him would wear the doglords face the man with two faces aye that was lord radu lykans plan but on the other hand if he should rise up again a whole man or creature free of the plague then there would be other uses for the mysterious one and they were far less of a mystery for one thing thered be a hungry warrior to see to it was harry stirred and mumbled something in his sleep and it was as good a time as any bj shushed him checked that he was still deeply asleep reached across him and toppled a smouldering block of firewood oak she thought from the back of the deep oldfashioned fireplace into the glowing embers then she slid out from under the blanket that shed drawn over them crossed the room and turned on a readinglamp at harrys desk and aiming it directly into harrys face his shut eyes she at once blocked the beam with her naked body and quickly returned to him then she lay beside him and propped herself on one elbow turned and looked at the lamp and narrowing her eyes to close out the rest of the room she nodded and congratulated herself that the glowing sphere of light looked not unlike a full moon the principal image the trigger that was already implanted in his mind the rest of it was down to power of will the intensity of her own eyes and voice and mind to which hed already succumbed on previous occasions and she breathed harry mah wee man are ye listening it was a deep purring penetrating scottish brogue which she breathed into his nostrils as well as his ears her scent her musk infiltrated harrys system his dreams and subconscious and for a moment his eyelids fluttered then were still as he mumbled yyes good she purred and dropping the accent harry you will listen to me and you will obey me is that understood yyes and as quickly as easily as that she had taken command of his mind it still seemed amazing to bj that control was so simple over a mind shed suspected of being so complex and so far shed used only the human side of her will while there was that in her which was much stronger and far and away superior to anything human but now because of the ultimately esoteric nature of what she must tell harry as a prelude to what radu would eventually instil into him bj had need of that greater alien strength of will again leaving their makeshift bed before the fire she went to the patio windows and opened the curtains high over the garden a threequarterfull moon poured its silvery light on her which pooled around her and turned her to an alabaster statue she opened her arms wide sighed and reached up letting the moonlight flood her psyche and drawing strength from it and this time her metamorphosis was that much easier colours flowed flesh rippled moved rearranged there sounded a crackle of static electricity as fur bristled stood erect and settled down on bj s flanks and drawing the curtains again and falling to all fours she went back to harry and cradling him and lusting after his flesh but denying herself because her lust was no longer sexual she commanded that he open his eyes and gaze upon the glorious moon and that he see only her eyes in the moonlight flooding from his readinglamp then burning the message home with her furnace gaze she told him what he must know if he was to go out into the world as the doglords spy to seek out the drakuls and the ferenczys knowledge he would retain in his innermost being without even realizing it was there likewise any information he might gather no other would be privy to it harry himself would scarcely be aware of its existence until bj or radu lykan drew it out of him and as her husky shewolfs voice coughed rumbled and occasionally whined through the long night hours telling its truths halftruths and damned lies mainly as she herself had heard the story from the doglord radu and employing his mode of expression so the necroscope absorbed all that she told him soaking it up as a bonedry sponge soaks water haaaarry harry keogh listen to me listen and remember all that i shall tell you but these are secret things this is secret knowledge for you and you alone retain it and use it when the time is right but at other times forget it lest it harm you irrepairably harry there is a world other than this world a place a space other than ours it has a name sunsidelstarside where there are men and other than men there are barrier mountains which keep the two races apart sunside of the mountains dwell men starside is home to the wamphyri the wamphyri were men but no longer now they are greater than men they are the vampire lords of a vampire world brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i in the earliest times of the vampire world lord shaitan of the wamphyri was the greatest of the starside lords the others rose up against him and he defeated them many of them whom he took prisoner were executed in various ways they were put into deep graves to stiffen to stones in the earth or were banished into the bittercold icelands but others were thrown into the starside gate which was thought to be the throat of a vampire hell in fact it was a true gate to this world our world except having come here they could not go back for the gate had closed behind them among them who came through with their thralls were several of the vilest of men creatures whose evil was quite beyond the imagining of mundane minds the drakul brothers karl and egon and nonari the gross ferenczy and these awesome lords were destined to become the forebears of vampirism in this world even as they had been among its first progenitors in starside but there was one other who was banished with them and he was honourable even among the wamphyri where true honour never existed his name was radu lykan a socalled doglord whose mistress was the moon and whose shape and affinity were more like unto the noble wolf than the illomened bat oh radu was wamphyri but in his nature he was above them as men are above rats and for a thousand years radu ran with the wolves and was one with the wild of this world a creature of nature aye and different from the vile and terrible lords who came out of starside with him he desired only to go his own way doing no harm to men but living alongside them unseen in the woods and mountain heights his prey were the wild things and his drink was the clean clear water of mountain streams but as for the drakuls and ferenczys they were they are a monstrous scourge and the source of a legend as wide as a world the legend of the vampire and radu because he is wamphyri has been tarred with their brush in that ancient world where he came forth out of starside down all the years of his freedom in the wild even unto these modern times he is known by a terrible name and an undeserved reputation werewolf and despite that he was never guilty of drakul and ferenczy excesses and atrocities he bears the selfsame taint and his memory is likewise cursed his memory aye because he is no more nothing in this world but an ancient creature in a cavern lair nothing but a bad dream which was never given the opportunity to clear its name because he was driven into hiding made to seek refuge and relinquish his life in the wild as a veritable force of nature by his olden starside enemies six hundred years ago in a time of war and famine and pestilence they sought him out to pursue him and put him down but he evaded them and theirs by hiding himself away in a mountainous redoubt except it is a redoubt in name only untenanted unprotected it is more a lair a sanctuary a place of refuge than a fortress but even there the doglord radu is not safe even there even now he is dogged by the sons of the sons of his olden starside enemies for while the descendants the spawn of vile drakuls and ferenczys are ignorant of radu s whereabouts still they know that he is not dead but undead dreaming in a place of his own and they cannot bear that he yet abides for when lord lykans sleep of centuries is done he will be up again and return to his woods and mountains except this time he will not suffer such as his enemies to live this time he will seek them out wherever they are disguised as men and deal with them as they would deal with him but it will not be easy for even in those bygone days six hundred years ago already the wamphyri were adept at hiding themselves away among men and the ferenczys especially so let me tell you what i know of their history harry as it was told to me by my master the doglord radu lykan but remember as a familytree of infamy this history of the wamphyri is incomplete it ends where radu retired to his mountain hideaway and in all the time gone by since then ah but who can say what is become of such creatures now their place in the world today well i can say something of them at least first the drakuls as told there were two of them came through the gate with radu karl and egon black karl as he was known not for the colour of his skin but that of his heart met up with radu in ainjalut in karl was with the mongols as was a certain ferenczy who ran off when he saw how all was lost i will tell you about him later and radu with the mamelukes who were triumphant wherefore we neednt any longer concern ourselves with karl thereafter however egon drakul was far more mindful of a wamphyri maxim here in this world that anonymity is synonymous with longevity perhaps it was because radu was actively hunting the drakuls down perhaps egon had simply had enough of the slaughter of the times whichever he disappeared for a while and for long and long radu could discover nothing of his whereabouts but some ninety years later radus spies reported egons presence in poland alas radu only learned of this when he was in france enroute for england fleeing from the scourge of the black death else he would have gone to poland at once too late he fell ill even as the black death began to burn itself out in its initial manifestation at leastso the doglord went into hibernation in his secret mountain refuge but he left certain tried and trusted thralls behind to look after his interests down the centuries of the latter there werent many most of his pups had been taken by the plague others had died building his retreat only the hardy descendants ofmirlus and tirenis recruited out ofsunside in the vampire world when radu was a starside lord lived to survive him and then only by brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i virtue of their isolation the inaccessible mountain heights in which they worked but when radu was safely asleep in his great sarcophagus then they went down into scotland to settle the land around or to wait out the last days of the plague before returning abroad to more familiar lands and territories ah how could they know that the plague wasnt finished with them that scarcely a decade would pass for the next four centuries without it returning again and again to scythe among them for since they were moonchildren all and ofradus blood its contagion was deadly to them no less than leprosy to the vampire lords ofstarside well if there were survivors i do not know of them but of that handful who remained local and loyal to radu a few did survive aye and six hundred years ago an ancestor of mine a mirlu was one of them we had to survive else radu himself could not for who would there be to to tend him in his secret lair to listen to him dreaming to reassure him if only by our presence of the time of his return to to console him in his long lonely sleep my ancestor aye he or more likely she lived and died a moon child but not without leaving an heir to her duties and there would always be an heir down the centuries for four hundred years harry a mirlu to care for radu in his immemorial tomb until there was me and surely that is the true miracle that to know him and be faithful to him indeed to dedicate ones life to him is to extend that life indefinitely longevity beyond the wildest dreams of the boldest men of science and medicine and yet radu has it harry and so do i and so can you but i fancy ive strayed i was speaking of egondrakul let me continue in poland the black death had little impact why who can say the plague was carried by rats of asiatic origin perhaps there were too many rivers to cross the danube the elbe the oder anyway and despite that one third of the european population succumbed egon drakul survived orifnotegon himself a blood or eggson certainly now thedrakuls had been driven out of their foothold in transylvania many hundreds of years earlier by successive waves of eastern invaders their influence in that mountainous region had been eroded theyd been less than covert in their activities the legend they originated was eradicated almost but six hundred years ago in the wake of plague famine war and civil unrest in general after the decimation of europe it was time to return to the source land the mountains that egon knew so well why upon a time hed even been a lord there no less than in sturside in another world so much ive gathered for in two hundred years i have been something of a fartraveller myself when times have allowed and on my masters behalf ive done what you will do sought evidence of his olden enemies sought to locate them so that when radu returns hell know their numbers and whereabouts and this much i have learned that indeed there was a drakul in his transylvanian castle until a time as recent as a hundred years ago an aristocrat ayea count the people around knew him however and eventually it was his time to move on again but was it egon drakul egon himself oh i think so and i have my reasons radu had killed egons brother karl then gone to earth in scotland perhaps egon sought revenge perhaps he would even seek out my master however it was he had his thralls in england sleepers if you will and went there now down the years this drakuls mentalist talent had grown in order to inform his english thralls of his imminent arrival on their soil he reached out to them with his mind and in so doing likewise alerted radu where he lay dreaming in his mountain refuge and radu alerted me a hundred years ago aye can you imagine how things have changed harry there were no aeroplanes in those days now men have walked on the surface of our mistress moon and sent their messages out to the stars the sciences were still young while superstition was still rife there were alchemists and others who remembered and believed in the old legends and there were some i feared because of what they believed but there was no other way and i must protect my master there was a muchtravelled man a doctor who knew who believed the legend of the wampir and before the drakul was able to set up a colony in england i made known to this doctor his presence here it was easy a letter a warning and it coincided with a spate of strange deaths and deteriorations also egon had come aboard a ship well how else but a plague ship by the time it wrecked on the northeast coast and so my doctor was convinced he put paid to egons plans pursued him back to transylvania brought him up out of his coffin into sunlight it was the end of one of the original lords of the wamphyri brought about by my hand as instructed by my master of course but it was the way of it the way of his true death that convinced me it was egon drakul and none other no matter what names he may have used to surrender to the sunlight like that and devolve into so much dust ah but he had been wamphyri for long and long and what an opportunity eh i couldnt resist it a trip to my masters country where first he entered this world and from there into the hinterland where at least one ancient drakul castle is standing to this day my duties were such that i could afford ninety days no more barely sufficient time but i went anyway to the castle of the dead drakul what on a whim never my lord radu lykan sent me and with specific instructions at that for he knew that the drakuls had been brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i creatures of habit by which i might know for certain it was egon we had killed and in the dank and gloomy dungeons in the spiderhaunted vaults of that hated place on its gaunt promontory i found the evidence i sought a bed of earth in the crumbling debris of an antique coffin earth out of starside in a vampire world but a coffin one coffin ah wo there were two coffins the one the old one bore a motif in the shape of a riven man and according to my master radu it had been a drakul punishment in starside to tear enemies asunder and let their guts rain down onto the boulder plains beneath the great aeries the other coffin was newer some two or three hundred years old it carried no special sigil but only these initials dd surely the second of the two must stand for drakul there were szgany around szekely apparently they were in thrall in one degree or another to the now absent drakuls they kept the castle and sheltered within its structure through bad winters me they hated on sight but i am what i am and was not concerned they melted away into the country around leaving me to my own devices but before departing for england i found a szkeley youth who was not adverse to talking tome and the youth told me that indeed the great boyas son had set out with his retainers and journeyed east at the selfsame time as his father had ventured westwards so then egon was dead but his son egg or bloodson i cant say had fled east but east is a big place and too far away in those days for me to visit and it seems that this most recent drakul had learned the lesson his forbears forgot or ignored the maxim which has it that longevity is synonymous with anonymity for in all the years since ive heard no more of these terrible drakuls except from radu who assures me that at host one of them survives still dd of course well so much for them who were in any case the least of radus enemies as for the worst of them they were they are the ferenczys let me tell you what is known of them but in order to do so i must go back a long long way now in the vampire world radu and the ferenczy clan had been enemies from the start theirs was a bloodfeud that began long before they were lords when they were szgany in sunside radu was a mere youth when the brutish ferenczy brothers lagula and rakhi not only murdered his human father but raped to death his sister the only creature hed ever cared for in all sunside when she was dead then he cared for nothing much nothing but revenge no not true he was also fond of a shewolf who wandered the sunside hills with him during his days as a mountain man a loner without a tribe neither family nor friends only the sun to warm him and the stars for guide at night radu and his shewolf aye but she was infected with vampirism and had a leech the parasite vacated her for radu who was a stronger cleverer host thus he became wamphyri but when radu crossed into starside he found the ferenczys already there vampire lords of their own great aeries so their bloodfeud continued becoming part of the greater wamphyri bloodwars eventually radu conquered and killed both of the ferenczy brothers but not before lagula had sired nonari the gross ferenczy whose left hand was like a club with all the fingers fused into one and so the bloodwars went on year in year out for decades until starside was drenched in blood but in the end the only real victor was neither doglord ferenczy drakul nor any common lord no it was shaitan the unborn first of them all who had the wit to pick them off one by one when they were weakened by the fighting then when it was over shaitan banished them through the gate for their troubles thus radu came into this world and his most hated enemies with him especially nonari the gross they could have settled it then but they were strangers in our world with troubles enough so they went their own ways radu adventuring in the world and nonari doing whatever he did but nonari had sworn vengeance on radu his kith kin and spawn for all time to come for the deaths of lagula his father and rakhi his uncle the impassioned vow of a lord of the wamphyri which might even outlast eternity and down all the years and centuries radu stayed alert and kept an ear cocked at all times for word of nonari ferenczy he heard certain things for instance how one onarius ferengus the roman governor of a small province on the black sea had died in the year of thereabouts at the hands of unknown barbarians that was when radu had been a vandal before they turned on him and drove him out of italy but he had also heard how this onarius had a son in the mountains north of moldavia in a place called the khorvaty and this sons name was belos pheropzis down the years as time and his travels allowed radu made inquiry but learned little a hundred years later when he was a voevod in the eastern carpathians he even tried to discover the whereabouts of this castle of belos pheropzis events intervened his duties called him away the search must wait centuries later he did come across the castle in the khorvaty but found it deserted and falling into ruin fortunately the people of the region kept records and they remembered belos pheropzis had been a great and terrible boyar and his mountain retreat secret and nearinaccessible as radu had discovered he too had a son called waldemar ferrenzig and a daughter who never ventured out from the castle it was rumoured that belos slept with her a not uncommon practice among the wamphyri belos had finally come to grief fending off a party ofbulgar raiders his castle was saved but he lost his life surviving bulgars likewise expired in necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley an avalanche brought about by waldemar and thereafter waldemar slept with his sister there were two sons but one of them might have been waldemar s eggson who knows wamphyri bloodlines are intricate as their histories are complex even what ive told you so far is hearsay and unproven but at least one must have been a bloodson by waldemar most likely out of his sister well brother murdered brother in an argument and the survivor inherited the castle from waldemar but as to what became of waldemar himself again i am at a loss the brother who inherited the khorvaty castle was called faethor and he reverted to the original family name faethor ferenczy bj paused as harrys body spasmed in an apparently involuntary jerk it felt like the kick of a recumbent man in the moment before he falls asleep which will often wake him up again except harrys sleep was a state of deep hypnosis and his reaction outside of bjs previous experience are you cold kneeling over him bj stirred blackened cinders to life and placed kindling and a small log where the embers were still hot by which time harry had settled down again and she could continue faethor was a strange one he would stay at home in his castle for decades at a time but always in the end the blood would draw him out and off hed go adventuring in a wartorn world in the two hundred years preceding the fourth crusade he used a great many pseudonyms he was for instance stefan ferrenzig then peter karl and grigor he became his own son time and time again for he knew that a man may not be seen to live too long among common men and certainly not for centuries at various times he was a crusader an uighur warrior a warlord under temujin then a general under genghiss grandson batu as fereng the black son of the fereng under hulegu he played apart in the extermination of the assassins and he was there at the fall of baghdad in why the doglord has even reasoned it out that it was this faethor who fought on the side of the mongols and karl drakul at the battle ofain jalut ah but what a pity that radu killed karl and missed him this damned ferenczy and so yet again we see how the histories of the wamphyri are complex but let me get on faethor had two sons that radu heard of in his time though he never came up against them they were thibor faethors eggson a fierce wattach who was a voevod for the rulers of both russian and his native land and janos a bloodson out of gypsy stock the last my master heard of thibor was in the late s shortly before the plague drove him to seek refuge in the resin at that time thibor was a voevod in romania in the last two hundred years however certainly in the last hundred excluding the war years it has been easier to travel in europe on behalf of my master radu ive done some research abroad and believe i know something of thibor as stated thibor was a voevod for a long line of wallachian princes the mirceas vlad tepes radu the handsome but no relation to my radu be sure and finally mircea the monk who seems to have been sore afraid of him too afraid to let him live perhaps at any rate that is where thibors trail ends as a warlord in the service of mircea the monk and then there was janos ferenczy who first made himself known as a young man in the early part of the th century he was a thief a pirate a corsair on the broad bosom of the mediterranean during the christianmoslem conflicts of the crusades he was one of the petty princelings looting them who had looted others he had a castle in the zarundului heights his father faethor spent many years there too to which he would return periodically and there is evidence to suggest he was a necromancer for which there might be a simple explanation as faethors bloodson janos could use this necromancy to enhance or supplement his meagre wamphyri powers which are frequently weaker in blood than in eggsons or daughters not that it could have done him much good he seems to have disappeared at the end of the th century about the same time as thibor so its my conclusion that faethor thibor and janos are all dead and gone my master isnt so sure he tells me the wamphyri have a habit of turning up in the strangest places at the most inconsiderate times and hes certain that ferenczys more than one and at least one drakul this dd of course survive to this day but now there are more complications and were obliged to go back back all the way bach to waldemar ferrenzig waldemar was a lusty one and fertile and his sister wasnt the only one he slept with there were records in a museum in olden moldavia that i read all of sixty years ago alas when i went back recently the museum was no more what theyd missed in world war i they hit in world war ii and the museum was a bumedout ruin but i remember what i read originally that before svyatoslav in kiev there was a boyar like a prince who was banished out of the city west to the farthest corners of the land who built a great house under the mountains on the border of moldavia the khorvaty his name was valdemar fuhrenzig but i can only believe he was waldemar as to why he was sent out of kiev well he was wamphyri those were viking days and the varyagi were establishing their trade routes to the greeks along kievan russias eastern rivers well despite that waldemar was banished from the land he liked to go into the woods necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley for days on end hunting boar in the great forests that sprawled west of the river bug and one day he came across a varyagi encampment normally there would be no trouble oh they were fierce men these vikings but they were traders too and the ferenczy had a party of retainers his thralls along with him but this time it was different the vikings were heading north for the baltic and home and they had a beautiful woman with them stolen out of some port on the black sea so far she had suffered no harm they would sell her back home to be some prince or kings ravenhaired darkeyed wife she implored waldemars help as a gentleman obviously he was a boyar for he had his men with him his dogs his hawks but the ferenczys men were thralls his dogs were wolves and his hawks as bloodthirsty as he himself well there was no more of the story in the old moldavian museum but at least i was able to ascertain this ladys name she was a sicilian princess or at least of royal blood alas she was also illegitimate with no actual claim to the region from which she took her name constanza de petralia and petralia is a village or town in sicilys le madonie it was worth a trip to sicily i spoke to several historians the code of silence is extensive but finally i was able to consult certain records constanza de petralia had returned to sicily in no sooner was she home than she gave birth to twin boys one of which was hideously deformed and destroyed at birth the surviving child was named of all things angela far more important on coming of age he changed his surname to ferenczini his mother came into property money she was overindulgent with her son who was muchtravelled corsica italy romania and moldavia but there the trail peters out and to my knowledge there are no more ferenczinis today as for ferenczy its a common name in all regions throughout and bordering the carpathians but the real ferenczys are still out there somewhere bj was finished with that part of it harry now knew as much as she knew in fact the necroscope knew a great deal more so much more that he could easily have told bj what had become of faethor and thibor ferenczy except it wouldnt be easy couldnt even be dragged out of him if it also meant compromising his talents but in any case she didnt ask for that was something she would never have suspected in a million years why should she bj was tired now it had taken a massive effort of will to maintain her wolfshape and the energy of her scarlet wamphyri eyes but she had needed to be sure that the knowledge she imparted would sink in stay there and not get misrepresented for he was a strange one this harry keogh and bj couldnt afford any more episodes or mistakes like the telephone farce and on that subject after she had relaxed a fraction and flowed back into human form harry about your telephone why change the number what was that all about he stared unblinking into her eyes feral now in the dark blot of her head where it was silhouetted against the glowing halo of his readinglamp across the room i was scared of it he croaked from a bonedry throat she said salivate moisten your throat feel well and talk normally but remain asleep and hear and obey of course he answered after a moment when the knob of his throat had stopped bobbing but why were you frightened of the phone he shrugged but he could guess bad dreams maybe i dont want to hear anything bad about brenda and the baby bj could understand and accept that but it couldnt be allowed to go on she must have contact with him get an answering machine she said if you start to hear something that you dont like you can switch it off or you can monitor your calls and simply cut them off as and when it suits you good harry nodded but of course you wont switch off when its me on the line because our little rule still applies youll hear is that mah wee man harry cut in talking normally and youll see the moon your eyes and a wolfs head in silhouette yes radus head he nodded indeed bj was pleased but now we really must talk about this search of yours for brenda and the baby i mean but that wasnt what she meant at all in fact she didnt even want him to find them he needed a new direction that was all to which his search would be peripheral his conscious purpose would seem the same to him but subconsciously also youre not as fit as you should be we have to get you in shape ive been intending to harry answered and i have a sneaking suspicion that youve been having a hard time of it with alcohol a frown at once etched itself deep into harrys forehead alcohol well not so much booze in general as that damned red wine of yours it seemed to have something for me something for you bj shook her head not any more harry as brian lumley manse and monastery aeries of now its something you can do without from this moment on you dont need it indeed the very thought of it is enough to make you feel sick is that understood oh yes harry breathed his relief but a moment later his face turned pale his stomach lurched and he belched its okay now put it out of your mind and youll be just fine she had to smile as he sighed and snuggled closer to her warmth her safety and after weve talked over these other things your search and whatall then well be able to get some sleep afterwards yes said harry and she felt the need building in him beginning to swell against her thigh she might have laughed in surprise delight whatever but knew it would only sap her concentration and with him she needed all the concentration she could muster with him yes with this ohsomysterious harry keogh part five i bonniejean birthday party harry getting in shape and funding his search in the morning bj was up first it was a few minutes after six and the light still burgeoning from the east in the garden the birds had been twittering for some time enough noise to wake the necroscope up albeit gradually he came awake knowing that it was going to be hell again and was pleasantly surprised or more properly relieved beyond measure to find that it wasnt no headache no fluff in his head where his brains used to be no sore throat and no great urge to drink anything except maybe a mug or two of black coffee at which he remembered that both his pantry and fridge were empty bj was upstairs he could hear the shower he dressed quickly made a mobius jump into town the local newsagents which doubled as a grocerycumpost office and just three or four minutes later was unloading stuff into the fridge which as bj came down and found him in the kitchen looked like he was taking stuff out of the fridge to prepare breakfast you have a wash brush your hair clean your teeth and whatever while i do it she said yes ma he cocked his head on one side raised an eyebrow asked any other instructions oh youre okay she laughed but in bed youre a ten so why lower your average when youre up and eyeing his groceries funny last night when i was getting supper i didnt think you had anything in you didnt look in the freezer compartment he mumbled waved his arms the cupboards she shrugged til manage something and as he headed upstairs and buy a new toothbrush that one tastes awful make yourself at home he thought but he knew he should feel pleased so why didnt he maybe because he his place had been invaded this had been a private place he and it could be as they were brian lumley here now he had to be someone else and there it was again the reminder that he was someone else and it was possible he even felt guilty too but why he couldnt honestly say for after all he wasnt the heavy in the piece it was brenda who had left him breakfast was good very and for the first time in godonlyknows how long with most of his guilty feelings and doubts melted away the necroscope actually felt good but then as the sky turned a lighter shade of grey and bj made ready to leave him he didnt for with her out of the way hed be back to thinking in everdecreasing circles again and doing nothing much else or perhaps not for in fact it seemed he did have a few things to do now they were there in the back of his mind anyway probably headedoff down the diversion that was bj but he knew that if he concentrated hed get back on track again til call one of my girls bj said breaking into his thoughts sandra ill catch her before she sets out for work she lives not too far away sure if you like harry told her which satisfied her that this really was his place and not some kind of safe house for the people he had used to work for if it had been surely he wouldnt want too many people to know about it but no he fitted in here the house had harry keogh written all over it or i can take a taxi whichever suits you he shrugged til call one if you like whatever is best for you just dont forget where i live right and to bj s mind that settled it not just a onenight stand then waiting for his answer she dialled a number and spoke briefly to someone at the other end of the line then put the phone down and turned to him looking down in the mouth again harry was standing close to her i suppose it should be he said a onenight stand i mean or rather it shouldnt have been shouldnt have happened at all but it did and frankly im im upside down messed up thats the truth of it im messed up she nodded well perhaps i am too but id better tell you now harry keogh i cant see myself as part of an eternal triangle thing in the role of the other woman its not my scene and it certainly isnt my style harry shook his head this wasnt a cheap thing not for me its just that i dont know how i feel i did a moment ago but now i dont as for brenda and my son this search is something i have to do even though i know i wont find her oh i might find them but i wont find her brenda doesnt know me any more neither do i scarcely but time is on our side harry said necroscope the lost years vol i she looked surprised time what from what was possibly a onenight stand to a longterm relationship all in one quick move i told you i was messed up bj almost felt sorry for him she knew why he was messed up something of it anyway and leaning forward giving him a brief brushing kiss lets wait and see how it all works out okay he nodded and said nothing and they waited for her girl to come bj hadnt been gone ten minutes before harry made a jump and bought himself a telephone answering machine and a bicycle to be delivered the first so that he could monitor calls and the second so that he could get himself in shape himself yes for hed finally decided this was him now and hed have to accept it and it couldnt really be that bad after all because bj for one had accepted him with a vengeance it was only after the bike had arrived that he realized he could have ridden it home along the mobius route why not he could easily have pedalled down a back street through a door and so home he knew the coordinates of the service road and the road across the river it would have been the easiest way he wouldnt have had to pay for the delivery either next up on his search itinerary was northern ireland he would give himself a week or so here at the house settling in and adjusting to a new regime make a list of places to visit then go and do it and he wouldnt any longer be alone not while he was at home anyway bj would be here he just knew she would come to him or he could go to her he couldnt say how it would work out didnt even want to think about it it was just the way it was the day had cleared up the sun was peeping through tufts of fluffy cloud next thing you know itll be spring harry thought and time for springcleaning had bj mentioned that springcleaning he thought she probably had told him the house could use a little dusting polishing scrubbing but couldnt think when or had it been sparked by the shame hed felt when she first walked in and saw the place but if it was her then shed been wrong the house could use a hell of a lot of dusting polishing and scrubbing his study wasnt even a room yet it was a jumble so why not start now a little hard labour would pass for getting himself in shape wouldnt it but first he had something really important to do a mind to put at rest down on the river bank harry was wrapped warmly for once but more importantly he felt warm on the inside too and his ma felt the difference in him as soon as she heard him in her mind tve been bad necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley ma he told her but she could feel the grin on his face one that slipped a little as she answered in how many ways son er i meant about the doctor i didnt go to see one like i promised but listen whatever the trouble was its gone no more drinking couldnt face it he shook his head the very thoughts enough to make me want to throw up it was the last ofmrkyle then which youve finally kicked out youve rejected what little was left of him to make room for you i can feel that youve more or less settled down with yourself son at least i think so i hope im right i feel a lot better all round yes he said but even now couldnt be sure maybe she sensed that too even as an expert at talking to the dead the expert the necroscope harry knew how hard it was to fool his ma and kyles talent this precognition thing not for a while now harry answered but that could be my loss i didnt understand it but it might have given me a few pointers anyway the main thing is i feel good and im determined to get myself back in shape ive bought myself a bicycle for exercise lots of it and when im finished talking to you im going to tear the house apart he sounded really enthusiastic if a bit jumbled youll what tear the house apart with a bicycle now she sounded more than a little alarmed i mean ill rip the place apart dust polish scrub it can use it springcleaning ma yes she said after a moment and thoughtfully why i do believe i can smell it springtime when a young mans thoughts turn to to springcleaning harry stopped her among other things his ma said but very quietly it was harrys cue to leave til let you know how i get on he said turning away from the river but you started this conversation by telling me youd been bad harry she wasnt about to let him go and i asked you in how many ways harry guarded his thoughts i meant two things ma about not seeing a doctor and about being neglectful of me of course not ofbrenda ma and now he was doubly cautious defensive you havent mentioned her once harry ma he was momentarily lost for words i feel like were drifting drifting apart he nodded i mean its not just that brenda is lost she lost herself after all she or the baby wanted to get lost or they wanted to lose me but it goes deeper than that its that were strangers now he sensed her understanding or at least that she was trying to understand and in a little while she said well lets not you and go the same way all right i mean theres nothing you cant tell me harry were too close for that i was there at the start of you and youre here at the end of me im not some kind of ogre that you have to hide from now ami she had sensed that his guard was up and it saddened her but from harrys point of view there was no help for it there are some things you dont tell anyone and especially not your ma once he got started on the house there was no stopping him he wanted it in order before he saw bj again two days went by three a few more and thered be a full moon what that had to do with things harry couldnt say but he knew that he must speak to must see bj again and soon finally he couldnt fight it any longer right or wrong he wanted her in his bed again maybe even in his life damn she was in his life he called her at the wine bar got one of her girls who told him that bj wasnt available right now then would she please tell bj that hed called of course would he be around if bj called back later yes he would and it didnt matter how much later and that night dozing on the couch in what really was his study now he felt the light of the full moon flooding through the patio windows into the room and wondered why it felt like bjs eyes on him but she was busy right how she had a life of her own and he had to understand that maybe she would call him later god he hoped so bj was busy or was about to be it had been a sixmonth and her needs and that of her girls must be attended to discretion was the name of the game it was like fishing or hunting for that matter or better still poaching make too much noise and youd scare away the game and perhaps attract unwanted attention use the wrong lure and the fish wouldnt bite or the game would ignore the trap tonight zahanine was the lure she was black and she was beautiful and she was one of bonnie jeans a moonchild and hungry as the rest of them oh she ate and she drank the same as anyone else except it wasnt the same it was zahanines night off that was what she told big jimmy lee when he walked into the lounge of the fiddlers elbow down the brian lumley road from bjs the place was almost empty with her round perfect backside seated on a bar stool and her long legs crossed and swaying to a juke box tune zahanine stood out like a sore thumb or a green light big jimmy bought himself a drink hesitated a moment and bought another for the girl before eyeing her up and down in an openly suggestive pigeyed fashion and saving but ahm surprised yere still on speakin terms wi such as me since yere boss that bleddy bonnie jean kicked me oota there big jimmy she said her voice as soft as her dark skin and seductive as her dark eyes you were out of order and well you know it you used threatening behaviour against a customer disturbed the other members and wrecked a table now tell me how is bj supposed to run a decent bar with all that stuff going on until that night you were a valued customer shes said so herself bj oh really he looked doubtful zahanine nodded shes looked for you coming back even had a new members card made out with your name on it but bj isnt the sort to beg if you want in again its up to you no more trouble though or the next times final a new card ive seen it myself she told him then fell silent as the barman headed their way picking up empty glasses but when he went into a back room you should drop by ye think so i know so and tonight would be a good time what but does she no close up around now zahanine glanced at her watch half an hour yes thats when you should come after ive had a chance to speak to her big jimmy frowned come again ahm no wi ye party time she explained after hours staff only just bj and the girls and maybe you too if you think you can mend your ways one of the girls is having a birthday why else would i be here on my night off free drinks jimmy not something that happens every day im on my way in a minute or two so what do you say should i tell bj youll be dropping by standing up she leaned forward and put her index finger in the cleft of his chin frankly ive missed you too he was genuinely taken aback but ah ah didnae ken ye cared maybe youve been chatting up the wrong girls she said and headed for the door thanks for the drink ye speak to her big jimmy called after her zahanine turned back stepped closer but remember she whispered this is a private party youve been quite enough trouble already so dont go blabbing it all over edinburgh or bj lose her licence for sure big jimmy nodded no a word he promised necroscope the lost years vol i then wait half an hour and come on along just give the usual ring and ill let you in yere sure itll be okay positive but well be late finishing maybe youd be a gentleman and see me home afterwards he grinned oh ahm no so sure aboot the gentleman bit but ah can see ye home definitely his voice was now rougher than ever with anticipation she smiled knowingly and left and he watched her out of the door and saw her distorted shadow pass by the smallpaned smokedglass windows but the memory of zahanines deliciously wriggling backside stayed with him for the next half hour until he pressed the bell outside bj s and fidgeted under the dark archway until the door was opened zahanine was there and one of the other girls they took his coat and would have led him inside at once but bj stepped from behind the door to caution him yere privileged jimmy dont mess it up now oh no fear mah bonnie lass he told her but ye know yere drinkin after hours and shouldnae be here if i let ye in its on yere own head of yere own free will what why all the polis in edinburgh couldnae keep me away he declared and smiling bj took his arm and marched him down the corridor all four girls were in the bar five if jimmy included zahanine apart from her they all wore their black stockings short flouncy dresses high heels blouses that were open way too far in front and snowed lots of flesh at the back owing a lot to playboy attire all they were missing were the fluffy bunny tails and ears and they were obviously in party mood poppers went off left right and centre as big jimmy lee appeared with bj and party he was covered in paper streamers slapped on the back made welcome as a prodigal son told good to have ye back big jimmy by all and sundry damn but ahm fair knocked out he declared the only thing thas missin seems tae be the fatted calf later jimmy bj told him well eat later but for now theres the drinks wines yere tipple is it no wine whisky whatever he said as she directed him to a stool at the bar and zahanine perched herself alongside her swinging leg stroking his thigh damn me he said but ahd swear this was all for me bj poured red wine which he swigged back almost without tasting it and the party got underway the girls took turns to flank him rubbing themselves against him all brian lumley necmscope the lost years vol i tits and smiling teeth and temptation and big jimmy had never resisted temptation it was wonderful he was the only man here and though hed heard of parties like this hed never imagined hed be the centrepiece at just such a one a gaggle of stacked women all bent on plying pleasing and plundering him of his vital fluids the lights were low the juke box played some old bluesy stuff and the girls seemed more gorgeous with every taste of bjs red wine as for bonnie jean herself she disappeared momentarily jimmy scarcely noticed he was having a hard time loosening the last button on one of the girls blouses but finally succeeded and gawped as her ample breasts lolled free and available he would have availed himself too except bj was back and dressed in a flimsy seethrough babydoll nightie by now big jimmy was certainsure what kind of party this was and despite that the room spun a little when he moved too fast and that the bar stool seemed to sway under his backside so that he must constantly maintain his balance his blood was pounding as he dazedly wondered which of the girls would want him first as it happened they all did so bj said standing a little apart from him along the bar was it worth coming back to us jimmy ah wouldnae missed it for the world he tried to answer but all of his words came out sideways he tried staring at bj tried to focus on her breasts the dark v of her pubic region under the gauzy nightgown but his gaze kept sliding off first to one side then the other behind the bar zahanine poured him the largest measure of whisky hed ever seen said this will straighten you up big jimmy its more what youre used to right he said and actually managed to grasp the glass and tilt its contents down his throat as zahanine refilled it two of the other girls wheeled a long trolley up behind jimmy positioning it precisely to his rear head lolling he glanced around and took in the scene as bj and the girls stood chairs around the trolley three to a side decked with a tablecloth the trolley was quite empty obviously theyd be bringing food and a birthday cake out from the kitchen obviously yes whose fffuckin birthday is it anyway big jimmy slurred tilting more whisky down his throat but this time as he went to put the glass down he missed the bar and sent the glass crashing to the floor it pulled him together momentarily long enough to look from face to face stupidly as he waited for an answer and eventually bj said birthday why its yours jimmy aye big jimmy rocked on his stool and tilted it back a little way but just a little too far thas a goodyin that is he roared mine by fuck and he teetered there except its not exactly a birthday bj said and her voice was quite different now as she touched his shoulder to apply the very slightest pressure losing his balance and toppling over backwards he scarcely knew he was falling several pairs of hands took his weight lowering him on to the top of the trolley or rather to the hardwood draining board for one of the girls had whipped away the cover there are two big days in a mans life jimmy bj said where she stood looking down into his quivering face ones at the beginning and the others at the end well youve had the one and this is the other wha he said whazzat as the girls strapped him down hands and feet and eh eh he queried as they used knives as sharp as scalpels to cut away his clothing and however ridiculously big jimmy was still grinning for this could only be some kind of weird sex game or an even weirder dream as someone turned the lights down more yet and bj s eyes and the eyes of her girls became yellow triangles in the gloom then there was more yellow the glitter of golden instruments as bj passed around slender tubes with trumpetlike mouthpieces similar to the funnels shed used in radu lykans redoubt except the feeders had been for the giving and these smaller versions were for the taking big jimmy only noticed them in passing however because he wasnt able to take his eyes off bj herself bonnie jean who might just as well be naked for all her nightgown hid standing there in the gloom with her yellow eyes no her scarlet eyes now burning into jimmys soul all feeling had fled him jimmy was as drunk or as poisoned as any man had ever been and remained conscious oh he had a powerful constitution but not powerful enough he could still hear see think but he couldnt have moved a muscle couldnt speak any more didnt understand that the crimson pounding in his skull his heart and his veins wasnt sexual potency but an effect of the drugged wine and the ceiling was revolving first this way then that and the faces of the girls looking down on him were foxy wolfish lustful and bj herself wasnt bonnie jean what she was exactly jimmy couldnt have said but as the nightgown slid from her slender furry form and her soft dark muzzle wrinkled back in a halfsnarl halfsmile he thought what a bitch which was perhaps as close as he would ever come to the truth of it or to anything ever again when the siphons sank in jimmy barely felt them he felt the warmth leaving him and the cold seeping in and a tide as dark and darker than the deepest ocean floor rolling over him washing him to and fro and gradually dissolving him all away but that was all brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i at in the morning bonnie jean got harry out of bed to answer the door sandra had dropped her off there had been an afterhours birthday party for one of the girls bj was sorry but she hadnt been able to get out of it anyway here she was or if it was too late too late harry told her she must be joking made her a coffee in the kitchen while she watched had a hard time keeping his hands off her but managed it somehow and he even made small talk until she asked him cant we talk in bed then he almost had her on the kitchen table and she was equally wanton on the stairs until finally in the bedroom getting her out of her clothes was a frenzied affair for both of them afterwards harry lit one of his very rare cigarettes and eventually bj said dont think me vulgar please but that was a fuck that wasnt just making love and replete in every way replete she was asleep before he could think her vulgar or think anything else of her before sleeping himself he touched her body all over but very gently so that she wouldnt know maybe it was to reassure himself that she was there but it felt like he was making sure that she was she what that was all about he couldnt say in his bed she smelled of woman and warm flesh and sex and something else her breath copper salt or was it just the sex hah just the sex but shed been like an animal vibrant writhing crushing him in her coils he had found himself thinking on several occasions that she would draw blood with her nails or her teeth but she hadnt he believed hed actually felt her holding back he knew there had been a repressed violence in her which had inspired the same sort of frenzy in him but now now despite that he felt exhausted it was hard to get to sleep something was bothering him finally harry realized what it was the light of the full moon pouring its rays in through his bedroom window so he got up and drew the faded curtains life became a blur space time places faces harry couldnt say where they came from or where they went he even began to forget where hed been would have forgotten he was sure but for the list he kept of the places hed visited spring turned to summer the seasons were turning and harry frequently felt that his mind was turning too from sanity to fullfledged madness yet when he was with bj he knew he was sane indeed those were the only times when he did know it upon a time hed had difficulty accepting his body he had felt that when it was hurt despite that it had hurt that it really didnt matter because it wasnt his body anyway but those times were past now that had a lot to do with bj too the fact that she had accepted him shed become his anchor on an increasingly ephemeral world shed anchored his body anyway but his mind was something else frequently he would wake up furious frightened unable to remember the nightmare that had awakened him but thinking someone is fucking with my mind and promising himself that when he found out who it was then thered be hell to pay but as the waking world took over so the anger would recede yet the feeling persisted that while his body was very definitely his now his mind was someone elses his memory for one thing or memories recent memories anyway was or were totally up the creek sometime around the middle of may hed mentioned it to bonnie jean when they stayed late in bed at his place one sunday morning do you remember when i did ireland and he had felt her drowsy attention sharpening rapidly centering on him yes youve not long since finished what of it well i dont i dont remember it she had slipped out of bed in a moment gone to a dresser returned with his notebook and opened it at the relevant pages his irish itinerary and shed read from a list of places in his handwriting starting at belfast and working down the coast to dundalk before he stopped her thats right thats right he was excited frustrated downpatrick and newry and kilkeel and halfadozen more you think i dont remember his jaw was tight where he scowled at her almost accusingly she sat beside him looked down on him curiously with her head cocked on one side and said logically but didnt you just say that you dont remember and she was right it was a contradiction a confusion a confounded nonsense he had shook his head flapped his hands said green fields emerald green in fact greener than england irish accents top o the mornin to yeh sor little pubs with ocean outlooks and peat fires shillelaghies and all that shit picture book stuff toss in a pixie or two and harry shed stopped him what is all this and the look on her face had said it all that it wasnt rational talk and hardly reasonable behaviour that he should take this out whatever it was on her after that they hadnt seen each other for a week or more finally hed called her and apologized for his irrational accusations which had been directed at the world in general never at bonnie jean she had seemed uncertain and hed said he would come and see her at bjs she had stalled him and come to him instead for which he was grateful for she really had become his one anchor on the world brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i no for there was one other of course but harry hardly dared speak to his ma any more and he knew that she wasnt likely to sneak up on him at an awkward moment she knew he liked his privacy and would wait until he came to her to the riverbank he hoped so anyway but a new idea had occurred to harry and he felt stupid that he hadnt thought of it earlier hed been relying on his own skills and the extraordinary talents at ebranch to turn up something on brenda and the baby but wasnt that exactly what the missing pair would expect harry jr was a power in his own right and would know how to avoid that sort of detection and he could move his mother at will any time he wanted to as to providing for her or for both of them well who could say what he was or wasnt capable of he would provide for his ma what she couldnt provide for herself and vice versa so they would naturally expect the very sort of approach that harry was employing the esoteric the gadgets the ghosts of ebranch but what about a more mundane approach every major town and city in the yellow pages of the whole wide world certainly the western world listed scores of detective agencies and here was harry keogh necroscope trying to cover all of that ground himself which he could do of course given an eternity of time stupid and if he should ever be lucky enough to get close and they spotted him then the whole wildgoose chase would have to start all over again but to have fifty detective agencies all on the job at the same time in fifty different places would cost a hell of a lot of money and harrys funds went only so far his funds yes but there were others who could well afford it according to darcy clarke anyway by the middle of june harry had set up the mechanisms for putting his battalions of detectives in their regiments of agencies in england france germany and the usa to work all he needed was the funding at least three and a half million pounds sterling or the equivalent in whatever currency was available to guarantee he could bankroll the tiling for just the first three months of its operation meanwhile darcy clarke had put him in contact with a swiss bank used by ebranch and harry had made a ridiculously small deposit a few hundred pounds out of his remaining few thousands to open a numbered account now he could get on with the more serious stuff so he thought but bonnie jean mirlu had other plans she had decided it was time that harry went into training in earnest real training for a man in his early thirties she of course worked on the not unnatural presumption that his body was his own that his mind and body were the same age harry hadnt been in the best possible shape concern over his wife and child might explain some of that and long idle periods between jobs would account for the rest the fact that hed done little or nothing in his field since his people ditched him but when he was working well she had evidence of his general efficiency the way hed been able to handle that situation in london the episode with big jimmy who would never be a problem to anyone ever again the fact that he had been able to enter secured guarded premises her premises find what he sought and get out again without being detected it said a lot for his skill in every department and even bj who had known a good many men in her vastly extended time had to admit that he was good in other departments too so good indeed that she considered herself genuinely fond of him or as fond as she could be of someone with his strictly limited future potential but the thought of actually sending him out into the world into radus world of hideous dangers such as he could never imagine except as she had told him about it was a matter of some concern not so much for harry as for herself and her master not that he could talk about them he didnt even know about them not consciously but anyone who cared to backtrack harry keoghs recent activities was bound to come across bj somewhere along the line and possibly in the course of things radu lykan on that front the secret watcher was problem enough without any further complications also bj hadnt yet quite satisfied herself that harry was all he appeared to be or something more she had reasoned that he wasnt in thrall to any other or if he was then it was beyond her power to detect radu however would soon sniff out whatever she might have missed nor was she convinced that his previous employers were quite done with him or with her what if she was being watched through harry without his consent or knowledge with that in mind she had ordered him not to scrub messages on his answering machine which so far were few and far between and then shed monitored them for coded or in any way cryptic content but so far nothing as for ebranch itself well hed said it was an esoteric organization one of the secret services and so it appeared shed been unable to discover anything at all not a single reference or clue to any such authority and despite that harry was completely in bjs thrall beguiled at the snap of her fingers or the utterance of a simple phrase mah wee man still he refused to divulge anything more than hed already told her he would simply tense up sweat tremble and offer no further information if theyd brainwashed all of their operatives the same way it was hardly surprising that this ebranch remained secret brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i but there again the doglord radu had his own methods if there was something her master should know be sure he would get to know it except of course she must first get harry into the lair he must somehow be made to climb into the unexplored heights of the cairngorms along with bj which was why shed needed him fit and why she must now train him in early july harry woke up one morning to find bj gone from his bed it was a wednesday shed recently been a little neglectful of work in the wine bar he found her note in the kitchen where shed thoughtfully laid out the makings of his breakfast harry what with your homemaintenance drive your cycling and all your fitmaking activities you are almost a new man i want you to give serious thought to what we talked about that holiday in the highlands it will be different something for me really but something i would like to share with you surely you can afford a few days before you start searching again after all i dont know that if youre successful it wont be the end of us do i all love bj the conversation she mentioned sprang immediately to mind though he couldnt remember where or when they had had it a holiday yes in the highlands bj liked to hunt climb live off the land healthy exercise for body and mind both and she had suggested that he might like to go with her live rough for a long weekend make love under the moon and stars especially the moon or was that last one of harrys inspirations it inspired him to go anyway thus it was his decision to go if only to please her so he thought the wamphyri have long believed that wherever possible the destiny of men should be in their own hands that whatever they enter into it should be of their own free will but no harm on occasion to offer a little encouragement along the way later he rang her and they set a date a month from now in august meanwhile theyd practise at least once a week in some good spots in the trossachs just a few hours out of edinburgh bj knew a lot of good rock climbs that would be ideal for an enthusiastic amateur well maybe so but the necroscope didnt intend to be that much of an amateur also shed only asked him to put off his search for a while which to his mind didnt include his planned operation to fund that search and in any case it was something that would only take a day or two depending on circumstances yet to be encountered in sicily since he was seeing her only once or twice in any week it was something he could fit in in between dates as for his preparations they were simplicity itself the necroscope made a jump to an army ordnance depot in the south of england entered in the dead of night via the mobius continuum and equipped himself with a lot of devastating weaponry he could have gone to darcy clarke for his supplies but wanted to avoid implicating ebranch in anything he did this wasnt simply because darcy had asked him to but mainly because hed quit the branch and couldnt afford any more favours hed managed to keep himself out of debt so far and liked it that way even if they found brenda for him they would only be balancing the books on what he had done for them the necroscope was scrupulously fairminded at the ammo depot he knew the squad on duty would catch hell theyd be in it up to their necks so before getting out with his heavyduty loot he deliberately tripped an alarm let the mod and military police try to figure out how it had been done thats what they were paid for doubtless theyd blame the ira next he obtained a recent map of sicily and more especially of the mountainous madonie then the next right riding the mobius continuum to the mediterranean in a series of cautious exploratory jumps he checked flight etas at the sleepy airport in catania and synchronized his watch to local time finally he used the toilets in the reception area secured his stalls door on the inside made doubly sure of his coordinates and returned home and when hed very carefully packed his suitcase then he was ready an hour later at that same night he phoned bj to tell her hed be away for a day or two looking for brenda she seemed anxious maybe even suspicious no other things business i didnt know you had any business not any more this is financial i have to move my bank accounts sort things out in general ive got nothing fixed up locally its your fault in a way youve occupied my free time not to mention my thoughts im doing some important personal administration thats all stuff ive let slip but it doesnt interfere with anything and im not due to see you until saturday there was a long pause until bj very softly said are you sure that it wont interfere with anything and before he could answer even as he framed words to answer now listen to me mah of course im sure he cut her off and was surprised to find brian lumley himself perspiring bj its thursday night ill be back tomorrow night or saturday morning at the latest and after another pause very well but remember harry were climbing this weekend i wouldnt miss it for the world he told her after that briefly harry gave thought to what he was doing something puzzled him and he couldnt figure out what it was eventually it came to him there had been a time when he would have simply used the mobius continuum to jump straight into palermo now it seemed hed developed a real need for his little subterfuges the secrecy this esoteric camouflage for his metaphysical talents but that was ridiculous of course he needed to keep his skills secret obviously he did but to this extent it was odd he was more concerned now about someone discovering his talents than ever before in his life but why now in a time of relative safety safety scarcely that considering what he had in mind but if there was an answer to all of this it was going to have to wait his course was set his plans made for the next few days at least it was in edinburgh in sicily harry made an international call to the airport at catania to check the sitrep on the incoming flight from athens it was descending starting its approach run he allowed it fortyfive minutes to land and commence discharging its passengers toward customs then took the mobius route directly to the stall hed booked in the mens toilets two or three minutes later he was queuing to change pounds into lira at the cambio then walking out of the airport reception area into the sicilian night with a handful of rather more mundane travellers now he was just another tourist with a heavy suitcase heavy for its size anyway daham drakesh le manse madonie dead silence the necroscope took a taxi to paterno paid for a room at the hotel adrano two nights in advance and by was taking a shower before retiring with a little luck the fan above his bed would keep him cool in the seventyplus degrees of heat hot in sicily yes but some four and a half thousand miles away on the roof of the world it was anything but hot indeed on tibets tingri plateau at am the temperature hovered just one degree above freezing but the sun was bright where its burgeoning golden blister threatened to burst on the eastern horizon and major chang lun was comfortable enough in his winterwarfare uniform furlined boots and hooded jacket he and his corporal driver had set out from the barracks at xigaze ninety minutes earlier because they knew they had to reach drakesh monastery within an hour or so of the sun clearing the horizon any later and theyd be denied entry no one was allowed to enter the monastery at drakesh in full daylight daylight was for contemplation worship darkness was for mundane man in his wickedness the taking of food the thinking of mundane thoughts the maintenance of the body as opposed to the soul the major must consider himself fortunate indeed that the high priest of the sect the enigmatic daham drakesh had seen fit to grant him audience during daylight hours such would be the opinion of outsiders anyway hah well major chang lun knew differently powerful as this monkish creature was in his own spheres the socalled peoples army of communist china was more powerful yet but chang lun was under orders and must play drakeshs game the majors vehicle was a twoseater halftrack a snowcat equipped for the plateaus uneven terrain his driver parked it in the lee of boulders close to steps leading up to the monasterys foreboding entrance covered it with a tarpaulin finally came erect and saluted necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley chang lun nodded his curt approval turned and bowed from the waist to the string of redrobed priests where they stood stock still arms folded patiently waiting there were six of them they indicated that the major and his driver should take their places centrally in the line and with three priests leading and three bringing up the rear the string set out at what was to the chinese soldiers an awkward unmilitary shuffle climbing the steps singlefile to the yawning stone mouth that formed the entrance to the monastery the leading priest held his left arm tucked into his waist at the elbow with the forearm held stiffly out in front his jogging motion caused tiny golden bells to chime where they were stitched into the seam of his robes extended sleeve and so into the drakesh monastery as they entered chang lun looked back in the middle distance glowing yellow where glancing rays of sunlight struck through the shade in the lee of ragged mountains a nameless city stood gaunt and deserted behind high fortress walls if it werent so remote the place would make an excellent military base but what purpose would it serve to station soldiers in a region as barren and inhospitable as this the southern borders with nepal bhutan and india were no longer in dispute then a portcullis of massive timbers was lowered shutting off the view and luns thoughts both the tinkling of the bells receded along with the soft flutter of monkish robes darkness settled the silence was nearabsolute and as the majors eyes began to adjust he saw that he and the corporal were alone if only for a moment then welcome to drakesh said a voice as dark as the surroundings it spoke a sibilant chinese but yet without a trace of dialectal accent you have entered of your own free will or rather at the command of your superiors well so be it the voice held a none too subtle sarcasm abruptly a torch was lit the shadows were at once thrown back and flickering fight illumined the face and form of daham drakesh chang lun had met him before but the physical appearance the presence of drakesh never failed to impress him at sixtyeight inches in height the major himself was taller than average for his race but he felt dwarfed in the presence of daham drakesh the man must be all of six and a half feet in height but thin to the point of emaciation he looked almost skeletal where the light of his torch showed through his shift and silhouetted his pipestem body his hands were freakishly long and tapering their pointed fingers tipped with thick yellow nails hooked into claws his shaven skull was thin at the front and lanternjawed long at the back and bulbous as the head of an insect on a scrawny neck but for all that daham drakesh seemed fragile as porcelain his eyes eyes luminous and yellow as molten sulphur gazed on chang lun and the corporal and seemed to gaze through them as if they were the ephemeral ones not he they felt paralysed by that gaze until finally drakeshs lips cracked in a ghastly smile and he said come i have prepared a room for your man in the left eye of the carven face there he may enjoy the daylight forbidden to me and mine sip tea break bread take his rest and wait for you of course we require no underlings to attend our discourse he smiled a mirthless sideways smile down on the major and moved silently flowingly ahead of his guests leading them through the labyrinth of rockhewn halls galleries and tunnels which was the monastery alas you and i may not rest major the wicked are not permitted to rest ever by which i mean that we have matters to discuss of course indeed we have the major snapped feeling intimidated by this creature in this place and determined to regain the upper hand grave matters which have brought me here on the orders of my superiors aye and your timing or the timing of your masters in peking is faultless daham drakesh answered as he rushed his visitors along gloomy stone corridors with his torch held high in front for just as you have your orders so i have my shall we say requirements who can say perhaps there are higher powers at work certainly it seems that your coming at this time was inevitable for if you had not requested an audience i most certainly would have summoned you summoned chang lun gasped why you but there he paused with his mouth agape his slanted eyes opening wide in the last few moments a massed moaning had become apparent the major had thought it might be some acoustic effect of the wind on the outer shell of the monastery but now in addition to the moaning he could discern a regular whistling or slicing sound like the crack of a lash splitting the air or of several lashes in unison and he had seen its source they had reached a central gallery deep in the mountainside lit by flambeaux still the light failed to illumine the high ceiling or reach into every corner the place was an amphitheatre with stone steps descending to a level central area but while the rest of the hall cave or excavation was poorly lit that central area was all too clearly illumined burning braziers suspended on chains from the ceiling cast their flaring light on a scene that bosch might easily have omitted from some hellish triptych emerging onto a perimeter walkway the major had come to an abrupt halt drakesh immediately gripped his elbow in a surprisingly powerful hand ah no he whispered be silent i beg you do not disturb them they are at worship they were the monasterys priests the sects devotees the acolytes of the faith they were naked their red robes of priesthood lay folded on the lower tiers of the amphitheatres encircling steps their pale cringing bodies thronged around the central dais no the long necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley stone trough as chang lun now saw but those who stood upon or in the trough were clad in red nevertheless the red of their own blood heads down in singlefile they trudged in their shuffling flipflop fashion from one end of the trough to the other while the brothers all around flailed away at them with long black and red metaltipped whips the blood streaked them it rained from them their feet were stained crimson where they slopped through an inch of plasma like men treading grapes yet never a cry of pain from a single brother but that low concerted moaning not least from the ones with the whips who knew it was their turn next and the blood in the trough it drained away through boreholes to a sluice and went steaming down a chute into unknown darkness those who had offered up their blood stepped from the trough at its far end and went stumbling reeling down an exit tunnel presumably to a place of rest and healing while at the other end untried brothers took their places stepped into the trough and commenced the ordeal of blood and in the outer circle the last of the priests were even now disrobing accepting whips from flayers who chose their own places in the shuffling moaning line worship the major was aghast and his driver trembling where daham drakesh hurried them around the perimeter and under an archway marked with an ankh a symbol of long life as chang lun was aware but long life in a place like this but what of the blood the corporals face was now a far paler shade of yellow where does it all go all of that blood all of that life for some time there was no answer just the flaring of drakeshs torch as he forged ahead then finally his voice came echoing back to the pair hurrying after him the blood returns to the earth eventually surely it is better to offer it fresh than rotting in corpses men take from the soil and the rivers giving nothing back but piss and shit until the end but here we observe our duty to nature huh the major couldnt suppress a derisory snort and do you bleed with them daham drakesh drakesh rounded on him in the doorway to his quarters and for a moment seemed to rear taller still then the fire dimmed a little in his eyes as he answered with them no chang lun i bleed for them for they are sinners all in the night they have sinned even their dreams have been foul and full of the vices which are in men they have dreamed of women and some of men they have plied their own flesh making it despicable but in this place we are of the spirit not the body which is why periodically we suffer their vile bodies to be purged not by the release of base fluids but the essence of life itself and so you see your driver was right the blood is the life at which a redrobed priest stepped forward from the shadows and drakesh turned to the shivering corporal go with the brother here who will see that you are comfortable when they were gone he stood aside and ushered the major into his chambers daham drakesh had been here a hundred years at the time this had seemed the only place in the world that no one wanted but now men wanted everything everywhere even a wasteland as barren as this plateau when first he came here there was the walled city and its people nothing else but in twentyodd years the city was forbidden and its people in thrall and in another twenty most of them had died in the excavation of the monastery it pleased drakesh to call it a monastery which was in fact an aerie as for the survivors of the great task their children were still in thrall to drakesh in his aerie in one of the highest most remote places on earth but it had not been remote enough even that mighty fang qomolangma everest itself one hundred and thirty miles away would not be remote enough men had conquered its topmost peak they had come out of foreign lands to plant their sigils there usually they hailed from the west but in older times they had come from the east too except those earlier conquerors had had scant interest in everest history repeats those same slanteyed warriors were back again not the hsiungnu or avars nor even the huns but their descendants certainly and with the same fierce blood in them but where before they had skirted the great plateau this time they had taken it well and daham drakesh last of his line was of an alien blood too of a truly alien blood aye this would not be the first time his kind had been swayed usurped even decimated by human invaders but never exterminated nor would it happen now it had been the same in dacia eflak wallachia transylvania the same in the sourceplace under whatever name the pages of history ascribed to it in those earlier times daham had heard it from his eggsire egon who had lived through all of those long centuries of war to become the survivor of survivors oldest of all the wamphyri well save one how nomadic invaders from the east had driven the vampire lords from their ancient territories time and again not least when they had considered themselves secure and now was it to be the same again not if daham drakesh had his way he had come here those hundred years ago to remove himself from the actions of his father bored by isolation in his transylvanian keep and aware that an ancient enemy lay asleep in a secret place in the west the count had determined to venture out and broaden his interests in the world he had lain low for far too long daham drakul egons son by transfusion of his egg had been left to care necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley for the keep in command as it were of a handful of itinerant szekely serfs and thralls huh what was that for power but treachery was ever the way of the vampire and no one hates a master vampire a lord of the wamphyri more than his own flesh and blood his own eggson by virtue of egons egg the burgeoning leech within him daham was wamphyri he would be a lord in his own right but not here in transylvania not in another lords castle wherefore he must remove himself to some far place and find or build an aerie of his own a handful of soil out of starside and six szgany thralls vampirized into lieutenants were all daham took with him oh and some monies in ancient golden ingots stolen from his fathers treasury and so to the roof of the world and to this place where eight years later hed learned of egons death at the hands of some merely human adversary but by then a return to the transylvanian keep had been out of the question for it had been recognized as a source of great evil the local administration would never allow another drakul to take up residence there it were best that the legend die again only to rise up in other parts when the time was ripe and so the decades had flown but what is time to a lord of the wamphyri time is nothing but ennui is and just as egon had become bored so was his son bored by his existence in this place except he must wait out his time or rather he must wait out the time of another until he was up again daham knew about radu knew who if not where he was at least he knew as much as egon had known before his illfated sojourn in england he also knew about the francezcis more properly the ferenczys and had watched from afar while they grew powerful in the world for just as they had their sources so daham had his indeed they were often the same sources but more than this he had his eyes and ears out in the world his redrobed thralls and emissaries of the message ostensibly a message of love and peace in reality they were his spies pure and simple and their message a sham or rather they were his crfsosimple and far less than pure agents but as well as information they sought out vampires toocommon vampires like themselves to learn from them and then to destroy them it was part of the agesold scheme of things a rule as valid as it had been fifteen hundred years ago that obscurity and anonymity are synonymous with longevity a simple code of existence that egon drakul had forgotten or put aside once too often but his son daham would not make the same mistake for he knew that if man discovered vampires in the world and if man believed in them he would not rest until they were destroyed every last one including daham which was why he sought out and killed these lesser creatures first as to who they were spawn of ferenczy lykan and drakul errors from a time lost in history the sons of the sons and daughters of daughters of supplicant szgany come into this world with radu lykan nonari the gross ferenczy yes and with karl and egon drakul too out of a far strange place they were not wamphyri no but they were of the blood and their source had been sunsidestarside in a vampire world daham had learned something of that place from his father and of bloodfeuds so terrible that they would outlast time moreover he knew it was only a matter of time before just such a feud erupted here he knew because down the years his disciples had come across descendants of radus thralls lycanthropes with eyes full of moonlight who told of a legend sleeping in a mountain far in the west this was the same rumour egon had heard a hundred years ago that sent him plunging headlong into england to his eventual death and who could say that egons death had not been wrought by radu or those hed left behind to tend him through his long sleep radu lykan and the ferenczys and the drakuls but that had been a feud and would be again when radu was up as to the when of it soon if daham could believe his sources and he did believe them the ferenczys had had thralls in england for long and long for what good reason if not to track radu to his lair and just as dahams people had researched the socalled ferenczinis and later the francezcis so had some other agency out of england daham knew it his eyes and ears were out there not always in the guise of redrobed priests radus thralls protected and looked after their sleeping master even now and in their turn sought out his olden enemies until the time of his return and when he returned what then and what of daham drakesh wamphyri in this remote but not inaccessible place how long before radu found him or if the ferenczys should find and destroy radu first how long before they found him or what if they had already found him well he had no proof of that nor even a shred of evidence as yet but there was always tomorrow and daham drakesh was a sincere believer in another old edict that a stitch in time saves nine egon had told him now upon a time in the vampire world the great lord shaitan the unborn had stood off and let lesser lords fight a great bloodwar until all of them were depleted made weak by their efforts then how hed picked them off one by one until he was the undisputed lord of lords it had been a story worth listening to and a lesson worth learning but how much better how much more ironic if shaitan the unborn had set those lesser lords to fighting if he had deliberately planned it so brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i that they performed the bulk of his work for him and who could say perhaps he had and perhaps daham would do the same the ultimate agent provocateur yes history repeats all of which were thoughts that passed fleetingly through the vampire lords mind as his visitor major chang lun of the peoples army of red china tried in vain to make himself comfortable in the austere cavern that served the last drakul for living space there was an alcove cut back into one wall within it a long lidded box like a linen chest fitted snugly into the seven by two foot recess a bench its polished top was scattered with cushions of a coarse local weave this was where drakesh had seated the major upon his own bed in fact which was inside the box normally at this hour drakesh would be inside too alas that on certain rare occasions such as this one he was obliged to make allowances and while chang luns host brought tea and foul tibetan biscuits from a secondary cave the major sat and narrowed his oval eyes staring all about the dim somehow smoky interior of this place it wasnt smoky he knew yet seemed full of drifting shadows and the shimmery mobility of a scene viewed through smoke perhaps it was an effect of the indirect daylight filtering in through narrow slits hewn right through the great thickness of the far wall the only indication that daham drakeshs apartments were on the outer extremes of the monastery chang lun had inquired about those narrow windows before in other keeps in other lands they might easily be mistaken for ancient arrow slits but in fact they were drakeshs clock the light crossed the room in dim barely perceptible bars forming patterns on the wall above the alcove where chang lun sat according to the shape and brightness of the patterns and the time of year drakesh could immediately determine the hour to within two or three minutes and at night i have a certain affinity with the night drakesh had at once answered it is an art of mine instinctively to know what is the hour i take pride in it a vanity i know but as the setting of the sun is a marvel and its rising even more so we should likewise pay attention to the darkness that lies between the two pseudomystical garbage the major felt himself slumping and sat up straighter it was always the same this place seemed to drain him of life huh the blood is the life indeed tea said daham entering as if from nowhere and causing the dingy air to shift and shimmer into new patterns and there are somangha biscuits should you require refreshment the tea is welcome the major offered his curt nod as for himalayan grass seeds in milk paste each to his own daham nodded his understanding and placed a brass tray on a circular wooden table then he pulled up a threelegged stool and seated himself facing his visitor soup cheese biscuits bread you would probably starve on a diet such as that but to the tibetan more than sufficient the major smiled thinly but you are not tibetan polish originally drakesh was frank when my mother died and my father returned to his native romania i went with him there i what heard the call i knew i had a mission in life and so i came here and built this mission this monastery think what you will of it and of me i have my devotees you saw some of them at a phase of their devotions indeed i did chang lun grimaced and quickly diverted the conversation so you built your monastery then we came and one by one the temples began to topple but not this one drakeshs eyes had narrowed those troops who preceded you warriors and not merely an occupying force they saw that i was different and that the mysteries of the drakesh sect were real they made report and an officer ah a full colonel chang lun came from his headquarters on kwijiang avenue chungking to see me do you know the significance of that perhaps you will understand me better if i speak of the british ebranch or their russian equivalent at the chateau bronnitsy near moscow oh yes major there are forces in the world greater than all the armaments of war some men understand such things and i daham drakesh am one of them but that is my pride speaking and pride is a sin indeed it is one of the original sins but perhaps im boring you chang lun shook himself this man was hypnotic his voice lulled his eyes drilled into your soul and as if he knew the majors innermost thoughts drakesh was even now smiling that ghastly smile of his no the major protested what bored not in the least so tell me what did the colonel from chungking want drakesh nodded i know that you already know he said and that you think me a fraud a fakir and colonel tsihong a gullible fool but ill tell you anyway he wanted to see me melt a block of ice from within he wanted to know how i can see in the dark without the aid of nitelite binoculars he was fascinated that i could fast for thirty days and nights without even water or a crust of bread to sustain me then walk naked ten miles out into the snows to meditate and having heard certain truths and untruths about me in lhasa he was especially interested in my longevity the fact that ive been here for a hundred years chang lun nodded metaphysics he sniffed longevity esp on kwijiang avenue in chungking they study such things also genetic mutations and such i say its a fad what weight can a thought carry and what use to breed freaks but we know the weight of a tank and necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley how deadly a gun is in the hands of a welltrained soldier so for the moment colonel tsihong is in favour indeed he has been in favour a good many years but he has superiors too and men want results as for genetics the russians have bred a superpig the beast cant walk its flesh is vile and its shit stinks but on kwijiang avenue in chungking drakeshs voice had fallen to a whisper they are not breeding pigs and now finally it was the majors turn to smile he just couldnt resist it on kwijiang avenue he said letting each word sink in they are no longer breeding anything reaching inside his uniform he produced a heavy sealed manila envelope which he handed to drakesh without a word or change of expression drakesh opened the envelope with a hooked fingernail the seal sprang open at a touch which scarcely surprised him where major chang lun was concerned the word privacy wasnt in his vocabulary what was written was lengthy and very complicated drakeshs eyes swept the crackling pages at incredible speed he nodded his acceptance of the contents and i told him as much nine years ago he said so now well do it my way as he placed the envelope in his robe his face was entirely emotionless chang lun made no attempt to disguise his knowledge of his hosts subject they wanted tissue samples you refused to cooperate they wanted blood you said it was your life and you could not part with it they wanted you as a sample of something alien extraordinary they would dissect you like a frog disassemble you like a watch to see what made you tick oh no physical damage neither scar nor puncture hole to tell the tale but small bits of you removed all the same you bluffed them you said you would rather die first told them youd will yourself to death tsi hong believed you why he might even learn something from watching you do it but then you offered him an alternative my seed daham drakesh nodded it seemed abhorrent to me that pieces of me however small should die on their telescopic slides and in the chemicals of their experiments i did not want myself examined but i could find no logical argument against the promotion of life from the ugly wriggling otherwise useless hordes of my loins you came in a bottle for them chang lun too could be cold emotionless they froze your sperm and took it away to chungking drakesh whispered indeed and that was nine years ago and fifty came forth drakeshs eyes seemed afire in the caves weird light out of the flower of chinas womanhood yes you father to a horde when loyal weeping chinese parents were strangling their babies in the name of the peoples republic to what end drakesh what of colonel tsihongs genetic experiments now i told him how it would be said the other that one may not grow exotic orchids in a paddy field that they will come up twisted and strange but if they are tended by caring gardeners watered by familiar rains and reared in their natural their native soil in other words youll grow them yourself what here and how will the brothers react to that daham drakesh a monastery or a harem a holy place or a place of holes if its your intention to offend me your time is wasted here drakesh answered what will be will be not necessarily because want it but because your leaders want it and if in order to exist i must obey then i will obey i will not be forced out of being driven from my place you dont fool me chang lun shook his head your socalled emissaries are out in the world even now to what end if not to find a new place for you i fancy youll flee before your deceptions are discovered lets be clear on this i consider you a fraud yes but i also consider you evil this this spawn that they bred by artificial insemination in chungking is proof of it sooner or later even tsihong will recognize the truth and what of you and yours then i dont know what you are drakesh but youre no holy man and youre not up to any good im sure as for this monastery do you think i cant see why you chose this place so close to so many borders even now your boltholes are ready to receive you when you are found out drakesh touched his robe the place of the letter major luns raving didnt concern him his mind was on other things fifteen of his children deformed destroyed at birth he had known about that long ago of course but fifteen out of fifty it was hardly surprising freak births and nightmarish malformations had been all too common among the wamphyri of starside so egon had informed him as for grotesque autisms bone and brain disorders tendencies to extreme violence and madness unnatural lusts what else would one expect these children these creatures had been vampires dahams bloodbrood his creatures aye the last six escaped chang lun broke into his thoughts made no excuse for knowing every smallest detail of the letter only eight years old and apparently perfect apart from their accelerated growth rate they killed their keepers and instructors they not only bit the hands that fed them but fed on them drinkers of blood cannibals homicidal maniacs in only eight years theyd grown to men and sexually voracious women finally they were hunted down to the last one and eradicated but it wasnt easy brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i and again drakesh said i told them how it would be but this time well do it my way his whisper was a hoarse rustle in his pipestem throat my way yes all of his children gone now the nucleus of an indefatigable army which tsihong had tried to create as a unique breed protectors of china all gone now but drakesh knew no pain he had known what the outcome would be tsihong had tried to teach them to be human daham would teach them to be what they were and to hide what they were until he was ready it was what he had wanted from the beginning it had been the way of the drakuls since a time beyond memory to infiltrate and eat out an enemys heart from within but china the enemy not at all the enemy was mankind china was merely the greenhouse for the next and last generation of great vampires and daham drakesh would be their unholy priest their bloodsire aye in the vampire world of tomorrow but for now you asked me certain questions he reminded the major unless they were frivolous i would answer them indeed i am obliged to answer them so that you may take my answer back to tsi hong would i make this place a harem you asked drakesh shook his head no the brothers will make ready the city in the lee of the mountain and the lascivious among them will repopulate it but i shall be the true father of the brood i know that place chang lun answered i visited it but briefly the first time i came here its doors are still daubed with plague markings drakesh shrugged whatever the plague was it is gone now and changing the subject there was something else that you said that i would flee when i was discovered and that my emissaries were out in the world even now seeking new places for me well you were right in one thing at least but quite wrong in another oh chang lun prompted him boltholes hah if ever i had intended flight surely by now i would have fled drakesh cocked his knobby head on one side and smiled what only sixty miles to nepal and the same to sikkim or bhutan and i am still here no dont pride yourself that i would ever flee from such as you major and before chang lun could answer as for my emissaries you dont know the half of it but colonel tsihong does over the roof of the world across the himalayas is the easiest route into friendly territories its true ah but not for me for my emissaries chang lun frowned and for the first time began to feel a little unsure of himself a little uneasy go on he said who better to look into the affairs of the outside world not only the religious affairs but also the social political and economical than harmless monks of an obscure tibetan order spies chang lun not only for me but also for the muchreviled colonel tsihong and by whom reviled by you and you dare to threaten me by all means do so but remember you may well be threatening china herself my emissaries yes spies for china ah and very necessary chang lun never more so than now doubtless you read in this letter how the chateau bronnitsy is no more reduced to rubble some two years ago but how was it wrought for what reason and by whom and what if a similar establishment on kwijiang avenue in chungking should be next metaphysics a fad do you still think so well others in the world take it far more seriously so now you see the entire picture youve become one of the privileged handful who do see it and perhaps one too many if were to let slip the fact of this new knowledge of yours and of your opinions to a certain colonel in chungking chang lun came to his feet at once but slowly oh so very slowly he sat down again i seem to have underestimated you he said worse it seems i was mistaken about certain things you were suspicious of what you did not understand drakesh told him but now you do understand something of it at least well no harm done he smiled that smile of his and stood up now you will excuse me while i write my reply this time perhaps the seal will remain intact and once again before the major could answer or protest if he intended to but lets have no secrets you and i my letter will list my requirements the equipment needed to make drakesh city inhabitable again which the military your forces in xigaze will transport as it is made available also i shall require more freedom the necessary visas to send my emissaries out into the world in greater numbers for troubled times are coming and i or should i say we would be well advised to prepare for them now it was all true as far as it went logically it fitted the scenario perfectly but none of it was for china drakesh turned to go turned back again i will send for your driver no need for you to wait on your own meanwhile i thank you for your understanding chang lun may you always be at peace with yourself if not with the world then with a last enigmatic smile bowing from the waist he retired into his inner sanctum in a swirl of red robes the necroscopes dreams were and always had been strange now more than ever before he found himself unable to recall their substance when he was awake this morning was no different he came awake in his bed in his room at the hotel adrano sweating panting fighting with his bedclothes in a frenzy of fear yet a moment later was lost as to the cause but the fear had been real as the continued trembling of his limbs and pounding of his heart testified brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i something about bj about the moon about wolves about a place like a skull on a frozen plateau about dark forces gathering in all the unquiet places of the world it was there and it was gone something about himself that he was two men in one body with two sets of thoughts when he was the other he didnt know his own mind and when he was him when he was him now what the hell when he was him what was he back to that again well he was him and he was satisfied with him now with which the rest of the dream blinked out and disappeared entirely and harry was left to locate himself physically in three dimensions as opposed to the fourth and purely mental dimension of his mind in this first day of the rest of his life in the hotel adrano in paterno sicily and having fixed that the rest of it fell into place and he knew why he was here set a thief to catch a thief well not quite but set one to steal from one or from two that was why he the waking him was here but the subconscious harry keogh of whom he wasnt even aware was here for another reason yet no confusion of purpose physical or otherwise both purposes locked together like the two halves of one brain and bj could not have planned it better even if shed known everything but if she had the necroscope wouldnt be here in the first place or any other place by now except maybe in a noplace the last place on or under the earth talking to his dead people in their own place face to face as it were but harry didnt know that he called for coffee breakfast and when it came had no taste for it by then hed washed shaved and dressed so he ate anyway and chewing over his food likewise chewed over his plans in doing so the two halves of his mind found a meeting place his business here was to break into le manse madonie of course and steal back from the francezci brothers some of their illgotten gains but it could do no harm to do a little research first in fact to research the francezcis not from any library or registrars office but from the dead themselves for who would know better about the history of a family and its ancestral home than that familys progenitors or if they were unwilling its servants and where better to find the latter than at le manse madonie itself except here something extraordinary that the necroscope never before in his life stumbled across two extraordinary things in fact one thinking of le manse madonie his mind had conjured the photographs that darcy clarke had shown him at ebranch hq in london more it had superimposed them over that precognitive vision of the place as shown to him by some residual echo of alec kyles talent this combination a sort of mental triangulation had the effect of locating the building exactly in his memory and in his mind astonishingly he remembered his coordinates from a flashforwards the idea at once struck him that using the mobius continuum he could go there right now without further ado it would be as simple as that he had his rooms coordinates if he was mistaken or if something were to go wrong he could return at once to the hotel in paterno or even further afield to any of the old coordinates he knew so well but if he was right if he could make one unbroken mobius jump directly to the madonie without ever having been there physically then the experiment would provide irrefutable proof that indeed hed inherited some gradually fading trace of alec kyles metaphysical skill and after le manse there were other perhaps far more important places it was completely irresistible placing his breakfast tray outside his door and locking it harry forced his minds mobius maths to a familiar configuration conjured a door stepped across the threshold and went there to the mountains of the madonie it worked there had been two locations one of them at a lower elevation well away from the place and the other close up harry had materialized at the first one thus keeping a healthy distance between himself and the actual house but there it was just as he had seen it in his vision he craned his neck to look up and up at stark yellow and white cliffs yellow in sunlight as he now saw and at the squat whitewalled castle mansion or chateau perched there in the rim of oblivion a fortress on a mountainside from the necroscopes viewpoint where he stood on a winding road halfway between the sea and the sky the sea of course he remembered how during that brief earlier visit hed smelled the tyrrhenian at his back and now he could turn and take it in the great sweep of sicilys northern coast against the blue dazzle of whiteflecked ocean hazing towards palermo in the west and curving over the distant horizon to messina in the east there were cars and a bus groaning their way up the steep road harry didnt especially care to be noticed turning his back to the vehicles he looked again at le manse madonie that somehow foreboding mansion built on the edge of a sheer drop that must be almost four thousand feet to the sloping scree of a rubblestrewn gorge and the great cliff of the mountainside itself all sunbleached rocks brittle scrub and a few stunted mediterranean pines exactly as hed seen it before deja vu indeed but in reverse more like vega du harry thought drawing himself back to the present the vehicles had disappeared around a bend been eaten up by a spur of the mountain where the road had been cut through it the necroscope was quite alone he found a flattopped rock by the side of brian lumley the road and sat down now with a bit of luck he should be able to find someone who could help him yet even as his mind slipped into its familiar mode that weird telepathic talent which allowed him to talk to the dead something warned him that he should guard his thoughts it was the place or rather it was that place up there teetering on the rim of the cliff like that oh yes it was as well to whisper in the presence of the unknown but a place is only a place after all so why was harry sweating it was a hot day certainly but it didnt feel like that kind of sweat and if it had been other than day the necroscope scarcely believed hed want to be here at all but he would have to be indeed he would have to go in there into that place tonight which made it imperative that he know something about it and he would also like to know something about the francezcis something about their background their history something other than darcy had told him though why he couldnt exactly say call it for future reference harrys thoughts even his most recent guarded inwarddirected thoughts were audible to the teeming dead they always were except when he shielded them or aimed them at an individual by now he would normally have expected someone to answer him inquire as to his presence here he was the necroscope after all but no the telepathic aether his lines of communication seemed to be down no one was interested in him or if they were they werent expressing that interest and yet he knew they were there he sensed them like phantom callers on a telephone they breathed however silently in his weird mind but it wasnt harry who was afraid it was them and because they were and after listening to their silence for a while so was he harry he jumped a foot what who with all of his experience still the necroscope spun around and despite that everything was bright hot dazzling sunlight and that sweat good old honestto goodness physical sweat now as well as a trace of the other sort rivered his back still he shivered until i im sorry he finally gasped i suppose i should have been expecting you i mean i was expecting someone but this silence this dead silence is sort of unnerving and that was it the second extraordinary thing the fact that with the exception of this one dead voice the great majority were dead silent oh they were here but they werent saying anything nor will they said the one lone voice in harrys metaphysical mind youre forgetting something harry that what the dead did in life they continue to do in death isnt that how it goes why yes but necroscope the lost years vol i but this is sicily said the as yet unknown other as if that were explanation enough ifs a place apart harry it has its own special code and indeed the necroscope did understand a code of silence thats right he sensed the others incorporeal nod ifs a code they adhere to and never more so than here here harry knew what the answer was going to be in the selfsame moment he framed the question right here yes said the dead voice in this very place in the shadow of le manse madonie necroscope the lost years vol i iii humph and others in the vaults beneath who are you harry would have liked a proper introduction but it seemed that in this place he wasnt going to get one who was do you mean the other was open about it hed obviously had plenty of time to get used to the idea he wasnt one of the recently dead but more properly a longtime member of the great majority was j humphrey jackson jr humph to my friends an american yeah as for what i did used to build safes safes thats right for banks for rich folks and sometimes for thieves who were worried that someone might try to steal it all back i designed and installed safes strongrooms vaults big steel piggy banks for little greedy piggies well im very glad to meet you humph harry told him especially since no one else around here seems interested oh theyre interested for sure humph told him but talk about closemouthed cliques harry a whole bunch of cliques clans families why they talk to each other all the time or rather they whisper but if youre an outsider forget it but in death too i would have thought silence was the last thing theyd want well you dont know much about the history of this island do you humph gave an incorporeal snort ifs a bloody place necroscope me i sort of found out the hard way and so could you thats why i spoke up see i was beginning to fall into their ways i mean there are people here i can speak to sure but recently ive been as tightassed as the rest of them then i sensed youd come on the scene you could only be the necroscope because you were warm and i could hear you thinking and what you were thinking about le manse madonie thats why you spoke to me mainly yes the dead mans thoughts were suddenly hard cold his was an uneasy spirit in life hed either left something undone or there had been a great injustice giving him a chance to organize his thoughts harry said you sound pretty close humph i mean is there a cemetery close by wheres your grave i could come and talk to you there it seems only right grave step to the other side of the road harry and look downt harry crossed the narrow road and came to a halt at a kneehigh metal safety barrier that didnt look any too safe that wasnt there in humph told him no blacktop on the road either just a potholed track an easy place to take a dive into the next world if you were a careless driver or if someone figured your time was up you crossed the wrong people the necroscope took a cautious step over the barrier one leg only and looked down two or three hundred feet of thin air to a screestrewn slope that went down to the next loop of road thats where i ended up in my burnedout wreck humph told him right there on that stretch of road mercifully i didnt feel a thing after the first bounce and no i didnt cross the wrong people i worked for them harry guessed what was coming next the francezcis absolutely three months to put in their vault supplied the brain they supplied the brawn and this is how i got paid off a couple of their boys their soldiers flagged me down on my way off the mountain they rapped me on the head hard enough to knock me dizzy took the brake off pushed me over an accident of course but why two reasons one they took back my cash payment before i went over miserable bastards and two two has to be obvious you were the only one who knew about their strongroom thats how i figure it yeah murder harrys voice had been quiet enough before now it was the merest murmur most foul humph agreed and a moment later so my bones went into a grave somewhere but i hung about down there where it happened and what do you know fortyodd years later along comes harry keogh necroscope enough to make a man believe in god vengeance is thine sayeth the lord except thats not what im here for harry told him and after a moments silence then maybe we should forget i ever spoke to you but ill see what i can do humphs lead was too good to let go of it might be exactly what harry was looking for brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i promise absolutely how i mean how will you get my own back the necroscopes turn to shrug they robbed you its my intention to rob them they killed me harry and i dont go for this turning the other cheek stuff i mean ive been hearing some things in the last couple of years like youre a man who believes in an eye for an eye thats true enough harry answered but i also need to believe in what im doing and as yet i dont have much information on the francezcis im pretty sure its within my parameters to steal from them but as for anything else try to put yourself in my position j theres no way i can right every wrong thats ever been done to the dead not on my own there are an awful lot of you humph youre of a very large even a great majority and im only one but yes when i j can see the whole picture then ill see what can be done so what can i tell you first do you know anything about their family history what mean what the hell would i know about family histories i build safes harry or i did is there nothing you might have seen inside that place i shit i wasnt allowed to see anything inside that place i had a room i could go from my room to my place of work and from my place of work to my room and also to the place where i ate always alone oh and the grounds it was okay if i wanted to walk around the grounds layout oh i can tell you the layout roughly i can tell you where their treasury is for sure but history very well lets settle for the layout for now anyway and humph told him taking it all in the necroscope listened intently as he moved out of the glaring sunlight into the shade of an embankment where the winding road had been blasted through the solid rock of the spur it had been some time since humph was inside le manse madonie but it had been on his mind ever since also his description was enhanced by pictures straight out of his dead mind so that harry was enabled to see the route he had taken from his room to the vault that hed been securing in the bowels of the place as if he himself were walking it he could actually get the feel of the place take coordinates right down in the bedrock he eventually commented no humph told him deep but not right down there were other levels below that one i just sort of happened to stray down there one time i cant remember if i lost my way or if i was just curious probably the latter no definitely the latter anyway i found a place with a steelbarred door hooked up to a generator electrified oh yeah but le manse madonie had its own juice that was something in sicily in those days maybe that was the old strongroom that yours was replacing harry reasoned maybe but i dont think so humphs thoughts were very dark now there was just something down there that they didnt want anyone to see not anyone anyway a guard caught me gave me hell frogmarched me in front of emilia francezci my employer harry caught a reflection of the man from humphs mind and gave a start oh humph said something up something was up yes this could easily be one of those photographs that darcy clarke had shown him the family resemblance was that close and like the photographs this picture from the mind of a dead man was somehow blurred indistinct know what you mean humph said these people were shady characters in more ways than one i never could remember precisely what they looked like funny eh but in no way funny haha you say this emilio was your employer singular harry frowned felt a little confused but youve also been talking in the plural they and these people emilias brother humph explained he was a big cheese in le manse madonie but didnt go out much never that i saw i saw the pair together though frequently brothers but definitely twins even if not identical darcy had said exactly the same thing but about the current owners of le manse the current generation of francezcis and this time it was humph who saw their pictures in the necroscopes mind thats them he said at once cant be harry shook his head these are francesco and tony or anthony today people what youre seeing is from a recent photograph he felt humphs astonishment and you know something the dead man said very quietly emilias brother was called francesco well why not harry wanted to know names can carry on down the generations as well as family resemblance and anyway im not so much concerned with the current family as with the historical dont know anything about that said humph stubbornly maybe you do lets go the route again from your room to the tunnel where you were putting those vault doors in he had remembered seeing something and wanted to see it again humph took him back along the route from his first floor rooms in the manse down a winding marble staircase into a huge hall or ballroom and on the walls glimpsed however dimly in the eye of the americans memory rich giltframed portraits of francezcis humph had surprised himself hey i remember now why theres a whole damn family tree on those walls except im brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i sorry harry but i cant remember what a single one of em looked like try to look a little closer the necroscope begged him and humph obliged as he had said these people were shady characters in more ways than one even their brooding portraits seemed obscured either by humphs memory or the patina of age or whatever but the family likeness was there in every one of them certainly harry leaned against the rocky wall of the cutting through the spur and closed his eyes the better to see through humphs and he saw a woman misty in humphs memory but still beautiful she was longnecked had an elegant or perhaps haughty tilt to her head and was classically sicilian and under the picture her name on a brass plate swimming up uncertainly in the eye of the dead americans memory constanza constanza de constanza de petralia and this time harrys start was violent indeed humph felt it and moving on to the next portrait asked are you okay necroscope are you getting all of this harry nodded knew humph would sense it peered yet more intensely through his incorporeal eyes and next to constanzas portrait that of her son angelo as a young boy but the very next frame was angelo again this time as a young man and now he had changed his name to angelo ferenczini of course the necroscope withdrew crashing out of humphs mind as if all the devils of hell were after him well they werent but evidence of them was in there for sure even as they were in still in le manse madonie harry humph queried as from very far away you okay necroscope harry knew what hed seen and recognized but already the information was subsuming itself into his inner identity into his subconscious mind it wasnt for him this information but for some other he was only the one who gathered it he mustnt allow it to register that part of his mind or bonnie jeans part was like her personal computer what was in there would not be activated until she pressed the right keys hearing the warning toot of a cars horn harry opened his eyes hed staggered out into the middle of the road and a car was coming through the cutting slowing to avoid him it pulled to a halt and the driver leaned out of his window and made some inquiry in italian harry stumblingly apologized shrugged got out of the way and the car rolled forward picked up speed and set off again down the mountainside harry humphrey jackson jr called again a faint cry from a long long way off as the necroscope deliberately tried to shut him out entirely he felt ill and didnt know why sunstroke possibly but suddenly his entire being seemed to reel like a drunkard what in hell had happened was happening here what was happening in his head he had felt this before when that lunatic telepath wolfman had invaded his mind but that had been in london and this was sicily was someone trying to get at him or get through to him normally harry could guard his thoughts to exclude whoever he wanted to but something some shock or other must have thrown him out of kilter off balance however temporarily his mind was wide open and they came whoooo whoo who who are you who yes who who are you a dozen of them all speaking at once whooorrrr a growl who a small timid pleading voice whoooooooooo like some young girls shriek of agony who whohoho hahahahaaa a burst of crazed laughter fired into the necroscopes mind like a stream of bullets from a machinegun and finally who what where but unlike the previous voices and despite that its source was the same this one was utterly alien and totally menacing and harry felt himself reeling again from its sheer terror from the touch of its mad blind groping in the innermost whorls of his brain run oh run run run no wait mad mental hands were reaching clutching for him he clapped his own hands to his ears and ran his knees hit the crash barrier his body pivoted he toppled forward and felt the air whistling in his clothes plastering back his sweatwet hair harry opened his eyes saw the cliff and the sky and the distant sea all revolving and saw the rocks and rubble waiting for him below in a moment sanity returned and in the next he conjured a mobius door immediately beneath his falling body and fell through it the continuum safety his coordinates paterno he stumbled from the mobius continuum into his room at the adrano crumpled to his knees and was at once sick in the middle of the beautifully carpeted floor harry must have been down for a couple of hours when he awoke he remembered being sick but not what had caused it sunstroke it could only be hed cleaned up the mess before collapsing on his bed thank goodness he didnt have to face that the rooms airconditioning had dispersed the stale smell but turning his mind to le manse madonie he remembered everything humph had told him including the dead mans tale of a forbidden place with an electrified door deep in the bedrock but nothing after that no big deal he knew where the strongroom was the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i francezci treasury and that was why he was here the only reason the only reason yes so why was he shivering it was a momentary thing it came and it went possibly even probably it was whatever had made him sick well probably he shivered again which triggered something else out of the past not what had made him sick but a scene of bitterly cold wastelands and a stony face carved on the stonier face of a mountain as quickly as that the necroscopes computer mind but a computer damaged or diseased not only by bonnie jeans virus but also by dr james andersens had managed to switch drives and thrown him off what could easily have become a very dangerous programme or train of thought and harry was quick to grab hold of something anything solid that might steady him up and give him a focal point to revolve around instead of all this dizzy spinning he was doing now and he remembered an idea that had flashed across his mind on discovering that he had le manses coordinates without ever having been there in the flesh that if it could work for that place maybe it would work for those other places too why not alec kyles power had been to look into the future but without ever knowing just exactly what the things he saw meant and something of that power had come down to harry in the contours of kyles brain hed seen le manse madonie as part of his future but his own weird talent had complemented alecs his metaphysical mind had instinctively recorded the coordinates and there were other places the stonefaced what temple in the mountains was one of them and the other was or might be where brenda was high passes and fanglike mountain peaks and stars like chips of ice glinting with a frozen blue sheen in an alien sky and down below a barren plain of boulders reaching to a shimmering horizon under the weave of ghostly auroras harry gave himself a shake brenda and the baby could be there yes they could be it was a scene from his future and not just the leftover of some fanciful dream well hed already proved the theory by going to le manse madonie and so would feel safer using it to visit these other places too wouldnt he only one way to find out first the temple or monastery or whatever it was but not before he felt a little better he took two alka seltzers let them go down and waited a few minutes until his stomach felt settled then he threw cold water in his face over his wash basin patted himself dry with a fresh towel and after lying on his back on his bed with his hands behind his head for half an hour just thinking it over finally he was ready he pictured the place in the frozen wastelands the location from which hed viewed the temple and tried to remember the coodinates no problem they were waiting right there in his mind this was it he got up from his bed conjured a mobius door and went there and again it worked a little after twelve noon in paterno sicily five in the afternoon at the drakesh monastery on the tibetan plateau and there the place was exactly as harry had seen it in that previous visitation indeed this was that visitation it was his future caught up with him or him with a precognitive glimpse out of the configurations of a brain not yet conforming to his patterns the unseasonal blizzard had fallen off fresh snow glistened softly in sunlight glancing through a grey cloud blanket and out there on the white waste movement of course antlike figures at this range making their way across the snows they were robotic in their movements like some physically punishing military drill routine left right left right left rapid and shuffling the three in front were dressed in red hooded robes also the three bringing up the rear but the one in the middle was clad in pure white and coming to the necroscope across a halfmile of gradually melting snow the chiming of tiny golden bells harry wasnt dressed for this summer it was even here but the elevation more than compensated the roof of the world yes and shivering again this time from the cold he conjured a door and returned to paterno the heat struck him an almost physical blow as he stepped from nowhere into his room and a maid was banging on the door the real door asking if she could makes it dacleanings he let her in showed her the stained carpet and said hed spilled coffee let her get on with her tut tutting and frantic cleaning and sitting in a corner out of the way watching her he wondered what the stonefaced temple on the cold plateau was all about and how it featured in his future one thing seemed certain brenda wasnt there there had been no sense of her presence and thered be no sense to it not in that place but mainly he wondered about the next place and how that featured a garden in a fertile valley between ruggedlyweathered spurs where dusty beams of sunlight came slanting through the high passes during the long daylight hours and the stars glittered like frosted jewels at night or iceshards suspended in the warp and weave of ghostly auroras was brenda there just thinking of the place weird coordinates surfaced on the screen of harrys mind weird yes like nothing hed ever seen before so strange that he was given to wonder were they real or were they simply the coordinates of fantasy the ephemera of dreams was that necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley it wishful thinking had he wished or dreamed too hard of an unattainable location somewhere over the rainbow well the necroscope didnt have any ruby slippers but he did have the mobius continuum finally the maid was finished with many nods smiles and a mouthful of unintelligible pidgin english she backed out of the room and was gone harry waited no longer but conjured his mobius door and in the primal darkness of the mobius continuum he pictured the esoteric symbols the weird equation that would signpost his destination and went nowhere it had been after all a dream a wish a forlorn hope and the coordinates had failed because they too were an invention of his wishful imagination and meant nothing he was wrong of course but had been perfectly correct to think of the coordinates as alien for in a parallel dimension beyond space as we know it harrys weird coordinates would have taken him directly to his target there was nothing wrong with them at all except that they were alien enough of experimentation discovery and disappointment right now despite that he had rested still harry was tired he was emotionlagged timelagged even mobius or spacetimelagged but later tonight he would need his wits about him need to be physically and mentally fit for the job in hand he had all the information he needed about le manse madonie his new knowledge with regard to the inhabitants of that place had sunk into and locked itself away in posthypnotic vaults of the necroscopes mind it would remain there beyond recall until some other bonnie jean or radu lykan pressed the right buttons as for conscious apprehensions they were natural enough considering his mission so he told himself he slept like a small child for once undisturbed by the whispering of the dead in their graves if they were talking they were very quiet about it but this was sicily after all waking about six in the evening harry felt a moments disorientation before his mind cleared it was still broad daylight would be for another two to three hours showering to shake off the last effects of dull sloth he made a desultory meal in the hotel restaurant a something genovese and at once returned to his room now the necroscope was just about ready and it was only a matter of time now too he realized how little he knew about le manse madonie its occupants and staff like how many of them for instance and what their duties were but in a place like that a fortress in its own right there would be little or no requirement for security in the form of guards a night watch possibly but on the perimeter even then it seemed unlikely that there would be too many people up and about in the wee small hours oh really well if they were up and about his plan was designed to take care of that they would be buzzing like wasps once hed set the thing in motion but on the outside a distraction was what they required something to divert them from their normal routine and a distraction was what he intended to deliver as for the vault doors they were combinationlocked he wasnt an expert safebreaker but he was an expert at getting into places without going through doors or rather he was the only one with the combination to his doors in fact it worked very much in harrys favour that humphs steel vault doors two of them took time to open hed be out of there before anyone else could get in why they might not even try to get in probably wouldnt because humphs doors were alarmed and harry wasnt going to set off any alarms not on the outside anyway it was time he checked out his distraction he hung a donotdisturb sign on his doorknob doublechecked that the door was locked got out his suitcase and opened it on his bed four tshirts a black tracksuit a pair of soft black canvas shoes a lightblue summer jacket and an exarmy web belt with canvas pouch attachments a box of six teargas canisters and nine fragmentation grenades packed like dully glinting bluedsteel eggs in a threebythree plywood nest of strawstuffed compartments the mere presence of the last couple of items would suffice to make most people extremely nervous but the necroscope had played around with far more deadly things in his time he put the stuff away again went down to the bar drank mineral water and sat alone determined to remain mainly unnoticed beyond patio windows a swimming pools lights came on a party of british tourists was out there hooting and splashing about a pretty blonde girl came in with a towel wrapped round her ordered drinks smiled at harry and said english nicht verstehen he told her went back to his room and fidgeted but on his way to his room he remembered to stop off at the gift shop and buy a pencilslim flashlight he might well need it in the treasure vault under le manse madonie his room had a small balcony he sat out there under brilliant stars and counted satellites tracking the sky until just after one oclock in the morning when his patience ran out it was still early but it would have to do he put on the tracksuit and black shoes fitted the belt and attachments to his waist stuffed the pouches with canisters and necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley grenades then tested their weight and his own freedom of movement everything was just right yet still he felt not unlike hed felt before he invaded the chateau bronnitsy for the first time but surely it wasnt as bad as that then harry had been full of mayhem bloodlust he had been going up against boris dragosani a vampire this time it was just a couple of godfathers wasnt it also dragosani had been expecting him and these people werent but in any case harrys course was set too late to have second thoughts now he had to fund his search for brenda and the baby and fund it big and the francezcis were crooked as they come and murderers to boot that last couldnt be proved in a court of law no but the necroscope was satisfied to take j humphrey jackson jrs word for it hed rarely known a dead man to lie some dead things lied but not men he conjured a mobius door and went to le manse madonie to that spot under the walls of the place whose coordinates he remembered from his second flash forwards and without pause he jumped again this time a halfmile away across rugged barren terrain to where uneven fanglike outcrops of rock jutted from the stony desiccated mountain soil like shattered teeth that was far enough using his flashlight he climbed a few feet to a good vantage point and looked back at the dark squat silhouette of le manse there were just a handful of dim lights shining out from rooms built into the walls servants quarters harry supposed but the archedover entrance to the inner courtyard was lit up by a battery of spotlights that was okay he wasnt going in through the main door he had his own doors humph he said under his breath are you out there hey ive been expecting you necroscope the other came back at once then the excitement ebbed as the american asked him what happened harry i mean when we were talking you were there and you were gone you sort of faded out as if you were being blocked out but by what the necroscope frowned shook his head im not sure i dont remember i get this feeling occasionally that someone is messing about with my mind and when i find out who theres going to be hell to pay but for the moment i think maybe id better keep a tight rein on this conversation at least so itll be just you and me this time humph how can i help you show me the route to the vault again not from your room but just the underground part the tunnels in the bedrock humph was puzzled but with your talents why not go right on into the vault for the life of him harry couldnt think why not he only knew he had to take a closer look at the subterranean layout of the place maybe its for later he shrugged humph answered shrug for shrug and said its your game harry and without more ado his dead mind lit with all the details of the snaking tunnel labyrinth through the bedrock under le manse madonie the necroscope memorized all the coordinates he needed including those of that forbidden nether tunnel in the very bowels of the place where humph had earned himself a reprimand got what you want harry lets hope so the necroscope answered and excused himself he was going to be busy now good luck then humph told him his dead voice fading into nothing harry got down from the rock it was time for his distraction a diversionary tactic he took three fragmentation grenades from his belt pouches pulled their pins lobbed them left right and centre as far as he could throw then he ducked down in a cluster of rocks and counted off the seconds in the silence of the warm mediterranean night with only the fryingfat sounds of a hundred cicadas and the toottoot of owls to disturb it the abrupt triple blast of the grenades going off one two three sounded like the beginning of world war hi shrapnel whistled overhead harry waited until the echoes came rolling back from the mountains then stood up sulphur and cordite stench came drifting on orange and grey clouds while across the false plateau the lights of le manse madonie blinked on one by one until the entire fagade was lit up like the esplanade of edinburgh castle during the annual tattoo there was even a searchlight beam in one of the corner towers that began to sweep the ground immediately outside the walls whoever was awake probably all of them by now theyd heard the blasts but hadnt detected the source and that wouldnt do harry gave it a count of ten then lobbed another grenade off to his left this time after the flash and the bang the searchlight beam came lancing right at him he sat down in the rocks and let it pass overhead unless these people were equipped with something extraordinary in the way of nightsight binoculars they wouldnt see anything at this range a minute passed and another the beam flashed to and fro a motor coughed into life and a vehicle probably a landrover fourwheel drive engaged roared into view from under the arch of the entrance it came bumping across the rough terrain headlights blazing then another motor snarled into life and with a rising whine and the unmistakable whup whup whup of rotors a helicopter hovered into view from behind le manses walls harry wasnt about to let these vehicles get to him only to where he had been by now every occupant of le manse madonie would be looking and thinking out it was the necroscopes time to go in he conjured a mobius door and jumped necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley to the location the coordinates that had come over the clearest from j humphrey jacksons memory a junction of rockhewn tunnels deep under le manse madonie darkest because this was a place that humph hadnt much cared for the necroscope had felt it as the dead american had guided him along the route his reluctance even in death and after all this time to have to visit this spot again however briefly it was easy to see why the place was claustrophobic soulless empty there was nothing here except the junction of tunnels itself yet it was as if something listened so that harry found himself listening back to nothing maybe it was just the knowledge of the weight of rock overhead claustrophobia yes and the sudden notion that if le manse were a beast these tunnels were its jaws and the waiting for them to close it was an oppressive place evocative of morbid thoughts but no more so than any deep dark deserted mine shaft so harry thought as he deliberately shook the feeling off the gouged arched ceiling was low no more than six and a half to seven feet every fifteen paces or so dim naked light bulbs were strung to the walls bending away horizontally with the curvature of the tunnel the illumination they offered was eerie at best more a haze than true lighting this was a meeting point for five tunnels stone steps going up to the basement of le manse harry knew and others descending to forbidden regions apparently it was down there that humph had got himself in trouble just for being there without having seen anything but harry must see eventually what but his reason for being here was money surely it was to fund his search the two halves of harrys mentality conscious and subconscious or posthypnotic met in momentary conflict confusion then cancelled the problem out solving it with a soft solution the necroscopes need to explore this place was just his natural curiosity that was all but right now his need was to be into the francezci treasure vault yet still he paused if only for a second to fix this coordinate indelibly in his metaphysical mind these steps coming down from above and others descending steeply into the echoing bowels of the place and three other tunnels joining horizontally the place was a labyrinth just as humph had said they and theirs had been hollowing it out for centuries harry gave his head an angry shake blinking his eyes rapidly worriedly in the poor light but the information had sunk in buried itself in his secret memory and now he could get on with the job in hand seconds had passed that was all up above thered be a lot of activity by now but down here all was silence or nearsilence the soft susurration of ventilation systems a sighing of air through the tunnels the muted throb of unseen machines and the pressured tonnage of the solid rock overhead of course with all the additional weight of le manse madonie on top of that which felt like a sound in its own right the mute but ever present groaning of stressed strata two of the three horizontal tunnels were unknown quantities humph had never explored them harry knew the route that lead upwards into le manse also something of the route leading down to whatever the third horizontal tunnel led straight to the strongroom to the massive steel doors installed by the dead american some fortyodd years ago but harry neednt waste time following the tunnel he could go directly to the outermost door he thought to contact humph again to check the coordinates then changed his mind not in this place he wouldnt want to disturb the psychic aether in this place and so the necroscope was on his own here it was as simple as that he went via the mobius route to the vaults outer door and discovered it exactly as humph had described and pictured it a hinged circular sixfoot plug of shining stainless steel set in a wall of roughsurfaced blued steel whose four unseen edges were sunk deep and concreted into walls floor and ceiling the great airlock of a plug was fitted with a combination lock and a massive wheel to slide the hidden bolts you could only go through that door if you had the locks combination or a thermal lance with an unlimited power source or quite a few wellplaced high velocity tank shells that was it there was no other way except one harrys way to anyone watching it would seem he simply disappeared and reappeared in the utter darkness on the other side of the door he breathed dead air used his flashlight took two paces to the inner door then a third pace into another quite invisible door which he conjured over the impervious metal and so into the treasure vault of the francezcis the fabulous loot of centuries the greedy black heart of le manse madonie and in the first thin beam from his flashlight as he swept the room or rather the cave the treasure cave yes behind humphs less than impenetrable doors the necroscope had known something of what to expect but that something was nothing compared to the reality wealth monies the illicit proceeds of ten twenty or thirty years of mob graft and greed vice and crime overseen or advised by the francezcis well in that case they had a hell of a lot of crime on their hands but deep inside in a forbidden place within himself which was as much a sealed vault as this place harry knew better knew it was more than that much more that some of this unthinkable some might say obscene spoil was garnered recently was obvious for one thing there must be millions if not billions in high denomination notes of almost every modern necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley currency certainly the wages of crime for what did the francezcis do that they could possibly have earned all of this legitimately and if it was legitimate then why was it here but that was only the actual money and by no means the treasure as for that some of it was literally centuried there had been pirates on the mediterranean since the early tenth century when genoa and pisa raided the saracen shipping routes later the crusaders themselves had been attacked as their ships lolled westward loaded down with the loot of fine cities and some of that loot was here statuettes in rare marbles and gold crude ingots of that same precious metal treasures from every era of mediterranean history but there was more recent treasure too harrys flashlight illumined chests clearly marked with the swastika some of which were as yet unopened but of those that had been opened harry knew of a wartime legend that rommels forces pinned down in tunisia in may had moved an immense hoard to corsica in the hope of using it to galvanize the german war effort the treasure was in the form of gold ivory works of art jewellery all of which had been accumulated in tunisia libya and northern egypt but none of it had ever fuelled the war if indeed it ever reached corsica the necroscope knew now that it never had for it was here but his flashlight wasnt enough couldnt show him enough harrys mouth was dry his hands trembled and he felt the sweat of fever on his brow even the necroscope wasnt immune to this for it was greed like the insatiable incredible lust of the wamphyri themselves treasure fever to be here alone surrounded by by a worlds ransom for a moment he could actually feel it the way they must feel in all their power their strength their gluttony and it was seductive then sweeping the metal shelves chests naked walls with his slender beam harry saw what he needed electrical conduits looping down from the ceiling with wires leading to light switches on a panel mortared to the wall between racks of shelving it pulled him together let him get a grip on his emotions his greedstricken senses it separated his two parts his two purposes so that while he knew about the francezcis in their modern role he also knew about the ferenczys in all their ancient horror knew that the historical treasures gathered here had been amassed by the brothers father who or whatever he was and before him by his forebears all the way back to angelo ferenczini bloodson of waldemar ferrenzig and constanza de petralia as to how many forebears that was beyond even harrys mathematical powers to calculate a matter for conjecture but certainly this mad magpies nest was not the work of one man but generations generations of vampires the knowledge was there clear as crystal in the necroscopes mind but only for a split second then it sank down into the limbo of bjs beguilement and was gone and frowning to himself harry hit the light switch in the dazzle of the bright lights for the first time he saw the full extent of it and in his turn was seen in a tower security room a guard stared from a halfopen window across the plateau of the madonie and watched the helicopter sweeping the far jumble of rocks and blasting clouds of dust over the sheer rim of the canyon then sensing the glare of a viewscreen brightening to unaccustomed life on the security console he blinked tired eyes and turned to see what was happening what he saw froze him rigid if only for a moment it was the strongroom its lighting system could only be activated from within it had been activated else the screen would be in darkness but that was okay it must be one of the brothers must be one of them because no one else was allowed in the strongroom ever except the brothers were down at the arched entranceway waiting for reports on the explosions a shadow a male figure darksuited flitted across the viewscreen paused at one of the racks picked up a small burlap sack and spilled some of its contents gold burned silver on the monochrome viewscreen as coins rolled this way and that the intruder was plainly astonished he picked up handfuls of heavy coins standing stock still to let them trickle through his fingers unaccountable blasts both of the francezcis in plain view out there in the night strongroom intruder it all came together in the disbelieving watchmans mind his jaw had fallen open he snapped it shut to bite off a halfhissed shit then grinned as a red flashing light on the console told him that the vaults cameras had been activated along with the lights whoever it was down there he was having his picture taken one way or the other he was already a dead man and sliding the window open all the way the guard shouted down to the francezcis intruder in the vault intruder at first they failed to hear or perhaps they didnt understand accept but who would then it sank in what anthony francezci called up as he and francesco glanced frowningly at each other and began walking then running towards le manses main doors whats that you say in the vault what vault hes onscreen the guards voice was hoarse with excitement hes in the strongroom the brothers knew what it meant of course they did it was one of theirs could only be one of theirs the bomb blasts had been a decoy treachery but it was unheard of unthinkable to a man these people were all in thrall in any case how could anyone even think to get away with it necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley weapons francesco called out his voice booming into the night he snatched his dark glasses from his face and his eyes were scarlet everyone up and on the alert man the walls any stranger you see take him alive or if you cant then shoot him dead in or out of the house and pointing at the security guard in the tower window you what about the cameras theyre activated yes the guard shouted back but by then the francezcis were into le manse and gone from view the necroscope hadnt noticed the cameras in the ceiling since switching on the lights hed noticed nothing except the extent of the hoard and even then his mind couldnt take it in only the fact that it was massive and illgotten from stacks of lost old masters one or two of which in rich gilt frames were actually hanging on the naked rock walls to the coins of forgotten realms from the books and illuminated manuscripts of antiquity to the jewelled ornaments of byzantium from pirate gold to modern paper money in bundles inches thick harrys eyes were drawn this way and that as the mass of it sank in it was far more than darcy clarke had hinted because darcy hadnt known but the necroscope did know and knew what he must do the place had ventilation he could hear a faint whirring and feel a gentle current of dry air being circulated and when he looked closer sure enough there were ducts behind the racks doubtless the system was an extension of le manse madonies airconditioning harry grinned for what felt like the first time in a very long time and thought well and why not add insult to injury this is for humph something of what hes owed anyway he took two teargas canisters from his belt attachments positioning them on shelving close to the ventilation ducts but first he had his own needs he unzipped the top half of his tracksuit and stuffed it to bulging with wads of deutschmarks sterling dollars filling the jacket until it bloated obscenely on him and threatened to split at the seams then he took up two small ridiculously heavy burlap sacks and hung them from hooks on his belt it was as much as he could manage it would have to do he yanked the ringpulls on the gas canisters backed off across the concrete floor and turned his face away there came the threatening hiss of hot gases expanding under pressure harry conjured a door and held it steady he took two grenades from his belt armed them tossed them among the shelving wanton destruction of priceless treasures but so what no way the francezcis were ever going to release any of this stuff or let anyone else see it or even admit that it was here it was here because it was theirs ownership was everything he stepped through his door exiting the continuum between humphs doors in the airlock section quickly he fiddled with the combination until a red light began flashing the alarm system obviously then he heard the crump crump of his grenades from within the vault and felt the bedrock give a shudder under his feet another jump took him into the outer passage on the other side of the first door where again he fiddled with the combination and once more the red flashing light which was when he heard the shouting and saw powerful torch beams turning the dim light almost to daylight where they lit up the bend in the tunnel as to why hed bothered to mess with the combination locks hed definitely developed a thing about protecting his talents this way he was making it obvious that somebody had physically broken into the strongroom and thus it would be far less obvious that the someone in question was purely and notsosimply a magician but in order to protect his talents yet again it was now time for him to move on before the people with those powerful hand torches came into view around the bend and anyway there was somewhere else he wanted to see he didnt quite know why but there was definitely somewhere else he wanted to see necroscope the lost years vol i iv the pitthing the climb the example harry was back in his hotel room he dumped his small but heavy burlap sacks and unzipped his jacket into a wardrobe deflating himself like a marquee with a snapped kingpost then moving at a frenzied pace he was out again at le manse madonie only nine or ten seconds had passed the francezci brothers were at the outer vault door where tony expertly spun the combination lock in a sequence that disarmed the alarms but already francesco was asking why did he lock the fucking place up again and how did he how could he get past us on his way out or is he still here one of us he glared all about at the small party of thralls gathered in the tunnel they stared back at his writhing features the unequivocal guarantee of murder written clear in his scarlet eyes and flaring convoluted nostrils tony had the outer door open he made to step through into the airlock section paused lifted his head and sniffed at the air and nostrils gaping he inhaled frantically disbelievingly then choked and grabbed his brothers elbow they all smelled it at the same time gas teargas in the ventilation system the lieutenants and thralls reacted instantly they stumbled about in the tunnel coughing and choking blinded by their own tears as the atmosphere became tinged with a trace of yellow from the tunnels ducts but a trace was enough not enough for the francezcis however not yet wamphyri they had more control over their bodies the gas couldnt hurt if they didnt breathe it in their eyes wouldnt sting if they shuttered them with transparent membranes the membranes would sting but sight would remain unimpaired for a while at least francesco put the second combination to rights as his men began to leave the tunnel staggering away through the reek of the place colliding with each other their torches probing the mistyyellow gradually thickening atmosphere he spun the dial this way and that and finally swung the door open on an inferno hot metal had set fire to paper money and burlap shelving sprawled in twisted disarray art treasures lay blackened broken in the roil of dense smoke and fumes electrical conduits burned sparked sputtered flames licked up the rear wall and gouted on the ceiling emitting the greasy black smoke and gutwrenching stench of destruction as fabulous oil paintings submitted to the heat a wall of heat came scorching out of the strongroom there were fire extinguishers but many of them were damaged blasted loose from their seatings on the walls it took quite some time for the francezcis to find two that were still working and a lot longer to bring the wreckage of the treasure vault under a semblance of control and of course they must do it themselves in the stinging yellow fog through all the tears and blood and rage of their hellish vampire eyes for as yet their thralls were only human after all harry emerged from the continuum at humphs coordinates deep underground where the americans unauthorized explorations had been challenged more than forty years ago and from which hed been marched under escort before his employers in that wide spiralling stairwell that led upwards to the junction of five tunnels and downwards to what a secret place that no one was allowed to see which was why the necroscope must see it it was very confusing he told himself it was to satisfy his natural curiosity but in fact it was to satisfy bjs posthypnotic command that he seek out the wamphyri oh shed yet to turn him loose officially but he knew her purpose and it had become his it would have been his purpose anyway whatever the circumstances but at the same time hed been ordered to store away whatever information he discovered to forget it place it in limbo until bj or radu brought about its resurgence the result of which was that he was now here investigating a monstrous survival a powerful and esoteric branch of the most dreadful dynasty to ever infest mankind with its evil the ferenczys and on this level he worked without conscious thought with regard to any outcome but certainly with regard to his own safety he was in thrall but he was still harry keogh down here there was as yet no tainted air in these nethermost extremes of le manse madonie the performance of the air conditioning system was at its slowest the circulation languid at best but up above harry could hear the hoarse shouting the crying of men scrambling for fresh air and they wouldnt find it until they were out of brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i the building proper out in the night that was good for they wouldnt be coming down here on the other hand harry knew his own limitations too he was sure that the teargas would soon find its way through the system and back to him wherefore time was of the essence he went down the spiralling steps through several complete revolutions until he arrived at a door formed of parallel bars of steel set in vertical stanchions a warning sign an openly displayed red lightning flash warned that the bars were electrified beyond the door the floor was fairly level but uneven and showed the natural stratification of rock the place was a cave at the terminal point the very lowest level of le manse madonies excavations well back from the bars on harrys side of the door there were twin rubberhandled switches set in a panel bolted to the wall one of these was marked with a lightning flash the other was likewise pictorial showing a series of horizontal bars it couldnt be simpler harry threw both switches waited until a mechanism hummed and the bars slid from left to right through the housing stanchion the door stood deactivated and open of course the necroscope could have simply taken the mobius route into the natural cavern beyond the door but hed been interested in the operation of the mechanism plainly the technology here antedated humphs vault doors also this door was never intended to keep people out which gave harry pause as he stepped across the threshold into the dimlylit cave beyond there was a nest of supplementary light switches mortared to the wall when he switched them on a battery of spotlights high in the walls lit the cave with a brilliance that was dazzling it took a few moments for harrys eyes to adjust then he saw that the main focus of the spotlights was the mouth of a great circular well whose wall was of massive blocks of old hewn masonry the necroscope took it all in at a glance the well its electrified wiremesh cover the hoist with its metal platform throwing a gallows shadow across the mouth of the well or the pit and the deeper shadows sharpetched marching away into the caverns unseen corners but the walled pit was definitely the places centre of focus and perhaps well was a better description after all harry could make out a thin mist issuing from its throat vaporizing on contact with the cover that this place was a facility that it was used however infrequently was obvious the door spotlights hoist electrification all of these things spoke volumes however inarticulately but what was it used for in the very instant of his inwardsdirected question the necroscope was warned not to ask it too late harrys natural curiosity had let him down his mental guard was down and his every thought was like a spoken word to the dead of which le manse madonie and the pit in particular had more than its fair share they might have remained silent but his query what was this place used for galvanized or even shocked them into grotesque activity it had been akin to showing the longhealed victims of some hideous torture the implements of their suffering except it was much worse for these victims were not yet healed the use of this place of the pit but they had been part of its use as they were even now part of the creature in the pit and while he it was not quite insane they were driven mad because they remembered what they had been and knew what theyd become the necroscope gaped his jaw fell open in that same split second the short hairs stood up stiff at the back of his neck because he sensed the coming onslaught but this time however strangely inexplicably he was ready for it he somehow knew these people he had heard their dead voices before but had forgotten them because they were part of something that he had been ordered to forget now however he was once more performing in that earlier mode so that for the time being his subconscious memory was intact again and him he was here befoooore hes back back back he didnt listen didnt run he must be as mad as we are har har haaarrrrgh the utterly crazed one whose laughter had sounded like bullets and now sounded like a soul tearing but all of them beating on harrys metaphysical mind simultaneously so that he had difficulty sorting them out beating almost physically great hammerblows of passion rage or terror and not only for themselves but for him dead the necroscope heard himself gasp out loud but where how again that question and in answer here in the pit and another voice like the breath of hell like the croak of some gigantic obscene toad that cowed them all to silence in a moment explaining the how of it in me contact with the group had been through harrys talent he was the necroscope and conversed with the dead but this other contact was different it was telepathy which harry recognized in a moment but how could it be when its source was the same they had the answer to that too but were part of him the terrified girl perhaps not so terrified after all or simply stronger more determined than the rest told him the francezcis brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i be quiet they fed its to him she finished in a whisper he him something in the pit something that breathed air creating the miasma rising from the throat of that now terrible hole but something alive obviously yet when harry had spoken to them in his unique fashion it had answered him back theyre dead the thing told him at once its massive mentality gonging in harrys mind but their minds live on in me and because telepathy and the language of the dead frequently convey more than is actually said now harry had the whole picture or thought he did the francezci brothers wamphyri last survivors of the dread ferenczy dynasty had grown something in this pit even as yulian bodescu had grown that other thing in the cellars of harkley house in devon england but where bodescus beast had been a mindless monstrosity sprouted of his own vampire flesh a thing of little or no original intelligence this construct of the ferenczys was hugely intelligent it gathered knowledge from the minds of those it consumed it was powerfully telepathic it was in harrys mind even now leeching his knowledge he could feel it its eagerly groping fingers and slammed the doors of his mind on it to shut it out before it learned too much its hold was broken necroscope and pitthing stood off face to face as it were weighing each other up harry felt its awesome vampire probes fumbling at the outer reaches of his identity but while telepathy is one thing communication with the dead is something else while the thing in the pit could hear harry and its own absorbed vestigial multiminds speaking and while it might occasionally cow those consumed identities or shout them down it was mainly incapable of anything but threats for you cant any longer hurt the dead and the girl the one whose agony was still so fresh seemed finally to have recognized that fact and was talking to harry begging him to run oh run youre warm and alive you dont want to be like us cold and dead so run but i have to know harry told her as he sniffed the first faint reek of gas what what is he he is their seer their scryer their crystal ball hes their machine they aim direct him and he gathers knowledge for them even from across the world he is their oracle and more than that he i was their father the great voice was back breaking through all harrys barriers but now there was a gasping sob in it an allconsuming grieving a sense of great loss like the loss of being or of the control of being i was angelo ferrenzig ferenczini francezci and i was the master of metamorphism until metamorphism mastered me again more was conveyed than was spoken much more the necroscopes skin crept as he saw the seething horror of a grotesque birth twins one of which was a monster from first gasp and destroyed at once the other was angela bloodson of waldemar and apparently normal a thousand years of vampire life until his metamorphism ran rampant became a disease reduced or exploded him to what he was now if harry had wondered how many generations of francezcis then he wondered no longer the answer was one the brothers themselves twins sons of angelo ferenczini born toward the end of his time as as a man for as his disease had taken hold on him he had determined to extend something of his loathsome existence into the future or perhaps he had hoped to do a lot more than that which was why he was now trapped down here and not freeroaming for harry had ample evidence of the tenacity of the wamphyri he knew that if thered been any way for this creature to continue as a whole man then that he would have found it or would yet find it perhaps in one of his sons if theyd not seen fit to trap him down here first so how long had he been here two three four hundred years and all that time his sons inhabiting le manse madonie sometimes as one person and at others as brothers little wonder there was a long history of twins for they were the same twins they would live here for a while then reverse the process rejuvenate come together as sons and brothers again and always there would be at least one keeper here but their father was faethor ferenczys brother or halfbrother out of a different mother constanza de petralia had angelo not known didnt he know of his sibling in a different time a different land and what of the longdead faethor did he not know of angelo he had never mentioned him to harry but then faethor had usually kept himself apart his interests had been limited divided between war and his mountain territories and bitter hatred of his eggson thibor the wallach or perhaps the two had known of one another but simply stayed well apart and anyway what would it have profited faethor to speak of this angelo whom he never met and if he had spoken of him would it have been the truth for of all liars there is none like a vampire fathers not only of monsters but of lies harry gave up on it there were discrepancies enough in the history of the wamphyri as the necroscope had longsince discovered but though all of this these incredible revelations and the presence of the thing in the pit was mindstaggering still harry had to know the worst of it and through the first faint wisps of a yellow mist he stumbled to the rim of the pit avoided the wiremesh ignored his stinging eyes and gazed down the throat of the awful shaft down there looking back up at him through its own miasma brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i something with burning sulphur eyes quivered and surged get out of here the multiminds urged him while the necroscope reeled with the knowledge the vision of what had driven them half or wholly mad but out of here angelo ferenczy was quieter now his voice dripping sarcasm out of le manse madonie but cant you see he came of his own free will and uninvited theres but one way out which he will find barred i am sure and eventually ah it will be a pleasure speaking to him again but more intimately next time oh ha ha haaaa dizziness nausea that same mental confusion which had left harry so helpless on the road below le manse madonie the previous afternoon struck again but this time he knew what it was the mental power of the thing in the reeking pit of angelo ferenczy or what was become of him was awesome the necroscope could only think of his own safety now and he knew that the multiminds of those that the thing had devoured were quite right he should run get out of here with all speed harry staggered back from the pit amidst thickening clouds of yellow and conjured a mobius door it took unaccustomed effort the gas was in his eyes and lungs the multiminds were shouting at him telling him to run run and the ancient hideously mutated ferenczy was tearing aside the necroscopes mental barriers like so much tissue paper panic set in confused harry saw halfadozen coordinates displayed on the screen of his mind places he could escape to such as his old flat in hartlepool or better still the hartlepool cemetery for the flat was probably occupied by now or his hotel room in paterno or his study garden or bedroom at the house in bonnyrig except he could no longer think of that last without bj mirlu also crossing his mind everything was so confused and confusing the pictures in the necroscopes mind were automatic instinctive lacking an explanatory narrative they gave little or nothing away but the girl the mind of the dead girl who had not yet forgotten the agonies of her dying seized upon one of them and clung to it and bonniejean she cried bj mirlu sent you and because she was part of angelo ferenczy he heard her too mirlu radu lykans thrall this one is one of radus then his awful mind registered utter terror his mental probes were immediately withdrawn they released their grip on harrys mentality writhing back from him as if he were suddenly white hot and in a way angelo was right harry was one of radus go the girl cried hurry you cant help me no one can so go now if you still can and tell bj tell her but harry never found out what he should tell bonnie jean for at that moment angelo exerted his telepathic power over all the shrieking multiminds and closed them down and the psychic aether was empty as deep space by which time the necroscope was in even deeper space that of the mobius continuum where he twirled aimlessly for what seemed a long time before a coordinate surfaced from the whirlpool deeps of his metaphysical mind and he fled to its source his room at the hotel in paterno harry woke up from an instantly forgotten nightmare woke with a splitting headache sweating and shivering and nauseous but he fought it down and lay still and in the light of a bedside lamp took in his surroundings the hotel yes his room at the hotel adrano in paterno sicily it all came flooding back or it didnt not all of it le manse madonie the treasure vault the teargas and the money at that he came off the bed so fast it set his mind and his body reeling again and his clothing stank of gas god no wonder he felt nauseous hed been hit by his own teargas but the money was it real nothingeft real it all felt like some badly fragmented dream as if something was missing so what else was new he hadnt felt right from the first moment he got to this fucking place but after hed opened the windows to his balcony and then opened the wardrobe it was no dream and nothing was missing not of his loot at least a burlap bag slumped over on its side and a handful of gold coins slipped from the rim and set off on their diverse courses wobbling across the polished boards their milled rims purred on varnished pine they thumped heavily where they collided with the carpet trim and fell on their sides and in the wardrobe where hed emptied his jacket bundles of high denomination notes a suitcase full pounds deutschmarks dollars in fifties and hundreds and the krugerrands twin burlap sacks weighing at least thirty pounds each sixty pounds of solid gold and all of this money here in his room in the night in sicily harry broke out in a sweat again he wasnt a thief but he was now but so were the francezcis and what the hell hed known what he was doing and what it was for but he had to get it out of here he did to the old house in bonnyrig then returned to the hotel adrano and lay tossing and turning all through the rest of the night unable to sleep brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i rising with the sun harry checked out of the hotel he didnt dare simply disappear for that would be to invite investigation but having checked out then he disappeared back to his home in bonnyrig where at last he would be able to set the wheels of a real search in motion in his house which felt unaccountably strange and empty now as if hed been away for a week at least harry secreted the money away and began to feel a little easier and then to make up for the deficiencies of last night he slept but only for an hour until the sun rose again for the second time in just sixty minutes it was the telephone that brought him awake bonnie jeans husky voice inquiring ohso knowingly is that mah wee man and oh yes it was him and he was hers beyond a doubt the full moon its golden light streaming down bjs strange eyes undergoing an even stranger metamorphosis and a wolfs head in silhouette dark against the disk of the moon harry said nothing because her words hadnt been a question but a trigger on the other end of the line bj understood his silence smiled at it and asked him well did you get your finances sorted out you can answer normally harry er yes he said im all fixed up now and ready for a weekends climbing ready as i ever will be he answered good she arranged a meeting for lunch noon at a little place she knew outside falkirk about half way to where theyd be climbing and she finished by asking him how will you get there til bike it harry answered looks like a nice day i should enjoy the ride it was no lie he would bike it some of the way anyhow he sensed bjs surprise but thats dont know maybe fifteen miles ill be setting out about plenty of time til have my car i could pick you up i think ill enjoy the fresh air at last he sensed her shrug well okay just as long as you save some of your energy er for the climbing i mean oh ill have enough of energy very well then she laughed til see you around midday afterwards when were done we can always put your bike on the roofrack and ill drive you home mah wee man which left harry feeling as if the world had blinked and for a moment hed felt the darkness but all he could remember was that he had a date with bonnie jean and that she was innocent of course but innocent of what at le manse madonie there was hell on there had been hell on all night and unheard by the brothers lieutenants and common thralls and ignored for now by the francezcis themselves because they were busy the ancient thing in the pit had wailed piteously continuously to itself for hours now and one by one the interrogations went on the household staff were called forward one after the other into francescos private rooms he and anthony talked to them threatened them required them to admit responsibility for last nights damage and robbery or if they werent directly responsible to admit that theyd been seduced by some outside agency and were part and parcel of the breakin to no avail but the brothers had known that from the start it was simply something that had to be done finally it was done le manses staff sufficiently cowed but all perfectly innocent or as innocent as vampires can be were back at their duties the francezcis could now begin to consider or at least attempt to consider the mechanics of this thing which had to be the most frustrating infuriating part for it was patently impossible francesco paced while tony sprawled in an easy chair the latter looked entirely exhausted but his looks were deceptive wamphyri he was simply exhausted of ideas but in fact he was the most sensitive or passive one while francesco had all the aggression we should have guy cavee in again francesco burst out he strode to the hugely heavy curtains looked for a moment as if he might draw them tear them aside but out there all was brilliant sunlight and throughout le manse madonie all of the curtains would stay closed until sundown the francezcis had a woman whose sole responsibility it was to open and close curtains no one else touched them not even the brothers the night watch to what end tony lolled in his chair he gave warning while still the intruder was in the vault we dont know that francesco rounded on him if cavee is lying the thief could have been in there and out of there before he called out if there was a plot he is the obvious one to have been in on it but if he is lying tony waved a slender languid hand then hes also planning his escape from this place indeed he would be fled by now or dead by his own hand for he must know that when if we discover the truth in any case francesco stopped pacing we have to make an example of someone and again he is the most obvious one youre saying that whoever did this he cant be seen to get away with it entirely someone must pay exactly but it will make no difference we still wont know who did it or how brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i he got into the strongroom without tripping an alarm and out again and out of le manse without anyone so much as seeing hearing or even smelling him even tony was beginning to show his agitation now oh i smelled him well enough francesco shouted teargas in the ventilation and grenades in the vault uncounted literally uncounted billions in marks lira francs dollars and treasures destroyed or stolen from under our noses at least a quarter of everything we held down there and as if that werent enough he actually locked up before leaving the impertinence of this bastard unbelievable impertinent yes his brother agreed scowling and we sit here impotent francesco ground his teeth and repeated we should have cavee in again tonys shrug he knows nothing one look at his face says it all why he thinks he should be rewarded he was that quick off the mark rewarded francesco snarled and the cameras ruined tony slumped more yet it was hot in there not necessarily ruined francesco answered they think they can save one of them or rather its contents we can at least hope that we have this dog on film we do have cavees description hah francesco snorted what a true description if he was in on it and if he wasnt what was that for a description anyway a face and figure seen distorted in monochrome and at an angle from above tony stirred himself stood up you know of course that he has been crying out all this time there was gas down there too and he is after all our greatest treasure for without him where would we be ive heard him yes francesco rumbled but then who could avoid hearing him raving babbling about bloody radu at a time like this but he knew that it must have been worse for his brother for anthony and his father were closer then in a moment francescos expression changed and turning to face the other his eyes narrowed more yet and became redburning slits in his dark face oh said tony wonderingly we have to make an example of someone francesco growled we cant be seen to be impotent as you put it our dear father is ever hungry and if guy cavee has knowledge of this thing hes a lieutenant tony pointed out junior but no he is our example francesco cut him off grinning darkly our important example we can always promote another junior lieutenant but we shall never be able to make a better example of anyone again tonys shrug well at least its a course of action he said certainly we need to do something but i cant see that it will produce anything of a solution however and since you seem determined grudgingly he nodded his head so be it by the necroscope was cycling through wild and gorgeous country somewhere west of edinburgh he wore his tracksuit a pack on his shoulders contained a pair of decent climbing shoes and some spare items of clothing he supposed bj would see to anything else himself harry had already seen to something and got himself some expert tuition or hed arranged access to it at least not wanting to make a total fool of himself in the hills this morning hed spoken to the dead in a bonnyrig cemetery and got some leads the man he had been looking for was in a graveyard in dalkeith harry had gone there along the mobius way and introduced himself in his fashion when the excitement had died down hed explained his reason for being there now he felt a lot happier that he could look after himself on a cliff face the dead man hed spoken to had been a climber of the old school not a mountaineer as such no but someone who had made himself something of a local legend in his lifetime as a rockclimbing man without peer no nylon ropes in they days necryscope hed told harry and i wouldnae be caught dead yell excuse mah language with hammer and piton in mah hand lord no all that cock wiz fer the socalled professionals ah wiz no professional but man ah could monkey up a sheer slab o a rock like a wee lizard lookin back now all eighty years and more ah cant say ah dont know ah think it wiz the view pure and simple toe look doon on the world frae on high frae a new place ye ken and ken that only the eagles had ever perched there afore a man ah that wiz something will be again harry had told him from his seat on the old lads sarcophagus in the shade of a tree breathing in the cool calming quiet of the cemetery you can see it all again through my eyes though i cant promise you the climb is going to excite you im only a beginner i dont suppose my guide will be letting me tackle anything too adventurous a beginner is it well yere in good hands be sure i wouldnae dare let anything happen to ye the dead man had assured him me but ah travelled tae do mah climbing harry ben nevis the peak district north wales derbyshire the dartmoor tors the cornish and pembrokeshire sea cliffs you name it but a wee climb will be better than none at all just gi me a call and ahll be there fer ye and dont fret none ahll no be letting ye down necryscope no wi a bump anyhow good harry told him see this lady ill be climbing with is good at it i dont want to be made to look you know stupid thats all brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol eh a wee lassie is it aye well there were a few good ones in mah day too ah mind one who oh its a long time ago but she wiz the only one who ever beat me up a crag ahll tell ye that and shortly it had been time to go it was only after the necroscope had left that his new friend recalled the name of the girl from his time eighty years ago who had beaten him up a crag then hed thought to call out after the necroscope but harrys ma had got to him first dont she told him my son is in trouble but we have it under control we think so anyway the thing is if he were to hear that girls name we really dont know what it would do to his mind so let it be for now there will be time later if it comes to it the old climber had asked no questions like most of the great majority hed heard of mary keogh and knew her reputation that whatever she did on harrys behalf would be for the best but he really couldnt understand her concern why that young lassie hed remembered that bonnie jean mirlu would be a long time down in the ground herself by now what after all these long years of course she would but because mary keogh had spoken these were thoughts he would keep to himself always the necroscope had long since mastered the technique of vacating the continuum astride his machine it was just a matter of balance of going from metaphysical to physical weightlessness to gravity darkness to light simple things to harry but he still had his other thing about someone seeing him in the moment he emerged into this spacetime he had become that concerned with keeping his esoteric talents secret on this occasion though he didnt worry for its one thing for a man to suddenly appear out of nowhere but quite another for a man on a bicycle to spring into existence for a bicycle is such a mundane thing that if a man on a bike comes from nowhere then its a trick of the light or the eye or the mind but it certainly cant be weird or supernatural thus in only ten minutes harry was able to cover the distance from his house on the outskirts of bonnyrig to his rendezvous with bonnie jean at a pub on the approaches to falkirk by jumping stretches of the road ahead for distances of anything from a hundred yards to half a mile if he could see the way was clear ahead see with his own eyes the place where he would like to emerge it was as good as a coordinate and he could simply go there finally the picturesque little pub was in view he spied the place from the crest of a low hill jumped to a paved service track at the rear and emerged as from an avenue of tall fullyclad chestnut trees that made for a perfectly concealed landing a moment more and he had cycled round to the front of the place parked his machine and entered bonnie jean was seated at a table in an alcove at one end of the bar a shame because it was gloomy she could have chosen a window seat but in any case the day was overcast maybe she wouldnt want to climb after all but no such luck he slid into his seat beside her said hello and it doesnt look any too hot out its ideal she gave him a kiss on the cheek we wont have the sun in our eyes he couldnt know that she had been keeping abreast of the weather forecasts and so had been fully aware that thered be little or no sun from noon today they talked about nothing much in particular ate a light lunch and harry paid the bill a man of means bj commented er you could say that he answered im solvent again anyway she pulled a wry face i wish i could say the same that place of mine scarcely pays for itself in fact im in debt then she bit her lip for she hadnt meant to tell him that how much he asked her too much she told him three and a half thousand too much and she sighed and shrugged it might mean becoming a pub instead of a club after all harry felt sorry for her said oh you never know something could turn up in a way he felt guilty for shed been spending quite a lot of her time her nights with him well he certainly had the means to put that right the climb bj had chosen was further than she had thought it was some time since shed been out this way and never by car something like sixty years since the last time shed practised her climbing here but the scenery hadnt changed that much the place in the sprawling foothills of ben vorlich was dramatically beautiful loch lubnaig gleamed silvergrey under the low unseasonal cloud ceiling and ben ledi across the loch was a hazy blue silhouette like a squat mushroom the bulk of the mountain holding aloft a massive grey cap formed of dirty sky shoes bj commented eyeing harrys feet as they made their way diagonally across sliding scree to the foot of a jagged rock outcrop that rose almost sheer for a hundred feet to a saddle between awesomely carved spurs boots were better climbing boots but as you can see i dont wear them either anyway its the soles that count good gritty rubber to grip the rock boots do protect the ankles though youll remember if you get a sprain thanks harry told her til try not to but as they arrived below the crag are we climbing this necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley bj grinned at him for starters she said but dont worry this time next year this will be like a sunday afternoon stroll and anyway ill have you on a rope this time so for now why dont you just sit there and watch while i get the gear ready ill be a minute or two thats all she shrugged out of her pack turned her back on him and went down on one knee harry wandered off around the base of a chimney that rose halfway to the summit out of sight of bj he spoke to his friend in the cemetery in dalkeith how about it the other looked out through his eyes answered damn me but ahve climbed here before ben vorlich am i right absolutely well are ye ready harry peeped around the base of the stack bj was still busy with her pack her back still turned to him yes why not off we go then a piece o cake just you leave it toe me necryscope and the necroscope left it to him but not entirely he felt what the dead climber felt every nuance of the climb and of course he learned as they went for it was his arms and muscles taking the strain easing him up ever up within the cleft of the chimney his eyes scanning the way ahead taking in each and every detail of the route his brain recording it all for later and the oldtimers narrative to guide him all the way that crack there a good wee hand hold three fingers at least and that split opposite ye can getyere toe in there but mind ye dinnae twist yere foot and that wee ledge necryscope aye park yere arse right there a moment but ony a moment and alwiz keep moving on and up and breathe laddie breathe for its the air that powers ye breathe easy harry in and oot ah and see there a piton but dinnae ye touch it thats cheatin they were through the chimney and onto the outer face and harry felt like he was actually haring for the high horizon of the topmost rim then he scuffed loose a pebble that went clattering all the way down the sheer face until it hit the scree and bounced up between bjs legs where shed just that instant straightened up from her pack laden with a rope hammer pitons she frowned turned saw a trickle of dust from above and she looked up then she would have called out in astonishment if for no other reason but was afraid to do so in case she distracted him the idiot but the idiot was hauling himself up onto the rim to sit there with his legs dangling waving down at her and bj too sat down with a bump on the scree stared up at harry and for the first time in as long as she could remember felt dizzy from the angle of her neck and from the thought of harrys solo climb the speed of it then anger replaced her astonishment the clever bastard letting her think he was new to all this quickly she shed her gear grabbed her pack set off back the way they had come thus she failed to see harry reeling on the rim and almost falling before he could regain his balance except it wasnt him but his guide the fact that the old climbers mind had seemed suddenly to go blank so that the necroscope had been left alone as it were on a knifeedge of vertiginous rock following which the way down took a deal longer and harry could feel something of a tremble in his guides suddenly uncertain mind at the bottom he asked him what was all that about a sick spell the other lied thats what stopped me frae climbing necryscope dizzy sickness er vertigo aye and it got me in the end sure enough ah got dizzy once too often you fell harrys jaw fell open he couldnt believe it so ah did but its how ah lived ah cannae complain its how ah died too and harry sighed deeply closed his eyes and thought now he tells me but he kept the thought to himself likewise his guide he too kept his thoughts to himself the fact that he now knew something of what harrys ma had been talking about for in fact his attack had come when harry had looked down at bonnie jean the old climber had seen her too through the necroscopes eyes that lass who eighty years ago had beaten him up a crag well and finally hed got his own back by the time harry reached the car bj had almost not quite forgiven him her tone was severe as she told him ive a mind to make you cycle home youve got it all wrong he lied but in a way told the precise truth ive never done it before it just seemed i dont know so natural thats all sort of instinctive and by the time shed got him home she was halfconvinced they made love through the evening but as night came on she had to go ive missed too many saturday nights she explained my regulars expect to see me behind the bar but as she kissed him and got into the car harry pressed a velvet gift sacklet into her hand oh bj looked at him curiously surprised at the weight of his present its very practical he told her a little something i feel sure you can use and it was in her room above bjs she untied the ribbon and turned out the contents onto her bedspread twenty golden krugerrands bj knew their value her mysterious mr keogh certainly brian lumley seemed to have got his finances sorted out not to mention hers at le manse madonie the cleansing of guy cavees person had taken all day hed been kept fully conscious most of the time a torture in itself the spanish inquisition could scarcely have been more cruel and like the inquisition at each stage of the process hed been given the opportunity to confess if he had been able to tell the francezcis anything certainly he would have done so and in the end he did let them so much as make a suggestion he agreed with it so that even then they couldnt be sure he was entirely innocent but they knew how to make sure in the moment of his absorption into angelo the truth would be known after that his mind or what was left of a mind would be mainly his own again but his body well there would be no body angelos digestive system was that of the wamphyri carried by his rampant metamorphism to its absolute limits literally absorption he would not so much digest the exlieutenant as render him liquid suck him up like a sponge add his mass to the bulk of the unthinkable abnormality that was angelo francezci ferenczini ferenczy a process of simultaneous internal and external homogenization to make cavee as one with the active body the substance of the pitthing the utter and utterly destructive rape and reduction of a person to protoplasm of of a different nature but the mind thoughts memories would be there not alive but incorporated into angelos mentality giving him something of access as to a piece of unfeeling computer software incorporeal and therefore unfeeling yes but not without emotion and not without memories guy cavee like all the others before him would know exactly what was become of him as for the thing in the pit angelo had been silent for hours even tony francezci had heard or sensed nothing of his father since midday it was possible that the intruders teargas had entered the things system rendering him ill or even unconscious but his metamorphism which was all he was now a metamorphism would have no trouble dealing with that and his mist his miasma rose up from the pit as before tony had tried speaking to him told him what had happened and what he and his brother were doing about it hoping to bring him round he had even asked for his advice in the matter all to no avail but as the brothers had had the now unconscious cavee placed on the cranes platform and swung out over the open pit tony had felt a psychic tingle of expectancy and had sensed an incredible hunger so that hed known his father was silent for his own reasons therefore before bringing cavee awake with an ampule and lowering him into the shaft tony had tried one last time father we need to know if this man is a traitor we need to know who coerced him turned him against us against you i know you are necroscope the lost years vol i hungry but if he is a dupe we need his thoughts we need the names in his head nothing only the miasma thickening as the brothers and their lieutenants and senior thralls edged back from the mouth of the pit and then francesco ever impatient stepped forward and broke an ampule under cavees nose committing him to hell the platform descended the miasma rose thicker yet cavee began screaming as he came awake to his worst nightmare he was tied down his screams denials confessions pitiful pleading couldnt help him nothing could then the choking coughing gurgling and the soggy splitting sound like meat wrenched from a bone or wet leather tearing and in a little while the mist rising from the mouth of the pit turning pink then an innocent their fathers doomfraught voice rang in the brothers minds more innocent than them who left me down here to cry out not knowing the whys or wherefores of it the same ones who now beg me for my help hah but you merely seek answers while i already have them tony waited awhile then said father what threatens us threatens you we need to know else we can do nothing ah anthony my anthony and francesco i see that you are here too but did you not hear me calling out to you i called for long and long and did you not hear the name that i called the brothers glanced at each other and francesco finally grunted and said that again radu radu radu but hes long gone to earth and wont be up for a while if ever what has he to do with anything oh you fool said that awful voice from the pit quietly but scornfully why upon a time you brought me one of his a girl to question her i learned a little not much because unlike my thralls radus thralls are strong she was beguiled her mind was closed she couldnt speak but she was one of his and you took her because you pressured us into believing that when he was up again hed come looking for us francesco snarled displaying his objection to being called a thrall because you fear this doglord bastard and transferred your fear to us and after a moments silence fear him why i fear everything trapped down here as i am i am vulnerable even my own sons have power over me but now theres one who may well have power over all of us his name tony was eager now brian lumley aye i saw that in his mind it was it was harry and is he invisible this harry francesco snorted his sarcasm apparently or not apparently the thing had its sense of humour and his master the people he works for how can you be my sons and deaf dumb and blind too again the brothers glanced at each other and are you saying tony began only to be cut off at once by a howl of rage frustration he strikes back even from his long sleep your intruder was no common man what but he speaks to the dead and he works for no common master you took one of his and this was his revenge or part of it angelo was mistaken in part at least but his logic was perfectly sound radu and now there was a tremor in tonys voice the same his father answered he flexes wasted muscles and tests our metal in advance of his return and he has found it weak tony grabbed francescos arm i think hes right i know that he believes it i need proof the other snarled oh i know we can move on our fathers word bring about mayhem in england or wherever perhaps track this radu to his lair and destroy him there and perhaps expose ourselves too not to any old vampire lord but to the authorities what centuries of secrecy wasted ah and how many of our good friends across the world would flock to our assistance then do you suppose no before i make another move i need proof i i i it was always t with francesco and never we tony narrowed his eyes but before he could answer there came a shout from the stairwell francesco anthony sir and sir a man in a white smock waved something excitedly photographs the intruder we have him on film and proof tony said his red eyes lighting like lamps well perhaps now we have it and behind them as they left the place the ancient thing in the pit thought it begins then relapsed into gibbering and darkness part six harry keogh catalyst the calm before the storm in the privacy of francescos rooms the brothers studied the photographs at greater length but even at first glance in the cavern of the pit that housed their terrible father francesco had gasped what in the before showing the badly mottled pictures to his brother tonys reaction had been more or less the same not shock but dismay that it appeared the pitthing old angelo ferenczy was right for he had to agree with francesco that for all the distortion of the grainy prints he too was certain theyd seen images of this man before some months earlier their sleeper in the british isles a trusted senior lieutenant had sent them a series of snaps taken outside the womans place in edinburgh just like these current pictures they too had been badly lit monochrome spurofthemoment efforts scarcely studio quality but then they werent required to be they had been obtained for information only items destined for the brothers file on one bonnie jean mirlu whom they had long suspected of being in thrall to radu lykan now the contents of that file lay sprawled across a massive desk one picture uppermost where francesco had thrown it in a rage for it was clear to both men or monsters that the man in the edinburgh photograph and the intruder pictured inside their treasure vault was indeed one and the same man a dead man francesco snarled for the third time him the woman radu too all of them you agree that our father was right then tony made no attempt to hide his smugness he took pride if not pleasure in the fact that hed been wise to take angelos side in this matter eh francesco rounded on him and what difference does it make if that that disgusting thing was right yes yes of course he was right but isnt he always its his function to be fucking right and yours to bolster his bloody ego or so it seems to me necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley tony smiled thinly and said we were right then and before his brother could rage again which seems to mean that we now have a feud on our hands you and i and the people we control all of us under the er things guidance of course against this elusive character in the photographs his mistress bonnie jean mirlu and her people and the sleeping but by no means silent radu lykan because of that girl we took francesco was trying hard to control himself thats what angelo said tony nodded this radu he goes to war over a thrall while he himself is still in hibernation or whatever so it would seem then he must be pretty damn sure of himself again francescos outburst and again his brothers nod pretty damn sure of his thralls anyway what are we up against brother oh we now know what our intruder looks like but how did he do it where did he come from and where did he go and how angelo says he talks to dead people angelo babbles frequently yes but at other times hes perfectly lucid today he seemed lucid enough to me lucid and devious francesco snarled he took guy cavee knowing that he was innocent this intruder had no inside help and our bloody father knew it he was hungry tony shrugged as always and anyway it was your idea cavee was your example pacing to and fro francesco scowled and nodded grudgingly yesss he hissed he was but anyway it did produce results of sorts we appeased the old bastard and he did speak to us if only to talk rubbish some of it maybe but we do know the intruders name at least what harry british isnt it probably francesco picked up the vault photographs from a corner of his desk he looks british anyway tony took the initiative lets take a look at what weve got and try putting it all together weve been watching bonnie jean mirlu for years but from a distance recently because of angelos warnings weve been taking a lot more interest in her we could have had her taken out a long time ago but that would have alerted radus other thralls and it still wouldnt tell us the location of his lair so we waited more warnings from our father in his pit we saw an opportunity to grab one of mirlus people the girl we got very little out of her yet in a way we did at least she showed us how strong radus power is over his people even our father failed to get into her well in one way at least or perhaps she didnt know a lot but in any case she was only a thrall oh but she was one of his radus and apparently he cares for his own even from his secret lair how we were traced tracked down and discovered after all this time who can say but we were and last night the doglord struck back hit us where it hurts most so what use is money to such as him but as you and i know well enough in this modern world money is allimportant especially to someone attempting to reestablish himself who will doubtless build his own power base his own army and what a wonderful irony to fund it with the proceeds of a strike against his greatest his oldest enemies but we were not his enemies francesco burst out after two thousand years radus enemies were all dead long before we were born perhaps you should have paid more attention to our father when when you could have tony told him for to the wamphyri the blood is the life and a bloodfeud is a bloodfeud unending until until it ends this radu will seek to avenge himself yes even for alleged crimes committed against him in another world another time by an earlier generation another world another time francesco mimicked myths and legends and lies of course and tell me how would our dear father know about that anyway what why he never knew his father waldemar ferrenzig so what are his sources to all this wamphyri history what makes him such an authority anthony smiled wryly at what he could only assume was his brothers naivete his stupidity his petty argumentative nature now i know that you are playing word games he said or you are being stupid and arguing for arguments sake our dear father as you have it had centuries in which to research his forebears ill tell you something you dont know for you were away at the time in the usa rome berlin that was a most difficult period as youll perhaps recall what the second world war exactly you remember the american invasion of course i remember wasnt i your gobetween emilio francezcis spokesman in america didnt i bargain for lucianos freedom in return for a soft landing for the american invasion force and also to ensure that no shells fell in the vicinity of le manse madonie tony smiled that wasnt all you bargained for or with our dear father had told me about a plan hed been working on a saturation airraid on naziheld territory north of ploiesti in romania it called for pinpoint bombing i remember francesco answered there was to be a topbrass meeting of german strategists to redirect the course of the war they were losing this was a valuable piece of information that angelo wanted passed on to the americans the meeting place would be the target for the bombers who would then head south and raid the oil installations at ploiesti what of it necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley there were no german strategists north of ploiesti on the night of the st august tony told him just a village or a huddle of rich homes and fine gardens and in one of those houses a ferenczy what francesco frowned what are you saying our fathers brother a bloodson of waldemar but out of a different mother which is to say our uncle francesco lived there as he had lived there for hundreds of years his name was faethor and he was or might possibly become a threat such was our fathers research brother that he was aware of faethor without that faethor ever knew of him and such was such is his wicked intelligence that he had faethor removed without that he or we could ever be shown to have been involved that way if faethor had survived he would never know that the bombs that night were intended specifically for him but in any case he didnt survive and i never knew about this i was never informed francescos brows were black as thunder tony held up a hand placatingly you were the negotiator you were our liaison with the americans among others if you had known would your story have held the same conviction i arranged for the death of my own uncle before he could discover you and arrange for yours yes i dont know how i should take this take it as it was intended angelo he and i were protecting you us the francezcis without my knowing all these years you were away for years it was one thing one incident why i wouldnt have remembered it myself if you hadnt questioned our fathers authority in such matters but its as ive said he is an authority mainly as a result of research in his youth such research as led him to the conclusion that this was the way forward his way and our way our way strength in riches in secrecy in ritual silence francesco why are the sicilians the way they are omerta because of the mafia why is the mafia because of the francezcis why were we until last night untouchable because we are the heart of a secret empire of terror and why all or any of this because of angelo francezcis talents what but he knew something of everything even of the future and he knew that the blood wars were not finished huh francesco snorted the sins of the fathers indeed but out of another world and time did we inherit that too apparently along with everything else havent you enjoyed it then what and isnt it worth fighting for you say we werent the doglords enemies oh really but the ferenczys have been his enemies as long and longer than you or i can possibly remember when we took that girl to examine her we rekindled an old fire lit an old fuse yes and its burning down even now francesco we have to find him francesco was paler than ever him the intruder find him extract every ounce of knowledge and kill him but tony shook his head no we have to find them and i mean all of them the lykans the drakuls their aeries their thralls to the last man and we have to do it soon then and only then can we move against them and even then in stealth and secrecy a bloodfeud the other mused but again his brother disagreed i would call it a bloodwar he said oh yes for thats how hot it could get to be yet on the surface all must appear calm the world cant know we must use our wits as angelo used his it must be something like that bombing raid on those german strategists it is definitely coming then it has come and no use to plead innocence or ignorance for just like last time we ferenczys are the ones who started it damn it to hell francesco slammed a clenched fist down onto the desk top scattering papers to hell yes tony agreed or maybe to glory we have the advantage brother radu isnt back yet but were already here not only do we have the intelligence of a certain what disgusting thing but also of the mafia the kgb and even our several contacts in the cia as for this harry person whoever he is hell be out of sicily by now but we know where to find him with radus lady lieutenant bonnie jean mirlu and we certainly know where to find her and through her radu himself all very interesting francesco told him but havent you forgotten something like our vulnerability weve been hit once so whats to stop them doing it again i mean this harry fellow has to be a ghost indeed we have our fathers word for it that he talks to dead people hah we were vulnerable yes tony answered but no more from now on therell be day and night patrols guards outside the vault men on the walls and at every access or egress le manse madonie has to become a fortress and after that if we so much as smell a stranger within a mile of the place he left the threat unspoken finally francesco was convinced everything youve said makes sense he said especially what you said about intelligence so why not put our contacts to use in the past weve been in the business of selling them information so why dont we buy a little back lets not stick our own necks out or at least not too far but have the kgb and cia do brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i it for us our father tells us this harry is no common man huh as if we didnt have proof enough already but doesnt that mean he should be on record somewhere good tony was enthusiastic send out copies of these photographs if hes known then well know him too and meanwhile ill look to the security of this place we have a network brother so lets use it but slowly ohsoslowly and let me emphasize it again the world must never suspect must never know of our secret war for if it did know be sure the world would go to war too against us all of us our father says two to three years before radu lykan is up again that is when he will be at his weakest in the hour of his resurgence well two to three years should be time enough to find him so i repeat slowly slowly does it and lets be sure that whatever it is thats going down were not going with it harry keogh necroscope woke up in his house on the outskirts of bonnyrig one morning and discovered that two years had gone by he had known they were going of course but still it surprised him from autumn to autumn to autumn as if in a single night it was the colour of the leaves that told him some of them were turning again just as theyd been when he and bj had first started climbing together but two years as long as that maybe it was only one and feeling disoriented but even so knowing what he would find he checked his calendar two years yes and again he wondered about his memory alzheimers god no he was too young for that echoes of alec kyle his talent and all his problems was harry compensating for those glimpses of the future by losing fragments of his past but kyles problems in particular his drinking had disappeared merging with or being subsumed into harrys stronger identity and his dubious talent hadnt recurred not so far anyway but two years and as he got dressed harry tried to fill them in he had done a little searching for his wife and baby of course except now he sometimes forgot what brenda had looked like and this time it wasnt any kind of defect in his memory not longterm anyway he remembered her as a girl in harden on the coast and school holidays on the beach the woods long walks their first fumbling attempts at making love then a blank it was grief but harry didnt know that it was as if brenda had died and his mind had found ways to forget forget what shed felt like in his arms what he had felt like in her the adult part the meaningful part had been closed down he had found ways to close it down to forget if only to get to sleep at nights when he was on his own as for the baby nothing harry just didnt know couldnt remember a single feature of the baby but except to a mother arent all babies like that a baby is a baby and what the hell harry jr wasnt a baby any longer and had he ever been one he was an infant almost four years old now lost years from his fathers point of view and harry wondered would he even recognize harry jr or his mother if he were to pass them on the street but in any case he had done some searching personally that is and keeping it quite separate from the army of private investigators who were now working on his case the west coast of england maryport to blackpool the derwent at workington grockles in kissmequick hats on fifty different promenades blackpool and the illuminations and the tower like some garish beacon its lights liquidly mobile on a rainy night and of course the east coast again whitley bay seaton carew and redcar marske and saltburnbythesea whitby and robin hoods bay but all stereotypes images unreal somehow scenes that drifted on the surface of his memory unable to anchor themselves as if he had never been there at all except he must have for they were all places hed struck from his itinerary yet if he tried to focus on any specific place or moment nothing and time and again he remembered catching himself thinking someone is messing with my mind in the end hed given it up his search the personal side of it he would let the professionals do it except they seemed to be having as little luck as he himself and of course he had to fund them all the way or someone must fund them if not the necroscope and a good many someones had including the most powerful of japans yakuza families whose illicit earnings were such that they operated their own bank and several oilrich potentially dangerous potentates and a czechoslovakian arms manufacturer notorious for his dealings with terrorists so far it had cost twenty million pounds or the equivalent and the end was nowhere in sight another two or three months harry would have to topup his fund yet again but since there was no lack of rich villains that shouldnt be too hard but the idea of villainy the word itself the thought of it was sufficient to bring on other emotions first among them harry felt himself victimized by whom or what he couldnt say worse he too felt like something of a villain it wasnt his series of grand larcenies his fundraising activities as he liked to think of them because in that regard he felt more like some modern robin hood no it was his adultery it was his guilt and no matter how many times he reminded himself that his wife brenda had deserted him still he felt like the villain of the piece like some kind of animal yes the necroscope had never considered had never thought of people as animals before meeting bj but he did now for his sexual appetite when he was with her was certainly animal likewise hers love perhaps he was in love with her and she with brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i him but wild no perhaps about that together they were wild harry told himself that for him it was a sort of frenzied making up for lost time the taking back of something stolen from him if only by circumstances but at the same time he admitted to a fascination hed never known before no doubt about it bj was fascinating and for her what was in it for her just lust maybe in the beginning but harry felt it was deeper than that now how much deeper then what if he were to find brenda now what if she should change her mind decide to come back and suddenly appear where would bj fit in the scheme of things then and would he even want brenda back thus his guilt complex if that was what it was ran in circles and the idea of himself as some sort of lustful animal who cared only for his own sexual fulfilment was reinforced it perhaps explained his dreams harrys dreams specifically his nightmares had always been complex things but never more so than now while he could never remember the substance of certain parts the animal motif was always present the wolf fetish inspired no doubt by those events in london almost three years ago featured strongly he would dream of bj usually when he was alone and the nightmare would start when she was in his arms gazing into his eyes the moons rim would rise above the windowsill shining into her eyes and they would change from slightly slanted hazel ovals to feral yellow triangles then from the colour of gold to that of blood and finally finally they would drip blood then a swirl of strange motion and dark against the disk of the moon a silhouette always the same silhouette a wolfs head thrown back in a fullblooded howl thinking about this fragment was sufficient to bring it back into focus and sufficient to chill the necroscope to the bone even though the morning was warm and sunny brilliant sunlight streamed in through his bedroom window pooling on the polished boards of the floor while harry sat and shivered and listened to an ululant fading howl conjured from a dream he gave himself a shake slid his feet into shoes tried physical as opposed to mental activity he knew what he would like to do today talk to his ma how long had it been far too long he was sure she would be feeling neglected but how could he talk to her there were questions she was bound to ask that he couldnt possibly answer and if he guarded his thoughts she would know it at once would think he was hiding something and of course he would be hed be hiding bj bonnie jean the woman was always on his mind especially at this time of the month tonight was a full moon he wouldnt be seeing bj after two years he knew that she had her own moods did her own thing whatever it was at the full of the moon she was a woman it was all part of her cycle harry told himself and every threemonth without fail he could guarantee shed be off to her beloved highlands for three or four days on her own climbing and hunting no matter the season he remembered her promise to take him with her one of these days and in fact they had already set the date just a month from today well at least it would be something to do other than check the mail for endless negative reports on the whereabouts of brenda and the baby and so he looked forward to it and yet at the same time and without knowing why he didnt and neither did bj but the twoyear period of probation was up she was satisfied that harry had no ulterior motive that he was under no others influence he was fully trained in her climbing techniques not that she believed hed needed extensive training but at least it had been an excuse to keep him from the most dangerous climb of all until now for radu had finally decided it was time he met his manwithtwofaces this ohsomysterious one in the flesh even knowing that this was not the safest of times still the doglord had insisted that bj bring harry to the cairngorms lair and she knew that hed ordered it in spite of the danger because he now felt obliged to advance the hour of his resurgence dangerous times yes for radu and for bonnie jean and not least for harry for radu because of his vulnerability for bj because she suffered agonies of indecision the frustration of her own burgeoning vampire which constantly strove to defy and undermine the authority of her master and for harry because he was the catalyst several kinds of catalyst for one thing harry worked on bonnie jean she was used to him now wanted him for herself she was unwilling to envisage a future without him in thrall to her and herself partly in thrall to him well possibly and for another he worked on radu for the doglord saw harry as his future as an alternative to the possibility of a crippled diseased incapacitated body and finally he had worked and was working still on the francezcis harrys watcher had been seen again indeed on a number of occasions over the last two years bonnie jean had even seen him for herself she had spied him one night through the gauzy curtains of her garret bedroom an ominous shadow lurking in the dark doorway across the street keeping his furtive vigil and her girls had been followed to and from their various lodgings so that all of their comings necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley and goings the tracks and trails of b j s small pack were known occasionally one or another of the girls would report seeing a certain figure and face on a crowded street in the gloom of a warm evening it was festival time and the tourists were here in their thousands the castle on the rock was lit like a christmas tree normally it would be a good time for bj and the pack this or that lone stranger could so easily disappear in the thronging night bonnie jeans girls were goodlookers all but now they were wary as never before it was that face that figure that watcher whom they feared for bj knew him shed seen him before oh ten twenty thirty years before bright bird eyes in a rheumy wrinkled old face eyes that one second looked grey and the next shone dull silver like an animals at night bj understood that well enough for they were feral eyes thrall eyes the heavily veined nose flanged at its tip and the toowide looselipped mouth and aggressive jaws and the grey aged aspect of the face generally but just like herself he never changed or got any older and until now had been cautious not to show himself too frequently she had passed on details of this suddenly increased surveillance to radu of course which had perhaps determined him to accelerate his rising and now he would examine harry find out if he was a fit vessel for his resurgence and also to discover whether in fact he could be sent out into the world as an agent and put to good use prior to to his primary use and even though bj was worried about the possible loss of her lover in various ways the doglord wasnt for if indeed this harry keogh was the key to radus future why then it was already decided he was the one foreseen then surely he must be there at radus rising between times no harm could possibly befall him not between times oh the doglord knew only too well that the future was a devious thing but what was foreseen was foreseen as fixed as the moon in its orbit and nothing could change that these were facts which radu impressed upon bjs mind just as she had impressed her own facts upon harrys it had become necessary for the doglord had seen the way things were going with his longlived perhaps too longlived lady lieutenant as the seasons passed and the hour of radus true awakening drew ever closer so with each successive quarterly visit she paid him the doglord had felt bjs reluctance her resistance to his beguilment the way she seemed to be turning away from him he had known for many years of course that she was wamphyri but while he was fixed in the resin helpless vulnerable it was something hed been obliged to keep from her not that he doubted his own powers but that he was unable to assess the growing potential of hers for bj was that rarity among great vampires she had achieved her ascension neither by transfusion of an egg migration of a leech or the breathing of spores nor by a bite of conversion neartotal loss of blood and its replacement by copious amounts of metamorphic vampire essence the natural result of which would be undeath and true vampirism nor even as her birthright for all that bonnie jeans parents had been of the blood moonchildren theyd also been common thralls and for the greater part human much like auld john no none of these things had brought about bonnie jeans ascension for she had simply willed it oh thered been more to it than that the fact that her blood was tainted by more than four centuries of ancestral thralldom her regular contact over two more centuries with a source of purest vampirism and lycanthropy in the shape and form of radu the indefinite extension of her own existence at the expense of others but in essence it was the truth bonnie jean had willed it which was perhaps a measure of the vampire lady she could become if her master were to allow it which of course he would not in the past for the past two hundred years bj had been radus lifeline without which he could not exist by now but for her ministrations he would be a shrivelled truly dead thing in some millions of years when his mountain den had collapsed and his remains were excavated men would wonder at this bony relic out of time of which there was no other fossil record this dog or wolflike man homo lupus preserved in amber but that time would never come for which he should be grateful to her on the other hand she had outlived her span by a hundred years at least and was still young so she should be grateful to him well and she had been and loyal to a fault until recently for at last she had started to feel the influence of her own creature radu had sensed it in her he had tasted it in her blood how she was torn two ways between obedience to him and obedience to her instincts her burgeoning parasite but more than this he had sensed her uncertainty her fear her uncertainty with regard to the future bj knew that the ferenczys and at least one drakul were out there waiting would she be capable of handling them without radu and her fear of him oh he had promised her the moon but that was when she was a thrall now she was a lady and what about her harry how would he fare when radu was up again was he to be radu and if so in whose design would he have his mans body and aspect or the doglords bonnie jean was a lady aye but her thoughts and tumultuous emotions were as yet a womans set to raging by her parasite but a vampire is a vampire and a great vampire is wamphyri already she had doubts and in a hundred years the time would come when radu must deal with her he knew it so why not in the hour of his resurgence when his need would be greatest necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley the idea was nothing new he had considered it before but now it was more than merely a notion it was a necessity what but she loved a man a mere man radu had only told her to give her body not her soul that was his or if not his it belonged to whoever it was who gathered them when they were fled now that it was decided definitely decided the doglord looked forward to it that marvellous feast to come oh he had sipped of bonnie jeans nectar before but to take it all to take her as he had so often dreamed of doing to fill her on the one hand while draining her on the other the thought was delicious but he would save the most prized delicacy the gobbet of true delight until the last bjs immature parasite itself to break a fast of centuries so he lay in the yellow glue of his sarcophagus and surrendered himself to his leechs lust for of course these were not the doglords plans alone but mainly those of his vampire from which creature sprang everything that he was through his leechs talent or its vampire influence on his radu knew how the future would be something of it at least for he had been given to see it the mysterious one his eyes full of a weird and wonderful passion his new knowledge his new being perhaps in the wake of radus metempsychosis and the thrall bonnie jean a pallid husk all drained away to nothing and radu lykan risen from the resin burning bright as the moon in his glory and the world of men trembling tumbling thundering to its knees in the face of such a plague as to make the black death seem the most trifling thing but not a man of them would die from radus plague or not for long for they would all be wwdead not a man would die no but as for those who were already undead the ferenczys and drakuls radus ancient enemies out of time or their descendants well of course they would die most certainly the true death at last for them for a solution had dawned on radu even a final solution to a problem as old as olden sunsidestarside that in a vampire world which this world would be the only safe course for a lord of vampires was to be the only one let there be vampires galore aye but only one lord lord radu lykan wamphyri the ferenczys and the last drakul had their own problems one of which was common to both harry keogh except they didnt know him under that name or rather the ferenczys did through their father in his cavern pit but angelo francezci seemed to have given them the wrong name two years ago the francezcis many contacts had responded to a rare reversal when the brothers had sent out pictures of their intruder the thief in their treasury requesting information and over the next few months the answers had commenced to come in from longestablished families in italy and america and also from more recent branches in europe nothing to the cosa nostra the man in the photographs was an unknown quantity he wasnt on file from the brothers contact in the cia nothing indeed their man in the cia returned their substantial gift in crisp dollar bills with the recommendation that the francezcis suspend their inquiries concerning this man which only served to make them more curious yet and from their longtime contact and senior lieutenant in edinburgh a very disappointing nothing he had seen this man only once since when bonnie jean mirlu had tightened her security it was now more difficult than ever to keep track of her and the members of her pack and as for the man in the pictures he left no tracks at all the francezcis had answered by telling him to try harder which accounted for his increased surveillance and so far only sheer misfortune had kept him from tracking bj from her wine bar to the necroscopes house near bonnyrig misfortune and the fact that she was now doubly vigilant but from the kgb some eleven months after the francezcis dispatched their initial request for information at last a positive but baffling response yes their highranking gobetween with the kgb knew the man in the photographs to prove it he enclosed a microfilm of his own the pictures had been taken two years earlier in the chateau bronnitsy the soviet espionage centre on the night of the chateaus destruction by some unknown agency as for the man in these pictures he was alec kyle head of ebranch the british equivalent of the russian organization whose hq had been the chateau bronnitsy as a result of extreme methods of interrogation kyle had been braindead when the pictures were taken but he had been most certainly dead later that same night when the chateau was reduced to so much rubble and a great many of its staff with it there was no way he could have avoided that holocaust as for the cause of the destruction it remained to be ascertained but sabotage seemed probable and a connection however tenuous the name harry rang a bell one harry keogh had been an agent of this same ebranch but he too was dead and as circumstances would have it he too had died at the chateau bronnitsy also during a time of crisis and sabotage in which he had definitely been instrumental but that had been prior to the actual destruction of the place the two incidents were probably connected but if so the connection was restricted beyond this agents need to know in short he didnt have access to the relevant files the brothers had pressed for further information on british ebranch three months later a list of names branch operatives and brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i contacts had arrived at le manse madonie and also a warning this organization was the most secret of the british secret services and certainly the most effective in the field of extrasensory or parapsychological intelligencegathering no comparable opposition existed not since the destruction of the bronnitsy complex which perhaps said a lot in itself but in any case these people should be considered untouchables which gave the brothers pause until now they had thought that their organization their web with their diseased father at its centre was the only one of its sort and so it was in the field of criminal endeavour indeed the report in its entirety gave them pause for unless the man pictured on a mortuary trolley at the chateau bronnitsy had an identical twin he was quite definitely the intruder in their subterranean vault and he was the man in the street outside bonnie jean mirlus place in edinburgh but if the report was wrong and alec kyle was still alive and perhaps alive in his capacity as head of ebranch then what was he doing with bj mirlu was it possible that the doglord radu lykan had started recruiting in advance of his return and that he was recruiting such as these toplevel british espers what if the bronnitsy affair had been some kind of elaborate subterfuge to make it appear that kyle was dead and on the subject of death what had been their diseased fathers meaning when he said that this harry spoke to dead people one further request of their moscow contact with regard to the harry keogh mentioned in the first report produced a yet more thoughtprovoking result their informant was embarrassed that he must pass on such dubious information but then in his estimation the whole world of espionage was a very grey and dubious area the brothers could readily understand his reluctance as a hardboiled kgb doubleagent a very much down to earth secret policeman his mundane perception of such matters was bound to be a narrow one but to them his information was worrying indeed for this dead harry keogh an exmember of ebranch was believed to have been a necromancer a man gifted or cursed to commune with the dead in order to know the secrets of the tomb the coincidences were too many and anyway the brothers francezci were no firm believers in coincidence whatever was going on here it involved them bj mirlu the doglord radu lykan in his secret lair and apparently certain members dead or alive of britains security services enough it had been time to set wheels turning eighteen months had gone by since the incident in their treasure vault and their progress towards a solution and retribution seemed slow indeed they had to know more about this ebranch about alec kyle and about harry keogh but how might they investigate ebranch an organization of trained espers without alerting them more substantially to their presence and their interest their father could probably help the old ferenczy in his pit was after all their seer server oracle but he was ever more difficult given to rambling less in control of himself and if angelo knew anything at all why hadnt he already told them they must see if they could find some special tidbit for him something to goad him to greater effort also there was the list of ebranch operatives and contacts and on that list the name of a man who was not an esper as such but who was very skilled in the art of hypnotism sufficiently so that ebranch used him from time to time surely he would know something about the organization and if he did then the francezcis could get to know about it his name was doctor james anderson and meanwhile on the roof of the world daham drakesh the last drakul had a certain advantage over the ferenczys he had known of the worlds espionage organizations from the start indeed he was ostensibly employed by one such the peoples armys parapsychology unit in chungking under the command of colonel tsihong through tsihong he had been one of the first outsiders to learn of the destruction of the chateau bronnitsy also he had been kept updated on what little was known of the activities of british e branch this last was very important to him for radu lykan lay sleeping somewhere in the british isles while seeking out his den drakesh must take care not to cross tracks with ebranch for just like the ferenczys he knew what would result if men suddenly became aware of the monsters in their midst until now drakesh had been the most anonymous and secure of them all he would like to keep it that way but some two years ago by some weird process of synchronicity at about the same time the francezcis had been studying grainy photographs of their intruder drakesh had likewise received a set of pictures a series of snapshots from members of his sect in england and he had at once recognized several faces darcy clarke current head of ebranch trevor jordan a branch telepath and alec kyle but that was impossible comparisons with photographs in one of drakeshs numerous files had decided the matter despite a deal of evidence to the contrary alec kyle wasnt dead and the last drakul had jumped to an understandable but incorrect conclusion that for reasons known only to ebranch kyle was now working undercover in all likelihood hed been killed off to free him from mundane duties and obscure the fact of his involvement with more important matters or perhaps but sooner rather than later brian lumley he had died in order to protect himself but from what it had been a mystery that not even tsihong could solve but then again british ebranch was a mysterious organization and since drakesh was in no way involved the pictures and the report that accompanied them about a peculiar event in londons oxford street had been filed for future reference until recently but now suddenly ebranch was hot again the ferenczys were known to be buying information on alec kyle and other members of ebranch from their contacts worldwide they had even sent two of their lieutenants into england to strengthen their presence there drakesh had started to put two and two together one the doglords rising was close now he could feel it in his vampire bones two the ferenczys must likewise be aware of this three for some time now the british ebranch had involved itself in a great many hushhush affairs not least the bronnitsy thing now theyd attracted the attention of the ferenczys in what connection drakesh couldnt say and in conclusion four since from now on it might well prove too dangerous to keep an eye on ebranch drakesh should watch the ferenczys people in england instead drakeshs emissaries expert in discovering vampires had found little difficulty in tracing the extra thralls sent into england by the ferenczys through them they had also found the ferenczy sleeper and through him bonnie jean mirlu moreover they had succeeded where the sleeper had failed for through bonnie jean they had also found alec kyle both radus keeper and the supposed exhead of ebranch together now finally it all made some kind of sense and drakesh believed he had the whole picture ebranch were indeed aware of the menace in the midst of humanity something of it anyway aware of radu and possibly the ferenczys too but ebranch did not yet know radus whereabouts else they would have put him down and all subterfuge done with alec kyle was their undercover agent who had somehow found his way into the female thralls confidence or kyle had been recruited by her and if so how many others of these damned espers had radu got at as for the ferenczys perhaps they were still safe and were simply keeping a wary eye on the whole thing to see which way it went well daham drakesh knew which way it would go it would appear that he was the only unknown factor in this entire equation and he intended to stay that way but for some time now hed searched for a way to play the role of agent provocateur and finally the opportunity had fallen right into his hands he had a triangle of forces here all in deadly opposition just waiting to be unleashed at each others throats the doglord radu necwscope the lost years vol i tfdrtej t ee ch and the called stu eve ft r remained to choose the it begins september harry and bonnie jean were driving north through the grampians en route for the cairngorms in the boot of her hired car surprisingly little by way of climbing gear harry had turned out to be a natural and bj was mainly scornful of such equipment and in any case she was planning to use the easy route to radus lair on the badenoch flank of the cairngorms that way she could save time by making a kill food for radus waking warrior on the way up harry was in conscious mode he was for the moment himself and not under any mental constraints other than the deepseated posthypnotic commands of james anderson and those of bonnie jean herself of course in short he continued to hide his talents as best he could and bj continued to be an innocent but strong or wrongheaded young woman she was also his lover and harry was loyal to a fault or things might not be so easy for her or so hard radu had been partly right there were other ways to enthrall a man but some swords are twoedged physically the necroscope was fit and well but mentally or subconsciously he was constantly uneasy his worries mainly unspecified which seemed something of a contradiction in itself were many and despite that he hid it from bj as far as possible he often felt paranoid that was the only way to describe it the omnipresent feeling that he was the victim of some malicious plot his memory however was much improved especially since giving up his search for brenda on a personal level on the other hand his sleep continued to be plagued by grotesque nightmares he could never remember in his waking hours but which he knew had grown worse than ever all he ever recalled of them was that they involved the great majority the teeming dead who were desperately trying to convey some message which he wasnt allowed to receive and a picture of his necroscope the lost years vol i beloved ma her face filled with concern and her arms thrown wide open as if to protect him from the tumult of their thoughts and lingering over as he struggled to bring himself awake always there would be that familiar moon motif with a howling wolfs head in silhouette oddly these dreams didnt come when he slept with bonnie jean she seemed to act as a buffer against them and something of a paradox too that in the conscious waking world he found the dead less inclined to his company while sensing in them an air of expectancy hard to define penny for them said bonnie jean luring the necroscope from his inwardprobing thoughts she spoke mainly to fill the unaccustomed vacuum between them an emptiness which in her case at least felt like an ache in her bones growing there from the moment radu had told her to bring harry to him a total blank he lied not wanting to worry her i was just lying back enjoying it the ride you can drive if you like on the other hand it would be better if he didnt they were travelling north and it was past noon if she let him drive she would be uncomfortable in the warm sunlight coming through his window he shook his head elevated his seat a little sat up and glanced out of the window almost unnoticed summer had slipped quietly away and made room for autumn the trees were beginning to shed their leaves red gold and umber slipping by outside the car and the occasional glossy blur of an evergreen where are we i chose a different route er from my usual one she began to explain then realized there was no need harry hadnt been out this way before anywhere north of the firth of forth would be new to him i just thought i dont know a change of scenery she fiddled with her sunglasses adjusting them on the bridge of her nose the real reason she was taking a different route was to break the routine and confuse anyone such as the watcher who might try to follow her also since she had rarely if ever sensed an intrusion during daylight hours it had seemed a good idea to make the trip in daylight a change of scenery he said well thats why were here but i asked where were through blairgowrie heading for pitlochry she told him does that help shouldnt have asked he shrugged and showing a rare flash of humour its all irish to me scottish she admonished but the smile as quickly fell from her face too and she wondered what he was really thinking the man inside this man for the man inside knew why they were here where they were going and who he would be meeting but the man inside was a prisoner in his own mindcell and he couldnt be set free couldnt necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley think his real thoughts except by special command to bonnie jean suddenly harry seemed much less than a whole man he felt like some kind of zombie sitting here beside her or a puppet waiting to jerk into life the moment she pulled his strings and she felt guilty she didnt like it but the fact of the matter was he would only become a zombie or a puppet if and when she commanded it then he would know would remember everything she had told him and not be able to do a damned thing about it he was so much under her control that she felt sorry for him but at the same time maybe something of understanding had surfaced at that the atmosphere between them felt unusual uneasy unnatural and now and then if she looked at him suddenly out of the corner of her eye was that an accusing look on harrys face if she were a faithless wife it might be just exactly the sort of curious vaguely doubting look she would expect from a husband who halfsuspected or was she just imagining it oh harry raised an eyebrow hed caught her giving him just such a look as shed imagined just wondering she said and before he could ask what after pitlochry within the hour we should be back on my usual route and into the forest of atholl plenty of places along the way to stop and picnic if you like or maybe a little cafe in the woods for tea it all sounded so weak so treacherous even to her own ears yes or especially so whatever you say he said which for some reason irritated her out of her mind bad enough that it was whatever she said when he was totally under her influence but here he was like like a lamb on his way to the slaughter and maybe not now not this time but soon too soon he really would be do you put that much bloody faith in me then she blurted glaring at him whatever i fucking say he was taken by surprise why yes why not oh mah wee man bj cried out to herself yet still managing to surprise herself if only it were possible to break the chains on his mind and set it free set him free to fly fly like a small frightened bird it would be worth almost anything she thought it and at once denied the thought what and betray a cause shed worked for for two hundred years and defy her master radu and throw away her own chance of immortality and prove once and for all and beyond any reasonable doubt that she could never be a lady wamphyri but must always be a snivelling woman ridiculous it was her immature leech fighting back fighting for its life against a power as strong as anything it ever met before which it didnt couldnt possibly understand bonnie jeans emotions boiled over she glanced at harry he had tucned his face away to look out of his window damn he was simply ignoring her outburst as if she were a child probably because he subconsciously understood only too well what was going on and there and then in broad daylight even at the wheel of the car bj felt the change coming and couldnt stop it it was as though she stood outside herself watching in horror frozen by her own hypnotic talent she could even feel the eyeteeth her dogteeth curving up through pinksheathing gums cutting the flesh she could taste the blood on her gums her blood as yet harry glanced ahead jerked upright cried christ the road and the lady in her was banished and bj back in charge for now at least she slammed on the brakes hauled on the wheel almost physically dragged the car round a sharp lefthand bend harry was thrown against her and as they collided bj came close to losing her sunglasses she knew her eyes would be crimson but had to put every effort into bringing the car to a halt the righthand wheels bumped up onto the grass verge the hedgerow made a sharp scraping against her window her driving mirror was bent back and the car stopped the necroscope collapsed his mobius door where he had instinctively conjured it across the dashboard it had been a close thing if they had crashed been thrown forward by now they would be in the mobius continuum nothing he could have said or done would have fooled bonnie jean this time no druginduced hallucination would have covered it he wiped the sweat from his brow and said did i say something bj thumped the steering wheel with both hands glared at him and burst out laughing then in the mirror she saw the blood on her lower lip and sucked it inside her mouth hurt he said at once solicitous i bit my lip she lied you he shook his head what happened i wasnt paying attention to my driving she answered i suppose im just a bad driver thats all a badtempered driver anyway lets get on to the forest of atholl then he said i could use a cup of tea now not to mention a leak which set her off laughing again a few minutes later cresting the next wave of foothills bj saw the rim of a full moon so pale it was almost transparent rising over a hazy bluepastelled horizon perhaps it explained something she hoped so anyway they found a tea shop sat outside under the trees relaxed a little and as they sat there bonnie jean sighed and surrendered her problems to fate what would be would be and anyway who could secondguess necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley the future but this man this harry oh his attraction his power over her was strong she knew it could be argued that hers over him was stronger but hers was artificial some of it how much was real she wondered she lay back in her chair eyes closed behind the lenses of her sunglasses and said harry you know you havent mentioned her in a long time when he failed to answer she opened her eyes a crack to squint at him he was frowning staring at a long low stationwagon where it had just pulled into the car park opposite the tea shop she followed his gaze something harry didnt answer just sat there staring but as the occupants of the vehicle got out and headed up the path under the trees to the tea house he averted his eyes turning them on bonnie jean instead and when the shuffling singlefile of redrobed asiatics had passed he said i saw this bunch or one like it in london once other places too hari krishna types she said shrugging pretty harmless really do they bother you the tinkling of tiny golden bells faded and died away as the group went into the cafe harry came back to life smiled and said bother me not much they dont talk to you or look at you theres no eyecontact they just do their own thing but after that he couldnt seem to relax and by the time the redrobes had come out of the tea shop and found themselves a table he was ready to move on and bj noticed as they drove away how the frown was back on his face how he kept staring into his rearview mirror long after the tea shop sign had disappeared into the distance behind them the roads were good and traffic light to nonexistent but after their nearaccident bj was taking it easy if there was even the suspicion of a scenic shortcut she would take it and the closer she got to her destination the slower she went stopping off at the slightest excuse for the view or a chance to dabble her feet in cool water over rounded pebbles whatever they even pulled off the road and slept for an hour cuddled up on a patch of heather in the lee of tall rocks where harry had to fix a blanket over a couple of dead branches for shade hed done so protesting that there was hardly enough heat in the sun to bother with it but bj was afraid of sunburn finally as they covered the last few miles to inverdruie the light began to fade the mist crept up from the streams and writhed in the copses and the wooded slopes took on a cloaked mystical look out of legend the lights of cottages clustering at junctions and crossroads twinkled like elffires while the backdrop of the mountains black against an indigo v of starstrewn sky seen through the pass might easily be the facade of a gigantic set on some cosmic stage the gloaming bj commented as she pulled off the road and turned tightly behind auld johns cottage parking the hire car in the shadows of birch and rowan in which the necroscope whisperingly answered all the jocks go aroaming the wee lads and lassies aye laughing lightly she got out of the car ah but if only her heart were as light as her laughter and what about his harry didnt quite know what to make of auld john but then he didnt quite know what to make of anything right now his heart seemed to spend most of its time in his mouth which was why he made jokes whenever he could and his nerves were stretched to breaking he supposed it was some kind of paranoia the latest attack of this ridiculous persecution complex but auld john was something else bj had told harry that the old gillie used to work for her uncle the one with the hunting lodge and that while he was very respectful and trustworthy he was also very proper and maybe just a bit peculiar understatements on all counts harry thought the old man didnt grovel but he came close and not just to bonnie jean but also to the necroscope bowing and scraping he was very nearly obsequious almost like a cringing dog who wants so badly to be petted but thinks he might be kicked but as for proper no doubt about it when bonnie jean went up to her tiny garret bedroom the old man stayed downstairs with harry in bjs absence he referred to her as the wee mistress a verah special lady well and so she might have been once upon a time harry supposed when shed used to stay at her uncles lodge after a while bj called auld john upstairs and for ten minutes or so harry could hear them talking but couldnt make out what was said then auld john came down again and offered him a nightcap a wee dram shid put ye away nicely aye a guid nichts sleep cannae hurt a man maybe not but the necroscope refused anyway if he was climbing tomorrow he would need a clear head and when auld john took harry upstairs he made a point of showing him the toilet directly opposite the necroscopes tiny room just sos ye cannae be mistaken ye ken yes he kenned well enough and the wee mistresss room was at the other end of the corridor with all those creaking floorboards in between wherever auld john was in the house hed be sure to hear those boards but in fact they didnt creak once bj was far lighter on her feet than necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley harry and the way she was able to manoeuvre her way around a dark house was quite remarkable so thought the necroscope while deep inside he didnt find it remarkable at all but he was glad she came anyway on this night of all nights it seemed to have meaning other than sex indeed it must have since they didnt make love but were content enough simply to lie in each others arms the morning was grey overcast and bj seemed pleased and in fairly good spirits pleased with the weather anyway the necroscope couldnt say how he felt odd might best describe it they breakfasted took auld johns car bj didnt say why and headed southwest along a road that paralleled the spey on their right and the cairngorms on their left it was early and the roads through the valley were empty how far harry asked as they turned onto the main road his voice and mood were very subdued just three or four miles she told him and then because she had been doing a lot of thinking and dreaming during the night she abruptly changed the subject harry would you mind telling me your thoughts about life life he was looking in his rearview mirror again birth life death the whole thing i mean how do you view it youre still young we are young but we get old we die and its all over harry knew all about that knew how wrong she was that death wasnt the end and it wasnt all over but that was something he couldnt talk about right now though he could lie because without consciously thinking about it he was in control of himself but maybe he didnt have to lie thats a bit morbid isnt it he said whats brought this on oh i dont know she answered trying to find a way to explain its just that as we get older we seem to leave so much behind family friends even lovers especially lovers one partner is older or gets old faster and dies faster and leaves the other to go on it seems unfair makes having someone to love seem pointless doesnt it is this us youre talking about are you worrying about the future she sighed and said i ask a question and you answer it with a question she could switch him on of course and find out how he felt that way but in their situation that would be unfair and what if she didnt like the way he felt but very well if its important to you he said the way i see it life is some kind of learning process we are bom and we dont know anything except were hungry we grow older and we start to learn things eventually were educated we figure we know everything except life isnt like that the older we get the more there is to understand and less time to understand it so that by the time we die which was something he knew all about were only just coming to the conclusion that we dont know any fucking thing and then we really wise up except its too damn late for by then we cant tell anyone how clever we are but what if we didnt get old bj said i mean what if we didnt have to if there was a way to avoid it she knew she was treading on thin ice she must be careful not to bridge the gap between harrys conscious and unconscious knowledge it wouldnt do to have the two start leaking into each other she neednt have worried for harry wasnt listening suddenly his knuckles were white where his fingers gripped his arm rest and his gaze was riveted to his rearview wing mirror bj glanced in the central rearview mirror and gave a start what the the stationwagon from yesterday with at least two occupants from the redrobe troupe was bearing down on them like a hawk stooping to its prey and the way it was coming it seemed aimed at their car at them so that a thought flashed unbidden through harrys mind is this it i saw their monastery that was kyles talent warning me about my future are these people the end of my future a bunch of kamikaze monks trying to force us off the road is it as simple as that and is that whats been bothering me somehow knowing that this was creeping up on me the car behind pulled out looked like it would overtake and bj gasped is that what they are all they are roadhogs what idiot issued a driving licence to this maniac she gave way and applied her brakes which probably saved their lives as the stationwagon rocketed forward and overtook them it swerved violently to the left cutting in on their vehicle the collision between the rear end of the stationwagon and the front of auld johns car threw the latter to the left the road ran parallel to a grass and weedgrown ditch on that side but right at this point there was a rickety wooden bridge that went angling off over the ditch to a woodlands track just how bj managed to control the steering and turn onto the bridge harry couldnt say it seemed more likely that the shock of the collision was responsible that it had physically shifted the front of their car to the left in another moment the bridges boards were rattling and shuddering under bjs wheels and then they were into the woods and slowing down bad driving she gasped that wasnt bad driving that was fucking deliberate harry was looking ahead the track curves right probably back onto the road dont stop but follow it through the trees if it was deliberate they may be waiting for us necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley so what good will that do he gritted his teeth and said at least well know it was deliberate well know to protect ourselves and maybe to hit back hit back she stamped on the brakes stopped and threw open her door how harry were in the middle of nowhere and unarmed well with one exception in the boot of the old car her crossbow she got it came back to her driving seat passed the weapon to harry he looked at it and almost had to shout what because the ancient engine had decided to start racing youll want to hit back wont you she yelled for it had sunk in that they really might have to shed been expecting something like this for as long as she could remember had known it must come eventually but like this bonnie jean what the hells going on he said grating the words out did it have to do with him alec kyles talent or with her and if with her why she was an innocent wasnt she but again innocent of what oh load the fucking thing she snapped and as he made to do so honk hoooonk they looked back and there it was the long black lowslung now sinisterlooking station wagon it was maybe ten to fifteen paces behind them halfhidden in dangling foliage its front doors open and leaning on the doors the driver and his frontseat passenger even as harry and bj stared the driver reached inside the car and honked again then cocked his head on one side and smiled harry looked at their faces eyecontact and knew from that moment that whatever this was it was lifeendangering serious in the dappling of the trees their eyes were feral full of yellow shifting light and their grins were almost vacuous like the grins of crocodiles or hyenas filled with malice almost unnoticed bj had taken the crossbow from him he saw the grins slip from the faces of the redrobes as they fell into crouches behind their doors saw their slanted eyes narrow heard the vibrating electric thrummm of the crossbows string and in the next splitsecond bjs bolt slammed home into the panel of the drivers door burying itself deep the driver was inside the car now straightening up behind the wheel he called out to his passenger that one had reached inside the car come back out with a machinepistol almost of its own accord the necroscopes mobius math commenced evolving on the screen of his metaphysical mind but before he could conjure a door bj had the car in gear fishtailing as the rear wheels threw up a screen of dirt then they were round a bend bumping through birch and rowan and onto a bridge in worse repair than the first one and finally back onto the road then as bj put her foot down without saying a word harry took up her crossbow and reloaded it but as he slowly carefully put it down again he said i thought they might have something against me but now im not sure you were sure you must have been because innocent people dont go shooting at people for being bad drivers so whats going on bj what do these men have against you she didnt answer but looked in her driving mirror and saw at a glance that it was time to switch him on definitely because the black stationwagon was coming at them again and bj knew she couldnt handle this on her own harry mah wee man she yelled as the rear window shattered showering diced glass inwards and something hot buzzed and spanged inside the car are you listening do you understand you can talk normally listening yes he mumbled dazedly as the moon blinked out the wolf quit howling and the inner man surfaced understand no his voice was like a childs uncertain afraid i told you the time might come when i would send you out after them the ferenczys and the drakuls he cut her off well now theyve come for us vampires harry said and as suddenly as that his voice had changed this was the man shed first seen in a dark garage in london the one in the alley after he had got her out of trouble the one who had faced up to big jimmy in bj s wine bar then for the first time in a long time she remembered just who he was supposed to be radus mysterious one maybe he was at that so it should come as no surprise that this harry was a very hard very cold one up ahead the road narrowed to a single lane on the left the righthand lane was coned off for some forty or fifty feet where the surface was badly potholed but it was a sunday and no one was working also on the right a wooden fence guarded the road from a steep descent to the river if a car went over it would keep right on going until it hit the water just as bj entered the defile harry reached his foot over and stamped on the brake the car behind was almost on top of them it skidded right then sharp left its nearside tyres skipped over the ditch which was shallow here and it ran nose first into a clump of springy saplings that bent over with its weight and finally stopped it it would take a little while to untangle but shit harry said as he released the brake and bj shot auld johns car forward again what she was jubilant but we stopped them only for a little while he said then they were round a slight lefthand bend and the road ran brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i straight ahead for maybe a mile or more at the end of the mile the road was cut into the hillside on the left at another lefthand bend while on the right the drop was sheer to dense woodlands drop me here harry said what she looked at him out of the corner of her eye drop me here he repeated harshly she gave a snort what and do you think youre the lone highwayman or something or something he nodded youll jump out and surprise them will you drop me now before they come round that bend back there and see us he said she saw that he was serious theyll kill you no they wont harry shook his head this is what i do remember so she dropped him but as the necroscope headed for the trees at the side of the road he called out now go like hell that car of theirs is more powerful if theyre not back on your tail in a couple of miles youll know i got them then you can come back for me and if they are he left it at that and watched from cover as bj drove away harry fixed the contours of the forested hillside ahead in his minds eye and registered the coordinates he would have liked to doublecheck them but didnt have the time then conjuring a mobius door he made a jump to the attic of his house in bonnyrig it took only a moment or so to collect what he needed and make a return jump back into the trees at the side of the road speeding southwest auld johns car had almost reached the place where the road was cut into the hillside but in the opposite direction just coming into view and rocketing down the road the black stationwagon at the speed they were going theyd catch her in about two minutes harry stepped back under the leafy cover of the trees and a moment later felt the blast of pressured air as the black car swept by he had forty seconds but needed only nine or ten one took him to a location on a bald bluff high over the road midway between the two cars two took him down again to where the road bent under a rocky wooded almost overhanging granite formation and three to ten saw him climbing just a few feet to a ledge where daisies sprouted in the cracks where he was able to crouch down out of sight but yet keep an eye on the road in that position by reaching out a hand he would be able to touch a passing car but simply to touch the stationwagon wasnt his purpose he had just less than thirty seconds bj was a halfmile farther down the road and her pursuers were on their way harry peeked out around the rim of the rock and calculated time and distance twenty seconds fifteen ten the necroscopes calculations were almost perfect he took a combination of deadly items from his pockets and armed them then held them a little awkwardly both in one hand and his time was up no more than two or three seconds left when he leaned out and swung his arm towards the open car window releasing the grenade and cs canister into the blurred interior in the last moment the occupants of the stationwagon had seen him the passenger the redrobe with the machinepistol was on harrys side he had jerked the top half of his body back into the car as the necroscope swung at his window but he had seen what had flown inside after that the activity in the stationwagon became frantic a blur of motion all to no avail in just a moment the car began to swerve left and right as its interior filled with yellow gas and the redrobe with the gun reached out and grabbed hold of the roofrack trying to drag himself out through his window then the windows blew out and the roof blew off taking the one with the machinepistol with it the vehicle had travelled maybe a hundred and fifty feet beyond harrys position but he threw up an arm to shield himself anyway as the blast licked out and thunder shook the air and the echoes started to come bouncing down from the valley walls and when he looked the cars top looked like it had been peeled or cut loose by a giant canopener it was floating in the air over the car turning lazily like a leaf and the redrobe had let go of his gun and was hanging onto the roofrack clinging to it for his life but both the car and roof were still travelling at more than sixty miles an hour and though the bend in the road was slight it certainly wasnt a straight line the stationwagon went through the wooden safety fence as if it were balsa wood then seemed to very gradually nosedive into the canopy of trees and the roof with its hangeron went fluttering after the necroscope halfexpected a second blast but it didnt come just the sound of branches shattering followed by the squeal of wrenched twisting metal several dull thuds and silence harry found a way down to the wreckage he could have used the continuum but wasnt in too much of a hurry despite the blast that redrobe who had been clinging to the roof as if it were a liferaft had still looked fairly agile a vampire it was possible hed survived the fall he would have come down on top of the car however which wouldnt have made for a happy landing the trees were dense and the way dark beneath them birds mainly wood pigeons were starting to settle in their branches and cheep and brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i coo again after the initial shock maybe that was a good sign looking back harry could just make out the broken fence through the foliage canopy and looking ahead through the undergrowth down the steep leafmould slope under the trees a flash of bright water caught in a stray sunbeam when he stepped over the freshly fallen branch of a tree its bark ripped back he knew he must be close the slope was very steep here lots of leafy debris had come down from above the necroscope began skidding on his heels deliberately aimed himself at the bole of a huge tree an oak he thought well over three feet in girth to slow himself down above him the canopy was dense with patches of daylight showing through and one unmistakable large patch of dangling broken branches using the great gnarly roots of the oak as hand and footholds harry scrambled around the bole of the tree and was there directly overhead trapped in a tangle of branches the twisted dented wreckage of the stationwagons roof lay horizontal on a platform of crushed foliage like a metal blanket flung carelessly into the tree and down below the vehicle was standing on its nose which had dug in then crumpled as the soil compacted its rear end was trapped compressed in a fork of mighty branches else the impact might easily have caused the petrol tank to explode maybe better if it had the necroscope thought better for the driver anyway for the driver was still in the car pinned like a fly on the column of his stripped steering wheel where the blast of the grenade had thrown him his face had come forward so that his chin was resting on the frame of the shattered windscreen and crimson trails were seeping from his ears nose and mouth down the vertical crumpled bonnet and dripping into the dark soil but his yellow asiatic face was mobile drooling grimacing and even as harry watched his eyes opened inverted but on a level with his own eyes they looked straight at him and he saw how red they were in their cores then the mouth blew red bubbles and made a noise and a bloodied broken hand twitched up onto the window sill of the sprung door it jerked and trembled there making feeble beckoning motions and those awful eyes pleaded the redrobe was asking for help oh sure the necroscope said and stepped back a pace but even if this one had been human or especially if he were human thered be no helping him several pulsating loops of lacerated intestine were dangling out from under the drivers door dripping blood somewhere overhead back through the tunnel of trees the drone of a cars engine coughed into silence and in the next moment a shout came echoing on the suddenly still air harry where are you bj she must have seen the broken fence and guessed something of what had happened down here harry called back which startled the wood pigeons again set them fluttering and broke the awestricken mood of the place be careful how you go its steep and the thought struck him just like we were out rambling except they werent out rambling and there was monstrous danger here what about the other redrobe then smelling a new but no less lethal danger he stepped back another two paces and began circling the suspended vehicle along with the blood seeping into the soil there was a shimmering pool of vaporizing fuel in the area of the buried fender a trail of petrol led back to the fractured tank he became aware of bjs sounds as she descended towards him through the trees but suddenly everything felt wrong what about the vampire who had been clinging to the roof where was he and just who was it who was coming down the slope under the trees anyway thinking of the one who had been on the roof of the stationwagon had caused the necroscope to glance up into the tree again at which precise moment there was movement the twisted blanket of metal tilted a little and a tattered blackened sleeve once red came into view but the hand projecting from the sleeve continued to hang on to the roof the roof tilted more yet and the redrobe came fully into view he was conscious furious he saw harry directly beneath him and snarled his eyeteeth were fangs then he let go his hold slid from the roof facedown and fell directly towards the necroscope harry hurled himself backwards missed his footing tried to conjure a door the vampire was on all fours muscles bunching to spring his robe was in tatters limbs and body a mass of cuts and scratches and his face was a mask out of hell bj stepped over harry aimed her crossbow almost pointblank squeezed the trigger the bolt sprang free buried itself to the flights in the redrobes heart he had seen her at the last moment and had started to come erect her bolt seemed to knock him backwards limbs flailing as he collided with the door of the stationwagon and slid to a sitting position then his mouth spat a stream of bloodied froth his eyes closed and his head slumped onto his chest and bj panted harry your lighter she was shaken yes but there was a snarl in her voice too harry collapsed the invisible door he had conjured a little way down the slope into which hed been about to hurl himself he fumbled out a cheap cigarette lighter flipped its top and struck fire he knew what bj would do as they scrambled away from the car and its occupants he did it for her he tossed the lighter in a lazy arc into the pool of vaporizing fuel it brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i hadnt even hit the ground before blue flames licked up enveloped the car making a whoosh and a roar that threw out a wall of heat bj and harry kept going they were into the trees covered by the mossy boles of a clump of birch trees when the tank blew and when they looked out the car was an inferno the explosion hadnt shaken it loose but already the foliage around was on fire burning furiously nothing was going to get out of that hell alive but still they kept watching look and learn bj said hoarsely one of them must be a lieutenant a job like this could never have been trusted entirely to mere thralls harry knew she was right and knew which one was the lieutenant the driver he said remembering how his eyes were crimson in their cores she glanced at him frowned and said oh she might have been about to say something else but a sudden commotion in the blazing car stopped her it was the driver for while his passenger was content to sit there and melt and drip he wasnt through the envelope of blueshimmering heat the lieutenants redrobed blazing figure was plainly visible twitching and jerking with all his limbs spastically threshing he lifted his head from the window sill and seemed to look out through the wall of fire but his eyes were peeled white things with no sight in them dead bj grated but his metamorphic flesh wont accept it it wants to go on wants more even as she spoke the chest and guts of the thing in the burning vehicle erupted putting out corpsewhite tentacles or feelers to lash in the superheated confines of the car bunching together they blossomed outwards through the stripped roof and upward into the fiery slipstream and floated there in the furnace updraft like the arms of some crippled anemone other tentacles uncoiled out of the door opened at their tips and pissed an orange fluid all around that steamed where it fell to earth then the thing gave in withdrew its melting appendages crumpled down into itself and began to slop out of the door around the shoulders of the blazing thrall body fats were on fire now and the stink of roasting flesh was sickening it masked what was left of the cs smell which bj had taken to be part of the natural stench of the accident that one had been a vampire oh for quite some time she said if he wasnt wamphyri it was close now we have to go its over and we dont want to be found here and harry who could still converse normally said this was just two of them there are four more that we know of i know she said taking the lead and heading back up the slope under the trees our trip is off i have to talk to auld john but by telephone they might have tracked us from his place if theyd held back just a minute or two they might even have followed us to to radu in his lair harry said she heard the confusion in his voice looked back and saw it in his face and she believed that she understood right now he was switched on to the reality of things he knew that she was in thrall to radu lykan wamphyri he knew that he was working for radus agent bonnie jean against those of other vampire lords the myth of their mutual affection the bond he and bj had established might have been compromised harry might have begun to suspect that he was being used therefore perhaps she would be wise to erase this entire episode from his mind but not here indeed the sooner they got away from this place the better and so its okay she told him over her shoulder til explain things in the car then anything you dont understand will seem oh very much simpler and there might be one or two things she would like him to explain to her too like how how did you do it they were heading south for dalwhinnie despite that harry was still under her spell he couldnt answer her andersons directive came first that he must protect his talents at all cost wherefore he must lie beginning to sweat he said i played the highwayman as you suggested left it to the last second and jumped out on them if the driver had had a moment to think he might have recognized me run me down but he didnt he tried to avoid me swerved and never regained control but are you crazy she gasped you could as easily have died if theyd kept coming i was ready to jump back into the bushes it was them or me or you you did it for but there she paused for she really didnt want to know this that harry had done it for her she preferred to believe hed done it because of her hypnotic programming didnt she but in any case his answer had thrown her completely off track so that she didnt think to ask how he had covered the mile from the place where shed dropped him to the spot where the station wagon had gone over the edge and she didnt even wonder why hed been so quick off the mark with his cigarette lighter but the necroscope knew why he hadnt wanted to give her time to notice the condition of the wrecked cars interior the fact that he had bombed it that would only have led to more questions and he wasnt sure hed have any satisfactory answers but in any case there were no more questions never could be in brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i connection with this episode for long before they got to dalwhinnie bj had already wiped it from the necroscopes mind told him it had been a nightmare to merge with all the others and that he should simply forget it unnoticed by the pair as they had pulled away from the accident site another car parked on the grass verge three hundreds yards back from the bend had come to life pulled out onto the road rolled silently forward and stopped where the fence was shattered and black smoke climbed in a column from the canopy of riverside trees to the bluegrey sky the driver a slight man dressed in a lightweight black raincoat buttoned to the neck a huge white hat with a floppy brim and sideshielded sunglasses got out and made his way quickly down into the woods following bj s and the necroscopes tracks and his nose he was soon at the scene of fiery devastation the fire was burning uphill through the tinderlike undergrowth towards the road which would form a natural firebreak thus the blazing vehicle clearly visible as the source of the fire was approachable likewise visible were the two blackening corpses one slumped behind the wheel and the other seated upright beside the sprung door keeping well back from the fire the slight man swept the scene with eyes that were birdbright yellow in the shade of his hat a glistening black steaming object roughly the size and shape of a cucumber hissed and made crackling noises some distance from the inferno it shuddered and lay still even as the slight man took up a dead branch to prod it between this object and the car a trail of sticky slime suggested that it had made its own way to where it had died it was dead yes but it couldnt be left lying there or sooner or later someone would be sure to examine it and that wouldnt do at all so using his branch the man in the raincoat twitched the leech back into the inferno into the furnace heat of the redglowing car that should do it then without further ado the little man made his way back to his own vehicle and drove quickly away from the scene it was time he made report to his masters in sicily in dalwhinnie bj phoned auld john and told him what had happened told him to bring her car where to leave it and where he would find his own car and when hed got that straight she said and now its up to you john are you up to it the weathers guid he answered barely managing to contain his elation and ahll take the easy way up dinnae fret

so be it said bonnie jean and put the phone down epilogue it was still the early hours of the morning in dalwhinnie in scotland but some two hours earlier in the drakesh monastery on the tingri plateau it had already been midday the whiterobed initiate whom harry keogh had seen tramping the white waste to the face in the rock was at last ready ready to face his final challenge the last rite of purification and longawaited acceptance into the drakesh sect he had been cleansed of all earthly sins all vices of the flesh the mind and the soul he had endured all the rigours of life in the monastery its austerity celibacy secrecy its lack of communication which was forbidden all of the selfdenial of the brotherhood without being a part of that brotherhood without its acceptance in short for the two long years that he had lived here hed lived a lie for unknown to him and two others just like him they were the only ones who had suffered the austerity celibacy and silence as for the rest of the brothers they had survived their initiations long ago now they had their master daham drakesh to give them succour now they bathed in the blood which is the life the tainted blood of their own now they had each other moreover they had the women of the drakesh township the produce of their farm and fields the warmth of their cringing bodies in the dark of night their blood in however small a measure to provide at least a taste of the feasts to come ah for their master provided for them in this monotonous white wilderness no less than he would provide for them in the outside world when at last it was his when it was theirs and except that they must not impregnate the women or drain them to death or undeath or weaken them beyond their capacity to work nothing was forbidden to the brothers but the only the ultimate the unforgivable sin would be brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i the denial of the vampire lord daham drakesh himself and its punishment but there were diverse ways in which sinners or even innocent men such as initiates might serve in the monastery of daham drakesh this initiate that figure in white whom the necroscope had seen marching with three priests in front and three behind was ready for his final ordeal in the preceding two years he had fasted for weeks at a time at other times he had survived on yaks milk coarse bread and pale honey for a month now his diet had been such that hed lost ten pounds in weight and now weighed a little over one hundred and five pounds and this was a young previously healthy man of eighteen years his ordeals had been fasting freezing loneliness celibacy which scarcely counted since hed never known a woman in his life selfdenial hard work and fear the last because there were sounds in the monastery and an aura work had been the first when for months he must toil to dig his own cavelet from the solid rock because he was forbidden to have a bed until he had a place to put the bed the rest had been likewise obligatory he could only eat what the brothers gave him speak if or when spoken to masturbate at his own peril the sensitivity of the brothers and especially of daham drakesh was frightening they could smell sex they seemed to have the power to smell the very thought of it but he had been cleansed of outside influences his body reduced and refined his mind numbed and daham drakesh who was skilled in the arts of seeing without being seen of knowing without being known and of hearing without being heard found him pleasing drakesh took pleasure in purity and innocence perhaps because he had never had any of his own but he knew where to get it the high priest took his time arriving at the room of the rite first he visited the cavern of the creatures hybrid vampire things waxing in their vats they would be warriors eventually the first of many then as it had been in sunsidestarside so it would be here and every high place an aerie each deadly day a time of curfew and the nights ah the nights would belong to daham drakesh in five ten fifteen years a long time aye but what is time to the wamphyri the cavern of the creatures no one was allowed down here but daham drakesh himself and a handful of his lieutenants if any common thrall should enter this place he would be fortunate indeed to leave drakesh looked down into a vat its gelatinous surface surging with long slow ripples they waxed his beasts they could be brought on quickly if need be or they could lie here another hundred years waiting to be born then he looked at the troughlike conduits that serviced the vats rust coloured runnels carved in the rock umbilical sluices to feed the foetal abnormalities being bred here that fool in chungking colonel tsihong would have drakesh breed human warriors well and so he would so he was as witness the brotherhood but tsihong knew nothing of such as these as the lord of vampires inspected his vats so there had commenced a familiar combination of whistling cracking sounds from somewhere overhead the acoustical quality of the monasterys chambers was remarkable and now it came a trickle at first but gradually swelling the red tide the lifeblood of the brothers given of their own free will gurgling down the sluices to the vats then in the heart of every liquid womb a sluggish stirring as vaguely outlined occupants sensed the flow of rich red food daham drakesh smiled in his fashion and moved on he had seen all of this before he left the foetal vatthings to their gluttony climbed stone stairs to the chamber of the trough the longaccustomed scene of silent ritual flagellation and from there took long loping forwardleaning strides to the room of the last rite of initiation he was eager now the sight of the crimson flow in the cavern of the creatures and the bloodtinged mist over the trough of silent agony had set vampire juices working drakesh had his own needs no less than the waxing creatures in his vats of metamorphic creation except his needs were more selective the initiate was waiting clad in white kneeling between a pair of redrobed acolytes drakeshs lieutenants he elevated his eyes as the master entered and at once lowered them the room was small square highceilinged at one end a nearvertical fluelike slot had been hewn into the solid rock wall six feet high from the floor this chimney was sealed by a massive block of stone stepped on one side like a dais a pulleysystem in the ceiling dangled long ropes of chains fitted with clawlike grapples to one side a cart was piled with blocks of ice that were slowly welding themselves together a stairwell in the opposite wall went down into darkness with the sinuous ease of the wamphyri drakesh moved to a position in front of the initiate placed a slender hand on his bowed head and said my son are you sure are you prepared his voice was almost gentle almost compassionate do you desire to exchange your white robe for the red robe of a brother indeed master the initiates voice was no more than a squeak his fear was such that he might almost have said no but he would not give in now especially not in the presence of drakesh in his sight he would never dare to admit defeat look at me the master of the monastery commanded the face of the initiate was drawn his eyes were hollow his yellow necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley skin pale as saffron parchment with fine blue veins showing through he smelled of youth innocence and everything that drakesh was not and the vampire smiled and began to explain the test the chimney will house you standing upright with your head bowed to your chest as if you bore the weight of the world but nothing so great be assured these brothers will place blocks of ice above you two or three depending on your fortitude this room is not especially cold and the ice will melt soon enough but the process will be greatly accelerated by the generation of heat from your own body this then is your ordeal my son the weight of the ice its slow cold drip the confines of the chimney all these things against your determination your force for life finally when the last few shards of ice slip down around your feet and you climb out it will be over and you will be a brother he clapped his hands no more explaining into the chimney the redrobed acolytes climbed the dais with the initiate and helped him down into the chimney drakesh stood watching as they operated the pulleys began loading blocks of ice onto the shoulders of the youth but master that one called out the sound of his voice muffled now there are tiny holes in the floor a great many certainly drakesh called back so that the water from the ice can flow out and the air can flow in what and should i let you drown or suffocate more blocks of ice went into the shaft stacked on top of each other they fitted well and because the chimney inclined back into the wall a little they could not topple forward all of their mass was focused on the youth who now cried out master the weight his voice was strained his words a series of panting grunts an ordeal is an ordeal drakeshs answer was cold as the ice itself less than that and it becomes a mockery but his very tone of voice was a mockery while his feraleyed acolytes grinned and plied the pulleys the column of ice reached up eight feet above the hole in the wall now its weight was that of five men as another block was released from the grapples and slid into place so the column settled an inch or two in its slot and feeling the sudden rapid compression of his body the initiate panted so much faster and louder his voice becoming a screech of protest i cannot master im being crushed my knees are against the wall my back is breaking cry out my son drakesh called back it will ease your pain pant and groan even as your mother groaned when her body opened to spit you into the world she gave you life as you now give it to me and as the acolytes worked at the rattling pulleys daham drakesh descended the stairwell into the room beneath this room of torture it was cold and as he disrobed he shuddered a very little but not from the cold it was an almost sexual shudder of anticipation against one wall of this lower chamber the floor had been scooped out into a shallow basin as drakesh stepped naked into the basin he looked up in the ceiling directly overhead contained in an area of some eighteen by eighteen inches a hundred small holes had been drilled through to the base of the torture chimney through these holes through the very rock he could hear the frantic screams of his victim and coming to him from the stairwell the relentless rattling of chains finally there was one last recognizable word a throbbing mmmother followed by a shriek to end all shrieks that echoed quickly into silence and a splintering sound that went on and on and all that remained was a slow crunching and squelching the compression of flesh and bone into jelly then as the rattling of the chains continued unabated the warm red rain of drakeshs shower commenced to smoke down upon him but a worse horror was yet to come for as drakesh opened his jaws in a yawning gape turned up his face and threw wide his spindly arms to the crimson spattering deluge so his parasite leech took over and all semblance of control of anything remotely human was surrendered now as the thing inside drakesh revelled in this its lifesource its being its cursed continuation revelled in the blood of an innocent drakeshs olivemarble skin took on a mottled life of its own his metamorphic flesh rippled over the bones of his face chest body and limbs the pores of his skin opened like small pouting mouths like the tiny flowers of some hybrid cactus in a rare desert rainstorm lapping with their own tongues at the juice of a man where it followed the contours of drakeshs writhing tormented form it went on for a long time after the pulley chains had stopped rattling and the acolytes were gone in haste from the upper chamber then as drakesh recovered from his awful ecstasy and staggered from the basin and the tiny mouths closed and his skin flowed back into a corpselike but unblemished whole pain such a burning agony drakesh hissed his terror fell back against the wall and gazed crimsoneyed on his burning flesh what was this was it possible hed made a terrible mistake had the initiate been a leper some kind of plaguebearer but no this wasnt his parasite complaining the pain wasnt his it was in his mind mentalism telepathy a sending from far far away but it was so necroscope the lost years vol i brian lumley real so immediate so psychically in tune with him that it could have only one possible source flesh of drakeshs flesh his bloodson and chief lieutenant four and a half thousand miles away in scotland drakesh opened himself to it accepted part of the pain in order to enter the mind behind it and he was right it was his bloodson sent out into a foreign land and sent there to die apparently the flames melting away his body his vampire flesh cutting into the very heart of him to the creature inside and his injuries so great as to be almost irrepairable utterly irrepairable in combination with the fire hoping to discover the cause of his sons funeral pyre its perpetrators drakesh attempted deeper penetration of the tormented mind but even vampire flesh can be weak in the face of the ultimate truth the true death it would not be easy to communicate with the terrified mentality behind the dying but still drakesh tried who he sent and how if you would be avenged you must try to tell me my son the how of it came at once for it was there fresh in the burning mind the sensesnumbing blast of heat and light inside a speeding vehicle the crash through a fragile fence and headlong plunge into high branches the jarring cessation of an illusory slowmotion falling as the wrecked car slammed down nosefirst into earth and at last it was time for the pain for the knowledge of a devastated body to sink in and its agony to wash outwards but before it could wash all the way to drakesh he sent and now who the man the woman the answer came back from a mind even now boiling in its steaming skull show me and daham drakesh looked out through a shimmering wall of blue fire at the faces and forms of his sons destroyers the man in the london photographs of course this alec kyle and radu lykans female thrall protectors of an ancient enemy and one who must now be aware that his enemies were abroad in the world the faces the identities were there and they were gone liquefying along with the mind that sent them last faint echoes of pain receding the flames dying out the sending ending along with the sender shocked scarcely realizing the full gravity of the thing as yet daham drakesh dressed himself and his fingers trembled and he saw again the enigmatic face of the man in his bloodsons sending and in the oxford street photographs that ohsohuman face masking its ohsoweird intelligence and again the master of the monastery shuddered not from anticipation this time but from the cold and no ordinary cold but that of the alien void behind the mans eyes however briefly then it was as if the vampire sensed the fall of a strange and threatening night whose taloned shadows were reaching for him even now two days later but again early in the morning the necroscope harry keogh came awake to the ringing of his telephone he had slept late and dreamed strange dreams of the great majority talking about him but not to him and as he focused his eyes on his travelling clock so the time clicked over from to the telephone extension beside his bed continued to ring and harry reached out and picked it up he had long since lost hisactual terror of the thing despite that it still conjured fleeting disturbing motifs now as his dreams faded away and his waking mind sharpened he grunted uh did i wake you for a moment harry didnt identify the gravelly voice on the other end of the line but then it registered and he said ben ben trask and he thought ebranch now whats up but what could be up except that theyd maybe heard something and sharper now giving it all of his attention he said ben is it about brenda sorry harry trask answered at once but no it isnt about brenda were still on it of course but nothing so far its just that its been quite a while now and we thought it was time we spoke we darcy and the rest of us to find out how the worlds treating you you know it came hard for trask to lie a liedetector in his own right it went against the grain harry nodded despite that the other couldnt see him im okay mainly and you people routine not that anything ever is routine around here and apparently theres some weird shit in your neck of the woods too so this was something other than a purely social call the necroscope made no attempt to disguise his sourness as he inquired so what is it ben can we get to the point and wheres darcy shouldnt he be making this call or are you trying to get at the truth of things eh and what would i have to lie about anyway an accident well an incident up there in jock territory trask answered didnt you read about it but he made no comment on darcy clarkes whereabouts i only get sunday papers harry told him so what are we talking about here the necroscope was curious now and cautious whatever it was why was ebranch talking to him about it something he might have been involved in he hadnt robbed any banks in scotland had he an incident trask repeated on the spey north of the forest of atholl just a couple of days ago on the river what kind of incident curiouser and curiouser harry brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol i and bonnie jean had been up that way until shed cried off their climb she hadnt felt up to it or perhaps shed thought he wasnt up to it near the river trask said a car went off the road and burned out its occupants too horrific but the police found a weapon evidence of a fire fight there were two bodies members of a tibetan sect the home office seems to think theres some kind of sectarian war going on there were already a dozen of these types in england and another six on their way in they work carrying the word or whatever in teams of six the ones on their way in have been turned back six more in london have been told to leave the country which leaves four of these people still unaccounted for and the necroscope said when it seemed trask was done what has all of this to do with me a slight pause and its for information only harry i mean since you happen to be up that way im not your eyes and ears in scotland ben i thought it was understood now im out of the branch im gone for good trasks voice was cooler as he answered were not asking anything harry just passing something on thats all well thanks the necroscope told him just as tersely and is that it thats it take care of yourself said harry and without waiting for an answer put the phone down at the london end trask looked at darcy clarke standing beside him and growled i didnt much like that i could see and hear the other nodded i understand and totally agree now forget it and tell me what you think trask shook his head its a funny one he said i got the impression he thinks hes telling the truth thinks from his point of view trask tried to explain he was telling the truth he wasnt involved in whatever it was that happened up there and yet i cant swear ive only rarely come across this complication before a complication where i trust someones word implicitly and so must consider my own talent suspect still i agree with you the whole thing up there whatever it is has necroscope stamped all over it and by the way the same goes for you whats that darcy didnt understand that complication i mentioned trask stared hard at him when it comes to harry i get much the same feeling about you i mean trust you all the way darcy but somehow i get this feeling that you dont after trask left his office darcy sat at his desk and thought about it and sighed for he knew that trasks talent wasnt in question the esper had been right darcy didnt trust himself or at least he didnt trust the decision he had made that time more than three years ago his loyalties continued to be divided between branch security and the wellbeing of a friend and harry was still under those posthypnotic strictures imposed by dr james anderson just how they were affecting his life who could say but on the whole darcy liked to believe that his decision had been the right one this thing with these redrobed priests out of tibet was a case in point okay so harry wasnt involved but supposing he had been what if these religious fanatics had known about his talents and had been hunting him down for their own purposes surely it was better for all concerned that harry had been neutralized in that respect of course it was yet still darcy felt guilty well it was something he would just have to learn to live with in his house outside bonnyrig the necroscope absentmindedly heaped pillows and sat back against them frowned at the telephone and wondered what all of that had been about redrobed tibetan monks of course he knew something about them that in some way or other they or their monastery were tied up with his future but that was all maybe in the not so distant future he would try to find out more but as for the recent past a couple of corpses in a burnedout car and evidence of a sectarian war was there a connection if so it wasnt even beginning to make itself apparent for the moment at least he must let it go at that it was all he could do for the fact was that the conscious waking harry keogh really didnt know a thing about it it had been excerpted from his life like a page lost from a manuscript and there was only one person who could rewrite it since she wasnt likely to or wasnt ready to for now it had become a part of the lost years
