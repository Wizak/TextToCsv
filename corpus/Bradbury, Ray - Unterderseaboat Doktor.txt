 unterderseaboat doktor the incredible event occurred during my third visit to gustav von seyfertitz my foreign psychoanalyst i should have guessed at the strange explosion before it came after all my alienist truly alien had the coincidental name von seyfertitz of the tall lean aquiline menacing and therefore beautiful actor who played the high priest in the film she in she the wondrous villain waved his skeleton fingers hurled insults summoned sulfured flames destroyed slaves and knocked the world into earthquakes after that at liberty he could be seen riding the hollywood boulevard trolley cars as calm as a mummy as quiet as an unwired telephone pole where was i ah yes it was my third visit to my psychiatrist he h called that day and cried douglas you stupid goddamn son of a bitch its time for beddybye ray bradbury beddybye was of course his couch of pain and humiliation where i lay writhing in agonies of assumed jewish guilt and northern baptist stress as he from time to time muttered a fruitcake remark or dumb or if you ever do that again ill kill you as you can see gustav von seyfertitz was a most unusual mine specialist mine yes our problems are land mines in our heads step on them shocktroop therapy he once called it searching for words blitzkrieg i offered ja he grinned his shark grin thats it again this was my third visit to his strange metalliclooking room with a most odd series of locks on a roundish door suddenly as i was maundering and treading dark waters i heard his spine stiffen behind me he gasped a great death rattle sucked air and blew it out in a yell that curled and bleached my hair dive dive i dove thinking that the room might be struck by a titanic iceberg i fell to scuttle beneath the lionclawfooted couch dive cried the old man dive i whispered and looked up to see a submarine periscope all polished brass slide up to vanish in the ceiling gustav von seyfertitz stood pretending not to notice me the sweatoiled leather couch or the vanished brass machine very calmly in the fashion of conrad veidt in casablanca or erich von ray bradbury like jack nicklaus hits a ball bamm a hand grenade that was the sound my germanic friends boots made as he knocked them together in a salute crrrack gustav mannerheim auschlitz von seyfertitz baron woldstein at your service he lowered his voice unterderseaboat i thought he might say doktor but unterderseaboat captain i scrambled off the floor another crrrack andthe periscope slid calmly down out of the ceiling the most beautiful freudian cigar i had ever seen no i gasped have i ever lied to you many times but he shrugged little white ones he stepped to the periscope slapped two handles in place slammed one eye shut and crammed the other angrily against the view piece turning the periscope in a slow roundabout of the room the couch and me fire one he ordered i almost heard the torpedo leave its tube fire two he said and a second soundless and invisible bomb motored on its way to infinity struck midships i sank to the couch you you i said mindlessly it i pointed unterderseaboat doktor at the brass machine this i touched couch why sit down said von seyfertitz i am lie down id rather not i said uneasily von seyfertitz turned the periscope so its topmost eye raked at an angle glared at me it had an uncanny resemblance in its glassy coldness his own fierce hawks gaze his voice from behind the periscope echoed so you want to know eh how gustav von seyfertitz baron woldstein suffered to leave the cold ocean depths depart his dear north sea ship flee his destroyed and beaten fatherland to become the unterderseaboat doktor now that you mention i never mention i declare and my declarations are seabattle commands so i noticed shut up sit back not just now i said uneasily his heels knocked as he let his right hand spider to his top coat pocket and slip forth yet a forth eye with which to fasten me a bright thin monocle which he screwed into his stare as if decupping a boiled egg i winced for now the monocle was part of his glare and regarded me with cold fire why the monocle i said idiot it is to cover my good eye so that neither ther eye can see and my intuition is free to work oh i said ray bradbury and he began his monologue and as he talked i realized his need had been pent up capped years so he talked on and on forgetting me and it was during this monologue that a strange thing occurred i rose slowly to my feet as herr doktor von seyfertitz circled his long slim cigar printing smoke cumuli on the air which read like white rorschach blots with each implantation of his foot a word ca out and then another in a sort of plodding grammar sometimes he stopped and stood poised with one leg raised and one word stopped in his mouth to be turned on his tongue and examined then the shoe went down the noun slid forth and the verb and object in good time until at last circling i found myself in a chair stunned for i saw herr doktor von seyfertitz stretched on his couch his long spider fingers laced on his chest it has been no easy thing to come forth on land he sibilated some days i was the jellyfish frozen others the shorestrewn octopi at least with tentacles or the crayfish sucked back into my skull but i have built my spine year on year and now i walk among the land men and survive he paused to take a trembling breath then continued i moved in stages from the depths to a houseboat to a wharf bungalow to a shoretent and then back to a canal in a city and at last to new york an island surrounded by water eh but where unterderseaboat doktor where in all this i wondered would a submarine commander find his place his work his mad love and activity it was one afternoon in a building with the worlds longest elevator that it struck me like a hand grenade in the ganglion going down down down other people crushed around me and the numbers descending and the floors whizzing by the glass windows rushing by flickerflash flickerflash conscious subconscious id egoid life death lust kill lust dark light plummeting falling ninety eighty fifty lower depths high exhilaration id ego id until this shout blazed from my raw throat in a great allaccepting panicmanic shriek dive dive i remember i said dive i screamed so loudly that my fellow passengers in shock peed merrily among stunned faces i stepped out of the lift to find onesixteenth of an inch of pee on the floor have a nice day i said jubilant with selfdiscovery then ran to selfemployment to hang a shingle and next my periscope carried from the mutilated divested castrated unterderseaboat all these years too stupid to see in it my psychological future and my final downfall my beautiful artifact the brass genitalia of psychotic research the von seyfertitz mark nine periscope thats quite a story i said damn right snorted the alienist eyes shut ray bradbury and more than half of it true did you listen what have you learned that more submarine captains should become psychiatrists so i have often wondered did nemo really die when his submarine was destroyed or did he run off to become my greatgrandfather and were his psychological bacteria passed along until i came into the world thinking to command the ghostlike mechanisms that haunt the under tides to wind up with the fiftyminute vaudeville routine in this sad psychotic city i got up and touched the fabulous brass symbol that hung like a scientific stalactite in midceiling may i look i wouldnt if i were you he only half heard me lying in the midst of his depression as in a dark cloud its only a periscope but a good cigar is a smoke i remembered sigmund freuds quote about cigars laughed and touched the periscope again dont he said well you dont actually use this for anything do you its just a remembrance of your past from your last sub yes you think that he sighed look i hesitated then pasted one eye to the viewer shut the other and cried oh jesus i warned you said von seyfertitz for they were there unterderseaboat doktor enough nightmares to paper a thousand cinema screens enough phantoms to haunt ten thousand castle walls enough panics to shake forty cities into ruin my god i thought he could sell the film rights to this worldwide the first psychological kaleidoscope in history and in the instant another thought came how much of that stuff in there is me or von seyfertitz or both are these strange shapes my maundering daymares sneezed out in the past weeks when i talked eyes shut did my mouth spray invisible founts of small beasts which caught in the periscope chambers grew outsize like the microscopic photos of those germs that hide in eyebrows and pores magnified a million times to become elephants on scientific american covers are these images from other lost souls trapped on that couch and caught in the submarine device or leftovers from my eyelashes and psyche its worth millions i cried do you know what this is collected spiders gila monsters trips to the moon without gossamer wings iguanas toads out of bad sisters mouths diamonds out of good fairies ears crippled shadow dancers from bali cutstring puppets from geppettos attic littleboy statues that pee white wine sexual trapeze performers allezoop obscene fingerpantomimes evil clown faces gargoyles that talk when it rains and whisper when the wind rises basement bins ray bradbury full of poisoned honey dragonflies that sew every fourteenyearolds orifices to keep them neat until they rip the sutures aged eighteen towers with mad witches garrets with mummies for lumber he ran out of steam you get the general drift nuts i said youre bored i could get you a fivemilliondollar deal with amalgamated fruitcakes inc and the sigmund f dreamboats split three ways you dont understand said von seyfertitz i am keeping myself busy busy so i wont remember all the people i torpedoed sank drowned midatlantic in i am not in the amalgamated fruitcake cinema business i only wish to keep myself occupied by paring fingernails cleaning earwax and erasing inkblots from odd beanbags like you if i stop i will fly apart that periscope contains all and everything i have seen and known in the past forty years of observing pecans cashews and almonds by staring at them i lose my own terrible life lost in the tides if you won my periscope in some shoddy flybynight hollywood strip poker i would sink three times in my waterbed never to be seen again have i shown you my waterbed three times as large as any pool i do eighty laps asleep each night sometimes forty when i catnap noons to answer your million fold offer no and suddenly he shivered all over his hands clutched at his heart unterderseaboat doktor my god he shouted too late he was realizing he had let me step into his mind and life now he was on his feet between me and the periscope staring at it and me as if we were both terrors you saw nothing in that nothing at all i did you lie how could you be such a liar do you know what would happen if this got out if you ran around making accusations my god he raved on if the world knew if someone said his words gummed shut in his mouth as if he were tasting the truth of what he said as if he saw me for the first time and i was a gun fired full in his face i would be laughed out of the city such a goddamn ridiculous hey wait a minute you it was as if he had slipped a devil mask over his face his eyes grew wide his mouth gaped i examined his face and saw murder i sidled toward the door you wouldnt say anything to anyone he said no how come you suddenly know everything about me you told me yes he admitted dazed looking around for a weapon wait if you dont mind i said id rather not and i was out the door and down the hall my knees jumping to knock my jaw ray bradbury come back cried von seyfertitz behind me i must kill you i was afraid of that i reached the elevator first and by a miracle it flung wide its doors when i banged the down button i jumped in say goodbye cried von seyfertitz raising his fist as if it held a bomb goodbye i said the doors slammed i did not see von seyfertitz again for a year meanwhile i dined out often not without guilt telling friends and strangers on street corners of my collision with a submarine commander become phrenologist so with my giving one shake of the ripe fruit tree nuts fell overnight they brimmed the barons lap to flood his bank account his grand slam will be recalled at centurys end appearances on phil donahue oprah winfrey and gerarldo in one single cyclonic afternoon with interchangeable hyperboles positivenegativepositive every hour there were von seyfertitz laser games and duplicates of his submarine periscope sold at the museum of modern art and the smithsonian with the super inducement of a halfmillion dollars he forcefed and easily sold a bad book duplicates of the animalcules lurks and curious critters trapped in his brass viewer arose in popup coloring books pasteon tattoos and inkpad rubberstamp nightmares at beastsrus unterderseaboat doktor i had hoped that all this would cause him to forgive and forget no one noon a year and a month later my doorbell rang and there stood gustav von seyfertitz f baron woldstein tears streaming down his cheeks how come i didnt kill you that day he mourned you didnt catch me i said oh ja that was it i looked into the old mans rainwashed tearravened face and said who died me or is it i ah to hell with it me you see before you he grieved a creature who suffers from the rumpelstiltskin syndrome rumpel stiltskin two halves with a rip from chin to fly yank my forelock go ahead watch me fall apart at the seam like zipping a psychotic zipper i fall two herr doktor admirals for the sick price of one and which is the doktor who heals and which the sellout bestseller admiral it takes two mirrors to tell not to mention the smoke he stopped and looked around holding his head together with his hands can you see the crack am i splitting again to become this crazy sailor who desires richness and fame being sieved through the hands of crazed ladies with ruptured libidos suffering fish i call them but take their money spit spend you should have such a year dont laugh im not laughing ray bradbury then cheer up while i finish can i lie down is that a couch too short what do i do with my legs sit sidesaddle von seyfertitz laid himself out with his legs draped over one side hey not bad sit behind dont look over my shoulder avert your gaze neither smirk nor pull long faces as i get out the crazyglue and paste rumpel back with stiltskin the name of my next book god help me damn you to hell you and your damned periscope not mine yours you wanted me to discover it that day i suppose you had been whispering dive dive for years to patients half asleep but you couldnt resist the loudest scream ever dive that was your captain speaking wanting fame and money enough to chock a horse show god murmured von seyfertitz how i hate it when youre honest feeling better already how much do i owe you he arose now we go kill the monsters instead of you monsters at my office if we can get in past the lunatics you have lunatics outside as well as in now have i ever lied to you often but i added little white ones come he said we got out of the elevator to be confronted by a long line of worshippers and supplicants there unterderseaboat doktor must have been seventy people strung out between the elevator and the barons door waiting with copies of books by madame blavatsky krishna murti and shirley maclaine under their arms there was a roar like a suddenly opened furnace door when they saw the baron we beat it on the double and got inside his office before anyone could surge to follow see what you have done to me von seyfertitz pointed the office walls were covered with expensive teak paneling the desk was from napoleons age an exquisite empire piece worth at least fifty thousand dollars the couch was the best soft leather i had ever seen and the two pictures on the wall were originalsa renoir and a monet my god millions i thought okay i said the beasts you said youll kill them not me the old man wiped his eyes with the back of one hand then made a fist yes he cried stepping up to the fine periscope which reflected his face madly distorted in its elongated shape like this thus and so and before i could prevent he gave the brass machine a terrific slap with his hand and then a blow and another blow and another with both fists cursing then he grabbed the periscope as if it were the neck of a spoiled child and throttled and shook it i cannot say what i heard in that instant perhaps real sounds perhaps imagined temblors like a glacier ray bradbury cracking in the spring or icicles in midnight perhaps it was a sound like a great kite breaking its skeleton in the wind and collapsing in folds of tissue maybe i thought i heard a vast breath in sucked a cloud dissolving up inside itself or did i sense clock machineries spun so wildly they smoked off their foundations and fell like brass snowflakes i put my eye to the periscope i looked in upon nothing it was just a brass tube with some crystal lenses and a view of an empty couch no more i seized the view piece and tried to screw it into some new focus on a far place and some dream bacteria that might fibrillate across an unimaginable horizon but the couch remained only a couch and the wall beyond looked back at me with its great blank face von seyfertitz leaned forward and a tear ran off the tip of his nose to fall on one rusted fist are they dead he whispered gone good they deserved to die now i can return to some kind of normal sane world and with each word his voice fell deeper within his throat his chest his soul until it like the vaporous haunts within the perikaleidoscope melted into silence he clenched his fists together in a fierce clasp unterderseaboat doktor of prayer like one who beseeches god to deliver him from plagues and whether he was once again praying for my death eyes shut or whether he simply wished me gone with the visions within the brass device i could not say i only knew that my gossip had done a terrible and irrevocable thing me and my wild enthusiasm for a psychological future and the fame of this incredible captain from beneath nemos tidal seas gone murmured gustav von seyfertitz baron woldstein whispered for the last time gone that was almost the end i went around a month later the landlord reluctantly let me look over the premises mostly because i hinted that i might be renting we stood in the middle of the empty room where i could see the dent marks where the couch had once stood i looked up at the ceiling it was empty whats wrong said the landlord didnt they fix it so you cant see damn fool baron made a damn big hole up into the office above rented that too but never used it for anything i knew of there was just that big damn hole he left when he went away i sighed with relief nothing left upstairs nothing i looked up at the perfectly blank ceiling nice job of repair i said thank god said the landlord ray bradbury what i often wonder ever happened to gustav von seyfertitz did he move to vienna to take up residence perhaps in or near dear sigmunds very own address does he live in rio aerating fellow unterderseaboat captains who cant sleep for seasickness roiling on their waterbeds under the shadow of the andes cross or is he in south pasadena within striking distance of the fruit larder nut farms disguised as film studios i cannot guess all i know is that some nights in the year oh once or twice in a deep sleep i hear this terrible shout his cry dive dive dive and wake to find myself sweating far und my bed
