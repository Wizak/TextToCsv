 my lady green sleeves his name was liam o leary and there was something stinking in his nostrils it was the smell of trouble he hadnt found what the trouble was yet but he would that was his business he was a captain of guards in estates general correctional institutionbetter known to its in mates as the jugand if he hadnt been able to detect the scent of trouble brewing a cellblock away he would never have survived to reach his captaincy and her name he saw was sueann bradley detainee no wfar he frowned at the rap sheet trying to figure out what got a girl like her into a place like this and what was more important why she couldnt adjust herself to it now that she was in he demanded why wouldnt you mop out your cell the girl lifted her head angrily and took a step forward the block guard sodaro growled wamingly watch it auntie oleary shook his head let her talk sodaro it said in the civil service guide to prison administration de tainees will be permitted to speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings and oleary was a man who lived by the book she burst out i never got a chance that old witch mathias never told me i was supposed to mop up she banged on the door and said slush up sister and then ten minutes later she called the guards and told them i refused to mop the block guard guffawed wipe talk thats what she was telling you to do capn you know whats funny about this this bradley is shut up sodaro captain oleary put down his pencil and looked at the girl she was attractive and young not beyond hope surely maybe she had got off to a wrong start but the question was would putting her in the disciplinary block help straighten her out he nibbed his ear and looked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail waiting for him to judge their cases he said patiently bradley the rules are you have to mop out your cell if you didnt understand what mathias was talking about you should have asked her now im warn ing you the next time hey capn wait sodaro was looking alarmed this isnt a first offense look at the rap sheetyesterday she pulled the same thing in the mess hall he shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner the block guard had to breakup a fight between her and another wench and she claimed the same businesssaid she didnt under stand when the other one asked her to move along he said virtuously the guard warned her then that next time shed get the green sleeves for sure inmate bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears she said tautly i dont care i dont care oleary stopped her thats enough three days in block he snapped and waved her away it was the only thing to dofor her own sake as much as for his he had managed by strength of will not to hear that she had omitted to say sir every time she spoke to him but he couldnt keep it up forever and he certainly couldnt over look hysteria and hysteria was clearly the next step for her all the same he stared after her as she left he handed the rap sheet to sodaro and said absently too bad a kid like her has to be here whats she m for you didnt know capn sodaro leered shes in for conspiracy to violate the categoried class laws dont waste your time with her capnshes a figgerlover captain oleary took a long drink of water from the fountain marked civil service but it didnt wash the taste out of his mouth what got into a girl to get her mixed up with that kind of dirty business he checked out of the cell blocks and walked across the yard wondering about her shed had every advantagedecent civil service parents a good education everything a girl could wish for if anything she had had a better environment than oleary himself and look what she had made of it evening capn a bleary old inmate orderly stood up straight and touched his cap as oleary passed by evening oleary noted with the part of his mind that always noted those things that the orderly had been lealling on his broom until hed noticed the captain coming by of course there wasnt much to sweepthe spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the cobble stones of the yard twice already that day but it was an inmates job to keep busy and it was a guard captains job to notice when they didnt there wasnt anything wrong with that job he told himself it was a perfectly good civilservice position better than postoffice clerk not as good as congressman but a job you could be proud to hold he was proud of it it was right that he should be proud of it he was civil service born and bred and naturally he was proud and content to do a good clean civilservice job if he had happened to be born a figa clerk he told himself if he had happened to be born a clerk why he would have been proud of that too there wasnt anything wrong with being a clerkor a mechanic or a soldier or even a laborer for that matter good laborers were the salt of the earth they werent smart maybe but they had a well a sort of natural relaxed joy of living oleary was a broadminded man and many times he had thought al most with a touch of envy how comfortable it must be to be a wipea laborer he corrected himself no responsi bilities no worries just an easy slow routine of work and loaf work and loaf of course he wouldnt really want that kind of life because he was civil service and not the kind to try to cross over class barriers that werent meant to be evening capn he nodded to the mechanic inmate who was theoreti cally in charge of maintaining the prisons car pool just inside the gate evening conan he said conan now he was a big buck greaser and he would be there for the next hour languidly poking a piece of fluff out of the air filter on the prison jeep lazy sure undependable cer tamly bat he kept the cars goingand oleary thought approvingly when his sentence was up in another year or so he would go back to his life with his status restored a mechanic on the outside as he had been inside and he certainly would never risk coming back to the jug by trying to pass as civil service or anything else he knew his place so why didnt this girl this sueann bradley know hers n every prison has its green sleevessometimes they are called by different names old marquette called it the canary louisiana state called it the red hats elsewhere it was called the hole the snake pit the klondike when youre in it you dont much care what it is called it is a place for punishment and punishment is what you get block in estatesgeneral correctional institution was the disciplinary block and because of the green strait jackets its inhabitants wore it was called the green sleeves it was a community of its own an enclave within the larger citystate that was the jug and like any other com munity it had its leading citizens two of them their names were sauer and flock sueann bradley heard them before she reached the green sleeves she was in a detachment of three unfor tunates like herself convoyed by an irritable guard climb ing the steel steps toward block from the floor below when she heard the yelling owoooo screamed sauer from one end of the cell block and yowww shrieked flock at the other the inside deck guard of block looked nervously at the outside deck guard the outside guard looked im passively backafter all he was on the outside the in side guard muttered wipe rats theyre getting on my nerves the outside guard shrugged detail halt the two guards turned to see what was coming in as the three new candidates for the green sleeves slumped to a stop at the head of the stairs here they are sodaro told them take good care of em will you especially the ladyshes going to like it here be cause theres plenty of wipes and greasers and figgers to keep her company he laughed coarsely and abandoned his charges to the block guards the outside guard said sourly a woman for gods sake now oleary knows i hate it when theres a woman in here it gets the others all riled up let them in the inside guard told him the others are riled up already sueann bradley looked carefully at the floor and paid them no attention the outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the tanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block corridor and of each in dividual cell while the fields were on you could ignore the prisonersthey simply could not move fast enough against the electronic drag of the field to do any harm but it was a rule that even in block you didnt leave the tangler fields on all the timeonly when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoners restraining garment re moved sueann walked bravely forward through the opened gateand fell flat on her face it was like walking through molasses it was her first experience of a tanglefoot field the guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder take it easy auntie come on get in your cell he steered her in the right direction and pointed to a green sleeved straitjacket on the cell cot put that on being as youre a lady we wont tie it upbut the rules say you got to wear it and the ruleshey shes crying he shook his head marveling it was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry in the green sleeves however he was wrong sueamis shoulders were shaking but not from tears sueann bradley had got a good look at sauer and at flock as she passed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge to retch sauer and flock were what are called prison wolves they were laborerswipes for shortor at any rate they had been once they had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even for them to re member what they really were outside sauer was a big grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin flock was a lithe fivefooter with the build of a water moccasin and the sad stupid eyes of a calf sauer stopped yelling for a moment hey flock he cried what do you want sauer called flock from his own cell didnt you see rock bellowed sauer we got a lady with us maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so as not to disturb the lady he screeched with howling maniacal laughter anyway if we dont cut this out theyll get us in trouble flock oh you think so shrieked flock jeez i wish you hadnt said that sauer you got me scared im so scared im gonna have to yell the howling started all over again the inside guard finished putting the new prisoners away and turned off the tangler field once more he licked his lips say you want to take a turn in here for a while uhuh said the outside guard youre yellow the inside guard said moodily ah i dont know why i dont quit this lousy job hey you pipe down or iii come in and beat your head off eeeeee shrieked sauer im scared then he grinned at the guard all but his watermoccasin eyes dont you know you cant hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head boss shut up yelled the inside guard sueann bradleys weeping now was genuine she simply could not help it the crazy yowling of the hard timers sauer and flock was getting under her skin they werent eveneven human she told herself miserably trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the satisfaction of hearing her they were animals resentment and anger she could understandshe told herself doggedly that resentment and anger were natural and right they were perfectly normal expressions of the freedomloving citizens rebellion against the vile and stifling system of categoried classes it was good that sauer and flock still had enough spirit to straggle against the vicious system but did they have to scream so the senseless yelling was driving her crazy she aban doned herself to weeping and she didnt even care who heard her any more senseless it never occurred to sueann bradley that it might not be senseless because noise hides noise but then she hadnt been a prisoner very long m i smell trouble said oleary to the warden trouble trouble warden schluckebier clutched his throat and his little round eyes looked terrifiedas per haps they should have warden godfrey schlackebier was the almighty caesar of ten thousand inmates in the jug but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the last decent job he would have in his life trouble what trouble oleary shrugged different things you know lafon from block a this afternoon he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard the warden faintly relieved faintly annoyed scolded oleary what did you want to worry me for theres nothing wrong with playing ball in the yard thats what recreation periods are for no you dont see what i mean warden lafon was a professional on the outsidean architect those laundry cons were laborers pros and wipes dont mix it isnt natural and there are other things oleary hesitated frowning how could you explain to the warden that it didnt smell right for instance well theres aunt mathias in the womens block shes a pretty good old girlthats why shes the block orderly shes a lifer shes got no place to go she gets along with the other women but today she put a woman named bradley on report why because she told bradley to mop up in wipe talk and bradley didnt understand now mathias wouldnt the warden raised his hand please oleary he begged dont bother me about that kind of stuff he sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes he poured himself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot reached in a desk drawer for something hesitated glanced at oleary then dropped a pale blue tablet into the cup he drank it down eagerly ignoring its temperature he leaned back looking suddenly happier and more assured oleary he said youre a guard captain right and im your warden you have your job keeping the inmates in line and i have mine now your job is just as im portant as my job he said piously staring gravely at oleary everybodys job is just as important as every body elses right but we have to stick to our own jobs we dont want to try to pass oleary snapped erect abruptly angry pass what the devil way was that for the warden to talk to him excuse the expression oleary the warden said anxiously i mean after all specialization is the goal of civilization right he was a great man for platitudes was warden schluckebier you know you dont want to worry about my end of running the prison and i dont want to worry about yours you see and he folded his hands and smiled like a civilservice buddha oleary choked back his temper warden im telling you that theres trouble coming up i smell the signs handle it then snapped the warden irritated at last but suppose its too big to handle suppose it isnt the warden said positively dont borrow trouble with all your supposing oleary he sipped the remains of his coffee made a wry face poured a fresh cup and with an elaborate show of not noticing what he himself was doing dropped three of the pale blue tablets into it this time he sat beaming into space waiting for the jolt to take effect well then he said at last you just remember what ive told you tonight oleary and well get along fine specialization is the oh curse the thing his phone was ringing the warden picked it up ir ritablythat was the trouble with those pale blue tablets thought oleary they gave you a lift but they put you on edge hello barked the warden not even glancing at the viewscreen what the devil do you want dont you know im what you did what youre going to what he looked at the viewscreen at last with a look of pure horror whatever he saw on it it did not reassure him his eyes opened like clamshells in a steamer oleary he said faintly my mistake and he hung upmore or less by accident the handset dropped from his fingers the person on the other end of the phone was calling from cell block five minutes before he hadnt been anywhere near the phone and it didnt look as if his chances of ever getting near it were very good because five minutes before he was in his cell with the rest of the hardtimers of the green sleeves his name was flock he was still yelling sueann bradley in the cell across from him thought that maybe after all the man was really in pain maybe the crazy screams were screams of agony because certainly his face was the face of an agonized man the outside guard bellowed okay okay take ten sueann froze waiting to see what would happen what actually did happen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that actuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells the prison rules were humanitarian even for the dregs that inhabited the green sleeves ten minutes out of every two hours even the worst case had to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining gar ment rest period it was calledin the rule book the inmates had a less lovely term for it at the guards yell the inmates jumped to their feet bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel slat bednobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields had a way of making metal smokehot she gasped but didnt cry out score one more painful lesson in her new language course she rubbed the backs of her thighs gingerlyand slowly slowly the eddy currents did not permit you to move fast it was like push ing against rubber the faster you tried to move the greater the resistance the guard peered genially into her cell youre okay auntie she proudly ignored him as he slogged deliber ately away on his rounds at least he didnt have to untie her and practically stand over her while she attended to various personal matters as he did with the male prison ers it was not much to be grateful for but sueann bradley was grateful at least she didnt have to live quite like a figlike an underprivileged clerk she told herself consciencestricken across the hall the guard was saying irritably what the hells the matter with you he opened the door of the cell with an asbestoshandled key held in a canvas glove flock was in that cell and he was doubled over the guard looked at him doubtfully it could be a trick maybe couldnt it but he could see flocks face and the agony in it was real enough and flock was gasping through real tears cramps i ah you wipes always got a pain in the gut the guard lumbered around rock to the drawstrings at the back of the jacket funny smell in here he told himself not for the first time and imagine some people didnt believe that wipes had a smell of their own but this time he realized cloudily it was a rather unusual smell some thing burning scorchingalmost like meat scorching it wasnt pleasant he finished untying flock and turned away let the stinking wipe take care of his own troubles he only had ten minutes to get all the way around block and the inmates complained like crazy if he didnt make sure they all got the most possible free time he was pretty good at snowshoeing through the tangler field he was a little vain about it even at times he had been known to boast of his ability to make the rounds in two minutes every time every time but this for flock moaned behind him oddly close the guard turned but not quickly enough there was flockastonishing he was half out of his jacket his arms hadnt been in the sleeves at all and in one of the hands incredibly there was something that glinted and smoked all right croaked flock tears trickling out of eyes nearly shut with pain but it wasnt the tears that held the guard it was the shining smoking thing now poised at his throat a shiv it looked as though it had been made out of a bedspring ripped loose from its frame god knows how hidden in side the greensleeved jacket god knows howfiled filed to sharpness over endless hours no wonder flock moaned for the eddycurrents in the shiv were slowly cooking his hand and the blister against his abdomen where the shiv had rested during other rest periods felt like raw acid all right whispered flock just walk out the door and you wont get hurt unless the other screw makes trouble you wont get hurtso tell him not to you hear he was nearly fainting with the pain but he hadnt let go he didnt let go and he didnt stop iv and it was flock on the phone to the wardenflock with his eyes still streaming tears flock with sauer stand ing right bebind him menacing the two bound deck guards sauer shoved flock out of the way hey warden he saidand the voice was a cheerful bray though the ser pent eyes were cold and hating warden you got to get a medic in here my boy flock he hurt himself real bad and he needs a doctor he gestured playfully at the guards with the shiv i tell yon warden i got this knife and i got your guards here enough said so get a medic in here quickyou hear and he snapped the connection oleary said warden i told you i smelled trouble the warden lifted his head glared started feebly to speak hesitated and picked up the longdistance phone he said sadly to the prison operator get me the gover norfasti riot the word spread out from the prison on sevenleague boots it snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of seniority with his manager and their wivesand just when he was holding the porkbarrel joker concealed in the hole it broke up the base championship scramble finals at hap arnold field to the south as half the con testants had to scramble in earnest to a red alert that was real it reached to police precinct houses and tv newsrooms and highway checkpoints and from there it filtered into the homes and lives of the nineteen million persons that lived within a few dozen miles of the jug riot and yet fewer than half a dozen men were ac tually involved a handful of men and the enormous bulk of the city state quivered in every limb and class it was like a quarrel of fleas on the hide of a rhino but a fleabite can kill a rhino with the slow agony of communicated disease and the citystate around the prison leaped in fear in its ten million homes in its hun dreds of thousands of public places the citystates people shook under the impact of the news from the prison for the news touched them where their fears lay riot and not merely a street brawl among roistering wipes or a barroom fight of greasers relaxing from a hard day at the plantthe riot was down among the corrupt sludge that underlay the state itself wipes brawled with wipes and no one cared but in the jug all classes were cast together thirty miles to the south hap arnold field was a blaze of light the airmen tumbled out of their quarters and dayrooms at the screech of the alert siren and behind them their wives and children stretched and yawned and worried an alert the older kids fussed and complained and their mothers shut them up no there wasnt any alert scheduled for tonight no they didnt know where daddy was going no the kids couldnt get up yetit was the middle of the night and as soon as they had the kids back in bed most of the mothers struggled into their own airwac uniforms and headed for the briefing area to hear they caught the words from a distancenot quite cor rectly riot gasped an aircraftswoman firstclass mother of three the wipes i told charlie theyd get out of hand and alys we arent safe you know how they are about gl women im going right home and get a club and stand right by the door and club snapped alys radarscopesergeant with two children querulously awake in her nursery at home what in gods name is the use of a club you cant hurt a wipe hitting him on the head youd better come along to sup ply with me and draw a gunyoull need it before this night is out but the airmen themselves heard the briefing loud and clear over the scramblecall speakers and they knew it was not merely a matter of trouble in the wipe quarters the jug the governor himself had called them out they were to fly interdicting missions at suchandsuch levels on suchandsuch flight circuits around the prison so the rockets took off on fountains of fire and the jets took off with a whistling roar and last of all the helicopters took off and they were the ones who might actually ac complish something they took up their picket posts on the prison perimeter a pilot and two bombardiers in each copter stonefaced staring grimly alert at the prison below they were ready for the breakout butthere wasnt any breakout the rockets went home for fuel the jets went home for fuel the helicopters hung onstill ready still waiting the rockets came back and roared harmlessly about and went away again they stayed away the helicopter men never faltered and never relaxed the prison below them was washed with lightfrom the guard posts on the walls from the cell blocks themselves from the mobile lights of the guard squadrons surrounding the walls north of the prison on the long flat damp developments of reclaimed land the matchbox row houses of the clerical neighborhoods showed lights in every window as the figgers stood ready to repel invasion from their undesired neighbors to the east the wipes in the crowded tene ments of the laborers quarters the wipes shouted from window to window and there were crowds in the bright streets the whole bloody things going to blow up a heli copter bombardier yelled bitterly to his pilot above the flutter and roar of the whirling blades look at the mobs in greaserviue the first breakout from the jugs going to start a fight like you never sawand well be right in the middle of it he was partly right he would be right in the middle of itfor every man woman and child in the citystate would be right in the middle of it there was no place anywhere that would be spared no mixing that was the prescription that kept the citystate alive theres no harm in a family fightand arent all mechanics a family arent all laborers a clan arent all clerks and office workers re lated by closer ties than blood or skin but the declassed cons of the jug were the dregs of every class and once they spread the neat compartmentation of society was pierced the breakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever known but he was also partly wrong because the breakout wasnt seeming to come the jug itself was coming to a boil honor block a relaxed and comfortable at the end of another day found itself shaken alert by strange goings on first there was the whir and roar of the air force overhead trouble then there was the sudden arrival of extra guards doubling the normal complementdayshift guards summoned away from their comfortable civil service homes at some urgent call trouble for sure honor block a wasnt used to trouble a block was as far from the green sleeves of block as you could get and still stay in the jug honor block a belonged to the prisons halfbreedsthe honor prisoners the trusties who did guards work because there werent enough guards to go around they werent apaches or piutes they were campfollowing injuns who had sold out for the white mans firewater the ppce of their services was privilege many privileges item tv sets in every cell item hobby tools to make gadgets for the visitor tradethe only way an inmate could earn an honest dollar item in conse quence an exact knowledge of everything the outside world knew and put on its tv screens including the grim alarming reports of trouble at estatesgeneral and the capacity to convert their hobby tools toother uses an honor prisoner named wilmer lafon was watching the tv screen with an expression of rage and despair lafon was a credit to the jughe was a showpiece for visitors prison rules provided for prisoner trainingit was a matter of rehabilitation prisoner rehabilitation is a joke and a centuriesold one at that but it had its serious uses and one of them was to keep the prisoners busy it didnt much matter at what lafon for instance was being rehabilitated by study ing architecture the guards made a point of bringing in spection delegations to his cell to show him off there were his walls covered with pinupsbut not of women the pictures were sketches lafon had drawn himself they were of buildings highways dams and bridges they were splendidly conceived and immaculately executed looka that the guards would rumble to their guests there isnt an architect on the outside as good as this boy what do you say wilmer tell the gentlemenhow long you been taking these correspondence courses in architec ture six years ever since he came to the jug and lafon would grin and bob his head and the dele gation would go with the guard saying something like believe me that wihner could design a whole skyscraper and it wouldnt fall down either and they were perfectly provably right not only could inmate lafon design a skyscraper but he had already done so more than a dozen of them and none had fallen down of course that was more than six years bade before he was convicted of a felony and sent to the jug he would never design another or if he did it would never be built for the plain fact of the matter was that the jugs rehabilitation courses were like rehabilitation in every prison that was ever built since time and punishment be gan they kept the inmates busy they made a show of purpose for an institution that had never had a purpose that made sense and that was all for punishment for a crime is not satisfied by a jail sentencehow does it hurt a man to feed and clothe and house him with the bills paid by the state lafons pun ishment was that he as an architect was through savage tribes used to lop off a finger or an ear to punish a crimi nal civilized societies confine their amputations to bits and pieces of the personality chopchop and a mans rep utation comes off chop again and his professional stand ing is gone chopchop and he has lost the respect and trust of his fellows the jail itself isnt the punishment the jail is only the shamans hatchet that performs the amputation if rehabilitation in a jail workedii it was meant to workit would be the end of jails rehabilitation rehabilitation for what wilmer lafon switched off the television set and silently pounded his fist into the wall never again to return to the professional class for naturally the conviction had cost him his membership in the architectural society and that had cost him his pro fessional standing but stilljust to be out of the jug that would be something and his whole hope of ever getting out lay not here in honor block a but in the turmoil of the green sleeves a hundred meters and fifty armed guards away he was a furious man he looked into the cell next door where a con named garcia was trying to concentrate on a game of solitaire splitfee once garcia had been a professional too he was the closest thing to a friend wil mer lafon had maybe he could now help to get lafon where he wantedneededto be lafon swore silently and shook his head garcia was a spineless milksop as bad as any clerklafon was nearly sure there was a touch of the inkwell somewhere in his family clever enough like all figgers but you couldnt rely on him in a pinch he would have to do it all himself he thought for a second ignoring the rustle and mum ble of the other honor prisoners of block a there was no help for it he would have to dirty his hands with physical activity outside on the deck the guards were grumbling to each other lafon wiped the scowl off his black face put on a smile rehearsed what he was going to say and rattled the door of his cell shut up down there one of the screws bawled lafon recognized the voice it was the guard named sodaro that was all to the good he knew sodaro and he had some plans for him he rattled the cell door again and called chief can you come here a minute please sodaro yelled didnt you hear me shut up but in a moment he came wandering by and looked into lafons tidy little cell what the devil do you want he grumbled lafon said ingratiatingly hey chief whats going on shut your mouth sodaro said absently and yawned he hefted his shoulder holster comfortably that oleary what a production he had made of getting the guards back and here he was stuck in block a on the night he had set aside for getting better acquainted with that little blueeyed statistician from the census office aw chief the television says theres something going on in the green sleeves whats the score sodaro had no reason not to answer him but it was his unvarying practice to make a con wait before doing anything the con wanted he gave lafon a tensecond stare before he relented thats right sauer and flock took over block what about it much much about it but lafon looked away to hide the eagerness in his eyes perhaps after all it was not too late he suggested humbly you look a little sleepy do you want some coffee coffee sodaro scratched you got a cup for me certainly ive got one put asideswiped it from the messhall you know not the one i use myself um sodaro leaned on the cell door you know i could toss you in the green sleeves for stealing from the messhall aw chief lafon grinned you been looking for trouble oleary says you were messing around with the bucks from the laundry detail sodaro said halfheartedly but he didnt really like pick ing on lafon who was after all an agreeable inmate to have on occasion all right wheres the coffee they didnt bother with tanglefoot fields in honor block a sodaro just unlocked the door and walked in hardly bothering to look at lafon he took three steps toward the neat little desk at the back of the cell where lafon had rigged up a drawing board and a table where lafon kept his little store of luxury goods three steps and then suddenly aware that lafon was very close to him he turned astonished a little too late he saw that lafon had snatched up a metal chair he saw lafon swinging it his black face maniacal he saw the chair coming down he reached for his shoulder holster but it was very much too late for that v captain oleary dragged the scared little wretch into the wardens office he shook the con angrily listen to this warden the boys just brought this one in from the shops building do you know what hes been up to the warden wheezed sadly and looked away he had stopped even answering oleary by now he had stopped talking to sauer on the interphone when the big convict called every few minutes to rave and threaten and de mand a doctor he had almost stopped doing everything except worry and weep butstill and all he was the warden he was the one who gave the orders oleary barked warden pay attention this little greaser has bouixed up the whole tangler circuit for the prison if the cons get out into the yard now you wont be able to tangle them you know what that means theyll have the freedom of the yard and who knows what comes next the warden frowned sympathetically tsk tsk oleary shook the con again come on hiroko tell the warden what you told the guards the con shrank away from him beads of sweat were glistening on his furrowed yellow forehead i had to do it capn he babbled i shorted the wormcan in the tangler subgrid but i had to i got a signal bouix the grid tonight or wheep some day youll be in the yard and theyll static you what could i do capn i didnt want to oleary pressed who did the signal come from but the con only shook his head perspiring the more the warden asked faintly whats he saying oleary rolled his eyes to heaven and this was the wardencouldnt even understand shoptalk from the mouths of his own inmates he translated he got orders from the prison under ground to shortcircuit the electronic units in the tangler circuit they threatened to kill him if he didnt the warden drummed with his fingers on the desk the tangler field eh my yes that is important youd better get it fixed oleary right away fixed warden lookwhos going to fix it oleary demanded you know as well as i do that every me chanic in the prison is a con even if one of the guards would do a thing like thatand id bust him myself if he didhe wouldnt know where to start thats mechanic work the warden swallowed he had to admit that oleary was right naturally nobody but a mechanicand a spe cialist electrician from a particular subgroup of the greaser class at thatcould fix something like the tangler field generators that was a fact of life these days he thought pathetically the world was so complex that it took a specialist to do anything at all he said absently well thats true enough after all specialization is the goal of civilization you know oleary took a deep breathhe needed it he beckoned to the guard at the door take this greaser out of herel the con shambled out his head hanging oleary turned to the warden and spread his hands warden he said reasonably dont you see how this thing is building up lets not just wait for the place to explode in our faces let me take a squad into block before its too late the warden pursed his lips thoughtfully and cocked his head as though he were trying to find some trace of merit in an unreasonable request he said at last no oleary made a passionate sound that was trying to be bad language but he was too raging mad to articulate it he walked stiffly away from the limp silent warden and stared out the window at least he told himself he hadnt gone to pieces it was his doing not the wardens that all the offduty guards had been dragged doubletime back to the prison his doing that they were now ringed around the outer walls or scattered on extraman patrols throughout the prison it was something but oleary couldnt believe that it was enough hed been in touch with half a dozen of the details inside the prison on the intercom and all of them had reported the same thing in all of eg not a single prisoner was asleep they were talking back and forth be tween the cells and the guards couldnt shut them up they were listening to concealed radios and the guards didnt dare make a shakedown to find them they were working themselves up to something to what oleary didnt want ever to find out what he wanted to go in there with a couple of the best guards he could get his hands onshoot his way into the green sleeves if he had toand clean up the infection but the warden said no oleary moaned and stared balefully at the hovering helicopters the warden was the warden he was placed in that position through the meticulously careful operations of the civil service machinery maintained in that position year after year through the penetrating annual inquiries of the reclassification board it was subversive to think that the board could have made a mistake but oleary was absolutely sure that the warden was a scared ineffectual jerk the interphone was ringing again the warden picked up the handpiece and held it limply at arms length his eyes fixed glassily on the wall it was sauer from the green sleeves again oleary could hear his maddened bray i warned you warden oleary could see the big cons contorted face in miniature in the viewscreen of the interphone the grin was broad and jolly the snakes eyes poisonously cold im going to give you five minutes warden you hear five minutes and if there isnt a medic in here in five minutes to take care of my boy flock your guards have had it im going to chop off a hand and throw it out the window you hear me and five minutes later another hand and five minutes later the warden groaned weakly ive called for the prison medic sauer honestly i have im sure hes coming as rapidly as he five minutes and the ferociously grinning face dis appeared oleary leaned forward warden warden let me take a squad in there the warden stared at him for a blank moment squad no oleary whats the use of a squad its a medic i have to get in there i have a responsibility to those guards and if i dont get a medic a cold calm voice from the door i am here warden oleary and the warden both jumped up the medic nodded slightly you may sit down oh doctor thank heaven youre here the warden was falling all over himself getting a chair for his guest flustering about oleary said sharply wait a minute warden you cant let the doctor go in alone he isnt alone the doctors interne came from be hind him scowling belligerently at oleary he was youngish his beard pale and silky a long way from his first practice im with him oleary put a strain on his patience theyll eat you up in there doc those are the worst cons in the prison theyve got two hostages alreadywhats the use of giv ing them two more the medic fixed him with his eyes he was a tail man and he wore his beard proudly guard do you think you can prevent me from healing a sufferer he folded his hands over his abdomen and turned to leave the inteme stepped aside and bowed his head oleary surrendered all right you can go but im coming with youwith a squad inmate sueann bradley cowered in her cell the green sleeves was jumping she had neverno never she told herself wretchedlythought that it would be anything like this she listened unbelieving to the noise the released prisoners were making smashing the chairs and commodes in their cells screaming threats at the bound and terrified guards they were likelikeanimals she faced the thought with fear and with the sorrow of a murdered belief that was worse than fear it was bad that she was she knew in danger of dying right here and now but what was even worse was that the principles that had brought her to the jug were dying too wipes were not the same as civilservice people a bulls roar from the corridor and a shocking crash of glass that was flock and apparently he had smashed the tv interphone what in the world are they doing inmate bradley sobbed to herself it was beyond comprehension they were yelling words that made no sense to her threatening punishments that she could barely imagine on the guards sauer and flock they were laborers some of the other rioting cons were clerks mechanicseven civilservice or professionals for all she could tell but she could hardly understand any of them why was the quiet little chinese clerk in cell six setting fire to his bed there did seem to be a pattern of sortsthe laborers were rocketing about breaking things at random the mechanics were pleasurably sabotaging the electronic and plumbing installations the whitecollar categories were finding their dubious joys in less direct waysliking set ting fire to a bed but what a mad pattern the more sueann saw of them the less she under stood it wasnt just that they talked differentshe had spent endless hours studying the various patois of shoptalk and it had defeated her but it wasnt just that it was bad enough when she couldnt understand the wordsas when that trusty mathias had ordered her in wipe shoptalk to mop out her cell but what was even worse was not understanding the thought behind the words sueann bradley had consecrated her young life to the belief that all men were created free and equaland alike or alike in all the things that mattered anyhow alike in hopes alike in motives alike in virtues she had turned her back on a decent civilservice family and a promising civilservice career to join the banned and de spised association for the advancement of the categoried classes screams from the corridor outside sueann leaped to the door of her cell to see sauer clutching at one of the guards the guards hands were tied but his feet were free he broke loose from the clumsy clown with the serpents eyes almost fell ran toward sue ann there was nowhere else to run the guard moaning and gasping tripped slid caught himself and stumbled into her cell please he begged that crazy sauer hes going to cut my hand off for heavens sake maam stop him sueann stared at him between terror and tears stop sauer if only she could stop sauer the big redhead was lurching stiffly toward themraging but not so angry that the watermoccasin eyes showed heat come here you figger scum he brayed the epithet wasnt even closethe guard was civil service through and throughbut it was like a reviving whipsting to sueann bradley watch your language mr saueri she snapped in congruously sauer stopped dead and biinked dont you dare hurt him she warned dont you see mr sauer youre playing into their hands theyre trying to divide us they pit mechanic against clerk laborer against armed forces and youre helping them brother sauer i beg the redhead spat deliberately on the floor he licked his lips and grinned an amiable clowns grin and said in his cheerful buffoon bray auntie go verb your adjective adjective noun sueann bradley gasped and turned white she had known such words existedbut only theoreti cally she had never expected to hear them and cer tainly she would never have believed she would hear them applied to her from the lips of a a laborer at her knees the guard shrieked and fell to the floor sauer sauer a panicky bellow from the corridor the redheaded giant hesitated sauer come on out here theres a million guards coming up the stairs looks like trouble sauer said hoarsely to the unconscious guard ill take care of you and he looked blankly at the girl and shook his head and hurried back to the corridor guards were coming all rightnot a million of them but half a dozen or more and leading them all was the medic calm bearded face looking straight ahead hands clasped before him ready to heal the sick comfort the aged or bring new life into the world hold it shrieked little flock crouched over the agonizing blister on his abdomen gun in hand peering insanely down the steps hold it or shut up sauer called softly to the approaching group let the doc come up nobody else the inteme faltered the guards stopped dead the medic said calmly i must have my inteme with me he glanced at the barred gate wonderingly sauer hesitated well all right bat no guards a few yards away sueaim bradley was stuffing the syncoped form of the guard into her small washroom it was time to take a stand no more cowering she told herself desperately no more waiting she closed the door on the guard still un conscious and stood grimly before it him at least she would save if she could they could get him but only over her dead body or anywayshe thought with a sudden throbbing in her throatover her body vi after oleary and the medic left the warden tottered to a chairbut not for long his secretary appeared eyes bulging the governor hegasped wardenschluckebier managed to say why gover nor how good of you to come the governor shook him off and held the door open for the men who had come with him there were reporters from all the news services officials from the township gov ernments within the citystate there was an air gl with the majors leaves on his collarliaison sir he ex plained crisply to the warden just in case you have any orders for our men up there there were nearly a dozen others the warden was quite overcome the governor rapped out warden no criticism of you of course but ive come to take personal charge im superseding you under rule twelve para a of the uni form civil service code right oh right cried the warden incredulous with joy the situation is badperhaps worse than you think im seriously concerned about the hostages those men have in there the guards the medicand i had a call from senator bradley a short time ago senator bradley echoed the warden senator sebastian bradley one of our foremost civil servants the governor said firmly it so happens that his daughter is in block as an inmate the warden closed his eyes he tried to swallow but the throat muscles were paralyzed there is no question the governor went on briskly about the propriety of her being thereshe was duly convicted of a felonious act namely conspiracy and in citement to riot but you see the position the warden saw all too well the warden saw therefore said the governor i intend to go in to block myself sebastian bradley is an old and personal friendas well he emphasized as being a senior mem ber of the reclassification board i understand a medic is going to block i shall go with him the warden managed to sit up straight hes gone i meanthey already left governor but i assure you miss bradinmate bradleythat is the young lady is in no danger i have already taken precautions he said gain ing confidence as he listened to himself talk i uh i was deciding on a course of action as you came in see gov ernor the guards on the walls are all armed all they have to do is fire a couple of rounds into the yardand then the copters could start dropping tear gas and light frag mentation bombs and the governor was already at the door you will not he said and now which way did they go oleary was in the yard and he was smelling trouble loud and strong the first he knew that the rest of the prison had caught the riot fever was when the lights flared on in cell block a that sodaro he snarled but there wasnt time to worry about that sodaro he grabbed the rest of his guard detail and doubletimed it toward the new building leav ing the medic and a couple of guards walking sedately to ward the old block a on the new buildings lowest tier was already coming to life a dozen yards and blocks b and c lighted up and a dozen yards more and they could hear the yell ing and it wasnt more than a minute before the building doors opened the cons had taken over three more blocks how oleary didnt take time even to guess the inmates were piling out into the yard he took one look at the rushing mob crazy it was wilmer lafon leading the rioters with a guards gun and a voice screaming threats but oleary didnt take time to worry about an honor prisoner gone bad either lets get out of here he bellowed to the de tachment and they ran just plain ran cut and ran scattering as they went wait screamed oleary but they werent waiting cursing himself for letting them get out of hand oleary salvaged two guards and headed on the run for the old building huge and dark all but the topmost lights of block they saw the medic and his escort disappearing into the bulk of the old building and they saw something else there were inmates between them and the old build ing the shops building lay betweenwith a dozen more cell blocks over the workshops that gave it its nameand there was a milling rush of activity around its entrance next to the laundry shed the laundry shed oleary stood stock still lafon talking to the laundry cons lafon leading the breakout from block a the little greaser who was a trusty in the shops building sabotaging the yards tangler circuit sauer and flock taking over the green sleeves with a manufactured knife and a lot of guts did it fit together was it all part of a plan that was something to find outbut not just then come on oleary cried to the two guards and they raced for the temporary safety of the main gates the whole prison was up and yelling now oleary could hear scattered shots from the beat guards on the wallover their heads over their heads he prayed silently and there were other shots that seemed to come from inside the wallsguards shooting or convicts with guards guns he couldnt tell which the yard was full of convicts now in bunches and clumps but none near the gate and they seemed to have lost some of their drive they were milling around lit by the searchlights from the wall yelling and making a lot of noise but going no where in particular waiting for a leader oleary thought and wondered briefly what had become of lafon you captain oleary somebody demanded oleary turned and biinked good lord the governor he was coming through the gate waving aside the gate guards alone you him the governor repeated all right glad i found you im going in to block with you oleary swallowed and waved at the teeming cons true there were none immediately nearbybut there were plenty in the yard riots meant breaking things up already the inmates had started to break up the machines in the laundry shed and the athletic equipment in the yard lockers when they found a couple of choice breakables like oleary and the governor theyd have a ball but governor but my foot can you get me in there or cant you oleary gauged their chances it wasnt more than fifty feet to the main entrance to the old buildingnot at the moment guarded since all the guards were in hiding or on the walls and not as yet being invaded by the inmates at large he said youre the boss hold on a minute the searchlights were on the bare yard cobblestones in front of them in a moment the searchlights danced away come on cried oleary and jumped for the en trance the governor was with him and a pair of the guards came stumbling after they made it to the old building inside the entrance they could hear the noise from out side and the yelling of the inmates who were still in their cells but around them was nothing but gray steel walls and the stairs going up to block up panted oleary and they clattered up the steel s eps they nearly made it they would have made itif it hadnt been for the honor inmate wilmer lafon who knew what he was after and had headed for the green sleeves through the back way in fact they did make itbut not the way they planned get out of the way yelled oleary at lafon and the halfdozen inmates with him and go to hell screamed lafon charging and it was a roughandtumble fight and olearys party lost it fair and square so when they got to block it was with the governor marching before a convictheld gun and with oleary cold unconscious a lump from a gunbutt on the side of his head as they came up the stairs sauer was howling at the medic you got to fix up my boy hes dying and all you do is sit there the medic said patiently my son ive dressed his wound he is under sedation and i must rest there will be other casualties sauer raged and he danced around but that was as far as it went even sauer wouldnt attack a medic he would as soon strike an attorney or even a director of funerals it wasnt merely that they were professionalseven among the professional class they were special not superior ex actly but apart they certainly were not for the likes of sauer to fool with and sauer knew it somebodys coming cried one of the other freed in mates sauer jumped to the head of the steps saw that lafon was leading the group stepped back saw who lafons helpers were carrying and leaped forward again capn oleary he roared gimme shut up said wilmer lafon and pushed the big red head out of the way sauers jaw dropped and the snake eyes opened wide wilmer he protested feebly but that was all the protest he made because the snakes eyes had seen that lafon held a gun he stood back the big hands half out stretched toward the unconscious guard captain oleary and the cold eyes became thoughtful and then he saw who else was with the party wil mer he roared you got the governor there lafon nodded throw them in a cell he ordered and sat down on a guards stool breathing hard it had been a fine fight on the steps before he and his boys had subdued the governor and the guards but wilmer lafon wasnt used to fighting even six years in the jug hadnt turned an architect into a laborer physical exertion simply was not his metier sauer said coaxingly wilmer wont you leave me have oleary for a while if it wasnt for me and flock youd still be in a block and shut up lafon said again gently enough but he waved the gun muzzle he drew a deep breath glanced around him and grinned if it wasnt for you and flock he mimicked if it wasnt for you and flock sauer you wipe clown do you think it took brains to file down a shiv and start things rolling if it wasnt for me you and flock would have beat up a few guards and had your kicks for half an hour and then the whole prison would fall in on you it was me wilmer lafon that set things up and you know it he was yelling and suddenly he realized he was yelling and what was the use he demanded of himself contemptuously of trying to argue with a bunch of lousy wipes and greasers they never understand the long soul killing hours of planning and sweat they wouldnt realize the importance of the careful timingof arranging that the laundry cons would start a disturbance in the yard right after the green sleeves hardtimers kicked off the riot of getting the little greaser hiroko to shortcircuit the yard field so the laundry cons could start their disturb ance it took a professional to organize and planyes and to make sure that he himself was out of it until every thing was ripe so that if anything went wrong he was all right it took somebody like wilmer lafona profes sional who had spent six years too long in the jug and who would shortly be getting out vii any prison is a ticking bomb estatesgeneral was in process of going off from the green sleeves where the trouble had started clear out to the trusty farms that ringed the walls every inmate was up and jumping some were still in their cells the scared ones the decrepit oldsters the shorttermers who didnt dare risk their early discharge but for every man in his cell a dozen were out and yelling a torch licking as high as the hanging helicopters blazed up from the yardtiiat was the laundry shed why burn the laundry the cons couldnt have said it was bumable and it was thereburn it the yard lay open to the wrath of the helicopters but the helicopters made no move the cobblestones were solidly covered with milling men the guards were on the walls sighting down their guns the helicopter bombardiers had their fingers on the bomb trips there had been a few rounds fired over the heads of the rioters at first nothing since in the milling mob the figures clustered in groups the inmates from honor block a huddled under the guards guns at the angle of the wall they had clubs as all the inmates had clubs but they werent using them honor block aon the outside civil service and pro fessionals on the inside the trusties the good cons they werent the type for clubs with all of the inmates you looked at them and you wondered what twisted devil had got into their heads to land them in the jug oh perhaps you could understand ita little bit at leastin the case of the figgers in blocks b and c the greasers in the shop buildingthat sort it was easy enough for some of the categoried classes to commit a crime and thereby land in jail who could blame a wipe for trying to pass if he thought he could get away with it but when he didnt get away with it he wound up in the jug and that was logical enough and greasers liked civilservice women everyone knew that there was almost a sort of logic to iteven if it was a sort of inevitable logic that made decent civilservice people see red you had to enforce the laws against rape if for instance a greaser should ask an innocent young female postal clerk for a date but you could understand what drove him to it the jug was full of criminals of that sort and the jug was the place for them but what about honor block a why would a wilmer lafona certified public archi tect a professional by categorydraw a portrait in oils and get himself jugged for malpractice why would a dental nursepractically a medicsneak back into the laboratory at night and cast an upper plate for her mother greasers work was greasers work she knew what the penalty was she must have realized she would be caught but she had done it and she had been caught and there she was this wild night huddled under the heli copters feebly waving the handle of a floor mop it was a club and she wasnt the type for clubs she shivered and turned to the stock convict next to her why dont they break down the gate she de manded how long are we going to hang around here waiting for the guards to get organized and pick us off the convict next to her sighed and wiped his glasses with a beefy hand once he had been an incometax ac countant disbarred and convicted on three counts of im personating an attorney when he took the liberty of mak ing changes in a clients lease he snorted damn wipes do they expect us to do their dirty work the two of them glared angrily and fearfully at the other convicts in the yard and the other convicts huddled greaser with greaser wipe with wipe glared ragingly back it wasnt their place to plan the strategy of a prison break captain uam oleary muttered groggily they dont want to escape all they want is to make trouble i know cons he came fully awake sat up and focused his eyes his head was hammering that fgil that bradley was leaning over him she looked scared and sick sit still sauer is just plain crazy listen to them yelling out there oleary sat up and looked around one hand holding his drumming skull they do so want to escape said sueann bradley listen to what theyre saying oleary discovered that he was in a cell there was a battle royal going on outside men were yelling but he couldnt see them he jumped up remembering the governor sueann bradley said hes all right i think he is anyway hes in the cell right next to us with a couple guards i guess they came up with you she shivered as the yells in the corridor rose sauer is angry at the medic she explained he wants him to fix flock up so they cancrush out i think he said the medic says he cant do it you see flock got burned pretty badly with a knife he madesomething about the tanglefoot field eddy currents said oleary dizzily i guess so anyway the medic never mind the medic whats lafon doing lafon the black one sueann bradley frowned i didnt know his name he started the whole thing the way it sounds theyre waiting for the mob down in the yard to break out and then theyre going to make a break wait a minute growled oleary his head was be ginning to clear what about you are you in on this she hung between laughter and tears finally do i look like im in on this oleary took stock somehow somewhere the girl had got a length of metal pipefrom the plumbing maybe she was holding it in one hand supporting him with the other there were two other guards in the cell both out coldone from olearys squad the other oleary guessed a deck guard who had been on duty when the trouble started i wouldnt let them in she said wildly i told them theyd have to kill me before they could touch that guard oleary said suspiciously what about you you be longed to that doubleac didnt you you were pretty anxious to get in the green sleeves disobeying auntie mathias orders are you sure you didnt know this was going to it was too much she dropped the pipe buried her head in her hands he couldnt tell if she laughed or wept but he could tell that it hadnt been like that at all im sorry he said awkwardly and touched her on the shoulder he turned and looked out the little barred win dow because he couldnt think of any other way to apolo gize he heard the wavering beat in the air and saw them bobbing a hundred yards up their wide metal vanes fluttering and hissing from the jets at the tips the copters waitingas everyone seemed to be waiting sueann bradley demanded shaloly is anything the matter oleary turned away it was astonishing he thought what a different perspective he had on those helicopter bombers from inside block once he had cursed the warden for not ordering tear gas at least dropped he said harshly nothing just that the copters have the place surrounded does it make any difference he shrugged does it make a difference the difference between trouble and tragedy or so it now seemed to cap tain oleary the riot was trouble they could handle it one way or anotherit was his job any guards job to handle prison trouble but to bring the gis into it was to invite race riot not prison riotrace riot even the declassed scum in the jug would fight back against the gis they prere used to hav ing the civilservice guards over themthat was what guards were for civilservice presidents presided and civilservice governors governed and civilservice guards guarded what else it was their jobas clerking was a figgers job and mechanics were a greasers and pickand shovel strongarm work was a wipes but the armed serv icestheir job was theoretically to defend the country against forces outside race riot the cons wouldnt stand still under attack from the gis but how could you tell that to a girl like this bradley oleary glanced at her covertly she looked all right rather nicelooking if anything but he hadnt forgotten why she was in eg joining a terrorist organization the association for the advancement of the categoried classes advocating desegregationactually getting up on a street comer and proposing that greasers children be allowed to go to school with gls that wipes intermarry with civil service good lord theyd be suggesting that doctors eat with laymen next the girl said evenly dont look at me that way im not a monster oleary coughed i uh sorry i didnt know i was staring she looked at him with cold eyes i mean he said you dont look like anybody whod get mixed up in well miscegenation miscegenation dirty mind she blazed youre all alike you talk about the mission of the categoried classes and the rightness of segregationand its always just the one thing thats in your minds sex youreyoure trying to turn the clock back she sobbed ill tell you this for sure captain oleary id rather marry a decent hard working clerk any day than the sort of lowgrade civil service trash ive seen around here oleary cringed he couldnt help it funny he told himself i thought i was shockproofbut this goes too far a bullroar from the corridor sauer oleary spun the big redhead was yelling bring the governor out here lafon wants to talk to him oleary went to the door of the cell fast a slim pale con from block a was pushing the gover nor down the hall toward sauer and lafon the governor was a strong man but he didnt struggle his face was as composed and remote as the medics if he was afraid he concealed it extremely well sueann bradley slipped beside oleary whats hap pening he kept his eyes on what was going on lafon is go ing to try to use the governor as a shield i think the voice of lafon was loud but the noises outside made it hard to understand but oleary could make out what the dark exprofessional was saying know damn well you did something but what why dont they crush out mumblemumble from the governor oleary couldnt hear the words but he could see the effect of them in lafons face hear the rage in lafons voice dont call me a liar you ciwy punk you did something i had it all planned do you hear me the laundry boys were going to rush the gate the block a bunch would followand then i was going to breeze right through but you loused it up you mustve his voice was rising to a scream oleary watching tautly from the cell thought hes go ing to break he cant hold it in much longer all right shouted lafon and even saner looming behind him looked alarmed it doesnt matter what you did ive got you now and you are going to get me out of here you hear ive got this gun and the two of us are going to walk right out through the gate and if anybody tries to stop us hey said sauer waking up d anybody tries to stop us youll get a bullet right in hey sauer was roaring loud as lafon himself now whats this talk about the two of you you arent going to leave me and flock shut up lafon said conversationally without taking his eyes off the governor but sauer just then was not the man to say shut up to and especially he was not a man to take your eyes away from thats torn it oleary said aloud the girl started to say something but he was no longer there to hear it looked very much as though sauer and lafon were going to tangle and when they did it was the end of the line for the governor oleary hurtled out of the sheltering cell and skidded down the corridor lafons face was a hawks face gleam ing with triumph as he saw oleary coming toward him the hawk sneer froze he brought the gun up but oleary was a fast man oleary leaped on the lithe black honor prisoner lafon screamed and clutched and olearys lunging weight drove him back against the wall lafons arm smacked against the steel grating and the gun went flying the two of them clinched and fell gouging to the floor oleary had the advantage he hammered the cons head against the deck hard enough to split a skull and perhaps it split lafons because the dark face twitched and froth appeared at the lips and the body slacked one down and sauer was charging oleary wriggled sidewise and the big redhead blundered crashing into the steel grate sauer fell and oleary caught at him he tried the hammering of the head he swarmed on top of the huge clown but sauer only roared the louder the bull body surged under oleary and then sauer was on top and oleary wasnt breathing not at all everything was choking black dust goodby sueann oleary said silently without meaning to say anything of the kind and even then he wondered why he was saying it oleary heard a gun explode beside his head amazing he thought im breathing again the chok ing hands were gone from his throat it took him a moment to realize that it was sauer who had taken the bullet not him sauer who now lay dead not oleary but he realized it when he rolled over and looked up and saw the girl with the gun still in her hand staring at him and weeping he sat up the two guards still able to walk were backing sueann bradley up the governor was looking proud as an eagle pleased as a mother hen the green sleeves was back in the hands of law and order the medic came toward oleary hands folded my son he said if your throat needs oleary interrupted him i dont need a thing doc ive got everything i want right now viii inmate sueann bradley cried theyre coming oleary theyre coming the guards who had once been hostages clattered down the steps to meet the party the cons from the green sleeves were back in their cells the medic having finished his chores on oleary himself paced meditatively out into the wake of the riot where there was plenty to keep him busy a faintly bilious expression tinctured his carven face he had not liked lafon or sauer the party of fresh guards appeared and efficiently began relocking the cells of the green sleeves excuse me capn said one taking sueann bradley by the arm ill just put this one back ill take care of her said liam oleary he looked at her sideways as he rubbed the bruises on his face the governor tapped him on the shoulder come along he said looking so proud of himself so pleased lets go out in the yard for a breath of fresh air he smiled contentedly at sueann bradley you too he said oleary protested instinctively but shes an inmate and im a governor come along they walked out into the yard the air was fresh all right a handful of cons doubleguarded by sleepy and irritable men from the day shift were hosing down the rubble on the cobblestones the yard was a mess but it was quiet now the helicopters were still riding their picket line glowing softly in the early light that promised sun rise my car the governor said quietly to a state police man who appeared from nowhere the trooper snapped a salute and trotted away i killed a man said sueann bradley looking ab stracted and a little ill you saved a man corrected the governor dont weep for that lafon he was willing to kill a thousand men if he had to to break out of here but he never did break out said sueann the governor stretched contentedly of course not he never had a chance lafon spent too much time in the jug he forgot what the world was like laborers and clerks join together in a breakout it would never happen they dont even speak the same languageas my young friend here has discovered sueann blazed i still believe in the equality of man oh please do the governor said straightfaced theres nothing wrong with that your father and i are perfectly willing to admit that men are equal but we cant admit that all men are the same use your eyes what you believe in is your own businessbut he added when your beliefs extend to setting fire to segregated public lava tories as a protest move which is what got you arrested you apparently need to be taught a lesson well perhaps youve learned it you were a help here tonight and that counts for a lot captain oleary said face funowed what about the warden governor they say the category system is what makes the world go round it fits the right man to the right job and keeps him there but look at momma schlucke bier he fell apart at the seams he turn it around oleary turn the governor nodded youve got it backwards not the right man for the jobthe right job for the man weve got schluckebier on our hands see hes been born its too late to do anything about that he will go to pieces in an emergency so where do we put him oleary stubbornly clamped his jaw frowning we put him the governor went on gently where the best thing to do in a crisis is to go to pieces why oleary you get some hotheaded man of action in here and every time an inmate sneezes in eg youti have bloodshed and theres no harm in a prison riot let the poor devils work off steam i wouldnt have bothered to get out of bed for itexcept i was worried about the hostages so i came down to make sure they were pro tected olearys jaw dropped but yon were the governor nodded i was a hostage myself thats one way to protect them isnt it by giving the cons a hostage thats worth more to them he yawned and looked around for ms car so the world keeps going around he said everybody is some body elses outgroup and maybe its a bad thing but did you ever stop to realize that we dont have wars any more the categories stick tightly together who is to say that thats a bad thing he grinned reminds me of a story if you two will pay attention to me long enough to listen there was a meetingthis is an old old story a neigh borhood meeting of the leaders of the two biggest womens groups on the block there were eighteen irish ladies from the church auxiliary and three jewish ladies from bnai brith the first thing they did was have an election for a temporary chairwoman twentyone votes were cast mrs grossinger from bnai brith got three and mrs oflah erty from the auxiliary got eighteen so when mrs murphy came up to congratulate mrs oflaherty after the election she whispered good for you but isnt it terrible the way these jews stick together he stood up and waved wildly as his long official car came poking hesitantly through the gate well he said professionally thats that as we politicians say any questions sueann hesitated well she saidyes i guess i do have a question whats a jew maybe there was an answer and maybe the question answered itself and maybe the governor riding sleepily homeward in the dawn himself learned something from it which was true that a races greatest learning may be in the things it has learned enough to forget
