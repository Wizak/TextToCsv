appearance this year to a tree down l in front there is a gardentable with a deckchair on the right of it and a straightbacked one to the left there are books papers and magazines on the table belinda of whom we shall know more presently is on the other side of the open windows which look on to the garden talking to betty who crosses to r of hammock securing it to tree c belinda from inside the house are you sure youre tying it up tightly enough betty betty coming to front of hammock yes maam i think its firm belinda because im not the fairy i used to be betty testing hammock yes maam its quite firm this end too belinda entering from portico with sunshade open its not the ends im frightened of its the middle where the weights coming comes down r and admiring it looks very nice she crosses at back of wicker table hanging her handbag on hammock closes and places her sunshade at back of tree c betty yes maam belinda trying the middle of it with her hand i asked them at the stores if they were quite sure it would bear me and they said it would take anything up to i forget how many tons i know i thought it was rather rude of them looking at it anxiously and trying to get in first with her right leg and then her left how does one get in so trying to be a sailor betty i think you sit in it maam and then explaining with her hands throw your legs over belinda i see she sits gingerly in the hammock and then with a sudden flutter of white does what betty suggests yes regretfully im afraid that was rather wasted on you betty we must have some spectators next time betty yea maam belinda cushions betty moves to and takes a cushion from deckchair belinda assists her to place it at back of her head betty then goes to back of hammock and arranges belindas dress there now then betty about callers betty yes maam belinda if mr baxter calls he is the rather prim gentleman betty yea maam the one whos been here several times before moves to below and l of hammock belinda giving betty a quick look yes well if he calls youll say not at home betty yes maam belinda he will say imitating mr baxter oh er oh er really then youll smile very sweetly and say i beg your pardon was it mr baxter and hell say yes and youll say oh i beg your pardon sir this way please betty yes maam belinda thats right betty well now if mr devenish calls he is the rather poetical gentleman betty yes maam the one whos always coming here belinda with a pleased smile yes well if he calls youll say not at home betty yes maam belinda hell immediately extending her arms descriptively throw down his bunch of flowers and dive despairingly into the moat youll stop him just as he is going in and say i beg your pardon sir was it mr devenish and he will say yes and you will say oh i beg your pardon sir this way please betty yes maam and suppose they both call together belinda nonplussed for a moment we wont suppose anything so exciting betty betty no maam and suppose any other gentleman calls belinda with a sigh there arent any other gentlemen betty it might be a clergyman come to ask for a subscription like belinda if its a clergyman betty i shall i shall want your assistance out of the hammock first betty yes maam belinda thats all betty crosses below table and chairs to porch to anybody else im not at home trying to secure book on table and nearly falling out of the hammock oh just give me that little green book pointing to books on the table the one at the bottom there thats the one betty gives it to her thank you reading the title the lute of love by claude devenish to herself as she turns the pages it doesnt seem much for halfacrown when you think of the daily telegraph lute lute i should have quite a pretty mouth if i kept on saying that with a great deal of expression lute she pats her mouth back betty is that all maam belinda thats all betty prepares to go oh what am i thinking of waving to the table i want that review i think its the blue one as betty begins to look it has an article by mr baxter on the rise of lunacy in the eastern counties betty gives her the nineteenth century magazine yes thats the one id better have that too im just at the most exciting place you shall have it after me betty betty is that all maam belinda yes that really is all betty goes into the house belinda reading to herself very pronouncedly it is a matter of grave concern to all serious students of social problems putting the review down in hammock and shaking her head gently but not in april lazily opening the book and reading tell me where is love well thats the question isnt it she lies back in the hammock lazily and the book of poems falls from her to the ground delia comes into the garden from paris she is decidedly a modern girl pretty and selfpossessed her hair is halfway up waiting for her birthday perhaps she sees her mother suddenly stops and then goes on tiptoe to the head of the hammock she smiles and kisses her mother on the forehead belinda looking supremely unconscious goes on sleeping delia kisses her lightly again belinda wakes up with an extraordinarily natural start and is just about to say oh mr devenish you mustnt when she sees delia delia they kiss each other frantically delia well mummy arent you glad to see me belinda my darling child delia say youre glad belinda sitting up my darling im absolutely delia crosses round to l of hammock hold the hammock while i get out dear we dont want an accident delia holds the l end of it and belinda struggles out leaving the magazine and her handkerchief in the hammock theyre all right when youre there and theyll bear two tons but theyre horrid getting in and out of kissing her again darling it really is you delia oh it is jolly seeing you again i believe you were asleep belinda with dignity certainly not child i was reading the nineteenth century with an air and after earnestly darling wasnt it next thursday you were coming back delia no this thursday silly belinda penitently oh my darling and i was going over to paris to bring you home delia i half expected you belinda so confusing their both being called thursday and you were leaving school for the very last time if you dont forgive me delia i shall cry delia kissing her and stroking her hand fondly silly mother belinda sits down in the deckchair and delia sits on the table belinda isnt it a lovely day for april darling ive wanted to say that to somebody all day and youre the first person whos given me the chance oh i said it to betty but she only said yes maam delia poor mother belinda jumping up suddenly crossing to l of and kissing delia again i simply must have another one and to think that youre never going back to school any more looking at her fondly and backing to l darling you are looking pretty delia am i belinda lovely she kisses her once more then she takes the cushion from the hammock moves at back of table and places it on the head of the deckchair and now youre going to stay with me for just as long as you want a mother anxiously moving to r of deckchair darling you didnt mind being sent away to school did you it is the usual thing you know delia silly mother of course it is belinda relieved and sitting on deckchair im so glad you think so too delia have you been very lonely without me belinda with a sly look at delia very delia turning to belinda and holding up a finger the truth mummy belinda ive missed you horribly delia primly the absence of female companionship of the requisite delia are you really all alone belinda smiling mysteriously and coyly well not always of course delia excitedly at she slips off the table and backing to l a little mummy i believe youre being bad again belinda really darling you forget that im old enough to be in fact am your mother delia nodding her head you are being bad belinda rising with dignity and drawing herself up to her full height moving l my child that is not the way to oh i say what a lot taller i am than you turning her back to delia and comparing sizes delia and prettier belinda playfully rubbing noses with delia oh do you think so firmly but pleased dont be silly child delia holding up a finger now tell me all thats been happening here at once belinda with a sigh and i was just going to ask you how you were getting on with your french sits in deckchair delia bother french youve been having a much more interesting time than i have so youve got to tell belinda with a happy sigh ooh she sinks back into her chair delia taking off her coat is it like the count at scarborough belinda surprised and pained my darling what do you mean delia dont you remember the count who kept proposing to you at scarborough i do places coat on hammock belinda reproachfully dear one you were the merest child paddling about on the beach and digging castles delia smiling to herself i was old enough to notice the count belinda sadly and id bought her a perfectly new spade how one deceives oneself delia at table and leaning across with hands on table and then there was the mp who proposed at windermere belinda yes dear but it wasnt seconded i mean he never got very far with it delia and the artist in wales belinda darling child what a memory you have no wonder your teachers are pleased with you delia settling herself comfortably in deckchair l of belinda and lying in her arms now tell me all about this one belinda meekly which one delia excitedly oh are there lots belinda severely only two delia two you abandoned woman belinda its something in the air darling ive never been in devonshire in april before delia is it really serious this time belinda pained i wish you wouldnt say this time delia it sounds so unromantic if youd only put it into french cette fois it sounds so much better cette fois parentally when ones daughter has just returned from an expensive schooling in paris one likes to feel delia what i meant dear was am i to have a stepfather at last belinda now youre being too french darling delia why do you still think father may be alive belinda why not its only eighteen years since he left us and he was quite a young man then delia yes but surely surely youd have heard from him in all those years if hed been alive belinda well he hasnt heard from me and im still alive delia looking earnestly at her mother rises and moves lc i shall never understand it belinda understand what delia were you as heavenly when you were young as you are now belinda rapturously oh i was sweet delia and yet he left you after only six months belinda rather crossly sitting up i wish you wouldnt keep on saying he left me i left him too delia running to and kneeling in front of belinda and looking anxiously into her face why belinda smiling to herself well you see he was quite certain he knew how to manage women and i was quite certain i knew how to manage men thoughtfully if only one of us had been certain it would have been all right delia seriously what really happened mummy im grown up now so i think you ought to tell me belinda thoughtfully that was about all you know except for his beard delia had he a beard laughing how funny belinda roaring with laughter in which delia joins yes dear it was but he never would see it he took it quite seriously delia and did you say dramatically if you really loved me youd take it off belinda apologetically im afraid i did darling delia and what did he say belinda he said very rudely that if i loved him id do my hair in a different way delia sinks down on her haunches facing the audience how ridiculous belinda touching her hair of course i didnt do it like this then i suppose we never ought to have married really delia why did you belinda mother rather wanted it solemnly delia never get married because your mother oh i forgot im your mother delia and i dont want a better one they embrace and so you left each other belinda yes delia but darling didnt you tell him there was going to be a me belinda oh no delia i wonder why not belinda well you see if i had he might have wanted to stay delia but belinda hurt if he didnt want to stay for me i didnt want him to stay for you penitently forgive me darling but i didnt know you very well then weve been very happy together havent we delia going to the hammock sitting in it and dangling her legs i should think we have belinda leaning back in chair i dont want to deny you anything and of course if youd like a stepfather looking down modestly or two delia oh you have been enjoying yourself belinda only you see how awkward it would be if jack turned up in the middle of the wedding like like eugene aram delia enoch arden darling belinda its very confusing their having the same initials perhaps id better call them both e a in future and then i shall be safe well anyhow it would be awkward darling wouldnt it not that i should know him from adam after all these years except for a mole on his left arm delia perhaps adam had a mole belinda no darling youre thinking of noah he had two delia thoughtfully i wonder what would happen if you met somebody whom you really did fall in love with belinda reproachfully now youre being serious and its april delia arent these two the present two serious belinda oh no they think they are but they arent a bit really besides im doing them such a lot of good im sure theyd hate to marry me but they love to think theyre in love with me and i love it and and they love it and and we all love it delia rising and crossing to belinda you really are the biggest darlingest baby who ever lived kisses her do say i shant spoil your lovely times belinda surprised spoil them why youll make them more lovely than ever delia turning away and sitting on table well but do they know you have a grownup daughter belinda suddenly realizing and sitting up oh delia it doesnt really matter because you dont look a day more than thirty belinda absently no hurriedly i mean how sweet of you only delia what belinda playing with her rings well one of them mr baxter harold she looks quickly up at delia and down again in pretty affectation but she is really laughing at herself all the time he writes statistical articles for the reviews percentages and all those things hes just the sort of man if he knew that i was your mother to work it out that i was more than thirty the other one mr devenish claude she looks up and down as before hes rather rather poetical he thinks i came straight from heaven last week delia laughing and jumping up and crossing below deckchair to r towards house i think id better go straight back to paris belinda jumping up and catching her firmly by the left arm you will do nothing of the sort pulling delia back to centre you will take off that hat she lets go of the arm and begins to take out the pin which is a perfect duck and i dont know why i didnt say so before she puts the hat down on the table and let me take a good look at you she does so and kiss you she does so then crosses delia below her and takes her towards the house and then well go to your room and unpack and have a lovely talk about clothes and then well have tea betty comes in and stands up at back and now heres betty coming in to upset all our delightful plans just when wevt made them belinda and delia are now on bettys r delia leaving belinda and shaking hands with betty how are you betty ive left school betty very nicely thank you miss backing to l and admiring youve grown belinda moving to and patting the top of delias head im much taller than she is crossing to betty in front of delia well betty what is it betty the two gentlemen mr baxter and mr devenish have both called together maam belinda excited oh how how very simultaneous of them delia eagerly going towards house oh do let me see them belinda stopping her darling youll see plenty of them before youve finished to betty in an exaggerated whisper what have you done with them betty theyre waiting in the hall maam while i said i would see if you were at home belinda all right betty give me two minutes and then show them out here betty yes maam betty crosses below belinda and delia and exits into the house belinda taking delia down r a step they cant do much harm to each other in two minutes delia taking her hat from table well ill go and unpack she goes back to belinda you really wont mind my coming down afterwards belinda of course not a little awkwardly taking delias arm and moving down r darling one i wonder if youd mind just at first being introduced as my niece by now at foot of deck chair you see i expect theyre in a bad temper already now c having come here together and we dont want to spoil their day entirely delia smiling on belindas l ill be your mother if you like belinda oh no that wouldnt do because then mr baxter would feel that he ought to ask your permission before paying his attentions to me hes just that sort of man a niece is so safe however good you are at statistics you cant really prove anything delia all right mummy belinda enjoying herself youd like to be called by a different name wouldnt you theres something so thrilling about taking a false name such a lot of adventures begin like that how would you like to be miss robinson darling its a nice easy one to remember persuasively and you shall put your hair up so as to feel more disguised what fun were going to have delia you baby all right then im miss robinson your favourite niece she takes her jacket from the hammock and moves towards the house belinda how sweet of you no no not that way youll meet them following quickly up between tree and table to delia who has now reached the house oh im coming with you to do your hair moving up c arm in arm with delia you dont think youre going to be allowed to do it yourself when so much depends on it and husbands leave you because of it and belinda seeing betty entering from house hurries delia up r and they bob down behind the yew hedge r betty comes from the house into the garden crossing to centre and up stage looking for belinda followed by mr baxter and mr devenish baxter gives an angry look round at devenish as he enters mr baxter is fortyfive prim and erect with closetrimmed moustache and sidewhiskers his clothes are dark and he wears a bowlerhat mr devenish is a longhaired goodlooking boy in a n glig costume perhaps twentytwo years old and very scornful of the world baxter crosses to l below betty and turns to her with a sharp inquiring glance devenish moves down r languidly admiring the garden betty looking about her surprised the mistress was here a moment ago the two heads pop up from behind the hedge and then down again immediately belinda and delia exeunt r i expect shell be back directly if youll just wait she goes back into the house baxter crossing to r meets devenish who has moved up r baxter is annoyed and with an impatient gesture comes down between the tree and the table to chair l and sits devenish throws his felt hat on to the table and walks to the back of the hammock he sees the review in the hammock and picks it up devenish good heavens baxter shes been reading your article baxter i dare say shes not the only one devenish thats only guesswork going to back of table you dont know of anyone else baxter with contempt how many people may i ask have bought your poems devenish loftily i dont write for the mob baxter i think i may say that of my own work devenish baxter i dont want to disappoint you but i have reluctantly come to the conclusion that you are one of the mob throws magazine down on table annoyed dash it what are you doing in the country at all in a bowlerhat baxter if i wanted to be personal i could say why dont you get your hair cut only that form of schoolboy humour doesnt appeal to me devenish this is not a personal matter i am protesting on behalf of nature leaning against tree what do the birds and the flowers and the beautiful trees think of your hat baxter if one began to ask oneself what the birds thought of things he pauses devenish well and why shouldnt one ask oneself it is better than asking oneself what the stock exchange thinks of things baxter well looking up at devenishs extravagant hair its the nesting season your hair suddenly ha ha ha ha ha ha devenish hastily smoothing it down really baxter youre vulgar he turns away and resumes his promenading going down r and then round deckchair to front of hammock suddenly he sees his book on the grass beneath the hammock and makes a dash for it ha my book gloating over it baxter she reads my book baxter i suppose you gave her a copy devenish exultingly yes i gave her a copy my next book will be hers and hers alone baxter then let me say that in my opinion you took a very great liberty devenish liberty and this from a man who is continually forcing his unwelcome statistics upon her baxter at any rate i flatter myself that there is no suggestion of impropriety in anything that i write devenish im not so sure about that baxter baxter what do you mean sir devenish did you read the times this month on the new reviews baxter well devenish oh nothing it just said mr baxters statistics are extremely suggestive baxter makes a gesture of annoyance i havent read them so of course i dont know what youve been up to baxter rising turning away in disgust and crossing up l pah devenish poor old baxter puts book of poems down on table and crosses below chair and gathers a daffodil from a large vase down r and saying poor old baxter ad lib baxter moves round back of hammock and to r collides with devenish and much annoyed goes down between table and tree towards chair down l baxter moving to and leaning against tree r baxter turning to devenish crossly i wish you wouldnt keep calling me baxter devenish harold baxter displays annoyance and continues his walk to l baxter it is only by accident an accident which we both deplore that we have met at all and in any case i am a considerably older man than yourself sits l devenish mr baxter father gesture of annoyance from baxter i have a proposal to make we will leave it to this beautiful flower to decide which of us the lady loves baxter turning round eh devenish pulling off the petals she loves me she loves mr baxter she loves me she loves mr baxter belinda appears in the porch heaven help her she loves me belinda coming down r what are you doing mr devenish devenish throwing away the flower and bowing very low my lady baxter rises quickly baxter removing his bowlerhat stiffly good afternoon mrs tremayne she gives her left hand to devenish who kisses it and her right to baxter who shakes it belinda how nice of you both to come baxter mr devenish and i are inseparable apparently belinda you havent told me what you were doing mr devenish was it plucking an imaginary flower this year next year or silk satin devenish my lady it was even more romantic than that i have the honour to announce to your ladyship that mr baxter is to be a sailor dances round imitating the hornpipe belinda to baxter doesnt he talk nonsense baxter hell grow out of it i did belinda moving down r and then to centre towards hammock oh i hope not i love talking nonsense and im ever so old as they both start forward to protest now which one of you will say it first devenish you are as old as the stars and as young as the dawn baxter you are ten years younger than i am belinda what sweet things to say i dont know which i like best devenish where will my lady sit belinda with an exaggerated curtsy i will recline in the hammock an it please thee my lord baxter goes to the right of the hammock saying allow me devenish moves to the left of the hammock and holds it takes up a cushion which baxter snatches from him and places in hammock again only its rather awkward getting in mr baxter perhaps youd both better look at the tulips for a moment baxter oh ah yes crosses down r turns his back to the hammock and examines the flowers devenish leaning over her if only belinda youd better not say anything mr devenlsh keep it for your next volume he turns away and examines flowers on l she sits on hammock one two three throws her legs over that was better than last time they turn round to see her safely in the hammock devenish leans against the l tree at her feet and baxter draws the deckchair from the right side of the table and turns it round towards her he presses his hat more firmly on and sits down i wonder if either of you can guess what ive been reading this afternoon devenish looking at her lovingly i know belinda giving him a fleeting look how did you know devenish well i belinda to baxter yes mr baxter it was your article i was reading if youd come five minutes earlier youd have found me wrestling i mean revelling in it baxter i am very greatly honoured mrs tremayne ah it seemed to me a very interesting curve showing the rise and fall of belinda i hadnt got up to the curves they are interesting arent they they are really more in mr devenishs line to devenish mr devenish it was a great disappointment to me that all the poems in your book seemed to be written to somebody else devenish it was before i met you lady they were addressed to the goddess of my imagination it is only in these last few weeks that i have discovered her belinda and discovered she was dark and not fair devenish she will be dark in my next volume belinda oh how nice of her baxter kindly you should write a real poem to mrs tremayne belinda excitedly oh do to belinda i dont know what rhymes except cinder you could say your heart was like a cinder all burnt up devenish pained oh my lady im afraid that is a cockney rhyme belinda how thrilling ive never been to hampstead heath devenish belinda it is far too beautiful to rhyme with anything but itself belinda fancy but what about tremayne singing oh i am mrs tremayne and i dont want to marry again devenish protesting my lady baxter protesting belinda belinda pointing excitedly to baxter there thats the first time hes called me belinda this naughty boy indicating devenish is always doing it by accident devenish are you serious belinda not as a rule devenish youre not going to marry again belinda well who could i marry devenish and baxter together me belinda dropping her eyes modestly but this is england baxter rising and taking off his hat which he places on table and going up to belinda mrs tremayne i claim the right of age of my greater years to speak first devenish mrs tremayne i belinda kindly to devenish you can speak afterwards mr devenish its so awkward when you both speak together to baxter giving encouragement yes baxter moving down a little and then returning to belinda mrs tremayne i am a man of substantial position devenish sniggers to baxters great annoyance and perhaps i may say of some repute in serious circles devenish sniggers again all that i have whether of material or mental endowment i lay at your feet together with an admiration which i cannot readily put into words as my wife i think you would be happy and i feel that with you by my side i could achieve even greater things belinda how sweet of you but i ought to tell you that im no good at figures devenish protesting my lady belinda i dont mean what you mean mr devenish you wait till its your turn to baxter yes baxter very formally i ask you to marry me belinda belinda settling herself happily and closing her eyes ooh now its your turn mr devenish devenish excitedly money thank heaven i have no money reputation thank heaven i have no reputation baxter very annoyed moves down and sits on deckchair what can i offer you dreams nothing but dreams come with me and i will show you the world through my dreams what can i give you youth freedom beauty baxter debts belinda still with her eyes shut you mustnt interrupt mr baxter devenish leaning across hammock belinda marry me and i will open your eyes to the beauty of the world come to me belinda happily ooh youve got such different ways of putting things how can i choose between you devenish then you will marry one of us belinda you know i really oughtnt to baxter i dont see why not belinda well theres just a little difficulty in the way devenish what is it i will remove it for you i could remove anything yes even baxter he looks at baxter who is sitting more solidly than ever in his chair belinda and anyhow i should have to choose between you devenish in a whisper choose me baxter stiffly mrs tremayne does not require any prompting a fair field and let the best man win devenish going across to and slapping the astonished baxter on the back aye let the best man win well spoken baxter baxter is very annoyed to belinda and going back to her l send us out into the world upon some knightly quest lady and let the victor be rewarded baxter i er ought to say that i should be unable to go very far i have an engagement to speak at newcastle on the lst devenish baxter i will take no unfair advantage of you let the beard of the lord mayor of newcastle be the talisman that my lady demands i am satisfied baxter this sort of thing is entirely contrary to my usual mode of life but i will not be outfaced by a mere boy rising i am prepared going to her devenish speak lady belinda speaking in a deep mysterious voice gentlemen ye put wild thoughts into my head in sooth i am minded to send ye forth upon a quest that is passing strange know ye that there is a maid journeyed hither hight robinson whose in her natural voice whats the old for aunt baxter hopefully mothers sister belinda you know i think i shall have to explain this in ordinary language you wont mind very much will you mr devenish devenish it is the spirit of this which matters not the language which clothes it belinda oh im so glad you think so well now about miss robinson shes my niece and shes just come to stay with me and poor girl shes lost her father absolutely lost him he disappeared ever such a long time ago and poor miss robinson delia naturally wants to find him poor girl she cant think where he is devenish nobly i will find him belinda oh thank you mr devenish miss robinson would be so much obliged baxter yes er but what have we to go upon beyond the fact that his name is robinson belinda i shouldnt go on that too much you see he may easily have changed it by now he was never very much of a robinson nothing to do with peter or any of those devenish i will find him baxter with a look of annoyance at devenish well can you tell us what hes like belinda well its such a long time since i saw him looking down modestly of course i was quite a girl then the only thing i know for certain is that he has a mole on his left arm about here she indicates a spot just below the elbow baxter examines it closely devenish folding his arms and looking nobly upwards i will find him baxter i am bound to inform you mrs tremayne that even a trained detective could not give you very much hope in such a case however i will keep a lookout for him and of course if devenish fear not lady i will find him baxter annoyed yes you keep on saying that but what have you got to go on devenish grandly faith the faith which moves mountains belinda yes and this is only just one small molehill mr baxter baxter yes but still belinda ssh here is miss robinson baxter takes up his hat and moves below the deckchair to r to meet delia if mr devenish will hold the hammock while i alight we dont want an accident delia comes out of the house i can introduce you he helps her to get out holding the hammock thank you delia darling delia moves down r this is mr baxter and mr devenish my niece miss robinson delia shakes hands with baxter and moves to c below belinda and shakes hands with devenish delia how do you do belinda miss robinson has just come over from france man dieu quel pays baxter i hope you had a good crossing miss robinson delia oh i never mind about the crossing very slowly and shyly aunt belindashe stops and smiles belinda yes dear delia i believe tea is almost ready i want mine and im sure mr baxters hungry he sniggers approvingly mr devenish scorns food i expect devenish hurt why do you say that delia arent you a poet belinda yes darling but that doesnt prevent him eating hell be absolutely lyrical over bettys sandwiches devenish you wont deny me that inspiration i hope miss robinson belinda taking delias arm and moving with her to below deck chair well lets go and see what theyre like delia moves up rc to below the porch accompanied by baxter on her r and devenish who follows her on her l they all move towards the porch mr baxter just a moment baxter apologizing to delia and moving in front of the others to back of deckchair yes delia gathers a daffodil from a vase r and places it in devenishs buttonhole belinda secretly not a word to her about mr robinson it must be a surprise for her baxter quite so i understand belinda thats right baxter rejoins delia raising her voice oh mr devenish devenish who is evidently much attracted by delia apologizes to her and goes back between tree and hammock to l of belinda devenish yes mrs tremayne belinda secretly not a word to her about mr robinson it must be a surprise for her devenish of course i shouldnt dreamindignantly robinson what an unsuitable name baxter and delia are just going into the house belinda dismissing devenish all right ill catch you up devenish goes after the other two left alone belinda laughs happily to herself and then begins to look rather aimlessly about her she picks up her sunshade and opens it she comes to the hammock picks out her handkerchief says ah there you are and puts it away she goes slowly towards the house tremayne enters from l and with his back to the audience tries latch of imaginary gate below scenic painted gateway l belinda turns her head hearing imaginary click of the garden gate l she comes slowly back rc belinda seeing tremayne have you lost yourself or something no the latch is this side yes thats right tremayne comes in he has been knocking about the world for eighteen years and is very much a man though he has kept his manners his hair is greying a little at the sides and he looks the fortyodd that he is without his moustache and beard he is very different from the boy belinda married tremayne with his hat in his hand im afraid im trespassing belinda winningly moving down r a little but its such a pretty garden turns away dosing her parasol isnt it tremayne half recognizing her moves to back of hammock and leans across to obtain a better view of her tremayne rather confused ii beg your pardon ier he is wondering if it can possibly be she belinda thinks his confusion is due to the fact that he is trespassing and hastens to put him at his ease belinda i should have done the same myself you know tremayne pulling himself together oh but you mustnt think i just came in because i liked the garden belinda clapping her hands no but say you do like it quick tremayne its lovely and he hesitates belinda hopefully yes tremayne with conviction yes its lovely belinda with that happy sigh of hers ooh now tell me what really did happen tremayne i was on my way to marytown belinda to where tremayne marytown belinda oh you mean mariton tremayne do i belinda yes we always call it mariton down here earnestly you dont mind do you tremayne smiling not a bit belinda just say it to see if youve got it right tremayne mariton belinda shaking her head oh no thats quite wrong try it again with a rustic accent mariton tremayne mariton belinda yes thats much better as if it were he who had interrupted well do go on tremayne im afraid it isnt much of an apology really i saw what looked like a private

talking about than that belinda do you think so he says yes with his eyes bows and moves up c the piano is now forte belinda accompanies him up a little then stops he turns in entrance up c and they

and he will say yes and you will say oh i beg your pardon sir almost as if she were betty she begins to move towards the house this way she would be smiling an invitation over her shoulder to mr

sittingroom there is an inner and an outer frontdoor both of which are open up c is a door leading to a small room where hats and coats are kept a door on the l leads towards the livingrooms devenish enters from up l at back passes the windows of the inner room and crosses to the porch he rings the electric bell outside then enters through the swing doors rc betty enters r and moves up at back of settee r to devenish by the swing doors he is carrying a large bunch of violets and adopts a very aesthetic attitude betty good morning sir devenish good morning i am afraid this is an unceremonious hour for a call but my sense of beauty urged me hither in defiance of convention betty yes sir devenish holding up his bouquet to betty see the dew is yet lingering upon them how could i let them wait until this afternoon betty yes sir but i think the mistress is out devenish they are not for your mistress they are for miss delia betty oh i beg your pardon sir if you will come in ill see if i can find her she crosses to the door r and goes away to find delia dosing the door after her devenish tries a number of poses about the room for himself and hit bouquet he crosses below the table c and sits l of it and is about to place his elbow on the table when he finds the toy dog which has been placed there is in his way he removes it to the centre of the table and then leans with his elbow on table and finds this pose unsuitable so he crosses to above the fireplace and leans against the upper portico resting on his elbow which slips and nearly prostrates him he then crosses up to l of the cupboard door at back centre and leans on his elbow against the wall enter delia from the door r delia shutting the door and going to devenish oh good morning mr devenish illustration devenish kisses her hand im afraid my er aunt is out devenish i know miss delia i know delia shell be so sorry to have missed you it is her day for you isnt it devenish her day for me delia yes mr baxter generally comes tomorrow doesnt he devenish jealously miss delia if our friendship is to progress at all it can only be on the distinct understanding that i take no interest whatever coming to back of table c in mr baxters movements delia moving down r a little oh im so sorry i thought you knew what lovely flowers are they for my aunt devenish to whom does one bring violets to modest shrinking tender youth delia i dont think we have anybody here like that devenish with a bow and holding out the violets to her miss delia they are for you delia smelling and taking violets oh how nice of you but im afraid i oughtnt to take them from you under false pretences i dont shrink devenish a fanciful way of putting it perhaps they are none the less for you delia well its awfully kind of you puts flowers down then she moves up to the cupboard he follows on her l and opens the door im afraid im not a very romantic person turning to him in cupboard doorway aunt belinda does all the romancing in our family devenish your aunt is a very remarkable woman delia she is dont you dare to say a word against her takes up a vase from a chair in cupboard and shakes it as if draining it devenish my dear miss delia nothing could be further from my thoughts why am i not indebted to her for that great happiness which has come to me in these last few days delia surprised good gracious and i didnt know anything about it coming down to r of table with vase but what about poor mr baxter devenish stiffly crossing over to fireplace very annoyed i must beg that mr baxters name be kept out of our conversation delia going up to table behind chesterfield up l but i thought mr baxter and you were such friends delia takes water carafe from the table and smiles at devenish which he does not see do tell me whats happened moving down to r of table c she sits and arranges the flowers i seem to have lost myself devenish coming to the back of c table and reclining on it what has happened miss delia is that i have learnt at last the secret that my heart has been striving to tell me for weeks past as soon as i saw that gracious lady your aunt i knew that i was in love foolishly i took it for granted that it was she for whom my heart was thrilling how mistaken i was directly you came you opened my eyes and now delia mr devenish you dont say youre proposing to me devenish i am i feel sure i am leaning towards her delia i love you delia how exciting of you devenish with a modest shrug its nothing i am a poet delia you really want to marry me devenish such is my earnest wish delia but what about my aunt devenish simply she will be my auntinlaw delia shell be rather surprised devenish delia i will be frank with you sits i admit that i made mrs tremayne an offer of marriage delia excitedly you really did was it that first afternoon i came devenish yes delia oh i wish id been there devenish with dignity rising and moving to l of table it is not my custom to propose in the presence of a third party it is true that on the occasion you mention a man called baxter was on the lawn but i regarded him no more than the old appletree or the flower beds or any other of the fixtures delia what did she say devenish she accepted me conditionally delia oh do tell me devenish it is rather an unhappy story this man called baxter in his vulgar way also made a proposal of marriage mrs tremayne was gracious enough to imply that she would marry whichever one of us fulfilled a certain condition delia how sweet of her devenish it is my earnest hope miss delia that the man called baxter will be the victor as far as is consistent with honour i shall endeavour to let mr baxter banging the table with his hand win delia what was the condition devenish that i am not at liberty to tell delia oh devenish it is i understand to be a surprise for you delia how exciting rising and taking vase of violets which she places up r mr devenish you have been very frank coming to front of settee r and sitting may i be equally so devenish crosses to her and bows in acquiescence why do you wear your hair so long devenish pleased you have noticed it delia well yes i have devenish i wear it so to express my contempt for the conventions of socalled society delia i always thought that people wore it very very short if they despised the conventions of society devenish i think that the mere fact that my hair annoys mr baxter is sufficient justification for its length delia but if it annoys me too devenish heroically it shall go sits on settee above delia belinda enters from up l with a garden basket supposed to contain cutlets she crosses the windows at back delia apologetically i told you i wasnt a very romantic person didnt i kindly you can always grow it again if you fall in love with somebody else devenish that is cruel of you delia i shall never fall in love again enter belinda through swing doors bc belinda why its mr devenish devenish rises and kisses her hand somewhat sheepishly how nice of you to come so early in the morning how is mr baxter devenish annoyed and crossing behind belinda to her l i do not know mrs tremayne belinda coming down to delia and sitting in the place vacated by devenish i got most of the things delia to devenish the things mr devenish is my rather stuffy way of referring to all the delightful poems that you are going to eat tonight devenish i am looking forward to it immensely mrs tremayne belinda i do hope ive got all your and mr baxters favourite dishes devenish annoyed and moving to l foot of table c im afraid mr baxter and i are not likely to appreciate the same things belinda coyly oh mr devenish and you were so unanimous a few days ago delia i think mr devenish was referring entirely to things to eat belinda i felt quite sad when i was buying the lamb cutlets to think that only a few days before they had been frisking about with their mammas and having poems written about them by mr devenish there im giving away the whole dinner delia take him away before i tell him any more delia rises goes to table and picks up water carafe which she replaces on refectory table up l we must keep some surprises for him delia to devenish as she crosses back to table r and picks up the flowers come along mr devenish belinda wickedly are those my flowers mr devenish devenish advancing to belinda and laughing awkwardly after a little hesitation with a bow which might refer to either of them they are for the most beautiful lady in the land belinda oh how nice of you devenish crosses to door r and opens it for delia who follows him and exits devenish standing above door catches belindas eye and with an awkward laugh follows delia belinda i suppose he means delia bless them she kisses her hand towards the door r she then rises and crosses below the table c placing her basket on the l end of it to the fireplace she rings the bell then she moves up on the r side of the chesterfield to the refectory table and takes off her hat she takes up a mirror from the table and gives a few pats to her hair and as she is doing so betty enters from door r and crosses the room towards c belinda pointing to basket on the c table oh betty betty moves to back of c table and takes up the basket crosses above settee and exits through door r belinda is moving towards the swing doors when she catches sight of baxter entering from the garden up r she moves quickly to the l of c table takes up a book and going to chesterfield l lies down with her head to r baxter looks in through the window up r then crosses round and enters through the portico and the swing doors belinda pretends to be very busy reading baxter rather nervously in front of wring doors er may i come in mrs tremayne belinda dropping her book and turning round with a violent start oh mr baxter how you surprised me she puts her hand to her heart and sits up and faces him baxter i must apologize for intruding upon you at this hour mrs tremayne belinda holding up her hand stop baxter startled what belinda i cannot let you come in like that baxter looking down at himself like what belinda dropping her eyes you called me belinda once baxter coming down to her may i explain my position mrs tremayne belinda before you begin have you been seeing my niece lately baxter surprised no belinda oh sweetly please go on baxter why is she lost too belinda oh no i just do sit down baxter moves to the chair l of c table and sits belinda rises when he has sat down let me put your hat down somewhere for you baxter keeping it firmly in his hand it will be all right here thank you belinda returning to the chesterfield and sitting im dying to hear what you are going to say baxter first as regards the use of your christian name i felt that as a man of honour i could not permit myself to use it until i had established my right over that of mr devenish belinda all my friends call me belinda baxter as between myself and mr devenish the case is somewhat different until one of us is successful over the other in the quest upon which you have sent us i feel that as far as possible we should hold aloof from you belinda pleadingly just say belinda once more in case youre a long time baxter very formally belinda belinda how nicely you say it harold baxter getting out of his seat mrs tremayne i must not listen to this belinda meekly i wont offend again mr baxter please go on she motions him to sit he does so tell me about the quest are you winning baxter i am progressing mrs tremayne indeed i came here this morning to acquaint you with the results of my investigations clears his throat yesterday i located a man called robinson working upon a farm close by i ventured to ask him if he had any marks upon him by which he could be recognized he adopted a threatening attitude and replied that if i wanted any he could give me some with the aid of halfacrown i managed to placate him putting my inquiry in another form i asked if he had any moles a regrettable misunderstanding which led to a fruitless journey to another part of the village was eventually cleared up and on my return i satisfied myself that this man was in no way related to your niece belinda admiringly how splendid of you baxter yes belinda well now we know hes not she holds up one finger baxter yes in the afternoon i located another mr robinson following the profession of a carrier my first inquiries led to a similar result with the exception that in this case mr robinson carried his threatening attitude so far as to take off his coat and roll up his sleeves perceiving at once that he was not the man i withdrew belinda how brave you are baxter yes belinda that makes two baxter yea belinda holding up another finger it still leaves a good many pleadingly just call me belinda again baxter rising and backing to r a little nervously you mustnt tempt me mrs tremayne belinda penitently i wont baxter going slowly to fireplace and placing his hat down on urmchair below fireplace to resume then my narrative this morning i have heard of a third mr robinson whether there is actually any particular fortune attached to the number three i cannot say for certain it is doubtful whether statistics would be found to support the popular belief but one likes to flatter oneself that in ones own case it may be true and so belinda and so the third mr robinson baxter something for which i cannot altogether account inspires me with hope he is i have discovered staying at mariton this afternoon i go to look for him belinda to herself mariton how funny i wonder if its the same one baxter what one belinda oh just one of the ones gratefully mr baxter you are doing all this for me baxter pray do not mention it i dont know if its devonshire going to and sitting l of belinda or the time of the year or the sort of atmosphere you create mrs tremayne but i feel an entirely different man there is something in the air which yes i shall certainly go over to mariton this afternoon belinda gravely i have had the same feeling sometimes mr baxter i am not always the staid respectable matron which i appear to you to be sometimes i she looks absently at the watch on her wrist good gracious baxter alarmed what is it belinda looking anxiously from the door to him mr baxter im going to throw myself on your mercy baxter my dear mrs tremayne belinda looking at her watch again rising and moving up lc looking at door a strange man will be here directly he must not find you with me baxter rising jealously a man belinda excitedly yes yes a man he is pursuing me

you moving l a little and looking out of windows baxter but you belinda i can defend myself i will send him away but he must not find you here you must hide before he overpowers you baxter with dignity crossing below table to r i will withdraw if you wish it belinda following to r at back of table c no not withdraw hide he might see you withdrawing leading the way to the cupboard door quick in here baxter embarrassed at the thought that this sort of thing really only happens in a bedroom farce and moving towards her i dont think i quite belinda reassuring him its perfectly respectable its where we keep the umbrellas she takes him by the hand baxter resisting and looking nervously into the cupboard im not at all sure that i belinda earnestly oh but dont you see what trust im putting in you to herself some people are so nervous about their umbrellas baxter well of course if you but i dont see why i shouldnt just slip out of the door before he comes belinda reproachfully of course if you grudge me every little pleasurecrossing in front of baxter towards swing doors and seeing tremayne coming quick here he is she bundles him through the cupboard door and closes it and with a sign of happiness crosses down to c table she sees baxters bowler hat on the armchair below the fireplace she fetches and carries it over to the cupboard door knocks and hands it to him saying your hat baxter expostulating and nearly knocking her over as he comes out well really i belinda bundling him into the cupboard and closing the door hush belinda straightens her hair takes up her book from l of c table and sits stroking the head of the toy dog and pretending to read tremayne enters from garden up r and through the swing doors up rc belinda gives an assumed cry of surprise tremayne at the swing doors its no good your pretending to be surprised because you said i could come coming down to the back of the table c and putting down his hat belinda rising shaking hands and welcoming him but i can still be surprised that you wanted to come tremayne oh no you arent belinda markng it off on her fingers just a little bit that much tremayne it would be much more surprising if i hadnt come belinda crossing to the chesterfield picking up her book and handing it to tremayne who puts it on the table it is a pretty garden isnt it she sits on r end of chesterfield tremayne coming to her you forget that i saw the garden yesterday belinda oh but the things have grown so much since then let me see this is the third day youve been and we only met three days ago he moves behind the

expect your little one refuses to be cooked she goes out after betty left alone tremayne stalks moodily about the room crossing it and kicking things which come in his way violently he kicks a hassock which is above the table r to under the table c then he takes up his hat and moves towards the swing doors and half opens them he pauses and considers then he comes down to the centre table throws down his hat moves round the left end of the table finds the dog in the way and then sits on the table with his hands in his pockets facing the audience as he has been moving about the room he has muttered the names of baxter and devenish devenish entering from the door r which he closes and goes to foot of the settee r surprised hullo a pause tremayne jealously and rising are you mr devenish

devenish i congratulate you i thought your greatgrandchildren would be the first to hear of me tremayne moving to l my names robinson by the way devenish connecting him with delia then let me return the compliment robinson your name is familiar to me tremayne hastily and going towards devenish i dont think im related to any robinsons you know devenish dubiously well no i suppose not when i was very much younger i began a collection of robinsons actually it was only three days ago but it seems much longer thinking of delia many things have happened since then tremayne uninterested moving l really devenish there is a man called baxter tremayne displays his jealousy of baxter who is still collecting i believe for myself i am only interested in one of the great family delia tremayne eagerly and going quickly to him and placing his hand on devenishs left shoulder you are interested in her devenish devotedly in fact i am at this moment waiting for her to put on her hat tremayne warmly banging him on the shoulder with both hands my dear devenish i am delighted to make your acquaintance he seizes his hand and grips it heartily how are you devenish backs to the settee in pain devenish sitting on settee feeling his fingers fairly well thanks tremayne sitting above him and banging him on the back thats right devenish still nursing his hand you are a very lucky fellow robinson tremayne in what way devenish people you meet must be so very reluctant to say goodbye to you have you ever tried strangling lions or anything like that tremayne with a laugh well as a matter of fact i have devenish i suppose you won all right tremayne in the end with the help of my beater devenish personally i should have backed you alone against any two ordinary lions tremayne one was quite enough as it was he gave me something to remember him by putting up his left sleeve he displays a deep scar devenish looking at it casually by jove thats a nasty one he suddenly catches sight of the mole and stares at it fascinated then stares up at tremayne good heavens tremayne whats the matter devenish clasping his head wait rising and moving up to l of tremayne let me think after a pause have you ever met a man called baxter tremayne no devenish would you like to tremayne grimly very much indeed devenish hes the man i told you about whos interested in robinsons hell be delighted to meet you with a nervous laugh funny thing hes rather an authority on lions you must show him that scar of yours it will intrigue him immensely earnestly dont shake hands with him too heartily just at first it might put him off the whole thing tremayne this mr baxter seems to be a curious man divenish absently yes he is rather odd looking at his watch i wonder if ito tremayne i suppose you wont be he stops suddenly a slight tapping noise comes from the room where they keep umbrellas tremayne whats that the tapping noise is repeated a little more loudly this time devenish moves to end of table devenish come in the door opens and baxter comes in nervously holding his bowler hat in his hand he moves towards the swing doors baxter apologetically oh i just tremayne stands up i just he goes back again devenish springing across the room baxter the door opens nervously again and baxters head appears round it come in baxter old man youre just the very person i wanted baxter comes in carefully devenish closes the door good man to tremayne taking baxter down r and placing his arm round his shoulders this is mr baxter that i was telling you about baxter removes devenishs arm from his shoulders tremayne moving up to baxter and much relieved at the appearance of his rival oh is this mr baxter holding out his hand with great friendliness how are you mr baxter devenish warningly steady tremayne shakes baxter quite gently by the hand baxter this is mr robinson casually robinson he looks sideways at baxter to see how he takes it baxter is noticeably impressed baxter really i am very glad to meet you sir tremayne very good of you to say so devenish to baxter taking his arm baxter is annoyed and gets free robinson is a great biggame hunter baxter moving down to tremayne indeed i have never done anything in that way myself but im sure it must be an absorbing pursuit tremayne oh well its something to do devenish to baxter you must get him to tell you about a wrestle he had with a lion once extraordinary story looking at his watch suddenly jove i must be off see you again baxter he bangs baxter on the shoulder and moves down to tremayne goodbye robinson no dont shake

your friend devenish i suppose it comes of being a poet baxter i have no great liking for mr devenish tremayne oh hes all right baxter but i am sure that if he is impressed by anything outside himself or his own works it must be something rather remarkable pray tell me of your adventure with the lion tremayne laughing really you mustnt think that i go about telling everybody my adventures it just happened to come up im afraid i shook his hand rather more warmly than i meant and he asked me if id ever tried strangling lions that was all baxter and had you tremayne well it just happened that i had baxter indeed you came off scatheless i trust tremayne carelessly indicating his arm well he got me one across there baxter rising and coming to above tremayne obviously excited really really points to his arm one across there not bad i hope tremayne laughing well it doesnt show unless i do that he pulls up his sleeve carelessly and baxter bends eagerly over his arm and sees the mole and very slowly looks up at tremayne then down at the arm again then up at tremayne baxter good heavens ive found it he runs over to the table and picks up his hat tremayne found what he pulls down his sleeve baxter going up l i must see mrs tremayne wheres mrs tremayne tremayne she went out just now whats the matter baxter out i must find her this is a matter of life and death he hurries through

towards centre table at soirees of the royal statistical society looking round the room he discovers that he is alone he picks up his hat from the table and jams it down on his head unusual he moves

foot of the settee r devenish to the back of the table up r while baxter stands at the back of the settee belinda moves to the front of the settee and delia sits on the table here you all are i do hope you havent been throwing away your cigars because smoking is allowed all over the house tremayne as he comes to the foot of the settee oh weve finished thank you belinda going up to the swing doors and opening them isnt it a wonderful night and so warm for april delia you must show mr robinson the garden by moonlight its the only light he hasnt seen it by devenish quickly coming to r back of table c i dont think ive ever seen it by moonlight miss delia belinda coming down a little i thought poets were always seeing things by moonlight baxter moving toward belinda i was hoping mrs tremayne that er perhaps delia moving quickly to above tremayne and taking his l hand and pulling him up stage to swing doors come along mr robinson tremayne looks at belinda who gives him a nod belinda then moves down r tremayne l of delia its very kind of you miss robinson i suppose there is no chance of a nightingale belinda there ought to be i ordered one specially for mr devenish delia and tremayne go out together belinda with a sigh moves over to the chesterfield and settles herself comfortably into it devenish annoyed by tremaynes attentions to delia crosses up angrily and looks off through the window up l above fireplace then comes down l of the chesterfield to the front of the fireplace baxter moves up to the swing doors angrily watching delia and tremayne then moves to the window r and looks off betty then enters with a salver from r she moves by the back of the settee to the back of the table c picks up the coffeecups and goes out r baxter then moves over to the window facing the audience up l he looks off then comes down to the r of belinda now were together again well mr devenish devenish er i belinda no i think ill let mr baxter speak first i know hes longing to baxter leaning on the back of the chair l of table he clears his throat hrm mrs tremayne i beg formally to claim your hand belinda sweetly on what grounds mr baxter devenish spiritedly yes sir on what grounds baxter coming to r of chesterfield close to belinda on the grounds that as i told you this morning i had succeeded in the quest devenish appearing to be greatly surprised succeeded baxter yes mr devenish young fellow you have lost he moves a few paces r to below the chair l of the table i have discovered the missing mr robinson devenish wiping hit brow and coming to baxter who where baxter dramatically miss robinson has at this moment gone out with her father devenish placing his hands heavily on baxters shoulders who staggers good heavens it was he baxter pats devenish sympathetically and moves to the back of the chesterfield and is about to speak to belinda she however silences him and he drops down to the front of the fireplace belinda sympathetically poor mr devenish devenish pointing tragically to the table and to think that i actually sat on that table no that seat he points to the settee r then he moves up stage between it and the table that i sat there with him this morning and never guessed why ten minutes ago i was asking him for the nuts baxter aha devenish youre not so clever as you thought you were devenish coming quickly to the back of the chair l of the table why i must have given you the clue myself he told me he had a scar on his arm and i never thought any more of it and then i went away innocently and left you two talking about it belinda alarmed a scar on his arm devenish where a lion mauled him belinda gives a little cry and shudder baxter its quite healed up now mrs tremayne belinda looking at him admiringly a lion what you two have adventured for my sake baxter i suppose you will admit devenish that i may fairly claim to have won looking the picture of despair devenish drops down l of the chair droops his head raises his arms and lets them fall hopelessly to his sides belinda mr devenish i have never admired you so much as i do at this moment she extends her r hand to devenish who gropes for it with his l hand and eventually manages to seize it baxter noticing he is holding her hand moving to them and looking at them quizzically indignantly to devenish i say you know thats not fair its all very well to take your defeat like a man but you mustnt overdo it they release their hands mrs tremayne i claim the reward which i have earned belinda after a pause and rising mr baxter mr devenish i have something to tell you devenish moves to her r belinda kneels upon the chesterfield facing them penitently i have not been quite frank with you i think you both ought to know that i i made a mistake delia is not my niece she is my daughter she buries her face in her hands devenish your daughter i say how ripping belinda gives him an understanding look baxter your daughter belinda yes baxter but but you arent old enough to have a daughter of that age belinda apologetically well there she is baxter but but shes grown up belinda quite baxter then in that case you must behe hesitates evidently working it out belinda hastily im afraid so mr baxter baxter but this makes a great difference i had no idea why when im fifty you would be belinda sighing yes i suppose i should baxter and when im sixty belinda pleadingly to devenish cant you stop him devenish with a threatening gesture look here baxter another word from you and youll never get to sixty baxter and then theres miss er delia in the event of our marrying mrs tremayne she i take it would be my stepdaughter belinda i dont think she would trouble us much mr baxter with a sly look at devenish i have an idea that she will be getting married before long she again glances at devenish who returns her look gratefully baxter moving up l into the inner room none the less the fact would be disturbing devenish with a wink at belinda crosses in front of her and warms his hands at the fire belinda watches baxter over the back of the chesterfield i have never yet considered myself seriously as a stepfather moving round the refectory table i dont think i am going too far if i say that to some extent i have been deceived in this matter he comes down to behind the c table belinda reproachfully and so have i i thought you loved me devenish sympathetically yes yes belinda turning to him suddenly and mr devenish too baxter moving to belinda er devenish er they stand before her guiltily and have nothing to say belinda with a shrug well i shall have to marry somebody else thats all baxter moving to below table who who belinda i suppose mr robinson after all if i am delias mother and mr baxter says that mr robinsons her father its about time we were married devenish eagerly mrs tremayne what fools we are he is your husband all the time belinda yes baxter moving up to the r of belinda youve had a husband all the time belinda apologetically i lost him it wasnt my fault baxter really this is very confusing i dont know where i am i gather i am to gather it seems that you are no longer eligible as a possible wife belinda i am afraid not mr baxter baxter but this is very confusing moving towards the swing doors this is very disturbing to a man of my age for weeks past i have been regarding myself as a a possible benedict i have ah taken steps back to the l end of the c table only this morning in writing to my housekeeper i warned her that she might hear at any moment a most startling announcement devenish cheerfully oh thats all right that might only mean that you were getting a new bowlerhat baxter dropping down lc a few steps suddenly ah and what about you sir how is it that you take this so lightly triumphantly i have it it all becomes clear to me you have transferred your affections to her daughter devenish oh i say baxter this is very crude belinda and why should he not mr baxter softly he has made me very happy baxter staggered he has made you happy mrs tremayne belinda very happy baxter thoughtfully oh oh ho oh ho he takes a turn up the room into the inner room muttering to himself belinda kneels and watches him over the back of the chesterfield then he comes down again to her r side mrs tremayne i have taken a great resolve solemnly i also will make you happy thumping his heart i also will woo miss delia belinda oh devenish look here baxter baxter suddenly crossing and seizing devenishs arm and pulling him towards the siding doors up r between the chesterfield and the table come we will seek miss delia together belinda seizes devenishs hand as he is passing and he clinging to it nearly pulls her off the chesterfield she is very amused it may be that she will send us upon another quest in which i shall again be victorious belinda releases her hand and slips down into the chesterfield tempestuously come i say he marches the resisting devenish to the swing doors let us put it to the touch to win or lose it all devenish turning and appealing to belinda please belinda gently mr baxter harold baxter stops and turns round you are too impetuous i think that as delias mother baxter coming down r to the foot of the c table your pardon mrs tremayne in the intoxication of the moment i am forgetting formally i have the honour to ask your permission to pay my addresses moves to chair l of table belinda no no i didnt mean that but as delias mother i ought to warn you that she is hardly fitted to take the place of your housekeeper she is not very domesticated baxter indignantly not domesticated sits l of table why did i not hear her tell her father at dinner that she had arranged all the flowers belinda there are other things than flowers devenish on baxters r behind the table bedsocks for instance baxter baxter is annoyed its a very tricky thing airing bedsocks i am sure your housekeeper baxter silencing devenish mrs tremayne she will learn the daughter of such a mother i need say no more belinda oh thank you but there is something else mr baxter you are not being quite fair to yourself in starting out upon this simultaneous wooing you forget that mr devenish has already had his turn devenish tries to stop her baxter turns round and nearly catches him this morning alone you should have yours alone too devenish oh i say baxter yes yes you are right i must introduce myself first as a suitor i see that rising to devenish you stay here i will go alone into the garden and moving below table and up to the swing doors belinda it is perhaps a little cold out of doors for people of of our age mr baxter now in the library baxter at the swing doors turning to her astonished library belinda yes baxter moving down r a little you have a library belinda to devenish he doesnt believe i have a library devenish you ought to see the library baxter baxter moving more down to below r of table but you are continually springing surprises on me this evening mrs tremayne first a daughter then a husband and then a library i have been here three weeks and i never knew you had a library dear me i wonder how it is that i never saw it belinda modestly rising i thought you came to see me baxter yes yes to see you certainly but if i had known you had a library belinda oh i am so glad i mentioned it wasnt it lucky mr devenish baxter my work has been greatly handicapped of late delia and tremayne enter the garden from up l and pass the window at the back belinda sweetly by me baxter i was about to say by lack of certain books to which i wanted to refer it would be a great help he moves up r reflectively muttering library belinda moving below and to r of c table my dear mr baxter my whole library is at your disposal she turns to devenish who is on her l and at the back of the table she speaks in a confidential whisper im just going to show him the encyclopedia britannica she moves below the settee to the door r you wont mind waiting delia will be in directly baxter still muttering library crosses to the door and opens it for her she goes out and he follows her devenish moves to the r of the swing doors and welcomes delia and tremayne tremayne enters from the portico and holds open the swing doors for delia delia speaking from the portico hullo were just coming in they enter and delia moves down r of the table tremayne wheres mrs tremayne devenish moving to down r shes gone to the library with baxter tremayne coming down on delias r side carelessly oh the library wheres that devenish promptly going towards the door opening it and standing above it the end door on the right delia sits on the r end of the table facing r right at the end you cant mistake it on the right tremayne ah yes he looks round at delia who points significantly at the door twice yes he looks at devenish yes he goes out devenish hastily shuts the door and comes back to delia devenish i say your mother is a ripper delia enthusiastically isnt she remembering at least you mean my aunt devenish smiling at her no i mean your mother to think that i once had the cheek to propose to her delia oh is it cheek to propose to people devenish to her delia but not to me devenish oh i say delia delia with great dignity thank you my name is miss robinson i mean tremayne devenish well if youre not quite sure which it is its much safer to call you delia delia smiling well perhaps it is devenish and if i did propose to you you havent answered delia sitting in the chair r of the table if you want an answer now its no but if you like to wait till next april devenish moving up to behind table reproachfully oh i say and i cut my hair for you the same afternoon turning quickly you havent really told me how you like it yet delia oh how bad of me you look lovely devenish sitting at back of the table and i promised to give up poetry for your sake delia perhaps i oughtnt to have asked you that devenish as far as im concerned delia ill do it gladly but of course one has to think about posterity delia but you neednt be a poet you could give posterity plenty to think about if you were a statesman devenish i dont quite see your objection to poetry delia you would be about the house so much i want you to go away every day and do great things and then come home in the evening and tell me all about it devenish then you are thinking of marrying me delia well i was just thinking in case i had to devenish he rises and taking her hands raises her from the chair she backs a step to r do it would be rather fun if you did and look here he pulls her gently back they both sit on the table he places his arm round her waist i will be a statesman if you like and go up to downing street every day and come back in the evening and tell you all about it delia how nice of you devenish magnificently holding up his l hand to heaven farewell parnassus delia pulling down his hand what does that mean devenish well it means that ive chucked poetry a statesmans life is the life for me behold mr devenish the new mp she holds up her l hand admonishingly and he laughs apologetically no look here that was quite accidental delia smiling at him i believe i shall really like you when i get to know you devenish i dont know if its you or devonshire or the fact that ive had my hair cut but i feel quite a different being from what i was three days ago delia you are different they both rise from the table she pulls him to r one step perhaps its your sense of humour coming back devenish perhaps thats it its a curious feeling delia pulling him towards the swing doors lets go outside theres a heavenly moon devenish moon moon now where have i heard that word before delia what do you mean devenish i was trying not to be a poet delia opens the doors well ill come with you but i shall refuse to look at it putting his l hand behind his back he walks slowly out with her saying to himself the prime minister then left the house they cross the windows at the back and go off l belinda and tremayne come from the library the latter holding the door for her to pass belinda moving below the settee across the room thank you i dont think its unkind to leave him do you he seemed quite happy tremayne following her i shouldnt have been happy if wed stayed belinda reaching the chesterfield she puts her feet up her head it towards l yes but i was really thinking of mr baxter tremayne above table c not of me belinda well i thought it was mr baxters turn poor man hes had a disappointment lately tremayne coming to b of the chesterfield eagerly a disappointment belinda yes he thought i was younger than i was tremayne smiling to himself how old are you belinda belinda dropping her eyes twentytwo after a pause he thought i was eighteen such a disappointment tremayne smiling openly at her belinda how old are you belinda just about the right age mr robinson tremayne the right age for what belinda for this sort of conversation tremayne shall i tell you how old you are belinda do you mean in figures or poetically tremayne i meant belinda mr devenish said i was as old as the now i must get this the right way round as old as the tremayne i dont want to talk about mr devenish belinda with a sigh nobody ever does except mr devenish as old as the stars and as young as the dawn settling herself cosily i think thats rather a nice age to be dont you tremayne a very nice age to be belinda its a pity hes thrown me over for delia i shall miss that sort of thing rather you dont say those sort of things about your auntinlawnot so often tremayne eagerly he really is in love with miss robinson belinda oh yes i expect he is out in the moonlight with her now comparing her to diana tremayne well that accounts for him now what about baxter belinda i thought i told you deeply disappointed to find that i was four years older than he expected mr baxter hurried from the drawing room and buried himself in a column of the encyclopedia britannica tremayne well that settles baxter are there any more men in the neighbourhood belinda shaking her head isnt it awful ive only had those two for the last three weeks tremayne sits on the back of the chesterfield and looks down at her tremayne belinda belinda yes henry tremayne my name is john belinda well you never told me i had to guess everybody thinks they can call me belinda without giving me the least idea what their own names are you were saying john tremayne my friends call me jack belinda jack robinson thats the man who always goes away so quickly i hope youre making more of a stay tremayne seizing her by both arms oh you maddening maddening woman belinda well i have to keep the conversation going you do nothing but say belinda tremayne taking her hand have you ever loved anybody seriously belinda belinda i dont ever do anything very seriously the late mr tremayne my first husband jack isnt it funny his name was jack he used to complain about it too sometimes tremayne with conviction silly ass belinda ah i think you are a little hard on the late mr tremayne tremayne belinda i want you to marry me and forget about him belinda happily to herself and lying back this is the proposal that those lamb cutlets interrupted this morning tremayne belinda i love you do you understand belinda suppose my first husband turns up suddenly like like e a tremayne like who belinda well like anybody tremayne he wont i know he wont dont you love me enough to risk it belinda belinda i havent really said i love you at all yet tremayne well say it now

powders her nose tremayne i have already told you that he was a silly ass he makes a move as if to kiss her again belinda holding up her hand and sitting on the r side of the chesterfield i shall scream for mr baxter tremayne sitting down on the chesterfield on her l side belinda belinda yes henry i mean jack tremayne do you know who i am he is thoroughly enjoying the surprise he is about to

and youve been playing with me and leading me on belinda mildly well darling you knew all the time that i was your wife and youve been making love to me and leading me on tremayne thats different belinda to herself thats just what the late mr tremayne said and then he slammed the door and went straight off to the rocky mountains and shot bears and i didnt see him again for eighteen years tremayne remorsefully darling i was a fool then and im a fool now belinda i was a fool then but im not such a fool now im not going to let you go its quite time i married and settled down tremayne you darling i he kisses her how did you find out who i was belinda awkwardly well it was rather curious darling after a pause it was april and i felt all sort of aprily and and there was the garden all full of daffodils and and there was mr baxter the one we left in the library knowing all about moles hes probably got the m volume down now well we were talking about them one day and i happened to say that the late mr tremayne that was you darling had rather a peculiar one on his arm and then he happened to see it this morning and told me about it tremayne what an extraordinary story belinda yes darling its really much more extraordinary than that i think perhaps id better tell you the rest of it another time coaxingly now show me where the nasty lion scratched you tremayne pulls up his sleeve oh she kisses his arm you shouldnt have left chelsea darling tremayne i should never have found you if i hadnt belinda squeezing his arm no jack you wouldnt after a pause i ive got another

ones fathers name unless of course you were lord robinson tremayne but you said her name was robinson before you she makes a playful move oh never mind about that a daughter belinda how could you let

let me ever go away again devenish and delia enter from up l and pass the windows on the way to the swing doors belinda im not going to jack im going to settle down into a staid old married woman

in his hand oh dont mind about me mrs tremayne ive enjoyed myself immensely he crosses to the armchair below the fireplace and places it in front of the fire belinda and tremayne move up into the inner room by the refectory table and embrace their backs to baxter delia and devenish are by the swing doors they also embrace their backs to baxter referring to his book i have been collecting some most valuable information on looking round at them and sitting in the armchair and continuing to read lunacy in the er county of devonshire the curtain falls
