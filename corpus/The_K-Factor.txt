the kfactor the kfactor by harry harrison speed never hurt anybody its the sudden stop at the end its not how much change that signals danger but how fast its changing illustrated by summers were losing a planet neel im afraid that i cant understand it the bald and wrinkled head wobbled a bit on the thin neck and his eyes were moist abravanel was a very old man looking at him neel realized for the first time just how old and close to death he was it was a profoundly shocking thought pardon me sir neel broke in but is it possible to lose a planet i mean if the readings are done correctly and the kfactor equations worked to the tenth decimal place then its really just a matter of adjustment making the indicated corrections after all societics is an exact science exact exact of course its not have i taught you so little that you dare say that to me anger animated the old man driving the shadow of death back a step or two neel hesitated feeling his hands quiver ever so slightly groping for the right words societics was his faith and his teacher abravanel its only prophet this man before him carefully preserved by the ageretarding drugs was unique in the galaxy a living anachronism a refugee from the history books abravanel had singlehandedly worked out the equations spelled out his science of societics then he had trained seven generations of students in its fundamentals hearing the article of his faith defamed by its creator produced a negative feedback loop in neel so strong his hands vibrated in tune with it it took a jarring effort to crack out of the cycle the laws that control societics as postulated by you are as exact as any others in the unifiedfield theory universe no theyre not and if any man i taught believes that nonsense im retiring tomorrow and dropping dead the day after my science and it is really not logical to call it a science is based on observation experimentation control groups and corrected observations and though we have made observations in the millions we are dealing in units in the billions and the interactions of these units are multiples of that and let us never forget that our units are people who when they operate as individuals do so in a completely different manner so you cannot truthfully call my theories exact they fit the facts well enough and produce results in practice that has been empirically proven so far some day i am sure we will run across a culture that doesnt fit my rules at that time the rules will have to be revised we may have that situation now on himmel theres trouble cooking there they have always had a high activity count sir neel put in hopefully high yes but always negative until now now it is slightly positive and nothing we can do seems to change it thats why ive called you in i want you to run a new basic survey ignoring the old one still in operation to reexamine the check points on our graphs the trouble may lie there neel thought before he answered picking his words carefully wouldnt that be a little unethical sir after all hengly who is operator there now is a friend of mine going behind his back you know i know nothing of the sort abravanel snorted we are not playing for poker chips or seeing who can get a paper published first have you forgotten what societics is neel answered by rote the applied study of the interaction of individuals in a culture the interaction of the group generated by these individuals the equations derived therefrom and the application of these equations to control one or more factors of this same culture and what is the one factor that we have tried to control in order to make all the other factors possible of existence war neel said in a very small voice very good then there is no doubt what it is we are talking about you are going to land quietly on himmel do a survey as quickly as possible and transmit the data back here there is no cause to think of it as sneaking behind henglys back but as doing something to help him set the matter right is that understood yes sir neel said firmly this time straightening his back and letting his right hand rest reassuringly on the computer slung from his belt excellent then it is now time to meet your assistant abravanel touched a button on his desk it was an unexpected development and neel waited with interest as the door opened but he turned away abruptly his eyes slitted and his face white with anger abravanel introduced them neel sidorak this is costa i know him he was in my class for six months there wasnt the slightest touch of friendliness in neels voice now abravanel either ignored it or didnt hear it he went on as if the two cold distant young men were the best of friends classmates very good then there is no need to make introductions though it might be best to make clear your separate areas of control this is your project neel and adao costa will be your assistant following your orders and doing whatever he can to help you know he isnt a graduate societist but he has done a lot of field work for us and can help you greatly in that and of course he will be acting as an observer for the un and making his own reports in this connection neels anger was hot and apparent so hes a un observer now i wonder if he still holds his old job at the same time i think it only fair sir that you know he works for interpol abravanels ancient and weary eyes looked at both men and he sighed wait outside costa he said neel will be with you in a minute costa left without a word and abravanel waved neel back to his chair listen to me now he said and stop playing tunes on that infernal buzzer neel snapped his hand away from the belt computer as if it had suddenly grown hot a hesitant finger reached out to clear the figures he had nervously been setting up then thought better of it abravanel sucked life into his ancient pipe and squinted at the younger man listen he said you have led a very sheltered life here at the university and that is probably my fault no dont look angry i dont mean about girls in that matter undergraduates have been the same for centuries im talking about people in groups individuals politics and all the complicated mess that makes up human life this has been your area of study and the program is carefully planned so you can study it secondhand the important thing is to develop the abstract viewpoint since any attempt to prejudge results can only mean disaster and it has been proved many times that a man with a certain interest will make many unwitting errors to shape an observation or experiment in favor of his interest no we could have none of that here we are following the proper study of mankind and we must do that by keeping personally on the outside to preserve our perspective when you understand that you understand many small things about the university why we give only resident student scholarships at a young age and why the outoftheway location here in the dolomites you will also see the reason why the campus bookstore stocks all of the books published but never has an adequate supply of newspapers the agreed policy has been to see that you all mature with the long view then hopefully you will be immune to shortterm political interests after you leave this policy has worked well in turning out men with the correct attitude towards their work it has also turned out a fair number of selfcentered egocentric horrors neel flushed do you mean that i no i dont mean you if i did i would say so your worst fault if you can call it a fault since it is the very thing we have been trying to bring about is that you have a very provincial attitude towards the universe now is the time to reexamine some of those ideas firstly what do you think the attitude of the un is towards societics there was no easy answer neel could see traps ready for anything he said his words were hesitant i cant say ive really ever thought about it i imagine the un would be in favor of it since we make their job of world government that much easier no such thing abravanel said tempering the sharpness of his words with a smile to put it in the simplest language they hate our guts they wish i had never formulated societics and at the same time they are very glad i did they are in the position of the man who caught the tiger by the tail the man enjoys watching the tiger eat all of his enemies but as each one is consumed his worry grows greater what will happen when the last one is gone will the tiger then turn and eat him well we are the uns tiger societics came along just at the time it was sorely needed earth had settled a number of planets and governed them first as outposts then as colonies the most advanced planets very quickly outgrew the colony stage and flexed their independent muscles the un had no particular desire to rule an empire but at the same time they had to insure earths safety i imagine they were considering all sorts of schemes including outright military control when they came to me even in its early crude form societics provided a stopgap that would give them some breathing time they saw to it that my work was well endowed and aided me unofficially of course in setting up the first control experiments on different planets we had results some very good and the others not so bad that the local police couldnt get things back under control after a while i was of course happy to perfect my theories in practice after a hundred years i had all the rough spots evened down and we were in business the un has never come up with a workable alternative plan so they have settled down to the uncomfortable business of holding the tigers tail they worry and spend vast sums of money keeping an eye on our work but why neel broke in why abravanel gave a quick smile thank you for fine character rating i imagine it is inconceivable to you that i might want to be emperor of the universe i could be you know the same forces that hold the lids on the planets could just as easily blow them off neel was speechless at the awful enormity of the thought abravanel rose from behind his desk with an effort and shambled over to lay a thin and featherlight arm on the younger mans shoulders those are the facts of life my boy and since we cannot escape them we must live with them costa is just a man doing his duty so try and put up with him for my sake if not for your own of course neel agreed quickly the whole thing takes a bit of getting used to but i think i can manage well do as good a job on himmel as it is possible to do dont worry about me sir costa was waiting in the next room puffing quietly on a long cigarette they left together walking down the hall in silence neel glanced sideways at the wiry darkskinned brazilian and wondered what he could say to smooth things out he still had his reservations about costa but hed keep them to himself now abravanel had ordered peace between them and what the old man said was the law it was costa who spoke first can you brief me on himmel what well find there and be expected to do run the basic survey first of course neel told him chances are that that will be enough to straighten things out since the completion last year of the refining equations of debirs postulate all sigma and alpha graph points are suspect just stop there please and run the flag back down the pole costa interrupted i had a sixmonths survey of societics seven years ago to give me a general idea of the field ive worked with survey teams since then but i have only the vaguest idea of the application of the information we got could you cover the ground again only a bit slower neel controlled his anger successfully and started again in his best classroom manner well im sure you realize that a good survey is half the problem it must be impartial and exact if it is accurately done application of the kfactor equations is almost mechanical youve lost me again everyone always talks about the kfactor but no one has ever explained just what it is neel was warming to his topic now its a term borrowed from nucleonics and best understood in that context look you know how an atomic pile works essentially just like an atomic bomb the difference is just a matter of degree and control in both of them you have neutrons tearing around some of them hitting nuclei and starting new neutrons going these in turn hit and start others this goes on faster and faster and bam a few milliseconds later you have an atomic bomb this is what happens if you dont attempt to control the reaction however if you have something like heavy water or graphite that will slow down neutrons and an absorber like cadmium you can alter the speed of the reaction too much damping material will absorb too many neutrons and the reaction will stop not enough and the reaction will build up to an explosion neither of these extremes is wanted in an atomic pile what is needed is a happy balance where you are soaking up just as many neutrons as are being generated all the time this will give you a constant temperature inside the reactor the net neutron reproduction constant is then this balance of neutron generation and absorption is the kfactor of the reactor ideally thats the ideal though the impossible to attain in a dynamic system like a reactor all you need is a few more neutrons around giving you a kfactor of and you are headed for trouble each extra neutron produces two and your production rate soars geometrically towards bang on the other hand a kfactor of is just as bad your reaction is spiraling down in the other direction to control a pile you watch your kfactor and make constant adjustments all this i follow costa said but wheres the connection with societics well get to that just as soon as you realize and admit that a minute difference of degree can produce a marked difference of kind you might say that a single impossibly tiny neutron is the difference between an atom bomb and a slowly cooling pile of inert uranium isotopes does that make sense im staggering but still with you good then try to go along with the analogy that a human society is like an atomic pile at one extreme you will have a dying decadent culture the remains of a highly mechanized society living off its capital using up resources it cant replace because of a lost technology when the last machine breaks and the final food synthesizer collapses the people will die this is the cooled down atomic pile at the other extreme is complete and violent anarchy every man thinking only of himself killing and destroying anything that gets in his way the atomic explosion midway between the two is a vital active producing society this is a generalization and you must look at it that way in reality society is infinitely complex and the ramifications and possibilities are endless it can do a lot more things than fizzle or go boom pressure of population war or persecution patterns can cause waves of immigration plant and animal species can be wiped out by momentary needs or fashions remember the fate of the passenger pigeon and the american bison all the pressures crossrelationships hungers needs hatreds desires of people are reflected in their interrelationships one man standing by himself tells us nothing but as soon as he says something passes on information in an altered form or merely expresses an attitude he becomes a reference point he can be marked measured and entered on a graph his actions can be grouped with others and the action of the group measured man and his society then becomes a systems problem that can be fed into a computer weve cut the gordian knot of the threels and are on our way towards a solution stop costa said raising his hand i was with you as far as the ls what are they a private code not a code abbreviation linear logic language the pitfall of all the old researchers all of them historians sociologists political analysts anthropologists were licked before they started they had to know all about a and b before they could find c facts to them were always hooked up in a series whereas in truth they had to be analyzed as a complex circuit complete with elements like positive and negative feedback and crossover switching with the whole thing being stirred up constantly by continual homeostasis correction its little wonder they did do badly you cant really say that adao costa protested ill admit that societics has carried the art tremendously far ahead but there were many basics that had already been discovered illustration if you are postulating a linear progression from the old social sciences forget it neel said there is the same relationship here that alchemy holds to physics the old boys with their frog guts and awful offal knew a bit about things like distilling and smelting but there was no real order to their knowledge and it was all an unconsidered byproduct of their single goal the whole nonsense of transmutation they passed a lounge and adao waved neel in after him dropping into a chair he rummaged through his pockets for a cigarette organizing his thoughts im still with you he said but how do we work this back to the kfactor simple neel told him once youve gotten rid of the ls and their false conclusions remember that politics in the old days was all we are angels and they are devils this was literally believed in the history of mankind there has yet to be a war that wasnt backed by the official clergy on each side and each declared that god was on their side which leaves you know who as prime supporter of the enemy this theory is no more valid than the one that a single man can lead a country into war followed by the inference that a welltimed assassination can save the peace that doesnt sound too unreasonable costa said of course not all of the old ideas sound good they have a simpleminded simplicity that anyone can understand that doesnt make them true kill a warminded dictator and nothing changes the violenceorientated society the factors that produced it the military party that represents it none of these are changed the kfactor remains the same theres that word again do i get a definition yet neel smiled of course the kfactor is one of the many factors that interrelate in a society abstractly it is no more important than the other odd thousand we work with but in practice it is the only one we try to alter the kfactor is the war factor adao costa said all the humor was gone now thats a good enough name for it neel said grinding out his halfsmoked cigarette if a society has a positive kfactor even a slight one that stays positive then you are going to have a war our planetary operators have two jobs first to gather and interpret data secondly to keep the kfactor negative they were both on their feet now moved by the same emotion and himmel has a positive one that stays positive costa said neel sidorak nodded agreement then lets get into the ship and get going he said it was a fast trip and a faster landing the un cruiser cut its engines and dropped like a rock in free fall night rain washed the ports and the computer cut in the maximum permissible blast for the minimum time that would reduce their speed to zero at zero altitude deceleration sat on their chests and squeezed their bones to rubber something crunched heavily under their stern at the exact instant the drive cut out costa was unbelted and out the door while neel was still feeling his insides shiver back into shape the unloading had an organized rhythm that rejected neel he finally realized he could help best by standing back out of the way while the crewmen gravlifted the heavy cases out through the cargo port into the blackness of the rainlashed woods adao costa supervised this and seemed to know what he was doing a signal rating wearing earphones stood to one side of the lock chanting numbers that sounded like detector fixes there was apparently enough time to unload everything but none to spare things got close towards the end neel was suddenly bustled out into the rain and the last two crates were literally thrown out after him he plowed through the mud to the edge of the clearing and had just enough time to cover his face before the takeoff blast burst out like a new sun sit down and relax costa told him everything is in the green so far the ship wasnt spotted on the way down now all we have to do is wait for transportation in theory at least adao costa was neels assistant in practice he took complete charge of moving their equipment and getting it under cover in the capital city of kitezh men and trucks appeared to help them and vanished as soon as their work was done within twenty hours they were installed in a large loft all of the machines uncrated and plugged in neel took a nosleep and began tuning checks on all the circuits glad of something to do costa locked the heavy door behind their last silent helper then dropped gratefully onto one of the bedding rolls how did the gadgets hold up he asked im finding out now theyre built to take punishment but being dropped twelve feet into mud soup then getting baked by rockets isnt in the original specs they crate things well these days costa said unworriedly sucking on a bottle of the famous himmelian beer when do you go to work were working right now neel told him pulling a folder of papers out of the file before we left i drew up a list of current magazines and newspapers i would need you can start on these ill have a sampling program planned by the time you get back costa groaned hollowly and reached for the papers once the survey was in operation it went ahead of its own momentum both men grabbed what food and sleep they could the computers gulped down neels figures and spat out tapereels of answers that demanded even more facts costa and his unseen helpers were kept busy supplying the material only one thing broke the ordered labors of the week neel blinked twice at costa before his equationfogged brain assimilated an immediate and personal factor youve a bandage on your head he said a bloodstained bandage a little trouble in the streets mobs and thats an incredible feat of observation costa marveled i had the feeling that if i came in here stark naked you wouldnt notice it i i get involved neel said dropping the papers on a table and kneading the tired furrow between his eyes get wrapped up in the computation sorry i tend to forget about people dont feel sorry to me costa said youre right doing the job im supposed to help you not pose for the before picture in home hospital ads anyway how are we doing is there going to be a war certainly seems like one brewing outside ive seen two people lynched who were only suspected of being earthies looks dont mean a thing neel said opening two beers remember the analogy of the pile it boils liquid metal and cooks out energy from the infrared right through to hard radiation yet it keeps on generating power at a nice steady rate but your abomb at zero minus one second looks as harmless as a fallen log its the kfactor that counts not surface appearance this planet may look like a dictators dream of glory but as long as were reading in the negative things are fine and how are things hows our little kfactor coming out soon neel said pointing at the humming computer cant tell about it yet you never can until the computation is complete theres a temptation to try and guess from the first figures but theyre meaningless like trying to predict the winner of a horse race by looking at the starters lined up at the gate lots of people think they can let them there are few enough pleasures in this life without taking away all delusions behind them the computer thunked and was suddenly still this is it neel said and pulled out the tape he ran it quickly through his fingers mumbling under his breath just once he stopped and set some figures into his hand computer the result flashed in the window and he stared at it unmoving good bad what is it neel raised his head and his eyes were ten years older positive bad much worse than it was when we left earth how much time do we have dont know for certain neel shrugged i can set it up and get an approximation but there is no definite point on the scale where war has to break out just a going and going until somewhere along the line i know gone costa said reaching for his gun he slid it into his side pocket now its time to stop looking and start doing what do i do going to kill war marshal lommeord neel asked distastefully i thought we had settled that you cant stop a war by assassinating the top man we also settled that something can be done to change the kfactor the gun is for my own protection while youre radioing results back to earth and theyre feeling bad about it im going to be doing something now you tell me what that something is this was a different man from the relaxed and quietly efficient adao costa of the past week all of his muscles were hard with the restrained energy of an animal crouching to leap the gun ready in his pocket had a suddenly new significance neel looked away reaching around for words this was all very alien to him and suddenly a little frightening it was one thing to work out a kproblem in class and discuss the theory of correction it was something entirely different to direct the operation well costas voice knifed through his thoughts you can well its possible to change one of the peak population curves isolate individuals and groups then effect status and location changes you mean get a lot of guys to take jobs in other towns through the commercial agents neel nodded too slow costa withered the idea with his voice fine in the long run but of absolutely no value in an emergency he began to pace back and forth too quickly it was more of a bubblingover than a relaxation cant you isolate some recent key events that can be reversed its possible neel thought about it quickly it wouldnt be a final answer just a delaying action thats good enough tell me what to do neel flipped through his books of notes checking off the betas these were the reinforcers the individuals and groups who were kfactor amplifiers it was a long list which he cut down quickly by crossing off the low increment additions and multiple groups even while the list was incomplete neel began to notice a pattern it was an unlikely one but it was there he isolated the motivator and did a frequency check then sat back and whistled softly we have a powerhouse here he said flipping the paper across the table take this organization out of the equations and you might even knock us negative society for the protection of the native born costa read doesnt sound like very important who or what are they proof positive of the law of averages its possible to be dealt a royal flush in a hand of cards but it isnt very common its just as possible for a bunch of simpletons to set up an organization for one purpose and have it turn out to be a supercharged highfrequency kfactor amplifier thats whats happened with this infernal spnb a seedy little social club dedicated to jingoists with low iqs with the war scare they have managed to get hold of a few credits they have probably been telling the same inflated stories for years about the discrimination against natives of this fair planet but no one has really cared now they have a chance to get their news releases and faked pix out in quantity just at a time when the public is ripe for their brand of nonsense putting this bunch out of business will be a good days work wont there be repercussions costa asked if they are this important and throw so much weight around wont it look suspicious if they are suddenly shut up like an obvious move by the enemy not at all that might be true if for instance you blew up the headquarters of the war party it would certainly be taken as an aggressive move but no one really knows or cares about this society of the halfbaked native born there might be reaction and interest if attention was drawn to them but if some accident or act of nature were to put them out of business that would be the end of it costa was snapping his lighter on and off as he listened to neel staring at the flame he closed it and held it up i believe in accidents i believe that even in our fireproof age fires still occur buildings still burn down and if a burnt building just happened to be occupied by the spnb just one tenant of many and their offices and records were destroyed that would be of very little interest to anyone except the fire brigade youre a born criminal neel told him im glad were on the same side thats your department and i leave it to you ill just listen for the news flashes meanwhile i have one little errand to take care of the words stopped costa who was almost out the door he turned stiffly to look at neel putting papers into an envelope yet costa spoke naturally letting none of his feelings through into his voice where are you going to see hengly the planetary operator here abravanel told me to stay away from him to run an entirely new basic survey well weve done that now and pinpointed some of the trouble areas as well i can stop feeling guilty about poaching another mans territory and let him know whats going on no stay away from hengly costa said the last thing in the world we want to do is to be seen near him theres a chance that he well might be compromised what do you mean neel snapped henglys a friend of mine a graduate he might also be surrounded ten deep by the secret police did you stop to think about that neel hadnt thought about it and his anger vanished when he did costa drove the point home societics has been a well kept secret for over two centuries it may still be a secret or bits of it might have leaked out and even if the himmelians know nothing about societics they have certainly heard of espionage they know the un has agents on their world they might think hengly is one of them this is all speculation of course but we do have one fact this society of native boobs we turned up we had no trouble finding them if hengly had reliable field men he should know about them too the only reason he hasnt is because he isnt getting the information which means hes compromised reaching back for a chair neel fell heavily into it youre right of course i never realized good costa said well do something to help hengly tomorrow but this operation comes first sit tight get some rest and dont open the door for anyone except me it had been a long job and a tiring one but it was almost over neel allowed himself the luxury of a long yawn then shuffled over to the case of rations they had brought he stripped the seal from something optimistically labeled chicken dinner it tasted just like the algae it had been made from and boiled some coffee while it was heating and all the time he was doing these prosaic tasks his mind was turning an indigestible fact over and over it wasnt a conscious process but it was nevertheless going on the automatic mechanism of his brain ran it back and forth like a half heard tune searching for its name neel was tired or he would have reacted sooner the idea finally penetrated one fact he had taken for granted was an obvious impossibility the coffee splashed to the floor as he jumped to his feet its wrong it has to be wrong he said aloud grabbing up the papers computations and graphs dropped and were trampled into the spilled coffee when he finally found the one he wanted his hands were shaking as he flipped through it the synopsis of henglys reports for the past five years the gradual rise and fall of the kfactor from month to month there were no sharp breaks in the curve or gaps in the supporting equations societics isnt an exact science but its exact enough to know when it is working with incomplete or false information if hengly had been kept in the dark about the spnb he would also have been misinformed about other factors this kind of alteration of survey would have to show in the equations it didnt time was running out and neel had to act but what to do he must warn adao costa and the records here had to be protected or better yet destroyed there was a power in these machines and charts that couldnt be allowed to fall into nationalist hands but what could be done about it in all the welter of equipment and containers there was one solid heavy box that he had never opened it belonged to costa and the un man had never unlocked it in his presence neel looked at the heavy clasps on it and felt defeat but when he pulled at the lid wondering what to do next it fell open it hadnt been sealed costa wasnt the kind of man who did things by accident he had looked forward to the time when neel might need what was in this box and had it ready inside was just what neel expected grenades guns some smoothly polished devices that held an aura of violence looking at them neel had an overwhelming sensation of defeat his life was dedicated to peace and the furthering of peace he hated the violence that seemed inborn in man and detested all the hypocritical rationalizations such as the ends justifying the means all of his training and personal inclinations were against it and he reached down and removed the blunt black gun there was one other thing he recognized in the compact arsenal a time bomb there had been lectures on this mechanism in school since the fact was clearly recognized that a time might come when equipment had to be destroyed rather than fall into the wrong hands he had never seen one since but he had learned the lesson well neel pushed the open chest nearer to his instruments and set the bomb dial for fifteen minutes he slipped the gun into his pocket started the fuse and carefully locked the door when he left illustration the bridges were burned now he had to find adao costa this entire operation was outside of his experience and knowledge he could think of no plan that could possibly make things easier or safer all he could do was head for the offices of the society for the protection of the native born and hope he could catch adao before he ran into any trouble two blocks away from the address he heard the sirens trying to act as natural as the other pedestrians he turned to look as the armored cars and trucks hurtled by packed with armed police their sirens and revolving lights cleared a path through the dark streets neel kept walking following the cars now the street he wanted to go into was cordoned off showing more than a normal interest would have been a giveaway he let himself be hurried past with no more than a glance down the block with the other pedestrians cars and men were clustered around a doorway that neel felt sure was number his destination something was very wrong had costa walked into a trap or tripped an alarm it didnt really matter which either way the balloon had gone up neel walked on slowly painfully aware of his own inadequacy in dealing with the situation it was a time for action but what action he hadnt the slightest idea where costa was or how he could be of help to him halfway down the block there was a dark mouth of an alleyway unguarded without stopping to think neel turned into it it would bring him closer to the building perhaps costa was still trapped in there he could get in help him the back of was quiet with no hint of the activity on the other side of the building neel had counted carefully and was sure he had the right one it was completely dark in the unlit alley but he found a recessed door by touch the chances were it was locked but he moved into the alcove and leaned his weight against it pulling at the handle just in case nothing moved an inch behind his back the alley filled with light washed with it eye burning and strong his eyes snapped shut but he forced them open again blinking against the pain there were searchlights at each end of the alley sealing it off he couldnt get out in the instant before the fear hit him he saw the blood spots on the ground there were three of them large and glistening redly wet they extended in a straight line away from him pointing towards the gaping entrance of a cellar when the lights went out neel dived headlong towards the cracked and filthy pavement the darkness meant that the police were moving slowly towards him from both ends of the alley trapping him in between there was nothing doubtful about the fate of an armed earthman caught here he didnt care neels fear wasnt gone he just had not time to think about it his long shot had paid off and there was still a chance he could get costa out of the trap he had let him walk into the lights had burned an afterimage into his retina before it faded he reached out and felt his fingers slide across the dusty ground into a patch of wetness he scrubbed at it with his sleeve soaking up the blood wiping the spot fiercely with his other hand he pushed together a pile of dust and dirt spreading it over the stain as soon as he was sure the stain was covered he slid forward groping for the second telltale splash time was his enemy and he had no way to measure it he could have been lying in the rubble of that alley for an hour or a second what was to be done had to be done at once without a sound there were silent deadly men coming towards him through the darkness after the second smear was covered there was a drawn out moment of fear when he couldnt find the third and last his fingers touched it finally much farther on than he had expected time had certainly run out yet he forced himself to do as good a job here as he had with the other two only when it was dried and covered did he allow himself to slide forward into the cellar entrance everything was going too fast he had time for a single deep breath before the shriek of a whistle paralyzed him again footsteps slapped towards him and one of the searchlights burned with light the footsteps speeded up and the man ran by close enough for neel to touch if he had reached out a hand his clothing was shapeless and torn his head and face thick with hair that was all neel had time to see before the guns roared and burned the life from the runner some derelict sleeping in the alley who had paid with his life for being in the wrong spot at the wrong time but his death had bought neel a little more time he turned and looked into the barrel of a gun shock after shock had destroyed his capacity for fear there was nothing left that could move him even his own death he looked quietly dully at the muzzle of the gun with slow determination his mind turned over and he finally realized that this time there was nothing to fear its me adao he whispered youll be all right now ahh it is you the voice came softly out of the darkness the gun barrel wavered and sank lift me up so i can get at this door cant seem to stand too well any more neel reached down found costas shoulders and slowly dragged him to his feet his eyes were adjusting to the glare above them now and he could make out the gleam of reflected light on the metal in costas fingers the un mans other hand was clutched tightly to his waist the gun had vanished the metal device wasnt a key but costa used it like one it turned in the lock and the door swung open under their weight neel half carried half dragged the other mans dead weight through it dropping him to the floor inside before he closed the door he reached down and felt a great pool of blood outside there was no time to do a perfect job the hard footsteps were coming just a few yards away his sleeves were sodden with blood as he blotted then pushed rubble into the stain he pulled back inside and the door closed with only the slightest click i dont know how you managed it but im glad you found me costa said there was weakness as well as silence in his whisper it was only chance i found you neel said bitterly but criminal stupidity on my part that let you walk into this trap dont worry about it i knew what i was getting into but i still had to go spring the trap to see if it was a trap you suspected then that hengly was neel couldnt finish the sentence he knew what he wanted to say but the idea was too unbearable to put into words costa had no such compunction yes dear hengly graduate of the university and practitioner of societics a traitor a warmonger worse than any of his predecessors because he knew just what to sell and how to sell it its never happened before but there was always the chance the weight of responsibility was too much he gave in costas voice had died away almost to a whisper then it was suddenly loud again no louder than normal speaking volume but sounding like a shout in the secret basement neel its all right take it easy nothing is all right dont you realize that ive been sending my reports back so the un and your societics people will know how to straighten this mess out but hengly can turn this world upside down and might even get a shootingwar going before they get here im out of it but i can tell you who to contact people wholl help hold the kfactor down that wouldnt do any good neel said quietly the whole thing is past the patch and polish stage now besides i blew the whole works up my machines and records your youre a fool for the first time there was pain in costas voice no i was before but not any more as long as i thought it was a normal problem i was being outguessed at every turn you must understand the ramifications of societics to a good operator there is no interrelationship that cannot be uncovered hengly would be certain to keep his eyes open for another field check our kind of operation is very easy to spot if you know where and how to look the act of getting information implies contact of some kind that contact can be detected hes had our location marked and has been sitting tight buying time but our time ran out when you showed them we were ready to fight back thats why i destroyed our setup and cut our trail but then were defenseless what can we possibly do neel knew the answer but he hesitated to put it into words it would be final then he suddenly realized he had forgotten about costas wound im sorry i forgot about your being hurt what can i do nothing costa snapped i put a field dressing on thatll do answer my question what is there left what can be done now ill have to kill hengly that will set things right until the team gets here but what good will that accomplish costa asked trying to see the other man in the darkness of the cellar you told me yourself that a war couldnt be averted by assassination no one individual means that much only in a normal situation neel explained you must look at the power struggle between planets as a kind of celestial chess game it has its own rules when i talked about individuals earlier i was talking about pieces on this chessboard what im proposing now is a little more dramatic im going to win the chess game in a slightly more unorthodox way im going to shoot the other chess player there was silence for a long moment broken only by the soft sigh of their breathing then costa stirred and there was the sound of metal clinking slightly on the floor its really my job costa said but im no good for it youre right youll have to go but i can help you plan it so you will be able to get to hengly you might even stand a better chance than me because you are so obviously an amateur now listen carefully because we havent much time neel didnt argue he knew what needed doing but costa could tell him how best to go about it the instructions were easy to memorize and he put the weapons away as he was told once youre clear of this building youll have to get cleaned up costa said but thats the only thing you should stop for get to hengly while he is still rattled catch him off guard as much as possible then after you finish with him dig yourself in stay hidden at least three days before you try to make any contacts things should have quieted down a bit by then i dont like leaving you here neel said its the best way as well as being the only way ill be safe enough ive a nice little puncture in me but theres enough medication to see me through if im going to hole up ill hole up here ill be back to take care of you costa didnt answer him there was nothing more to say they shook hands in the darkness and neel crawled away there was little difficulty in finding the front door of the building but neel hesitated before he opened it costa had been sure neel could get away without being noticed but he didnt feel so sure himself there certainly would be plenty of police in the streets even here only as he eased the door did he understand why costa had been so positive about this gunfire hammered somewhere behind him other guns answered costa must have had another gun he had planned it this way and the best thing neel could do was not to think about it and go ahead with the plan a car whined by in the roadway as soon as it had passed neel slipped out and crossed the empty street to the nearest monosub entrance most of the stations had valet machines it was less than an hour later when he reached henglys apartment washed shaved and with his clothes cleaned neel felt a little more sure of himself no one had stopped him or even noticed him the lobby had been empty and the automatic elevator left him off at the right floor when he gave it henglys name now facing the featureless door he had a sharp knife of fear it was too easy he reached out slowly and tried the handle the door was unlocked taking a deep breath he opened it and stepped inside it was a large room but unlit an open door at the other end had a dim light shining through it neel started that way and pain burst in his head spinning him down face forward he never quite lost consciousness but details were vague in his memory when full awareness returned he realized that the lights were on in the room he was lying on his back looking up at them two men stood next to him staring down at him from above the perspective columns of their legs one held a short metal bar that he kept slapping into his open palm the other man was hengly not very friendly for an old classmate he said holding out neels gun now get inside i want to talk to you neel rolled over painfully and crawled to his feet his head throbbed with pain but he tried to ignore it as he stood up his hand brushed his ankle the tiny gun costa had given him was still in the top of his shoe perhaps hengly wasnt being as smart as he should i can take care of him hengly said to the man with the metal rod hes the only one left now so you can get some sleep see you early in the morning though the man nodded agreement and left slouched in the chair neel looked forward to a certain pleasure in killing hengly costa was dead and this man was responsible for his death it wouldnt even be like killing a friend hengly was very different from the man he had known he had put on a lot of weight and affected a thick beard and flowing mustache there was something jovial and paternal about him until you looked into his eyes neel slumped forward worn out letting his fingers fall naturally next to the gun in his shoe hengly couldnt see his hand the desk was in the way all neel had to do was draw and fire you can pull out the gun hengly said with a grim smile but dont try to shoot it he had his own gun now aimed directly at neel leaning forward he watched as neel carefully pulled out the tiny weapon and threw it across the room thats better he said placing his own gun on the desk where he could reach it easily now we can talk theres nothing i have to say to you hengly neel leaned back in the chair exhausted youre a traitor hengly hammered the desk in sudden anger and shouted dont talk to me of treachery my little man of peace creeping up with a gun to kill a friend is that peaceful where are the ethos of humanism now you were very fond of them when we were in the university neel didnt want to listen to the words he thought instead of how right costa had been he was dead but this was still his operation it was going according to plan walk right in there costa had said he wont kill you not at first at least hes the loneliest man in the universe because he has given up one world for another that he hasnt gained yet there will be no one he can confide in hell know you have come to kill him but he wont be able to resist talking to you first particularly if you make it easy for him to defeat you not too easy he must feel he is outthinking you youll have a gun for him to take away but that will be too obvious this small gun will be hidden as well and when he finds that too he should be taken off his guard not much but enough for you to kill him dont wait do it at the first opportunity out of the corner of his eye neel could see the radiophone clipped to the front of his jacket it was slightly tarnished looking like any one of ten thousand in daily use almost a duplicate of the one hengly wore a universal symbol of the age like the keys and small change in his pockets only neels phone was a deadly weapon product of a research into sudden death that he had never been aware of before all he had to do was get it near hengly the mechanism had been armed when he put it on it had a range of two feet as soon as it was that far from any part of his body it would be actuated can i ask you a question hengly his words cut loudly through the run of the other mans speech hengly frowned at the interruption then nodded permission go ahead he said what would you like to know the obvious why did you do it change sides i mean give up a positive work for this this negative corruption thats how much you know about it hengly was shouting now positive negative war peace those are just words and it took me years to find it out what could be more positive than making something of my life and of this planet at the same time its in my power to do it and ive done it power perhaps thats the key word neel said suddenly very tired we have the stars now but we have carried with us our little personal lusts and emotions theres nothing wrong with that i suppose as long as we keep them personal its when we start inflicting them on others the trouble starts well its over now at least this time with a single easy motion he unclipped the radiophone and flipped it across the desk towards hengly goodby he said the tiny mechanism clattered onto the desk and hengly leaped back shouting hoarsely he pulled the gun up and tried to aim at the radiophone and at neel at the same time it was too late to do either there was a brief humming noise from the phone neel jerked in his chair it felt as if a slight electric shock had passed through him he had felt only a microscopic percentage of the radiation hengly got it all the actuated field of the device had scanned his nervous system measured and tested it precisely then adjusted itself to the exact microfrequency that carried the messages in his efferent nervous system once the adjustment had been made the charged condensers had released their full blasts of energy on that frequency the results were horribly dramatic every efferent neuron in his system carried the message full power every muscle in his body responded with a contraction of full intensity neel closed his eyes covered them turned away gasping it couldnt be watched an epileptic in a seizure can break the bones in a leg or arm by simultaneous contraction of opposing muscles when all the opposed muscles of henglys body did this the results were horrible beyond imagining when neel recovered a measure of sanity he was in the street running he slowed to a walk and looked around it was just dawn and the streets were empty ahead was the glowing entrance of a monotube and he headed for it the danger was over now as long as he was careful pausing on the top step he breathed the fresh air of the new morning there was a sighing below as an early train pulled into the station the dawnlit sky was the color of blood blood he said aloud then do we have to keep on killing isnt there another way he started guiltily as his voice echoed in the empty street but no one had heard him quickly two at a time he ran down the steps the end
