 the kings jackal by richard harding davis the kings jackal i the private terrace of the hotel grand bretagne at tangier was shaded by a great awning of red and green and yellow and strewn with colored mats and plants in pots and wicker chairs it reached out from the kings apartments into the garden of palms and was hidden by them on two sides and showed from the third the blue waters of the mediterranean and the great shadow of gibraltar in the distance the sultan of morocco had given orders from fez that the king of messina in spite of his incognito should be treated during his stay in tangier with the consideration due to his rank so onehalf of the hotel grand bretagne had been set aside for him and his suite and two soldiers of the bashaws guard sat outside of his door with drawn swords they were answerable with their heads for the life and safety of the sultans guest and as they could speak no language but their own they made a visit to his majesty more a matter of adventure than of etiquette niccolas the kings majordomo stepped out upon the terrace and swept the mediterranean with a fieldglass for the third time since sunrise he lowered it and turned doubtfully toward the two soldiers the boat from gibraltar has she arrived yet he asked the two ebony figures shook their heads stiffly as though they resented this introduction of a foreign language and continued to shake their heads as the servant addressed the same question to them in a succession of strange tongues well said colonel erhaupt briskly as he followed niccolas out upon the terrace has the boat arrived and the launch from the yacht he continued has it started for shore yet the man pointed to where the yacht lay a mile outside the harbor and handed him the glass it is but just now leaving the ships side he said but i cannot make out who comes in her ah pardon he added quickly as he pointed to a stout elderly gentleman who walked rapidly toward them through the garden the gibraltar boat must be in sir here is baron barrat coming up the path colonel erhaupt gave an exclamation of satisfaction and waved his hand to the newcomer in welcome go tell his majesty he said to the servant the man hesitated and bowed his majesty still sleeps wake him commanded erhaupt tell him i said to do so well baron he cried gayly as he stepped forward welcome or are you welcome he added with an uneasy laugh i should be i have succeeded the other replied gruffly as he brushed past him where is the king he will be here in a moment i have sent to wake him and you have been successful good i congratulate you how far successful the baron threw himself into one of the wicker chairs and clapped his hands impatiently for a servant twelve thousand pounds in all he replied thats more than he expected it was like pulling teeth at first i want some coffee at once he said to the attendant and a bath that boat reeked with moors and cattle and there was no wagonlit on the train from madrid i sat up all night and played cards with that young cellini have madame zara and kalonay returned i see the yacht in the harbor did she succeed we do not know the boat only arrived at daybreak they are probably on the launch that is coming in now as barrat sipped his coffee and munched his rolls with the silent energy of a hungry man the colonel turned and strode up and down the terrace pulling at his mustache and glancing sideways when the baron had lighted a cigarette and thrown himself back in his chair erhaupt halted and surveyed him in some anxiety you have been gone over two weeks he said i should like to see you accomplish as much in as short a time growled the other you know paris you know how hard it is to get people to be serious there i had the devils own time at first you got my cablegram yes it wasnt encouraging well i wasnt hopeful myself they wouldnt believe a word of it at first they said louis hadnt shown such great love for his country or his people since his exile that they could feel any confidence in him and that his conduct in the last six years did not warrant their joining any undertaking in which he was concerned you cant blame them theyve backed him so many times already and theyve been bitten and theyre shy naturally but i swore he was repentant that he saw the error of his ways that he wanted to sit once more before he died on the throne of his ancestors and that he felt it was due to his son that he should make an effort to get him back his birthright it was the son won them exhibit a i call him none of them would hear of it until i spoke of the prince so when i saw that i told them he was a fine little chap healthy and manly and brave and devoted to his priest and all that rot and they began to listen at first they wanted his majesty to abdicate and give the boy a clear road to the crown but of course i hushed that up i told them we were acting advisedly that we had reason to know that the common people of messina were sick of the republic and wanted their king that louis loved the common people like a father that he would reestablish the church in all her power and that father paul was working day and night for us and that the vatican was behind us then i dealt out decorations and a few titles which louis has made smell so confoundedly rank to heaven that nobody would take them it was like a game i played one noble gentleman against another and gave this one a portrait of the king one day and the other a miniature of exhibit a the next and they grew jealous and met together and talked it over and finally unlocked their pockets they contributed about l between them then the enthusiasm spread to the women and they gave me their jewels and a lot of youngsters volunteered for the expedition and six of them came on with me in the train last night i won two thousand francs from that boy cellini on the way down theyre all staying at the continental i promised them an audience this morning good commented the colonel good l i suppose you took out your commission in advance i took out nothing returned the other angrily i brought it all with me and i have a letter from each of them stating just what he or she subscribed toward the expedition the duke dantiz so much the duke dorvay francs the countess mattini a diamond necklace it is all quite regular i played fair the colonel had stopped in his walk and had been peering eagerly down the leafy path through the garden is that not zara coming now he asked look your eyes are better than mine barrat rose quickly and the two men walked forward and bowed with the easy courtesy of old comrades to a tall fair girl who came hurriedly up the steps the countess zara was a young woman but one who had stood so long on guard against the world that the strain had told and her eyes were hard and untrustful so that she looked much older than she really was her life was of two parts there was little to be told of the first part she was an english girl who had come from a manufacturing town to study art and live alone in paris where she had been too indolent to work and too brilliant to remain long without companions eager for her society through them and the stories of her wit and her beauty she had come to know the king of messina and with that meeting the second part of her life began for she had found something so attractive either in his title or in the cynical humor of the man himself that for the last two years she had followed his fortunes and miss muriel winter art student had become the countess zara and an uncrowned queen she was beautiful with great masses of yellow hair and wonderful brown eyes her manner when she spoke seemed to show that she despised the world and those in it almost as thoroughly as she despised herself on the morning of her return from messina she wore a blue serge yachting suit with a golf cloak hanging from her shoulders and as she crossed the terrace she pulled nervously at her gloves and held out her hand covered with jewels to each of the two men i bring good news she said with an excited laugh where is louis i will tell his majesty that you have come you are most welcome the baron answered but as he turned to the door it opened from the inside and the king came toward them shivering and blinking his eyes in the bright sunlight it showed the wrinkles and creases around his mouth and the blue veins under the mottled skin and the tiny lines at the corners of his little bloodshot eyes that marked the pace at which he had lived as truthfully as the rings on a treetrunk tell of its quiet growth he caught up his long dressinggown across his chest as though it were a mantle and with a quick glance to see that there were no other witnesses to his deshabille bent and kissed the womans hand and taking it in his own stroked it gently my dear marie he lisped it is like heaven to have you back with us again we have felt your absence every hour pray be seated and pardon my robe i saw you through the blinds and could not wait tell us the glorious news the barons good words i have already overheard i listened to them with great entertainment while i was dressing i hoped he would say something discourteous or foolish but he was quite discreet until he told erhaupt that he had kept back none of the money then i lost interest fiction is never so entertaining to me as the truth and real people but tell us now of your mission and of all you did and whether successful or not be assured you are most welcome the countess zara smiled at him doubtfully and crossed her hands in her lap glancing anxiously over her shoulder i must be very brief for kalonay and father paul are close behind me she said they only stopped for a moment at the customhouse keep watch baron and tell me when you see them coming barrat moved his chair so that it faced the gardenpath the king crossed his legs comfortably and wrapped his padded dressingrobe closer around his slight figure and erhaupt stood leaning on the back of his chair with his eyes fixed on the fine insolent beauty of the woman before them she nodded her head toward the soldiers who sat at the entrance to the terrace as silent and immovable as blind beggars before a mosque do they understand she asked no the king assured her they understand nothing but that they are to keep people away from me and they do it very well i wish i could import them to paris to help niccolas fight off creditors continue we are most impatient we left here last sunday night as you know she said we passed algiers the next morning and arrived off the island at midday anchoring outside in the harbor we flew the royal yacht squadrons pennant and an owners private signal that we invented on the way down they sent me ashore in a boat and kalonay and father paul continued on along the southern shore where they have been making speeches in all the coasttowns and exciting the people in favor of the revolution i heard of them often while i was at the capital but not from them the president sent a company of carbineers to arrest them the very night they returned and smuggled me on board the yacht again we put off as soon as i came over the side and sailed directly here as soon as i landed on tuesday i went to the hotel de messina and sent my card to the president he is that man palaccio the hotelkeepers son the man you sent out of the country for writing pamphlets against the monarchy and who lived in sicily during his exile he gave me an audience at once and i told my story as he knew who i was i explained that i had quarrelled with you and that i was now prepared to sell him the secrets of an expedition which you were fitting out with the object of reestablishing yourself on the throne he wouldnt believe that there was any such expedition and said it was blackmail and threatened to give me to the police if i did not leave the island in twentyfour hours he was exceedingly rude so i showed him receipts for ammunition and rifles and maxim guns and copies of the oath of allegiance to the expedition and papers of the yacht in which she was described as an armored cruiser and he rapidly grew polite even humble and i made him apologize first and then take me out to luncheon that was the first day the second day telegrams began to come in from the coasttowns saying that the prince kalonay and father paul were preaching and exciting the people to rebellion and travelling from town to town in a manofwar then he was frightened the prince with his popularity in the south was alarming enough but the prince and father superior to help him seemed to mean the end of the republic i learned while i was down there that the people think the father put some sort of a ban on every one who had anything to do with driving the dominican monks out of the island and with the destruction of the monasteries i dont know whether he did or not but they believe he did which is the same thing and that superstitious little beast the president certainly believed it he attributed everything that had gone wrong on the island to that cause why if a second cousin of the wife of a brother of one of the men who helped to fire a church falls off his horse and breaks his leg they say that he is under the curse of the father superior and there are many who believe the republic will never succeed until paul returns and the church is reestablished the government seems to have kept itself well informed about your majestys movements and it has never felt any anxiety that you would attempt to return and it did not fear the church party because it knew that without you the priests could do nothing but when paul whom the common people look upon as a living saint and martyr returned hand in hand with your man friday they were in a panic and felt sure the end had come so the president called a hasty meeting of his cabinet and such a cabinet i wish you could have seen them louis with me in the centre playing on them like an advocate before a jury they were the most dreadful men i ever met bourgeois and stupid and ugly to a degree two of them were commissionmerchants and one of them is old dr gustavanni who kept the chemists shop in the piazza royale they were quite silly with fear and they begged me to tell them how they could avert the fall of the republic and prevent your landing and i said that it was entirely a question of money that if we were paid sufficiently the expedition would not land and we would leave them in peace but that the king shifted his legs uneasily and coughed behind his thin pink fingers that was rather indiscreet was it not marie he murmured the idea was to make them think that i at least was sincere was not that it to make it appear that though there were traitors in his camp the king was in most desperate earnest if they believe that you see it will allow me to raise another expedition as soon as the money we get for this one is gone but if you have let them know that i am the one who is selling out you have killed the goose that lays the golden eggs they will never believe us when we cry wolf again you must let me finish zara interrupted i did not involve you in the least i said that there were traitors in the camp of whom i was the envoy and that if they would pay us francs we would promise to allow the expedition only to leave the yacht their troops could then make a show of attacking our landingparty and we would raise the cry of treachery and retreat to the boats by this we would accomplish two things we would satisfy those who had contributed funds toward the expedition that we had at least made an honest effort and your majesty would be discouraged by such treachery from ever attempting another attack the money was to be paid two weeks later in paris to me or to whoever brings this ring that i wear the plan we finally agreed upon is this the yacht is to anchor off basnai next thursday night at high tide which is just about daybreak we are to lower our boats and land our men on that long beach to the south of the breakwater the troops of the republic are to lie hidden in the rocks until our men have formed then they are to fire over their heads and we are to retreat in great confusion return to the yacht and sail away two weeks later they are to pay the money into my hands or she added with a smile as she held up her fourth finger to whoever brings this ring and i need not say that the ring will not leave my finger there was a moments pause as though the men were waiting to learn if she had more to tell and then the king threw back his head and laughed softly he saw erhaupts face above his shoulder filled with the amazement and indignation of a man who as a duellist and as a soldier had shown a certain brute courage and the king laughed again what do you think of that colonel he cried gayly they are a noble race my late subjects bah exclaimed the german i didnt know we were dealing with a home for old women the baron laughed comfortably it is like taking money from a blind beggars hat he said why with two hundred men that i could pick up in london erhaupt declared contemptuously i would guarantee to put you on the throne in a fortnight heaven forbid exclaimed his majesty so they surrendered as quickly as that did they he asked nodding toward madame zara to continue the countess glanced again over her shoulder and bit her lips in some chagrin her eyes showed her disappointment it may seem an easy victory to you she said consciously but i doubt knowing all the circumstances if any of your majestys gentlemen could have served you as well it needed a woman and it needed a beautiful woman interrupted the king quickly in a tone that he would have used to a spoiled child it needed a woman of tact a woman of courage a woman among women the countess zara do not imagine marie that we undervalue your part it is their lack of courage that distresses colonel erhaupt one of them it is true did wish to fight the countess continued with a smile a frenchman named renauld whom they have put in charge of the army he scoffed at the whole expedition but they told him that a foreigner could not understand as they did the danger of the popularity of the prince kolonay who by a speech or two among the shepherds and fishermen could raise an army the king snapped his fingers impatiently an army of brigands and smugglers he exclaimed that for his popularity but he instantly raised his hands as though in protest at his own warmth of speech and in apology for his outbreak his zeal will ruin us in time he is deucedly in the way he continued in his usual tone of easy cynicism we should have let him into our plans from the first and then if he chose to take no part in them we would at least have had a free hand as it is now we have three different people to deceive this cabinet of shopkeepers which seems easy enough father paul and his fanatics of the church party and this apostle of the divine right of kings kalonay and he and the good father are not fools at these words madame zara glanced again toward the garden and this time with such evident uneasiness in her face that barrat eyed her with quick suspicion what is it he asked sharply there is something you have not told us the woman looked at the king and he nodded his head as though in assent i had to tell them who else was in the plot besides myself she said speaking rapidly i had to give them the name of some man who they knew would be able to do what i have promised we could do who could put a stop to the revolution the name i gave was his kalonays barrat threw himself forward in his chair kalonays he cried incredulously kalonays echoed erhaupt what madness madame why name the only one who is sincere she will explain said the king in an uneasy voice let her explain she has acted according to my orders and for the best but i confess i some one had to be sacrificed returned the woman boldly and why not he indeed if we wish to save ourselves there is every reason that it should be he you know how mad he is for the kings return how he himself wishes to get back to the island and to his old position there why god only knows but it is so what pleasure he finds in a land of mists and fogs in a ruined castle with poachers and smuggling fishermen for companions i cannot comprehend but the fact remains he always speaks of it as home and he wishes to return and now suppose he learns the truth as he may at any moment and discovers that the whole expedition for which he is staking his soul and life is a trick a farce that we use it only as a bait to draw money from the old nobility and to frighten the republic into paying us to leave them in peace how do we know what he might not do he may tell the whole of europe he may turn on you and expose you and then what have we left it is your last chance it is our last chance we have tried everything else and we cannot show ourselves in europe at least not without money in our hands but by naming kalonay i have managed it so that we have only to show the written agreement i have made with the republic and he is silenced in it they have promised to pay the prince kalonay naming him in full francs if the expedition is withdrawn that agreement is in my hands and that is our answer to whatever he may think or say our word is as good as his or as bad we are all of the same party as far as europe cares and it becomes a falling out among thieves and we are equal baron barrat leaned forward and marked each word with a movement of his hand do i understand you to say he asked that you have a paper signed by the republic agreeing to pay francs to kalonay then how are we to get it he demanded incredulously from him it is made payable to him continued the woman or to whoever brings this ring i wear to the bankinghouse of the schlevingens two weeks after the expedition has left the island i explained that clause to them by saying that kalonay and i were working together against the king and as he might be suspicious if we were both to leave him so soon after the failure of the expedition we would be satisfied if they gave the money to whichever one first presented the ring suppose i had said she went on turning to the king that it was either barrat or the colonel here who had turned traitor they know the baron of old when he was chamberlain and ran your roulette wheel at the palace they know he is not the man to turn back an expedition and the colonel if he will pardon me has sold his services so often to one side or another that it would have been difficult to make them believe that this time he is sincere but kalonay the man they fear most next to your majesty to have him turn traitor why that was a master stroke even those boors stupid as they are saw that when they made out the agreement they put down all his titles and laughed as they wrote them in prince judas they called him and they were in ecstasies at the idea of the aristocrat suing for bloodmoney against his sovereign of the man they feared showing himself to be only a common blackmailer it delighted them to find a prince royal sunk lower than themselves this man who has treated them like curs like the curs they are she broke out suddenly like the curs they are she rose and laughed uneasily as though at her own vehemence i am tired she said avoiding the kings eyes the trip has tired me if you will excuse me i will go to my rooms through your hallway if i may most certainly said the king i trust you will be rested by dinnertime au revoir my fair ambassadrice the woman nodded and smiled back at him brightly and louis continued to look after her as she disappeared down the corridor he rubbed the back of his fingers across his lips and thoughtfully examined his fingernails i wonder he said after a pause looking up at barrat the baron raised his eyebrows with a glance of polite interrogation i wonder if kalonay dared to make love to her on the way down the barons face became as expressionless as a deathmask and he shrugged his shoulders in protest or did she make love to kalonay the king insisted laughing gently i wonder now i do not care to know but i wonder according to tradition the kalonay family was an older one than that of the house of artois and its name had always been the one next in importance to that of the reigning house the history of messina showed that different members of the kalonay family had fought and died for different kings of artois and had enjoyed their favor and shared their reverses with equal dignity and that they had stood like a rampart when the kingdom was invaded by the levelling doctrines of republicanism and equality and though the kalonays were men of stouter stuff than their cousins of artois they had never tried to usurp their place but had set an example to the humblest shepherd of unfailing loyalty and goodwill to the king and his lady the prince kalonay who had accompanied the dominican monk to messina was the last of his race and when louis iv had been driven off the island he had followed his sovereign into exile as a matter of course and with his customary goodhumor his estates in consequence of this step had been taken up by the republic and kalonay had accepted the loss philosophically as the price one pays for loving a king he found exile easy to bear in paris and especially so as he had never relinquished the idea that some day the king would return to his own again so firmly did he believe in this and so keenly was his heart set upon it that louis had never dared to let him know that for himself exile in paris and the riviera was vastly to be preferred to authority over a rocky island hung with fogs and inhabited by dull merchants and fierce banditti the conduct of the king during their residence in paris would have tried the loyalty of one less gay and careless than kalonay for he was a sorry monarch and if the principle that the king can do no wrong had not been bred in the young princes mind he would have deserted his sovereign in the early days of their exile but as it was he made excuses for him to others and to himself and served the kings idle purposes so well that he gained for himself the name of the kings jackal and there were some who regarded him as little better than the kings confidential blackguard and man friday the weakest if the most charming of his court of adventurers at the first hint which the king gave of his desire to place himself again in power kalonay had ceased to be his jackal and would have issued forth as a commanderinchief had the king permitted him but it was not to louiss purpose that the prince should know the real object of the expedition so he assigned its preparation to erhaupt and despatched kalonay to the south of the island at the same time madame zara had been sent to the north of the island ostensibly to sound the sentiment of the old nobility but in reality to make capital out of the presence there of kalonay and father paul the king rose hurriedly when the slim figure of the prince and the broad shoulders and tonsured head of the monk appeared at the farthest end of the gardenwalk they are coming he cried with a guilty chuckle so i shall run away and finish dressing i leave you to receive the first shock of kalonays enthusiasm alone i confess he bores me remember the story madame zara told them in the yacht is the one she told us this morning that none of the old royalists at the capital would promise us any assistance be careful now and play your parts prettily we are all terribly in earnest kalonays enthusiasm had not spent itself entirely before the king returned he had still a number of amusing stories to tell and he reviewed the adventures of the monk and himself with such vivacity and humor that the king nodded his head in delight and even the priest smiled indulgently at the recollection kalonay had seated himself on one of the tables with his feet on a chair and with a cigarette burning between his fingers he was a handsome dark young man of thirty with the impulsive manner of a boy dissipation had left no trace on his face and his eyes were as innocent of evil and as beautiful as a girls and as eloquent as his tongue may the maria santissima pity the girls they look upon his old spanish nurse used to say of them but kalonay had shown pity for every one save himself his training at an english public school and later as a soldier in the ecole polytechnique at paris had saved him from a too early fall and men liked him instinctively and the women much too well it was good to be back there again he cried with a happy sigh it was good to see the clouds following each other across the old mountains and throwing black shadows on the campagna and to hear the peoples patois and to taste messinian wine again and to know it was from your own hillside all our old keepers came down to the coast to meet us and told me about the staghunt the week before and who was married and who was in jail and who had been hanged for shooting a customs officer and they promised fine deer stalking if i get back before the snow leaves the ridges for they say the deer have not been hunted and are running wild he stopped and laughed i forgot he said your majesty does not care for the rude pleasures of my half of the island kalonay threw away his cigarette clasping his hands before him with a sudden change of manner but seriously he cried as i have been telling them i wish your majesty could have heard the offers they made us and could have seen the tears running down their faces when we assured them that you would return i wished a thousand times that we had brought you with us with you at our head we can sweep the island from one end to the other we will gather strength and force as we go as a landslide grows and when we reach the capital we will strike it like a human avalanche and i wish you could have heard him speak kalonay cried his enthusiasm rising as he turned and pointed with his hand at the priest there is the leader he made my blood turn hot with his speeches and when he had finished i used to find myself standing on my tiptoes and shouting with the rest without him i could have done nothing they knew me too well but the laziest rascals in the village came to welcome him again and the women and men wept before him and brought their children to be blessed and fell on their knees and kissed his sandals it was like the stories they tell you when you are a child he made us sob with regret and he filled us with fresh resolves oh it is very well for you to smile you old cynics he cried smiling at his own fervor but i tell you i have lived since i saw you last the priest stood silent with his hands hidden inside his great sleeves and his head rising erect and rigid from his cowl the eyes of the men were turned upon him curiously and he glanced from one to the other as though mistrusting their sympathy it was not me it was the church they came to welcome the fools he cried bitterly they thought they could destroy the faith of the people by banishing the servants of the church as soon end a mothers love for her children by putting an ocean between them for six years those peasants have been true i left them faithful i returned to find them faithful and now he concluded looking steadily at the king as though to hold him to account and now they are to have their reward the king bowed his head gravely in assent they are to have their reward he repeated he rose and with a wave of his hand invited the priest to follow him and they walked together to the other end of the terrace when they were out of hearing of the others the king seated himself and the priest halted beside his chair i wish to speak with you father louis said concerning this young american girl miss carson who has promised to help us to help you with her money has she said yet how much she means to give us asked the king and when she means to let us have it it is a delicate matter and i do not wish to urge the lady but we are really greatly in need of money baron barrat who arrived from paris this morning brings back no substantial aid although the sympathy of the old nobility he assures me is with us sympathy however does not purchase maxim guns nor pay for rations and madame zaras visit to the capital was as you know even less successful your majesty has seen miss carson then the priest asked yes her mother and she have been staying at the continental ever since they followed you here from paris and i have seen her once or twice during your absence the young lady seems an earnest daughter of our faith and she is deeply in sympathy with our effort to reestablish your order and the influence of the church upon the island i have explained to her that the only way in which the church can regain her footing there is through my return to the throne and miss carson has hinted that she is willing to make even a larger contribution than the one she first mentioned if she means to do this it would be well if she did it at once perhaps i have misunderstood her said the priest after a moments consideration but i thought the sum she meant to contribute was to be given only after the monarchy has been formally established and that she wished whatever she gave to be used exclusively in rebuilding the churches and the monastery i do not grudge it to your majestys purpose but so i understood her ah that is quite possible returned louis easily it may be that she did so intend at first but since i have talked with her she has shown a willing disposition to aid us not only later but now my success means your success he continued smiling pleasantly as he rose to his feet so i trust you will urge her to be prompt she seems to have unlimited resources in her own right do you happen to know from whence her money comes her mother told me said the priest that mr carson before his death owned mines and railroads they live in california near the mission of saint francis i have written concerning them to the father superior there and he tells me that mr carson died a very rich man and that he was a generous servant of the church his daughter has but just inherited her fathers fortune and her one idea of using it is to give it to the church as he would have done the priest paused and seemed to consider what the king had just told him i will speak with her he said and ask her aid as fully as she can give it may i inquire how far your majesty has taken her into our plans miss carson is fully informed the king replied briefly and if you wish to speak with her you can see her now she and her mother are coming to breakfast with me to hear the account of your visit to the island you can speak with her then and father the king added lowering his eyes and fingering the loose sleeve of the priests robe it would be well i think to have this presentation of the young nobles immediately after the luncheon while miss carson is still present we might even make a little ceremony of it and so show her that she is fully in our confidence that she is one of our most valued supporters it might perhaps quicken her interest in the cause i see no reason why that should not be said the priest thoughtfully turning his eyes to the sea below them madame zara he added without moving his eyes will not be present the king straightened himself slightly and for a brief moment of time looked at the priest in silence but the monk continued to gaze steadily at the blue waters madame zara will not be present the king repeated coldly there are a few fishermen and mountaineers your majesty the priest continued turning an unconscious countenance to the king who came back with us from the island they come as a deputation to inform your majesty of the welcome that waits you and i have promised them an audience if you will pardon me i would suggest that you receive these honest people at the same time with the others and that his highness the crown prince be also present and that he receive them with you their anxiety to see him is only second to their desire to speak to your majesty you will find some of your most loyal subjects among these men their forefathers have been faithful to your house and to the church for many generations excellent said the king i shall receive them immediately after the deputation from paris consult with baron barrat and kalonay please about the details i wish either kalonay or yourself to make the presentation i see miss carson and her mother coming after luncheon then at say three oclock will that be satisfactory as your majesty pleases the priest answered and with a bow he strode across the terrace to where kalonay stood watching them ii mrs carson and her daughter came from the hotel to the terrace through the hallway which divided the kings apartments baron barrat preceded them and they followed in single file miss carson walking first it was a position her mother always forced upon her and after people grew to know them they accepted it as illustrating mrs carsons confidence in her daughters ability to care for herself as well as her own wish to remain in the background patricia carson as she was named after her patron saint or patty carson as she was called more frequently was an exceedingly pretty girl she was tall and fair with a smile that showed such confidence in everyone she met that few could find the courage to undeceive her by being themselves and it was easier in the face of such an appeal as her eyes made to the best in every one for each to act a part while he was with her she was young impressionable and absolutely inexperienced as a little girl she had lived on a great ranch where she could gallop from sunrise to sunset over her own prairie land and later her life had been spent in a convent outside of paris she had but two great emotions her love for her father and for the church which had nursed her her fathers death had sanctified him and given him a place in her heart that her mother could not hold and when she found herself at twentyone the mistress of a great fortune her one idea as to the disposal of it was to do with it what would best please him and the church which had been the ruling power in the life of both of them she was quite unconscious of her beauty and her mode of speaking was simple and eager she halted as she came near the king and resting her two hands on the top of her lace parasol nodded pleasantly to him and to the others she neither courtesied nor offered him her hand but seemed to prefer this middle course leaving them to decide whether she acted as she did from ignorance or from choice as the king stepped forward to greet her mother miss carson passed him and moved on to where the father superior stood apart from the others talking earnestly with the prince what he was saying was of an unwelcome nature for kalonays face wore an expression of boredom and polite protest which changed instantly to one of delight when he saw miss carson the girl hesitated and made a deep obeisance to the priest i am afraid i interrupt you she said not at all kalonay assured her laughing it is a most welcome interruption the good father has been finding fault with me as usual and i am quite willing to change the subject the priest smiled kindly on the girl and while he exchanged some words of welcome with her kalonay brought up one of the huge wicker chairs and she seated herself with her back to the others facing the two men who stood leaning against the broad balustrade they had been fellowconspirators sufficiently long for them to have grown to know each other well and the priest so far from regarding her as an intruder hailed her at once as a probable ally and endeavored to begin again where he had ceased speaking do you not agree with me miss carson he asked i am telling the prince that zeal is not enough and that high ideals unless they are accompanied by good conduct are futile i want him to change to be more sober more strict oh you must not ask me miss carson said hurriedly smiling and shaking her head we are working for only one thing are we not beyond that you know nothing of me and i know nothing of you i came to hear of your visit she continued am i to be told anything she asked eagerly looking from one to the other it has been such an anxious two weeks we imagined all manner of things had happened to you kalonay laughed happily the father was probably never safer in his life he said they took us to their hearts like brothers they might have suffocated us with kindness but we were in no other danger then you are encouraged father she asked turning to the priest you found them loyal your visit was all you hoped you can depend upon them we can count upon them absolutely the monk assured her we shall start on our return voyage at once in a day as soon as his majesty gives the word there are so many things i want to know the girl said but i have no right to ask she added looking up at him doubtfully you have every right the monk answered you have certainly earned it without the help you gave us we could not have moved you have been more than generous miss carson interrupted him with an impatient lifting of her head that sort of generosity is nothing she said with you men it is different you are all risking something you are actually helping while i must sit still and wait i hope father she said smiling it is not wrong for me to wish i were a man wrong exclaimed kalonay in a tone of mock dismay of course its wrong its wicked the monk turned and looked coldly over his shoulder at kalonay and the prince laughed i beg your pardon he said but we are told to be contented with our lot he argued impenitently he only is a slave who complains and that is true even if a heretic did say it the monk shook his head and turned again to miss carson with a tolerant smile he is very young he said as though kalonay did not hear him and wild and foolish and yet he added doubtfully i find i love the boy he regarded the young man with a kind but impersonal scrutiny as though he were a picture or a statue sometimes i imagine he is all i might have been he said had not god given me the strength to overcome myself he has never denied himself in anything he is as wilful and capricious as a girl he makes a noble friend miss carson and a generous enemy but he is spoiled irretrievably by good fortune and good living and good health the priest looked at the young man with a certain sad severity unstable as water thou shalt not excel he said the girl in great embarrassment turned her head away glancing from the ocean to the sky but kalonay seated himself coolly on the broad balustrade of the terrace with his hands on his hips and his heels resting on the marble tiling and clicked the soles of his boots together oh i have had my bad days too father he said he turned his head on one side and pressed his lips together looking down unstable as water that is quite possible he said with an air of consideration but spoiled by good fortune oh no that is not fair do you call it good fortune sir he laughed to be an exile at twentyeight is it good fortune to be too poor to pay your debts and too lazy to work to be the last of a great name and to have no chance to add to the glory of it and no means to keep its dignity fresh and secure do you fancy i like to see myself drifting farther and farther away from the old standards and the old traditions to have english brewers and german jew bankers taking the place i should have buying titles with their earnings and snubbing me because i can only hunt when someone gives me a mount and because i choose to take a purse instead of a cup when we shoot at monte carlo what childs talk is this interrupted the priest angrily a thousand horses cannot make a man noble nor was poverty ever ignoble you talk like a weak boy every word you say is your own condemnation why should you complain your bed is of your own making the other prodigal was forced to herd with the swine you have chosen to herd with them the girl straightened herself and half rose from her chair you are boring miss carson with my delinquencies said the prince sternly his face was flushed and he did not look either at the girl or at the priest but the prodigals father said miss carson smiling at the older man did he stand over him and upbraid him you remember he went to meet him when he was yet a great way off that was it was it not father of course he did cried kalonay laughing like a boy and slipping lightly to the terrace he met him half way and gave him the best he had he stepped to miss carsons side and the two young people moved away smiling and the priest seeing that they were about to escape him cried eagerly but that prodigal had repented this one lets run cried the prince he will get the best of us if we stay he always gets the best of me he has been abusing me that way for two weeks now and he is always sorry afterward let us leave him alone to his sorrow and remorse kalonay walked across the terrace with miss carson bending above her with what would have seemed to an outsider almost a proprietary right she did not appear to notice it but looked at him frankly and listened to what he had to say with interest he was speaking rapidly and as he spoke he glanced shyly at her as though seeking her approbation and not boldly as he was accustomed to do when he talked with either men or women to look at her with admiration was such a cheap form of appreciation and one so distasteful to her that had he known it kalonays averted eyes were more of a compliment than any words he could have spoken his companions who had seen him with other women knew that his manner to her was not his usual manner and that he gave her something he did not give to the others that he was more discreet and less ready and less at ease the prince kalonay had first met miss carson and her mother by chance in paris at the rooms of father paul where they had each gone on the same errand and since that meeting his whole manner toward the two worlds in which he lived had altered so strangely that mere acquaintances noticed the change before he had met her the little the priest had said concerning her and her zeal for their common desire had piqued his curiosity and his imagination had been aroused by the picture of a romantic young woman giving her fortune to save the souls of the people of messina his people whom he regarded and who regarded him less as a feudal lord than as a father and a comrade he had pictured her as a nervous angular woman with a pale ascetic face and with the restless eyes of an enthusiast dressed in black and badly dressed and with a severe and narrow intelligence but he had prepared himself to forgive her personality for the sake of the high and generous impulse that inspired her and when he was presented to her as she really was and found her young lovable and nobly fair the shock of wonder and delight had held him silent during the whole course of her interview with the priest and when she had left them his brain was in a tumult and was filled with memories of her words and gestures and of the sweet fearlessness of her manner beautiful women he had known before as beautiful women but the saving grace in his nature had never before been so deeply roused by what was fine as well as beautiful it seemed as though it were too complete and perfect for he assured himself that she possessed everything those qualities which he had never valued before because he believed them to be unattainable and those others which he had made his idols she was with him mind and heart and soul in the one desire of his life that he took seriously she was of his religion she was more noble than his noble sisters and she was more beautiful than the day in the first glow of the meeting it seemed to him as though fate had called them to do this work together she from the far shore of the pacific and he from his rocky island in the middle sea and he saw with cruel distinctness that if there were one thing wanting it was himself he worshipped her before he had bowed his first goodby to her and that night he walked for miles up and down the long lengths of the avenue of the champselysees facing the great change that she had brought into his life but knowing himself to be utterly unfit for her coming he felt like an unworthy steward caught at his masters return unprepared with ungirt loins and unlighted lamp nothing he had done since he was a child gave him the right to consider himself her equal he was not blinded by the approaches which other daughters and the mothers of daughters had made him he knew that what was enough to excuse many things in their eyes might find no apology in hers he looked back with the awakening of a child at the irrevocable acts in his life that could not be altered nor dug up nor hidden away they marked the road he had trodden like heavy milestones telling his story to every passerby she could read them as everyone else could read them he had wasted his substance he had bartered his birthright for a moments pleasure there was no one so low and despicable who could not call him comrade to whom he had not given himself without reserve there was nothing left and now the one thing he had ever wanted had come and had found him like a bankrupt his credit wasted and his coffers empty he had placed himself at the beck and call of every idle man and woman in paris and he was as common as the great clockface that hangs above the boulevards miss carsons feelings toward kalonay were not of her own choosing and had passed through several stages when they had first met she had thought it most sad that so careless and unprincipled a person should chance to hold so important a part in the task she had set herself to do she knew his class only by hearsay but she placed him in it and accordingly at once dismissed him as a person from her mind kalonay had never shown her that he loved her except by those signs which any woman can read and which no man can conceal but he did not make love to her and it was that which first prepossessed her in his favor one or two other men who knew of her fortune and to whom she had given as little encouragement as she had to kalonay had been less considerate but his attitude toward her was always that of a fellowworker in the common cause he treated her with a gratitude for the help she meant to give his people which much embarrassed her his seriousness pleased her with him seeing as she did that it was not his nature to be serious and his enthusiasm and love for his halfcivilized countrymen increased her interest in them and her liking for him she could not help but admire the way in which he accepted without forcing her to make it any plainer the fact that he held no place in her thoughts and then she found that he began to hold more of a place in her thoughts than she had supposed any man could hold of whom she knew so little and of whom the little she knew was so ill she missed him when she went to the priests and found that he had not sent for kalonay to bear his part in their councils and at times she felt an unworthy wish to hear kalonay speak the very words she had admired him for keeping from her and at last she learned the truth that she did love him and it frightened her and made her miserable and happy they had not seen each other since he had left paris for messina and though they spoke now only of his mission to the island there was back of what they said the joy for each of them of being together again and of finding that it meant so much what it might mean to the other neither knew for some little time the king followed the two young people with his eyes and then joined them making signs to kalonay that he wished him to leave them together but kalonay remained blind to his signals and barrat seeing that it was not a teteatete joined them also when he did so kalonay asked the king for a word and laying his hand upon his arm walked with him down the terrace pointing ostensibly to where the yacht lay in the harbor louis answered his pantomime with an appropriate gesture and then asked sharply well what is it why did you bring me here and what do you mean by staying on when you see you are not wanted they were some distance from the others kalonay smiled and made a slight bow your majesty he began with polite emphasis the king looked at him curiously in the old days under similar circumstances the prince continued with the air of a courtier rather than that of an equal had i thought of forming an alliance by marriage i should have come to your majesty first and asked your gracious approval but those days are past and we are living at the end of the century and we do such things differently he straightened himself and returned the kings look of amused interest with one as cynical as his own what i wanted to tell you louis he said quietly is that i mean to ask miss carson to become the princess kalonay the king raised his head quickly and stared at the younger man with a look of distaste and surprise he gave an incredulous laugh indeed he said at last there was always something about rich women you could never resist the prince made his acknowledgment with a shrug of his shoulders and smiled indifferently i didnt expect you to understand he said it does seem odd its quite as difficult for me to understand as for you i have been through it a great many times and i thought i knew all there was of it but now it seems different no it does not seem different he corrected himself it is different and i love the lady and i mean to ask her to do me the honor to marry me i didnt expect you to understand i dont care if you do i only wanted to warn you warn me interrupted the king with an unpleasant smile indeed against what your tone is a trifle peremptory but you are interesting most interesting kalonay in a new role kalonay in love most interesting warn me against what he repeated sharply your majesty has a certain manner the prince began with a pretence of hesitation a charm of manner i might say which is proverbial it is we know attractive to women every woman acknowledges it but your majesty is sometimes too gracious he permits himself to condescend to many women to any woman to women of all classes that will do said the king what do you mean what i mean is this said kalonay lowering his voice and looking into the kings halfclosed eyes you can have all of miss carsons money you want all you can get i dont want it if i am to marry her at all i am not marrying her for her money you cant believe that it isnt essential that you should but i want you to leave the woman i hope to make my wife alone i will allow no pretty speeches nor royal attentions she can give her money where she pleases now and always but ill not have her eyes opened to as you can open them i will not have her annoyed and if she is ah and if she is challenged the king his eyes were wide apart now and his lips were parted and drawn back from his teeth like a snarling cat i shall hold whoever annoys her responsible kalonay concluded impersonally there was a moments pause during which the two men stood regarding each other warily then the king stiffened his shoulders and placed his hands slowly behind his back that sounds my dear kalonay he said almost like a threat the younger man laughed insolently i meant it too your majesty he answered bowing mockingly and backing away as the kings guests seated themselves at his breakfasttable louis smiled upon them with a gracious glance of welcome and approval his manner was charmingly condescending and in his appearance there was nothing more serious than an anxiety for their better entertainment and a certain animal satisfaction in the food upon his plate in reality his eyes were distributing the people at the table before him into elements favorable or unfavorable to his plans and in his mind he shuffled them and their values for him or against him as a gambler arranges and rearranges the cards in his hand he saw himself plainly as his own highest card and barrat and erhaupt as willing but mediocre accomplices in father paul and kalonay he recognized his most powerful allies or most dangerous foes miss carson meant nothing to him but a source from which he could draw the sinews of war what would become of her after the farce was ended he did not consider he was not capable of comprehending either her or her motives and had he concerned himself about her at all he would have probably thought that she was more of a fool than the saint she pretended to be and that she had come to their assistance more because she wished to be near a prince and a king than because she cared for the souls of sixty thousand peasants that she would surely lose her money and could hardly hope to escape from them without losing her good name did not concern him it was not his duty to look after the reputation of any american heiress who thought she could afford to be unconventional she had a mother to do that for her and she was pretty enough he concluded to excuse many things so pretty that he wondered if he might brave the countess zara and offer miss carson the attentions to which kalonay had made such arrogant objections the king smiled at the thought and let his little eyes fall for a moment on the tall figure of the girl with its crown of heavy golden hair and on her clever earnest eyes she was certainly worth waiting for and in the meanwhile she was virtually unprotected and surrounded by his own people according to his translation of her acts she had already offered him every encouragement and had placed herself in a position which to his understanding of the world could have but one interpretation what kalonays sudden infatuation might mean he could not foresee whether it promised good or threatened evil he could only guess but he decided that the young mans unwonted show of independence of the morning must be punished his claim to exclusive proprietorship in the young girl struck the king as amusing but impertinent it would be easy sailing in spite of all he decided for somewhere up above them in the hotel sat the unbidden guest the woman against whom father paul had raised the ban of expulsion but who had nevertheless tricked both him and the faithful jackal the breakfast was drawing to an end and the faithful niccolas was the only servant remaining in the room the talk had grown intimate and touched openly upon the successful visit of the two ambassadors to the island and of barrats mission to paris of madame zaras visit to the northern half of the island which was supposed to have been less successful no mention was made louis felt as he listened to them like a man at a play who knows that at a word from him the complications would cease and that were he to rise in the stalls and explain them away and point out the real hero and denounce the villain the curtain would have to ring down on the instant he gave a little purr of satisfaction and again marshalled his chances before him and smiled to find them good he was grandly at peace with himself and with the world whatever happened he was already richer by some francs and in a day if he could keep the american girl to her expedition had been played he would be free free to return to his clubs and to his boulevards and boudoirs with money enough to silence the most insolent among his creditors and with renewed credit with even a certain glamour about him of one who had dared to do even though he had failed in the doing who had shaken off the slothfulness of ease and had chosen to risk his life for his throne with a smoking rifle in his hand until a traitor had turned fortune against him the king was amused to find that this prospect pleased him vastly he was surprised to discover that careless as he thought himself to be to public opinion he was still capable of caring for its approbation but he consoled himself for this weakness by arguing that it was only because the approbation would be his by a trick that it pleased him to think of perhaps some of his royal cousins in the light of his bold intent might take him under their protection instead of neglecting him shamefully as they had done in the past his armed expedition might open certain doors to him his name and he smiled grimly as he imagined it would ring throughout europe as the soldier king as the modern disciple of the divine right of kings he saw in his minds eye even the possibility of a royal alliance and a pension from one of the great powers no matter where he looked he could see nothing but gain to himself more power for pleasure more chances of greater fortune in the future and while his lips assented to what the others said and his eyes thanked them for some expression of loyalty or confidence he saw himself in dreams as bright as an absinthe drinkers back in his beloved paris in the champselysees behind fine horses lolling from a silk box at the opera dealing baccarat at the jockey club or playing host to some beautiful woman of the hour in the new home he would establish for her in the discreet and leafy borders of the bois he had forgotten his guests and the moment he had forgotten that there were difficulties yet to overcome and with a short indrawn sigh of pleasure he threw back his head and smiled arrogantly upon the sunny terrace and the green palms and the brilliant blue sea as though he challenged the whole beautiful world before him to do aught but minister to his success and contribute to his pleasures and at once as though in answer to his challenge a tall slim young man sprang lightly up the steps of the terrace passed the bewildered guards with a cheery nod and striding before the open windows knocked with his fist upon the portals of the door as sharply and as confidently as though the kings shield had hung there and he had struck it with a lance the kings dream shattered and faded away at the sound and he moved uneasily in his chair he had the gamblers superstitious regard for trifles and this invasion of his privacy by a confident stranger filled him with sudden disquiet he saw kalonay staring at the open windows with an expression of astonishment and dismay who is it the king asked peevishly what are you staring at how did he get in kalonay turned on barrat sitting at his right did you see him he asked barrat nodded gloomily the devil exclaimed the prince as though barrat had confirmed his guess i beg your pardon he said nodding his head toward the women he pushed back his chair and stood irresolutely with his napkin in his hand tell him we are not in niccolas he commanded he saw us as he passed the window the baron objected say we are at breakfast then i will see him myself in a moment what shall i tell him he asked turning to barrat do you think he knows he must know they have told him in paris you are keeping us waiting said the king what is it who is this man an american named gordon he is a correspondent kalonay answered without turning his head his eyes were still fixed on the terrace as though he had seen a ghost the king slapped his hand on the arm of the chair you promised me he said that we should be free from that sort of thing that is why i agreed to come here instead of going to algiers go out barrat and send him away barrat pressed his lips together and shook his head you cant send him away like that he said he is a very important young man find out how much he will take then exclaimed the king angrily and give it to him i can better afford to pay blackmail to any amount than have my plans spoiled now by the newspapers give him what he wants a fur coat they always wear fur coats or five thousand francs or something anything but get rid of him barrat stirred uneasily in his chair and shrugged his shoulders he is not a boulevard journalist he replied sulkily your majesty is thinking of the hungarian jews at vienna explained kalonay who live on chantage and the monte carlo propaganda fund this man is not in their class he is not to be bought i said he was an american an american exclaimed mrs carson and her daughter exchanging rapid glances is it archie gordon you mean the girl asked i thought he was in china that is the man archie gordon he writes books and explores places kalonay answered i know him he wrote a book on the slave trade in the congo contributed colonel erhaupt i met him at zanzibar what does he want with us he was in yokohama when the japanesechinese war broke out said kalonay turning to the king and he cabled a london paper he would follow the war for it if they paid him a hundred a week he meant american dollars but they thought he meant pounds so they cabled back that theyd pay onehalf that sum he answered one hundred or nothing and they finally assented to that and he started and when the first weeks remittance arrived and he received five hundred dollars instead of the one hundred he expected he sent back the difference what a remarkable young man exclaimed the king he is much too good for daily wear we dont want anyone like that around here do we i know mr gordon very well said miss carson he lived in san francisco before he came east he was always at our house and was a great friend of the family wasnt he mother we havent seen him for two years now but i know he wouldnt spoil our plans for the sake of his paper if he knew we were in earnest if he understood that everything depended upon its being kept a secret we are not certain that he knows anything the king urged he may not have come here to see us i think father paul should talk with him first i was going to suggest said miss carson with some hesitation that if i spoke to him i might be able to put it to him in such a way that he would see how necessary it oh excellent exclaimed the king eagerly and rising to his feet if you only would be so kind miss carson kalonay misunderstanding the situation altogether fastened his eyes upon the table and did not speak he has not come to see you patricia said mrs carson quietly he does not know that i am here miss carson answered but im sure if he did he would be very glad to see us again and if we do see him we can make him promise not to do anything that might interfere with our plans wont you let me speak to him mother mrs carson turned uncertainly to the priest for direction and his glance apparently reassured her for she rose though still with a troubled countenance and the two women left the room together the men standing regarding each other anxiously across the table when they had gone the king lit a cigarette and turning his back on his companions puffed at it nervously in silence kalonay sat moodily studying the pattern on the plate before him and the others whispered together at the farther end of the table when miss carson and her mother stepped out upon the terrace the american was standing with his back toward them and was speaking to the guards who sat crosslegged at the top of the steps they showed no sign of surprise at the fact of his addressing them in their own tongue further than that they answered him with a show of respect which they had not exhibited toward those they protected the american turned as he heard the footsteps behind him and after a startled look of astonishment hurried toward the two women exclaiming with every expression of pleasure i had no idea you were stopping here he said after the first greetings were over i thought you were somewhere on the continent i am so glad i caught you it seems centuries since i saw you last youre looking very well mrs carson and as for patty i am almost afraid of her ive been hearing all sorts of things about you lately patty he went on turning a smiling countenance toward the girl about your engagements to princes and dukes all sorts of disturbing rumors what a terrible swell youve grown to be i hardly recognize you at all mrs carson it isnt possible this is the same young girl i used to take buggy riding on sunday evenings indeed it is not i wish it were said mrs carson plaintively sinking into a chair im glad to see youre not changed archie she added with a sigh why hes very much changed mother the girl said hes taller and in comparison with what he was hes almost wasted away and so sunburned i hardly knew him except round the forehead she added mockingly and i suppose the sun couldnt burn there because of the laurelwreaths i hear they bring them to you fresh every morning theyre better than coronets at any rate gordon answered with a nod theyre not so common and if im wasted away can you wonder how long has it been since i saw you patty no im wrong hes not changed miss carson said dryly as she seated herself beside her mother how do you two come to be stopping here the young man asked i thought this hotel had been turned over to king louis it has mrs carson answered we are staying at the continental on the hill there we are only here for breakfast he asked us to breakfast he repeated gordon with an incredulous smile who not the king not that blackguard miss carson raised her head and stared at him in silence and her mother gave a little gasp apparently of relief and satisfaction yes miss carson answered at last coldly we are breakfasting with him what do you know against him gordon stared at her with such genuine astonishment that the girl lowered her eyes and bending forward in her chair twirled her parasol nervously between her fingers what do i know against him why patty he exclaimed how did you meet him in heavens name he asked roughly have you been seen with him have you known him long who had the impudence to present him mrs carson looked up now thoroughly alarmed her lower lip was trembling and she twisted her gloved hands together in her lap what do you know against him miss carson repeated meeting gordons look with one as full of surprise as his own the young man regarded her steadily for a few moments and then with a change of manner as though he now saw the situation was much more serious than he had at first supposed drew up a chair in front of the two women and seated himself deliberately has he borrowed any money from you yet he asked miss carsons face flushed crimson and she straightened her shoulders and turned her eyes away from gordon with every sign of indignation and disapproval the young man gave an exclamation of relief no thats good you cannot have known him so very long i am greatly relieved louis of messina he began more gently is the most unscrupulous rascal in europe since they turned him out of his kingdom he has lived by selling his title to men who are promoting new brands of champagne or floating queer mining shares the greater part of his income is dependent on the generosity of the old nobility of messina and when they dont pay him readily enough he levies blackmail on them he owes money to every tailor and horsedealer and hotelkeeper in europe and no one who can tell one card from another will play with him that is his reputation and to help him live up to it he has surrounded himself with a parcel of adventurers as rascally as himself a colonel erhaupt who was dropped from a german regiment and who is a colonel only by the favor of the queen of madagascar a retired croupier named barrat and a fallen angel called kalonay a fellow of the very best blood in europe and with the very worst morals they call him the kings jackal and he is one of the most delightful blackguards i ever met so is the king for that matter a most entertaining individual if you keep him in his place but a man no woman can know in fact mrs carson gordon went on addressing himself to the mother when you have to say that a woman has absolutely no reputation whatever you can best express it by explaining that she has a title from louis of messina that is his majestys way of treating his feminine friends when they bore him and he wants to get rid of them he gives them a title the only thing the man ever did that was to his credit and that could be discussed in polite society is what he is doing now at this place at this moment for it seems gordon whispered drawing his chair closer that he is about to show himself something of a man after all and that he is engaged in fitting out an armed expedition with which he hopes to recover his kingdom thats what brought me here and i must say i rather admire him for attempting such a thing of course it was kalonay who put him up to it he would never have stirred from the boulevards if that young man had not made him but he is here nevertheless waiting for a favorable opportunity to sail and he has ten thousand rifles and three maxim guns lying in his yacht out there in the harbor thats how i came to learn about it i was getting an estimate on an outfit i was thinking of taking into yucatan from my old gunsmith in the rue scribe and he dropped a hint that he had shipped ten thousand rifles to tangier to colonel erhaupt i have met erhaupt in zanzibar and knew he was the kings righthand man so i put two and two together and decided i would follow them up and yes and now interrupted miss carson sharply and now that you have followed them up what do you mean to do gordon looked his surprise at her earnestness but answered that he did not know what he would do he thought he would either ask them to give him a commission in their expedition and let him help them fight and write an account of their adventures later or he would telegraph the story at once to his paper it was with him he said entirely a question as to which course would be of the greater news value if he told what he now knew his paper would be the first of all others to inform the world of the expedition and the proposed revolution while if he volunteered for the expedition and waited until it had failed or succeeded he would be able to tell more eventually but would have to share it with other correspondents miss carson regarded him with an expression in which indignation and entreaty were curiously blended archie she said in a low voice you do not know what you are doing or saying you are threatening to spoil the one thing in my life on which i have set my heart the return of this man to his throne whether he is worthy or not means the restoration of the catholic church on that island it means the return of the monks and the rebuilding of the monasteries and the salvation of sixty thousand souls i know all that they mean to do i am the one who paid for those rifles that brought you here you have told me only what i have known for months and for which i have been earnestly working and praying i am not blinded by these men they are not the creatures you describe but no matter what they may be it is only through them and through them alone that i can do what i have set out to do gordon silenced her with a sweep of his hand do you mean to tell me he demanded that you are mixed up in this with these that they have taken money from you and told you they meant to use it to reestablish the church mrs carson he exclaimed bitterly turning upon her why have you allowed this what have you been doing while this was going on do you suppose those scoundrels care for the church the church indeed wait until i see them any of them erhaupt by choice and ill make them give up every franc youve lent them or ill horsewhip and expose them for the gang of welshers and thimbleriggers they are or if they prefer their own methods ill call them out in rotation and shoot their arms and legs off he stopped and drew a long breath either of content that he had discovered the situation in time to take some part in it or at the prospect of a fight the idea of you two helpless females wandering into this den of wolves he exclaimed indignantly its about time you had a man to look after you you go back to your hotel now and let me have a chat with louis of messina hes kept me waiting some twenty minutes as it is and thats a little longer than i can give him im not a creditor he rose from his chair but miss carson put out her hand and motioned him to be seated archie she said i like the way you take this even though you are all wrong about it because its just like you to fly into a passion and want to fight someone for somebody if your conclusions were anywhere near the truth you would be acting very well but they are not the king is not handling my money nor the prince kalonay it is in the keeping of father paul the father superior of the dominican monks who is the only one of these people i know or who knows me he is not a swindler too is he or a retired croupier listen to me now and do not fly out like that at me or at mother it is not her fault last summer mother and i went to messina as tourists and one day when passing through a seaport town we saw a crowd of people on the shore standing or kneeling by the hundreds in a great semicircle close to the waters edge there was a priest preaching to them from an open boat it was like a scene from the new testament and the man this father paul made me think of one of the disciples i asked them why he did not preach on the land and they told me that he and all of the priests had been banished from the island six years before and that they could only return by stealth and dared not land except by night when the priest had finished speaking i had myself rowed out to his boat and i talked a long time with him and he told me of this plan to reestablish himself and his order i offered to help him with my money and he promised me a letter to cardinal napoli it reached me on my return to rome and through the influence of the cardinal i was given an audience with the pope and i was encouraged to aid father paul as far as i could i had meant to build a memorial church for father but they urged me to give the money instead to this cause all my dealings until today have been with father paul alone i have seen a little of the prince kalonay because they are always together but he has always treated me in a way to which no one could take exception and he is certainly very much in earnest when father paul left paris mother and i came on here in order to be near him and that is how you find me at tangier and now that you understand how much this means to me i know you will not do anything to stand in our way those men inside are afraid that you came here for just the reason that apparently has brought you and when they saw you a little while ago through the windows they were greatly disturbed let me tell them that you mean to volunteer for the campaign the king cannot refuse the services of a man who has done the things you are always doing and i promise you that for a reward you shall be the only one to tell the story of our attempt i promise you she repeated earnestly that the day we enter the capital you can cable whatever you please and tell our story to the whole of europe the story be hanged replied gordon you have made this a much more serious business than a newspaper story you misunderstand me utterly patty i am here now because i am not going to have you compromised and robbed the girl stood up and looked down at the young man indignantly you have no right whatever to use that tone to me she said i am of age and my own adviser i am acting for the good of a great number of people and according to what my conscience and common sense tell me is right i shall hate you if you attempt to interfere you can do one of two things archie i give you your choice you can either go with them as a volunteer and promise to keep our secret or you can cable what you know now what you know only by accident but if you do you will lose your best friend and you will defeat a good and a noble effort gordon leaned back in his chair and looked up at her steadily for a brief moment and then rose with a smile and bowed to the two women in silence he crossed the terrace quickly with an amused and puzzled countenance and walked into the breakfastroom from the windows of which as he rightly guessed the five conspirators had for some time observed him he looked from one to the other of the men about the table until his eyes finally met those of the king i believe sir you are leading an expedition against the republic of messina gordon said i am afraid it cant start unless you take me with you iii the presence in tangier of the king of messina and his suite and the arrival there of the french noblemen who had volunteered for the expedition could not escape the observation of the resident consulsgeneral and of the foreign colony and dinners riding and hunting parties pigsticking and excursions on horseback into the outlying country were planned for their honor and daily entertainment had the conspirators held aloof from these the residents might have asked since it was not to enjoy themselves what was the purpose of their stay in tangier and so to allay suspicion as to their real object different members of the expedition had been assigned from time to time to represent the visitors at these festivities on the morning following the return of the yacht from messina an invitation to ride to a farmhouse some miles out of tangier and to breakfast there had been sent to the visitors and the king had directed the prince kalonay and half of the delegation from paris to accept it in his name they were well content to go and rode forth gayly and in high spirits for the word had been brought them early in the morning that the expedition was already prepared to move and that same evening at midnight the yacht would set sail for messina they were careless as to what fortune waited for them there the promise of much excitement of fighting and of danger of possible honor and success stirred the hearts of the young men gloriously and as they galloped across the plains or raced each other from point to point or halted to jump their ponies across the many gaping crevices which the sun had split in the surface of the plain they filled the still warm air with their shouts and laughter in the party there were many ladies and the groups changed and formed again as they rode forward spread out on either side of the caravantrail and covering the plain like a skirmish line of cavalry but kalonay kept close at miss carsons stirrup whether she walked her pony or sent him flying across the hard sunbaked soil i hope you wont do that again he said earnestly as she drew up panting with her sailor hat and hair falling to her shoulders they had been galloping recklessly over the open crevices in the soil its quite the nastiest country i ever saw he said it looks as though an earthquake had shaken it open and had forgotten to close it again believe me it is most unsafe and dangerous your pony might stumble he stopped as though the possibilities were too serious for words but the girl laughed its no more dangerous than riding across our prairie at dusk when you cant see the barbed wire you are the last person in the world to find fault because a thing is dangerous she added they had reached the farm where they went to breakfast and the young englishman who was their host was receiving his guests in his garden and the servants were passing among them carrying cool drinks and powdered sweets and turkish coffee kalonay gave their ponies to a servant and pointed with his whip to an arbor that stood at one end of the garden may we sit down there a moment until they call us he said i have news of much importance and i may not have another chance he begged looking at her wistfully the girl stood motionless her eyes were serious and she measured the distance down the walk to the arbor as though she saw it beset with dangers more actual than precipices and twisted wire the prince watched her as though his fate was being weighed in his presence very well she said at last and moved on before him down the gardenpath the arbor was open to the air with a low broad roof of palmleaves that overhung it on all sides and left it in deep shadow around it were many strange plants and flowers some native to morocco and some transplanted from their english home from where they sat they could see the other guests moving in and out among the groves of orange and olive trees and swaying palms and standing outlined against the blue sky upon the low flat roof of the farmhouse i have dared to ask you to be so good as to give me this moment the prince said humbly only because i am going away and it may be my last chance to speak with you you do not mind you do not think i presume no i do not mind said the girl smiling in my country we do not think it a terrible offence to talk to a girl at a gardenparty but you said there was something of importance you wanted to say to me you mean the expedition yes said kalonay we start this evening the girl raised her head slightly and stared past him at the burning white walls and the burning blue sky that lay outside the circle of shadow in which they sat this evening she repeated to herself we reach there in two days kalonay continued and then we then we go on until we enter the capital the girls head was bent and she looked at her hands as they lay in her lap and frowned at them they seemed so white and pretty and useless yes you go on she repeated and we stay here you are a man and able to go on i know what that means and you like it she added with a glance of mingled admiration and fear you are glad to fight and to risk death and to lead men on to kill other men kalonay drew lines in the sand with his ridingwhip and did not raise his head i suppose it is because you are fighting for your home the girl continued and to set your country free and that you can live with your own people again and because it is a holy war that must be it now that it is really come i see it all differently i see things i had not thought about before they frighten me she said the prince raised his head and faced the girl clasping the end of his whip nervously in his hand if we should win the island for the king he said i believe it will make a great change in me i shall be able to go freely then to my home as you say to live there always to give up the life i have led on the continent it has been a foolish life a dogs life and i have no one to blame for it but myself i made it worse than it need to have been but if we win i have promised myself that i will not return to it and if we fall i shall not return to it for the reason that i shall have been killed i shall have much power if we win when i say much power i mean much power in messina in that little corner of the world and i wish to use it worthily and well i am afraid i should not have thought of it he went on naively as though he were trying to be quite fair had not father paul pointed out to me what i should do how i could raise the people and stop the abuses which made them drive us from the island the people must be taxed less heavily and the money must be spent for them and not for us on roads and harbors and schools not at the palace on banquets and fetes these are father pauls ideas not mine but now i make them mine he rose and paced the length of the little arbor his hands clasped behind him and his eyes bent on the ground yes that is what i mean to do he said that is the way i mean to live and if we fail i mean to be among those who are to die on the fortifications of the capital so that with me the kalonay family will end and end fighting for the king as many of my people have done before me there is no other way for me there shall be no more idleness nor exile i must either live on to help my people or i must die with them he stopped in his walk and regarded the girl closely you may be thinking it is easy for him to promise this it is easy to speak of what one will do i know that i know that i can point back at nothing i have done that gives me any right to ask you to believe me now but i do ask it for if you believe me believe what i say it makes it easier for me to tell you why after this i must live worthily but you know why you must know it is not possible that you do not know he sat down beside her on the bench leaning forward and crushing his hands together on his knee it is because i love you because i love you so that everything which is not worthy is hateful to me myself most of all it is the only thing that counts i used to think i knew what love meant i used to think love was a selfish thing that needed love in return that it must be fed on love to live that it needed vows and tender speeches and caresses or it would die i know now that when one truly cares he does not ask whether the other cares or not it is what one gives that counts not what one receives you have given me nothing nothing not a word nor a look yet since i have known you i have been more madly happy in just knowing that you live than i would have been had any other woman in all the world thrown herself into my arms and said she loved me above all other men i am not fit to tell you this but tonight i go to try myself either never to see you again or to come back perhaps more worthy to love you think of this when i am gone do not speak to me now i may have made you hate me for speaking so or i may have made you pity me so let me go not knowing just loving you worshipping you and holding you apart and above all other people i go to fight for you do you understand not for our church not for my people but for you to live or die for you and i ask nothing from you but that you will let me love you always the prince bent and catching up miss carsons ridinggloves that lay beside her on the bench kissed them again and again and then rising quickly walked out of the arbor into the white sunshine and without turning mounted his pony and galloped across the burning desert in the direction of tangier archie gordon had not been invited to join the excursion into the country nor would he have accepted it for he wished to be by himself that he might review the situation and consider what lay before him he sat with his long legs dangling over the broad rampart which overlooks the harbor of tangier he was whistling meditatively to himself and beating an accompaniment to the tune with his heels at intervals he ceased whistling while he placed a cigar between his teeth and pulled upon it thoughtfully resuming his tune again at the point where it had been interrupted below him the waves ran up lazily on the level beach and sank again dragging the long seaweed with them as they swept against the sharp rocks and exposed them for an instant naked and glistening in the sun on either side of him the town stretched to meet the low white sandhills in a crescent of low white houses pierced by green minarets and royal palms a warm sun had sent the world to sleep at midday and an enforced peace hung over the glaring white town and the sparkling blue sea gordon blinked at the glare but his eyes showed no signs of drowsiness they were on the contrary awake to all that passed on the high road behind him and on the sandy beach at his feet while at the same time his mind was busily occupied in reviewing what had occurred the day before and in adjusting new conditions at the hotel he had found that the situation was becoming too complicated and that it was impossible to feel sure of the truth of anything or of the sincerity of anyone since the luncheon hour the day before he had become a fellowconspirator with men who were as objectionable to him in every way as he knew he was obnoxious to them but they had been forced to accept him because so they supposed he had them at the mercy of his own pleasure he knew their secret and in the legitimate pursuit of his profession he could if he chose inform the island of messina with the rest of the world of their intention toward it and bring their expedition to an end though he had chosen as a reward for his silence to become one of themselves only the countess zara had guessed the truth that it was gordon himself who was at their mercy and that so long as the american girl persisted in casting her fortunes with them her old young friend was only too eager to make any arrangement with them that would keep him at her side it was a perplexing position and gordon turned it over and over in his mind had it not been that miss carson had a part in it he would have enjoyed the adventure as an adventure keenly he had no objections to fighting on the side of rascals or against rascals he objected to them only in the calmer moments of private life and as he was of course ignorant that the expedition was only a makebelieve he felt a certain respect for his fellowconspirators as men who were willing to stake their lives for a chance of better fortune but that their bravery was of the kind which would make them hesitate to rob and deceive a helpless girl he very much doubted for he knew that even the bravest of warriors on their way to battle will requisition a herd of cattle or stop to loot a temple the day before gordon had witnessed the brief ceremony which attended the presentation of the young noblemen from paris who had volunteered for the expedition in all good faith and he reviewed it and analyzed it as he sat smoking on the ramparts it had been an impressive ceremony in spite of the fact that so few had taken part in it but the earnestness of the visitors and the enthusiasm of kalonay and the priest had made up for the lack of numbers the scene had appealed to him as one of the most dramatic he had witnessed in the pursuit of a calling in which looking on at real dramas was the most frequent duty and he had enjoyed the strange mixture of ancient terms of address and titles with the modern manners of the men themselves it had interested him to watch baron barrat bring out the ancient crown and jewelled sceptre which had been the regalia of all the kings of messina since the crusades and spread them out upon a wicker teatable from which niccolas had just removed some empty coffeecups half filled with the ends of cigarettes some yellowbacked novels and a copy of the paris figaro it was also interesting to him to note how the sight of the little heirapparent affected both the peasants from the mountains and the young nobles from the club royale the former fell upon their knees with the tears rolling down the furrows in their tanned cheeks while the little wiseeyed boy stood clinging to his nurses skirts with one hand and to his fathers finger with the other and nodded his head at them gravely like a toy mandarin then the king had addressed them in a dignified earnest and almost eloquent speech and had promised much and prophesied the best of fortunes and then at the last had turned suddenly toward miss carson where she stood in the background between her mother and father paul every cause has its joan of arc or its maria theresa he cried looking steadfastly at miss carson no cause has succeeded without some good woman to aid it to help us my friends we have a daughter of the people as was joan of arc and a queen as was maria theresa for she comes from that country where every woman is a queen in her own right and where the love of liberty is inherent the king took a quick step backward and taking miss carsons hand drew her forward beside him and placed her facing his audience while the girl made vain efforts to withdraw her hand this is she he said earnestly the true daughter of the church who has made it possible for us to return to our own again it is due to her that the king of messina shall sit once more on his throne it is through her generosity alone that the churches will rise from their ruins and that you will once again hear the angelus ring across the fields at sunset remember her my friends and cousins pray for her as a saint upon earth and fight gloriously to help her to success gordon had restrained himself with difficulty while this scene was being enacted he could not bear the thought of the king touching the girls hand he struggled to prevent himself from crying out at the false position into which he had dragged her and yet there was something so admirably sincere in the kings words something so courteous and manly that it robbed his words of all the theatrical effect they held and his tribute to the girl filled even gordon with an emotion which on the part of the young nobles found expression in cheer upon cheer gordon recalled these cheers and the looks of wondering admiration which had been turned upon miss carson and he grew so hot at the recollection that he struck the wall beside him savagely with his clinched fist and damned the obstinacy of his young and beautiful friend with a sincerity and vigor that was the highest expression of his interest in her behalf he threw his cigar into the rampart at his feet and dropped back into the high road it was deserted at the time except for the presence of a tall slightly built stranger who advanced toward him from the city gates the man was dressed in garments of european fashion and carried himself like a soldier and gordon put him down at a glance as one of the volunteers from paris the stranger was walking leisurely stopping to gaze at the feluccas in the bay and then turning to look up at the fortress on the hill he seemed to have no purpose in his walk except the interest of a tourist and as he drew up even with gordon he raised his helmet politely and greeting him in english asked if he were on the right road to the bashaws palace gordon pointed to where the white walls of the palace rose above the other white walls about it that is it he said all the roads lead to it you keep going up hill thank you said the stranger i see i have taken a long way he put his white umbrella in the sand and removing his helmet mopped his forehead with his handkerchief it is a curious old town tangier he said affably but too many hills is it not so algiers i like better there is more life yes algiers is almost as good as the boulevards gordon assented if you like the boulevards i prefer this place because it is unspoiled but as you say there is not much to do here the strangers eyes fell upon the hotel grande bretagne which stood a quarter of a mile away from them on the beach that is the hotel bretagne is it not he asked gordon answered him with a nod the king louis of messina so the chasseur at the hotel tells me is stopping there en suite the stranger added with an interrogative air of one who volunteers an interesting fact and who asks if it is true at the same moment i cant say im sure gordon replied i only arrived here yesterday the stranger bowed his head in recognition of this piece of personal information and putting on his helmet picked up his umbrella as though to continue his stroll as he did so his eyes wandered over the harbor and were arrested with apparent interest by the yacht which lay a conspicuous object on the blue water he pointed at it with his umbrella one of your english menofwar is in the harbor i see she is very pretty but not large not so large as many he said gordon turned his head obligingly and gazed at the yacht with polite interest is that a manofwar i thought it was a yacht he said im not familiar with the english warvessels i am an american ah indeed commented the affable stranger i am french myself but i think she is a manofwar i saw her guns when i passed on the steamer from gibraltar gordon knew that the steamer did not pass within half a mile of where the yacht lay at anchor but he considered it might be possible to see her decks with the aid of a glass you may be right he answered indifferently as he turned his eyes from the boat he saw a woman dressed in white and carrying a parasol leave the gardens of the hotel bretagne and come toward them along the beach the frenchman following the direction of his eyes saw her also and regarded her instantly with such evident concern that gordon who had recognized her even at that distance as the countess zara felt assured that his inquisitor held as he had already suspected more than a tourists interest in tangier well i will wish you a goodmorning said the frenchman hurriedly goodmorning gordon replied and taking a cigar from his case he seated himself again upon the rampart as he walked away the stranger glanced back over his shoulder but gordon was apparently absorbed in watching the waves below him and had lost all interest in his chance acquaintance but he watched both the woman and the frenchman as they advanced slowly from opposite directions and drew nearer together and he was not altogether surprised when the in man was within twenty feet of her to see her start and stand still and then with the indecision of a hunted animal move uncertainly and then turn and run in the direction of the hotel something the man apparently called after her caused her to stop and gordon observed them now with undisguised interest as they stood conversing together oblivious of the conspicuous mark they made on the broad white beach under the brilliant sun i wonder what hes up to now gordon mused he was trying to pump me thats evident and he certainly recognized the lady and she apparently did not want to recognize him i wonder if he is a rejected lover or another conspirator this is a most amusing place nothing but plots and counterplots and hello he exclaimed aloud the man had moved quickly past madame zara and had started toward the hotel and zara had held out her hand to him as though to entreat him to remain but he did not stop and she had taken a few uncertain steps after him and had then much to the americans dismay fallen limply on her back on the soft sand she was not a hundred yards distant from where he sat and in an instant he had slipped from the wall and dropped on his hands and knees on the beach below when gordon reached her the frenchman had returned and was supporting her head on his knee and covering her head with her parasol the lady has fainted he exclaimed eagerly his manner was no longer one of idle indolence he was wide awake now and visibly excited the sun has been too much for her he said it is most dangerous walking about at this time of day gordon ran down the beach and scooped up some water in his helmet and dipping his handkerchief in it bathed her temples and cheek he had time to note that she was a very beautiful girl and the pallor of her face gave it a touch of gentleness that he had not seen there before i will go to the hotel and bring assistance said the stranger uneasily as the woman showed signs of regaining consciousness no said gordon youll stay where you are and shade her with her umbrella shell be all right in a minute the girl opened her eyes and looking up saw gordon bending over her she regarded him for a moment and made an effort to rise and in her endeavor to do so her eyes met those of the frenchman and with a sharp moan she shut them again and threw herself from gordons knee to the sand give me that umbrella said gordon and go stand over there out of the way the man rose from his knee without showing any resentment and walked some little distance away where he stood with his arms folded looking out to sea he seemed much too occupied with something of personal interest to concern himself with a womans faintingspell the girl lifted herself slowly to her elbow and then before gordon could assist her rose with a quick graceful movement and stood erect upon her feet she placed a detaining hand for an instant on the americans arm thank you very much she said i am afraid i have been imprudent in going out into the sun her eyes were fixed upon the frenchman who stood moodily staring at the sea and tearing one of his fingernails with his teeth he seemed utterly oblivious of their presence the girl held out her hand for the parasol she had dropped and took it from gordon with a bow may i walk back with you to your hotel he asked unless this gentleman thank you the girl said in tones which the frenchman could have easily overheard had he been listening i am quite able to go alone now it is only a step she was still regarding the frenchman closely but as he was obviously unconscious of them she moved so that gordon hid her from him and in an entirely different voice she said speaking rapidly you are mr gordon the american who joined us last night that man is a spy from messina he is renauld the commanderinchief of their army he must be gotten away from here at once it is a matter for a man to attend to will you do it how do you know this gordon asked how do you know he is general renauld i want to be certain the girl tossed her head impatiently he was pointed out to me at messina i saw him there in command at a review he has just spoken to me that was what frightened me into that faintingspell i didnt think i was so weak she said shaking her head he offered me a bribe to inform him of our plans i tell you he is a spy thats all right said gordon reassuringly you go back to the hotel now and send those guards here on a run ill make a charge against him and have him locked up until after we sail tonight hurry please ill stay here gordon felt a pleasurable glow of excitement it was his nature to throw himself into everything he did and to at once become a partisan it was a quality which made his writings attractive to the reader and an object of concern to his editor at the very word spy and at this first hint of opposition to the cause in which he had but just enlisted he thrilled as though it had always been his own and he regarded the frenchman with a personal dislike as sudden as it was unfounded the frenchman had turned and was walking in the direction of the city gate his eyes were bent on the sandy beach which stretched before him and he made his way utterly unmindful of the waves that stole up to his feet and left little pools of water in his path gordon beckoned impatiently to the two soldiers who came running toward him at the hotel and moved forward to meet them the sooner he took one of them by the wrist and pointed with his other hand at the retreating figure of the frenchman that man he said is one of the kings enemies the king is in danger while that man is here your duty is to protect the king so he gives this foreigner into your charge the soldier nodded his head in assent the king himself sent us he replied you will place him in the civil prison gordon continued until the king is safe on his yacht and you will not allow him to send for the french consulgeneral if he sees the consulgeneral he will tell him a great many lies about you and a great warship will come and your bashaw will be forced to pay the foreigners much money i will go with you and tell this man in his own tongue what you are going to do with him they walked hurriedly after the frenchman and when they had overtaken him gordon halted and bowed one moment please he said these soldiers have an order for your arrest i speak the language and if you have anything to say to them i will interpret for you the frenchman stared from gordon to the guards and then laughed incredulously but with no great confidence he had much to say but he demanded to know first why he should be arrested the lady you insulted gordon answered gravely happened unfortunately for you to be one of the kings guests she has complained to him and he has sent these soldiers to put you where you cannot trouble her again you see sir you cannot annoy women with impunity even in this barbarous country insult her i did not insult her the man retorted that is not the reason i am arrested you annoyed her so much that she fainted i saw you said gordon backing away with the evident purpose of abandoning the foreigner to his guards she has lied the man cried either to the king or to me i do not know which but i am here to find out that is why i came to tangier and i intend to learn the truth youve begun rather badly gordon answered as he still retreated in the civil prison your field of investigation will be limited the frenchman took a hasty step toward him shrugging off the hand one of the soldiers had placed on his shoulder are you the prince kalonay sir he demanded but surely not he added no i am not the prince gordon answered i bid you goodmorning sir then you are on the other side the man called after him eagerly with a tone of great relief i have been right from the very first i see it plainly it is a double plot and you are one of that womans dupes listen to me i beg of you listen to me i have a story to tell gordon paused and looked back at the man over his shoulder doubtfully its like the arabian nights he said with a puzzled smile there was once a rich merchant of bagdad and the sultan was going to execute him but they put off the execution until he could tell them the story of the beautiful countess and the french envoy i am sorry he added shaking his head but i cannot listen now i must not be seen talking to you at all and everyone can see us here they were as conspicuous figures on the flat surface of the beach as two palms in a desert and gordon was most anxious to escape for he was conscious that he could be observed from every point in the town a hundred yards away on the terrace of the hotel he saw the king madame zara barrat and erhaupt standing together watching them if the american leaves him now we are safe the king was saying he spoke in a whisper as though he feared that even at that distance gordon and the frenchman could overhear his words but if he remains with him he will find out the truth and that means ruin he will ruin us look he is coming this way zara answered he is leaving him the danger is past the frenchman raised his eyes and saw the four figures grouped closely together on the terrace see what did i tell you he cried she is with the king now it is a plot within a plot and i believe you know it he added furiously you are one of these brave blackmailers yourself that is why you will not let me speak blackmailers said gordon confound your impudence what the devil do you mean by that but the frenchman was staring angrily at the distant group on the terrace and gordon turned his eyes in the same direction something he saw in the strained and eager attitude of the four conspirators moved him to a sudden determination that will do you must go he commanded pointing with his arm toward the city gate and before the frenchman could reply he gave an order to the guards and they seized the foreigner roughly by either arm and hurried him away thank god exclaimed the king piously they have separated and the boy thinks he is rendering us great service well and so he is the young fool the group on the piazza remained motionless watching gordon as he leisurely lit a cigar and stood looking out at the harbor until the frenchman had disappeared inside the city wall then he turned and walked slowly after him i do not like that i do not like his following him said barrat suspiciously that is nothing answered the king he is going to play the spy and see that the man is safely in jail then he will return and report to us we must congratulate him warmly he follows at a discreet distance you observe and keeps himself well out of sight the boy knows better than to compromise himself by being seen in conversation with the man of course if renauld is set free we must say we had no part in his arrest that the american made the arrest on his own authority what a convenient tool the young man is why his coming really frightened us at first and now now we make a catspaw of him the king laughed merrily we undervalue ourselves sometimes do we not he is a nice boy said zara i feel rather sorry for him he looked so anxious and distressed when i was so silly as to faint on the beach just now he handled me as tenderly as a woman would have done not that women have generally handled me tenderly she added i was thinking the simile was rather misplaced said the king gordon passed the city wall and heard the gates swing to behind him the frenchman and his two captors were just ahead toiling heavily up the steep and narrow street gordon threw his cigar from him and ran leaping over the huge cobbles to the frenchmans side and touched him on the shoulder we are out of sight of the hotel now general he said he pointed to the dark cool recesses of a coffeeshop and held back the rug that hung before it come in here he said and tell me that story iv baron barrat was suspicious by education his experience of life and his own conduct had tended to render him so and accordingly when three hours after he had seen gordon apparently commit the french officer to jail he found them leaving a cafe in the most friendly and amicable spirit he wasted no time in investigation but hurried at once to warn the king what we feared would happen has happened he said the frenchman has told gordon that zara and kalonay sold the secret of the expedition and gordon will be coming here to warn you of it now what are you going to do we must act quickly i shall refuse to believe the frenchman of course said the king i shall ask zara in his presence to answer his charges and she will tell him he lies that is all there will be of it what does it matter what he says we sail at midnight we can keep him quiet until then if he is troublesome i can call for help from this room and the servants of the hotel and the guards will rush in and find us struggling together we will charge him with an attempt at assassination and this time he surely will go to jail by tomorrow morning we shall be many miles at sea but he can cable to messina by way of gibraltar and head us off objected barrat what can he cable demanded the king nothing the people of the republic do not already know it is our friends here that must not find us out that is the main thing thank heaven he exclaimed kalonay and paul are out of the way and those crazy boys from paris we will settle it here among ourselves in five minutes and the american asked zara he knows he will come with him suppose he believes suppose he believes that kalonay and i have sold you out but suspects that you know it the american can go to the devil said the king confound him and his insolence ill have him in the prison too if he interferes or erhaupt can pick a quarrel with him here and fight it out behind the sandhills before the others get back from their picnic he has done as much for me before zara stood up she was trembling slightly and she glanced fearfully from erhaupt to the king you will not do that she said and why not madame demanded louis because it will be murder zara whispered he will murder him as he did that boy in the park at pesth what does the woman mean growled the german is she mad send her to her room louis you know what i mean zara answered her voice rising in her excitement you fired before they gave the word i know you did oh louis she cried you never warned me it might come to this i am afraid i am afraid to meet that man she gave a sudden cry and kalonay she held out her hands appealingly indeed she cried do not let kalonay question me silence commanded the king you are acting like a fool he advanced toward her and clasped her wrist firmly in his hand no nerves now he said ill not have it you shall meet kalonay and you shall swear that he is in the plot against me if you fail us now we are ruined as it is we are sure to lose the bribe from the republic but we may still get miss carsons money if you play your part it is your word and the word of the frenchman against kalonays and we have the paper signed by you for kalonay as evidence have you got it with you zara bowed her head it is always with me she answered good said the king it will be a difficult chance but if you stand to your story and we pretend to believe you the others may believe you too but i cannot zara cried i know i cannot i tell you if you put me face to face with kalonay i shall fail you i shall break down they will see that i am lying send me away send me away before they come tell them i saw the frenchman and suspected i had been found out and that i have gone away tell them you dont know where i am i believe shes right erhaupt said she will do us more harm than good let her go to her room and wait there she will remain where she is said the king sternly and she will keep her courage and her wits about her or he was interrupted by an exclamation from barrat whatever you mean to do you must do it at once he said grimly he was standing at the window which overlooked the beach here they come now he continued the american has taken no chances he is bringing an audience with him the king and erhaupt ran to the window and peered over barrats shoulder advancing toward them along the beach some on foot and some on horseback were all the members of the expedition those who had been of the ridingparty and those who had remained in tangier gordon and the frenchman renauld were far in the lead walking by themselves and speaking earnestly together father paul was walking with mrs carson and her daughter and kalonay was riding with two of the volunteers the count de rouen and prince henri of poitiers when the king and erhaupt turned from the window the countess zara had disappeared it is better so said erhaupt she was so badly frightened she would have told the truth the king stood leaning on the back of a large armchair well the moment has come it is our last chance he said send for the crown prince baron i shall be discovered in the act of taking a tender farewell of my son barrat made an eager gesture of dissent i would not do that he cried if we are to make charges against the jackal do not have the boy present the boy must not hear them you know how kalonay worships the child and it would enrage him more to be exposed before the prince than before all the rest of the world he will be hard enough to handle without that dont try him too far you are absurd barrat exclaimed the king the boy wont understand what is said no but the jackal will barrat returned you dont understand him louis he is like a woman he has sentiment and feelings and when we all turn on him he will act like a madman keep the boy out of his sight i tell you its the only thing he cares for in the world he has been a better father to him than you ever have been that was quite natural that was because it was his duty said the king calmly a kalonay has always been the protector and tutor of the heirapparent if this one chooses to give his heart with his service that is not my concern why confound them they all think more of the child than they do of me that is why i need him by me now barrat shook his head i tell you it will make trouble he persisted kalonay will not stand it he and the child are more like comrades than a tutor and his pupil why kalonay would rather sit with the boy in the champselysees and point out the people as they go by than drive at the side of the prettiest woman in paris he always treats him as though he saw the invisible crown upon his head he will throw over any of us to stay in the nursery and play tin soldiers with him and when he was ill barrat nodded his head significantly you remember that will do said the king we have no time to consider the finer feelings of the jackal he is to be sacrificed and that is all there is of it the presence of the child may make him more unmanageable but it will certainly make it easier for me so go bring the boy here as i bid you barrat left the room and returned immediately followed by the crown prince and his nurse the prince was a dark handsome little fellow of four years his mother had died when he was born and he had never played with children of his own age and his face was absurdly wise and wistful but it lighted with a sweet and grateful smile when anyone showed him kindness or sought to arouse his interest to the crown prince kalonay was an awful and wonderful being he was the one person who could make him laugh out of pure happiness and for no reason as a child should laugh and people who had seen them together asked which of the princes was the older of the two when the child entered the room clinging to barrats finger he carried in his other hand a wooden spade and bucket still damp with sand and he was dressed in a shabby blue sailor suit which left his little legs bare and exposed the scratches and bruises of many falls a few moments later when the conspirators entered the kings salon preceded by erhaupt they found the boy standing by his fathers knee the king had his hand upon the childs head and had been interrupted apparently in a discourse on the dignity of kingship for the royal crown of messina had been brought out and stood beside him on the table and his other hand rested on it reverently it was an effective tableau and the visitors observed it with varying emotions but with silence the king rose taking his sons hand in his and bowed looking inquiringly from barrat to the prince kalonay to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit he asked was it discreet of you to come together in this way but you are most welcome place chairs for the ladies barrat kalonay glanced at the others and they nodded to him as though to make him their spokesman he pointed at gordon with his cap we are here on the invitation of this gentleman your majesty he said he took it upon himself to send after those of us who had gone into the country and came in person for the others who remained in town he tells us he has news of the greatest importance to communicate which he cannot disclose except to you and in the presence of all of those who are to take part in the expedition we decided to accompany him here as he asked us and to leave it to your majesty to say whether or not you wished us to remain kalonay smiled in apology at the king and the king answered him with a smile the procedure is perhaps unconventional the king said but in america they move quickly no doubt our young companion has acted as he thought was for the best if he has taken a liberty the nature of his news will probably excuse him perhaps mr gordon he added turning to the american you had better first tell me what this discovery is and i will decide whether it is best to discuss it in open council gordon did not appear to be the least disturbed by the criticism kalonay and the king had passed upon his conduct he only smiled pleasantly when the king had finished speaking and showed no inclination to accept a private audience what i have to say your majesty he began is this i have learned that all the secrets of your expedition have been sold to the republic of messina one of those now present in this room is charged with having sold them shall i go on he asked or do you still think it advisable for anyone to leave the room he paused and glanced from the king to the double row of conspirators who were standing together in a close semicircle facing the king and himself the instant he ceased speaking there rose from their ranks an outburst of consternation of anger and of indignant denial the kings spirits rose within him at the sound although he frowned and made a gesture as though to command silence mr gordon this is a serious charge you make he said smiling grimly one that may cost you a great deal it might cost you your life perhaps he paused significantly and there was a second outburst this time from the younger men which came so suddenly that it was as though louis had played upon certain chords on a keyboard and the sounds he wanted had answered to his touch pardon me that is not the question said gordon that i make charges or run risks in making charges is not important that your expedition has failed before it has even started is however of great importance at least so it sees to me there was a movement in the circle and father paul pushed his way forward from his place beside miss carsons chair he was so greatly moved that when he spoke his voice was harsh and broken what is your authority for saying we have failed he demanded gordon bowed gravely and turned and pointed to the frenchman this gentleman he said is general renauld commanderinchief of the army of messina he is my authority he knows all that you mean to do if he knows it it is likely is it not that his army and the president of the republic know it also and that when we attempt to land they will be waiting for us the king silenced the second outburst that followed this by rising and holding up his hand silence i believe i can explain he said he was smiling and his bearing was easy and so full of assurance that the exclamations and whispers died away on the instant i am afraid i see what has happened the king said but there need be no cause for alarm this gentleman is as mr gordon says the commanderinchief of the messinian army and it is true he suspected that an armed force would invade the island it is not strange that he should have suspected it and it needed no traitor to enlighten him the visit of father paul and the prince kalonay in the yacht and their speeches inciting the people to rebellion would have warned the government that an expedition might soon follow the return of our yacht to this place has no doubt been made known in messina through the public press and general renauld followed the yacht here to learn what he could of our plans of our intended movements he came here to spy on us and as a spy i ordered mr gordon to arrest him this morning on any charge he pleased and to place him out of our way until after tonight when we should have sailed i chose mr gordon to undertake this service because he happened to speak the language of the country and it was necessary to deal directly with the local authorities without the intervention of an outsider what has happened is only too evident the spy who when he came here only suspected now as mr gordon says knows the truth and he could have learned it only from one person to whom he has no doubt paid a pretty price for the information the king took a step forward and pointed with his hand at the american i gave that man into your keeping sir he cried but i had you watched instead of placing him in jail you took him to a cafe and remained there with him for three hours and from that cafe you came directly here to this room if he knows the truth he learned it in that cafe and he learned it from you there was a ring of such earnestness and sincerity in the kings speech and he delivered it with such indignation and bitter contempt that a shout of relief of approbation and conviction went up from his hearers and fell as quickly on the words as the applause of an audience drowns out the last note of a great burst of song barrat in the excess of his relief turned his back sharply on the king glancing sideways at erhaupt and shaking his head in speechless admiration he is wonderful simply wonderful erhaupt muttered he would have made a great actor or a great diplomat he is wasted as a king whispered barrat there was a menacing movement on the part of the younger men toward gordon and general renauld which the king noted but which he made no effort to check neither gordon nor general renauld gave any sign that they observed it the american was busily engaged in searching his pockets and from one of these he produced two pieces of paper which he held up above his head so that those in the room might see them one moment please he began and then waited until the tumult in the room had ceased again i must point out to you he said in brisk businesslike tones that we are digressing the important thing is not who did or did not sell out the expedition but that it is in danger of failing altogether what his majesty says is in part correct i did not take this gentleman to jail i did take him to a cafe and there he told me much more concerning the expedition than i had learned from those directly interested his information he told me had been sold to the republic by one who visited the island and who claimed to act for one other i appreciated the importance of what he said and i also guessed that my word and his unsupported might be doubted as you have just doubted it so i took the liberty of verifying what general renauld told me by cabling to the president of messina there was a shout of consternation at these words but gordons manner was so confident and the audacity of his admission so surprised his hearers that they were silent again immediately and waited with breathless interest while gordon unfolded one of the pieces of paper this is a copy of the cablegram i sent the president he said and to which with his permission i signed general renaulds name it is as follows the president the palace messina they will not believe you are fully informed cable at once the exact hour when they will leave tangier at what hour they expect to land at what place they expect to land what sum you have promised to pay for this information and the names of those to whom it is to be paid renauld gordon lowered the paper is that quite clear he asked do you follow me i have invited the enemy himself to inform you of your plans and to tell you who has betrayed them his answer which was received a half hour ago removes all suspicion from any save those he names general renauld and myself cease to be of the least consequence in the matter we are only messengers it is the president of messina who will speak to you now if you still doubt that the secret of your expedition is known to the president you will have to doubt him the king sprang quickly to his feet and struck the arm of his chair sharply with his open hand i shall not permit that message to be read he said if we have a traitor here he is a traitor against me and i shall deal with him as i see fit in private there was a murmur of disappointment and of disapproval even and the king again struck the arm of his chair for silence kalonay advanced toward him shaking his head and holding out his hands in protest your majesty i beseech you he began this concerns us all he cried it is too evident that we have been betrayed but it is not fair to any of us that we should all lie under suspicion as we must unless it is told who has been guilty of this infamy i beg your majesty to reconsider there is no one in this room who is not in our secret and whoever has betrayed us must be with us here and now i who have an interest second only to your own ask that that cablegram be read there was a murmur of approbation from the conspirators and exclamations of approval and entreaty miss carson in her excitement had risen to her feet and was standing holding her mothers hand the king glanced uncertainly at kalonay and then turned to barrat and erhaupt as if in doubt gordons eyes were fixed for a moment on kalonay with a strange and puzzled expression then he gave a short sigh of relief and turning quickly searched the faces of those around him what he saw seemed to confirm him in his purpose for he folded the paper and placed it in his pocket his majesty is right he said i shall not read this kalonay and father paul turned upon him angrily you have no choice in the matter sir kalonay cried it has passed entirely out of your hands i beg your majesty that the cablegram be read the priest demanded in a voice that held less the tone of a request than of a command i shall not read it persisted gordon because the person chiefly concerned is not present that is all the more reason for reading it said kalonay your majesty must reconsider the king whispered to barrat and the others waited in silence that expressed their interest more clearly than a chorus of questions would have done it shall be as you ask the king said at last you may read the message mr gordon gordon opened the paper and looked at it for some seconds of time with a grave and perplexed expression and then with a short breath as one who takes a plunge read it aloud this is it he said to general renauld cable office tangier they leave tangier tuesday at midnight they land at daybreak thursday morning on the south beach below the old breakwater the secret of the expedition was sold us for three hundred thousand francs by the countess zara and the prince kalonay gordon stuck the paper in his pocket and crossing to kalonay held out his hand with a smile i dont believe it of course he said but you would have it kalonay neither saw the gesture nor heard the words he was turning in bewilderment from the king to father paul and he laughed uncertainly what nonsense is this he demanded whose sorry trick is this the lie is not even ingenious general renauld had not spoken since he had entered the room but now he advanced in front of kalonay and faced him with a threatening gesture the president of messina does not lie sir he said sternly i myself saw the countess zara write out that paper which i and others signed and in which we agreed to pay to her and to you the money you asked for betraying your king father paul pressed his hand heavily on kalonays shoulder do not answer him he commanded gordon had moved to kalonays other side and the three men had unconsciously assumed an attitude of defence and stood back to back in a little group facing the angry circle that encompassed them the priest raised his arm to command a hearing where is madame zara he cried ah where indeed echoed the king sinking back into his chair she has fled it is all too evident now she has betrayed us and she has fled but on his words as if in answer to the priests summons the curtains that hid the door into the kings private room were pulled to one side and madame zara appeared between them glancing fearfully at the excited crowd before her as she stood hesitating on the threshold she swayed slightly and clutched the curtains for a moment as though for support the priest advanced and led her to the centre of the room she held a folded paper in her hand which she gave to him in silence you have heard what has passed he asked with a toss of his head toward the heavy curtains the woman raised her head and bowed the priest unfolded the paper am i to read this he asked the woman bowed again there was silence in the room while the priests eyes ran quickly over the paper he crushed it in his hand it is as general renauld says he exclaimed in this the republic of messina agrees to pay the countess zara and the prince kalonay three hundred thousand francs if the expedition is withdrawn after it has made a pretence of landing on the shores of messina he took a step forward madame zara he cried in a tone of warning do you pretend that the prince kalonay was your accomplice in this that he knew what you meant to do madame zara once more bowed her head no you must speak commanded the priest answer me zara hesitated in evident distress and glanced appealingly at the king but the expression on his face was one of grief and of unrelenting virtue i do she said at last in a low voice kalonay did know he thought the revolution would not succeed he thought it would fail and so and so and we needed money they made me i o my god i cannot i cannot she cried suddenly sinking on her knees and hiding her face with her hands kalonay stepped toward her and lifted her gently to her feet but when she looked and saw who it was that held her she gave a cry and pulled herself free she staggered and would have fallen had not gordon caught and held her by the arm the king rose from his chair and pointed at the shrinking figure of the woman stand aside from her he said sternly why should we pity her what pity has she shown for us for me she has robbed me of my inheritance but let her go she is a woman we cannot punish her her sins rest on her own head but you you he cried turning fiercely on kalonay his voice rising to a high and melancholy key you whom i have heaped with honors whom i have leaned upon as on the arm of a brother that you should have sold me for silver that you should have turned judas the crowd of volunteers bewildered by the rapid succession of events and confused and rendered desperate by the failure of their expedition caught up the word and pressing forward with a rush surrounded kalonay in an angry circle crying judas traitor and coward kalonay turned from side to side on some he smiled bitterly in silence and at others he broke out into swift and fierce denunciations but the men around him crowded closer and would not permit him to be heard he had turned upon them again challenging them to listen when there was an opening in the circle and the men stepped back and miss carson pushed her way among them and halted at kalonays side she did not look at him but at the men about him she was the only calm figure in the group and her calmness at such a crisis and her youth and the fineness and fearlessness of her beauty surprised them into a sudden quiet there was instantly a cry for order and the men stood curious and puzzled watching to see what she would do gentlemen she said in a clear grave voice gentlemen she repeated sharply as a few murmurs still greeted her if you are gentlemen let this lady speak she has not finished she crossed quickly and took the countess zara by the hand go on madame she urged gently do not be afraid you say they made you do it who made you do it you have told us a part of the truth now tell us the whole truth for a moment the girl seemed much the older of the two and as zara glanced up at her fearfully she smiled to reassure her and stroked the womans hand with her own who made you do it she repeated not the prince kalonay surely you cannot hope to make us believe that we trust him absolutely who was it then the king sprang forward with an oath his apathy and mock dignity had fallen from him like a mask his face was mottled and his vicious little eyes flashed with fear and anger erhaupt crowded close behind him crouching like a dog at his heels she has lied enough already the king cried we will not listen to her take her away yes let her go shouted erhaupt with a laugh if she had been a decent woman there was a quick parting in the group and the sound of a heavy blow as kalonay flung himself upon erhaupt and struck him in the face so that he staggered and fell at length upon the floor gordon stood over him his fingers twitching at his side stand up you bully he said and get out of this before we throw you out zaras face had turned a pitiful crimson but her eyes flashed and burned with resolve and indignation she stood erect and menacing like an angry goddess and more beautiful in her indignation than they had ever seen her now i shall tell them the truth she said sternly that man she cried pointing her finger at the king that man whom they call a king that man who would have sacrificed the only friend who serves him unselfishly is the man who sold your secret to the enemy it was he who made me do it he sent me to messina and while the priest and the prince kalonay were working in the south i sold them to the government at the capital barrat knew it erhaupt knew it the king himself planned it to get money he has robbed all of his own people he had meant to rob this young girl and he is so mean and pitiful a creature that to save himself he now tries to hide behind the skirts of a woman and to sacrifice her the woman who has given her soul to him and for this my god she cried her voice rising in an accent of agony and bitter contempt for this there was a grim and momentous silence in the room while zara turned and without waiting to learn what effect her words might have made her way swiftly through the crowd and passed on out of the room and on to the terrace beyond the king crouched back in his chair like a common criminal in the dock glancing fearfully from under his lowered eyebrows at the faces about him and on none did he see the least question of doubt but that zara had at last spoken the truth she lies the king muttered as though answering their unspoken thoughts the woman lies there was no movement from the men about him shame for him and grief and bitter disappointment for themselves showed on the face of each from outside a seabreeze caught up the sand of the beach and drove it whispering against the high windows and the beat of the waves upon the shores filled out and marked the silence of the room the prince kalonay stepped from the circle and stood for a moment before the king regarding him with an expression of grief and bitter irony the kings eyes rose insolently and faltered and sank for many years your majesty the prince said but so solemnly that it was as though he were a judge upon the bench or a priest speaking across an open grave the princes of my house have served the kings of yours in times of war they fought for the king in battle they beggared themselves for him in times of peace our women sold their jewels for the king our men gave him their lives and in all of these centuries the story of their loyalty of their devotion has had but one sequel and has met with but one reward ingratitude and selfishness and treachery you know how i have served you louis you know that i gave up my fortune and my home to go into exile with you and i did that gladly but i did more than that i did more than any king or any man has the right to expect of any other man i served your idle purposes so well that you yourself called me your jackal the only title your majesty has ever bestowed that was deserved there is no low thing nor no base thing that i have not done for you to serve your pleasures to gain you money i have sunken so low that all the royal blood in europe could not make me clean but there is a limit to what a man may do for his king and to the loyalty a king may have the right to demand and today and here with me the story of our devotion to your house ends and you go your way and i go mine and the last of my race breaks his sword and throws it at your feet and is done with you and yours forever even those in the room who held no sympathy in their hearts for the sentiment that had inspired the young man felt that at that moment and in their hearing he had renounced what was to him his religion and his faith and on the faces of all was the expression of a deep pity and concern their own adventure in the light of his grief and bitterness of spirit seemed selfish and little and they stood motionless in an awed and sorrowful silence the tense strain of the moment was broken suddenly by the advent on the scene of an actor who had in the rush of events been neglected and forgotten the little crown prince had stood clinging to his nurses skirts an uncomprehending spectator of what was going forward but he now advanced slowly feeling that the silence invited him to claim his fathers notice he halted beside the chair in which louis sat his head bent on his hands and made an effort to draw himself up to his fathers knee but the king pushed him down and hid his face from him the child turned irresolutely with a troubled countenance and looking up saw that the attention of all was fixed upon him at this discovery a sudden flood of shyness overtook him and he retreated hastily until his eyes fell on the prince kalonay standing alone with his own eyes turned resolutely away there was a breathless hush in the room as the child with a happy sigh ran to his former friend and comrade and reached up both his arms the tableau was a familiar one to those who knew them and meant only that the child asked to be lifted up and swung to the mans shoulder but following as it did on what had just passed the gesture and the attitude carried with them the significance of an appeal kalonay as though with a great effort lowered his eyes to the upturned face of the child below him but held himself back and stood stiffly erect a sharp shake of the head as though he argued with himself was the only sign he gave of the struggle that was going on within him at this second repulse the childs arms dropped to his side his lips quivered and he stood a lonely little figure glancing up at the circle of men about him and struggling to press back the tears that came creeping to his eyes kalonay regarded him steadfastly for a brief moment as though he saw him as a stranger searching his face with eyes as pitiful as the childs own and then with a sudden sharp cry the prince dropped on his knee and caught the child toward him crushing him against his heart and burying his face on his shoulder there was a shout of exultation from the nobles and an uttered prayer from the priest and in a moment the young men had crowded in around them struggling to be the first to kiss the childs hands and to ask pardon of the man who held him in his arms gentlemen kalonay cried his voice laughing through his tears we shall still sail for the island of messina they shall not say of us that we visited the sins of the father on a child i was weak my friends and i was credulous i thought i could break the tradition of centuries but our instincts are stronger than our pride and the house i have always served i shall serve to the last he swung the crown prince high upon his shoulder and held his other arm above his head you will help me place this child upon his throne he commanded and the room rang with cheers you will appeal to his people he cried do you not think they will rise to this standardbearer will they not rally to his call for he is a true prince my comrades who comes to them with no stain of wrong or treachery without a taint as untarnished as the white snow that lies summer and winter in the hollow of our hills and a child shall lead us and a child shall set them free to the yacht he shouted we will sail at once and while they wait for us to be betrayed into their hands at the north we shall be landing in the south and thousands will be hurrying to our standard his last words were lost in a tumult of cheers and cries and the young men poured out upon the terrace running toward the shore and filling the soft nightair with shouts of long live the prince regent long live our king as the room grew empty kalonay crossed it swiftly and advancing to miss carson took her hand his face was radiant with triumph and content he regarded her steadily for a moment as though he could not find words to tell his feelings you had faith in me he said at last can i ever make you understand how much that means to me when all had turned against me you trusted me you had faith in me in the kings jackal silence you must never say that again the girl commanded gently you have shown it to be the lie it always was we shall call you the defender of the faith now you are the guardian of a king she smiled at the little boy in his arms and made a slight courtesy to them both you have outgrown your old title she said you have a proud one now you will be the prince regent kalonay with the child in his arms and miss carson were standing quite alone general renauld had been led away guarded by a merry band of youngsters the king still crouched in his chair with barrat bowed behind him but pulling with philosophic calm on a cigarette and father paul and gordon were in close conversation with mrs carson at the farther end of the room the sun had set and the apartment was in semidarkness kalonay moved closer to miss carson and looked boldly into her eyes there is a prouder title than that of the regent he whispered will you ever give it me the girl started breathing quickly and turned her head aside making an effort to free her hand but kalonay held it closer in his own will you give it me he begged then the girl looked up at him smiling but with such confidence and love in her eyes that he read his answer though she shook her head as though to belie the truth her eyes had told him when you have done your work she said come to me or send for me and i shall come and give you my answer and whether you fail or succeed the answer will be the same kalonay stooped quickly and kissed her hand and when he raised his face his eyes were smiling with such happiness that the little child in his arms read it there and smiled too in sympathy and pressed his face closer against his comrades shoulder gordon at this moment moved across the room and bowed making a deep obeisance to the child might i be permitted he asked to kiss his royal highness i should like to boast of the fact later he explained the crown prince turned his sad wise eyes on him in silence and gravely extended a little hand you may kiss his highnesss hand said kalonay smiling gordon laughed and pressed the fingers in his own when you talk like that kalonay he said you make me feel like alice in the courtroom with the kings and queens around her a dozen times this afternoon ive felt like saying after all they are only a pack of cards kalonay shook his head and glanced toward miss carson for enlightenment i dont understand he said no you couldnt be expected to said gordon you have not been educated up to that it is the point of view he stuck out the middle finger of his hand and drove it three times deliberately into the side of the crown prince the child gasped and stared openmouthed at the friendly stranger and then catching the laugh in gordons eyes laughed with him now said gordon i shall say that i have dug the king of messina in the ribs that is even better than having kissed him god bless your royal highness he said bowing gravely you may find me disrespectful at times he added but then you must remember i am going to risk a valuable life for you at least its an extremely valuable one to me kalonay looked at gordon for a moment with serious consideration and then held out his hand you also had faith in me he said i thank you are you in earnest do you really wish to serve us i mean to stay by you until the boy is crowned said the american unless we separate on our several paths of glory where they will lead depends i imagine on how we have lived or on how we die kalonay added i am glad to hear you speak so if you wish i shall attach you to the person of the crown prince you shall be on the staff with the rank of colonel gordon made a low and sweeping bow rise sir archibald gordon he said i thank you he added we shall strive to please miss carson shook her head at him and sighed in protest will you always take everything as a joke archie she said my dear patty he answered the situation is much too serious to take in any other way they moved to the door and there the priest and mrs carson joined them but on the threshold kalonay stopped and looked for the first time since he had addressed him at the king he regarded him for some seconds sternly in silence and then pointed with his free hand at the crown of messina which still rested on the table at the kings elbow colonel gordon he said in a tone of assured authority i give the crown of messina into your keeping you will convey it with all proper regard for its dignity safely on board the yacht and then bring it at once to me when he had finished speaking the prince turned and without looking at the king passed on with the others across the terrace and disappeared in the direction of the shore where the launch lay waiting gordon crossed the room and picked up the crown from the table lifting it with both hands the king and barrat watching him in silence as he did so he hesitated and held it for a moment regarding it with much the same expression of awe and amusement that a man shows when he is permitted to hold a strange baby in his arms turning he saw the sinister eyes of the king and of barrat fastened upon him and he smiled awkwardly and in some embarrassment turned the crown about in his hands so that the jewels in its circle gleamed dully in the dim light of the room gordon raised the crown and balanced it on his fingertips regarding it severely and shaking his head there are very few of these left in the world now your majesty he said cheerfully and the number is getting smaller every year we have none at all in my country and i should think seeing they are so few that those who have them would take better care of them and try to keep them untarnished and brushed up and clean he turned his head and looked inquiringly at the king but louis made no sign that he heard him i have no desire you understand me continued gordon unabashed to take advantage of a man when he is down but the temptation to say i told you so seems almost impossible to resist what he asked i beg your pardon i thought you spoke but the king continued scornfully silent and only a contemptuous snort from barrat expressed his feelings gordon placed the crown carefully under his arm and then removed it quickly with a guilty look of dismay at its former owner and let it swing from his hand but this fashion of carrying it seemed also lacking in respect so he held it up again with both hands and glanced at the king in some perplexity there ought to be a sofacushion to go with this or something to carry it on he said in a grieved tone you see i am new at this sort of thing perhaps your majesty would kindly give me some expert information how do you generally carry it the kings eyes snapped open and shut again on my head he said grimly gordon laughed in great relief now do you know i like that he cried that shows spirit i am glad to see you take it so cheerfully well i must be going sir he
