not george washington an autobiographical novel with accents chapter james arrives i am margaret goodwin a week from today i shall be mrs james orlebar cloyster it is just three years since i first met james we made each others acquaintance at halfpast seven on the morning of the th of july in the middle of fermain bay about fifty yards from the shore fermain bay is in guernsey my home had been with my mother for many years at st martins in that island there we two lived our uneventful lives until fate brought one whom when first i set my eyes on him i knew i loved perhaps it is indiscreet of me to write that down but what does it matter it is for no ones reading but my own james my fianc is not peeping slyly over my shoulder as i write on the contrary my door is locked and james is i believe in the smokingroom of his hotel at st peters port at that time it had become my habit to begin my day by rising before breakfast and taking a swim in fermain bay which lies across the road in front of our cottage the practice i have since abandoned it was good for the complexion and generally healthy i had kept it up moreover because i had somehow cherished an unreasonable but persistent presentiment that some day somebody james as it turned out would cross the pathway of my maiden existence i told myself that i must be ready for him it would never do for him to arrive and find no one to meet him on the th of july i started off as usual i wore a short tweed skirt brown stockings my ankles were and are good a calico blouse and a red tamoshanter ponto barked at my heels in one hand i carried my blue twill bathinggown in the other a miniature alpenstock the sun had risen sufficiently to scatter the slight mist of the summer morning and a few flecked clouds were edged with a slender frame of red gold leisurely and with my presentiment strong upon me i descended the steep cliffside to the cave on the left of the bay where guarded by the faithful ponto i was accustomed to disrobe and soon afterwards i came out my dark hair over my shoulders and blue twill over a portion of the rest of me to climb out to the point of the projecting rocks so that i might dive gracefully and safely into the still blue water i was a good swimmer i reached the ridge on the opposite side of the bay without fatigue not changing from a powerful breaststroke i then sat for a while at the waters edge to rest and to drink in the thrilling glory of what my heart persisted in telling me was the morning of my life and then i saw him not distinctly for he was rowing a dinghy in my direction and consequently had his back to me in the stress of my emotions and an aggravation of modesty i dived again with an intensity like that of a captured conger i yearned to be hidden by the water i could watch him as i swam for strictly speaking he was in my way though a little farther out to sea than i intended to go as i drew near i noticed that he wore an odd garment like a dressinggown he had stopped rowing i turned upon my back for a moments rest and as i did so heard a cry i resumed my former attitude and brushed the salt water from my eyes the dinghy was wobbling unsteadily the dressinggown was in the bows and he my seagod was in the water only for a second i saw him then he sank how i blessed the muscular development of my arms i reached him as he came to the surface thats twice he remarked contemplatively as i seized him by the shoulders be brave i said excitedly i can save you i should be most awfully obliged he said do exactly as i tell you i say he remonstrated youre not going to drag me along by the roots of my hair are you the natural timidity of man is i find attractive i helped him to the boat and he climbed in i trod water clinging with one hand to the stern allow me he said bending down no thank you i replied not really thank you very much but i think i will stay where i am but you may get cramp by the way im really frightfully obliged to you for saving my life i mean a perfect stranger im afraid its quite spoiled your dip not at all i said politely did you get cramp a twinge it was awfully kind of you not at all then there was a rather awkward silence is this your first visit to guernsey i asked yes i arrived yesterday its a delightful place do you live here yes that white cottage you can just see through the trees i suppose i couldnt give you a tow anywhere no thank you very much i will swim back another constrained silence are you ever in london miss goodwin oh yes we generally go over in the winter mr cloyster really how jolly do you go to the theatre much oh yes we saw nearly everything last time we were over there was a third silence i saw a remark about the weather trembling on his lip and as i was beginning to feel the chill of the water a little i determined to put a temporary end to the conversation i think i will be swimming back now i said youre quite sure i cant give you a tow quite thanks perhaps you would care to come to breakfast with us mr cloyster i know my mother would be glad to see you it is very kind of you i should be delighted shall we meet on the beach i swam off to my cave to dress breakfast was a success for my mother was a philosopher she said very little but what she did say was magnificent in her youth she had moved in literary circles and now found her daily pleasure in the works of schopenhauer kant and other germans her lightest reading was sartor resartus and occasionally she would drop into ibsen and maeterlinck the asparagus of her philosophic banquet her chosen mode of thought far from leaving her inhuman or intolerant gave her a social distinction which i had inherited from her i could if i had wished it have attended with success the teadrinkings the tennisplayings and the clairandlemonade dances to which i was frequently invited but i always refused nature was my hostess nature which provided me with balmy zephyrs that were more comforting than buttered toast which set the race of the waves to the ridges of fermain where arose no shrill heated voice crying love forty which decked foliage in more splendid sheen than anything the local costumier could achieve and whose poplars swayed more rhythmically than the dancers of the assembly rooms the constraint which had been upon us during our former conversation vanished at breakfast we were both hungry and we had a common topic we related our story of the sea in alternate sentences we ate and we talked turn and turn about my mother listened to her the affair compared with the tremendous subjects to which she was accustomed to direct her mind was broad farce james took it with an air of restrained amusement i seriously tentatively i diverged from this subject towards other and wider fields impressions of guernsey which drew from him his address at the st peters port hotel the horrors of the sea passage from weymouth which extorted a comment on the limitations of england england london kensington south kensington the guntoncresswells yes yes extraordinary curious coincidence excursus on smallness of world queer old gentleman mr guntoncresswell he is indeed quite one of the old school oh quite still wears that beaver hat does he really yes ha ha yes here the humanising influence of the teutonic school of philosophic analysis was demonstrated by my mothers action mr cloyster she said must reconcile himself to exchanging his comfortable rooms at the st peters port i particularly dislike halffilled hotel life mrs goodwin for the shelter of our cottage he accepted he was then warned that i was chef at the cottage mother gave him a chance to change his mind something was said about my saving life and destroying digestion he went to collect his things in an ecstasy of merriment at this point i committed an indiscretion which can only be excused by the magnitude of the occasion my mother had retired to her favourite bowwindow where by a tour de force on the part of the carpenter a system of low adjustable bookcases had been craftily constructed in such a way that when she sat in her windowseat they jutted in a semicircle towards her hand james whom i had escorted down the garden path had left me at the little wooden gate and had gone swinging down the road i shielded from outside observation if any by a line of lilacs gazed rapturously at his retreating form the sun was high in the sky now it was a perfect summers day birds were singing their notes blended with the gentle murmur of the sea on the beach below every fibre of my body was thrilling with the magic of the morning through the kindly branches of the lilac i watched him and then as though in obedience to the primaeval call of that july sunshine i stood on tiptoe and blew him a kiss i realised in an instant what i had done fool that i had been the bowwindow i was rigid with discomfiture my mothers eyes were on the book she held and yet a faint smile seemed to hover round her lips i walked in silence to where she sat at the open window she looked up her smile was more pronounced margie she said yes mother the hedonism of voltaire is the indictment of an honest bore yes mother she then resumed her book chapter james sets out miss margaret goodwins narrative continued those august days have there been any like them before i realise with difficulty that the future holds in store for me others as golden the island was crammed with trippers they streamed in by every boat but james and i were infinitely alone i loved him from the first from the moment when he had rowed out of the unknown into my life clad in a dressinggown i like to think that he loved me from that moment too but if he did the knowledge that he did came to him only after a certain delay it was my privilege to watch this knowledge steal gradually but surely upon him we were always together and as the days passed by he spoke freely of himself and his affairs obeying unconsciously the rudder of my tactful inquisitiveness by the end of the first week i knew as much about him as he did himself it seemed that a guardian an impersonal sort of business man with a small but impossible family was the most commanding figure in his private life as for his finances fiveandforty sovereigns the remnant of a larger sum which had paid for his education at cambridge stood between him and the necessity of offering for hire a sketchy acquaintance with general literature and a third class in the classical tripos he had come to guernsey to learn by personal observation what chances tomato growing held out to a young man in a hurry to get rich tomato growing i echoed dubiously and then to hide a sense of bathos people have made it pay of course they work very hard myes said james without much enthusiasm but i fancy i added the life is not at all unpleasant at this point embarrassment seemed to engulf james he blushed swallowed once or twice in a somewhat convulsive manner and stammered then he made his confession guiltily i was not to suppose that his aims ceased with the attainment of a tomatofarm the nurture of a wholesome vegetable occupied neither the whole of his ambitions nor even the greater part of them to write the agony with which he throatily confessed it to be swept into the maelstrom of literary journalism to be en rapport with the unslumbering forces of fleet street those were the real objectives of james orlebar cloyster of course i mean he said i suppose it would be a bit of a struggle at first if you see what i mean what i mean to say is rejected manuscripts and so on but still after a bit once get a footing you know i should like to have a dash at it i mean i think i could do something you know of course you could i said i mean lots of men have dont you know theres plenty of room at the top i said he seemed struck with this remark it encouraged him he had had his opportunity of talking thus of himself during our long rambles out of doors they were a series of excursions which he was accustomed to describe as hunting expeditions for the stocking of our larder thus james would announce at breakfast that prawns were the days quarry and the foreshore round cobo bay the huntingground and to cobo accordingly we would set out this prawnyielding area extends along the coast on the other side of st peters port where two halts had to be made one at madame garniers the confectioners the other at the library to get fiction which i never read then came a journey on the top of the antediluvian horsetram a sort of diligence on rails and then a whole summers afternoon among the prawns cobo is an expanse of shingle dotted with seaweed and rocks and guernsey is a place where one can take off ones shoes and stockings on the slightest pretext we waded hither and thither with the warm brine lapping unchecked over our bare legs we did not use our nets very industriously it is true but our tongues were seldom still the slow walk home was a thing to be looked forward to ah those memorable homecomings in the quiet solemnity of that hour when a weary sun stoops one can fancy with a sigh of pleasure to sink into the bosom of the sea prawnhunting was agreeably varied by fishsnaring musselstalking and mushroomtrapping sports which james in his capacity of head forester included in his venery for mushroomtrapping an early start had to be made usually between six and seven the chase took us inland until after walking through the fragrant earthy lanes we turned aside into dewy meadows where each blade of grass sparkled with a gem of purest water again the necessity of going barefoot breakfast was late on these mornings my mother whiling away the hours of waiting with a volume of diogenes laertius in the bowwindow she would generally open the meal with the remark that anaximander held the primary cause of all things to be the infinite or that it was a favourite expression of theophrastus that time was the most valuable thing a man could spend when breakfast was announced one of the covers concealed the mushrooms which under my superintendence james had done his best to devil a quiet day followed devoted to sedentary recreation after the labours of the run the period which i have tried to sketch above may be called the period of goodfellowship whatever else love does for a woman it makes her an actress so we were merely excellent friends till jamess eyes were opened when that happened he abruptly discarded goodfellowship i on the other hand played it the more vigorously the situation was mine our days run became the merest shadow of a formality the office of head forester lapsed into an absolute sinecure love was with us triumphant and no longer to be skirted round by me fresh electric glorious in james we talked we must have talked we moved our limbs performed their ordinary daily movements but a golden haze hangs over that second period when by the strongest effort of will i can let my mind stand by those perfect moments i seem to hear our voices low and measured and there are silences fond in themselves and yet more fondly interrupted by unspoken messages from our eyes what we really said what we actually did where precisely we two went i do not know we were together and the blur of love was about us always the blur it is not that memory cannot conjure up the scene again it is not that the scene is clouded by the illproportion of a dream no it is because the dream is brought to me by will and not by sleep the blur recurs because the blur was there a love vast as ours is penalised as it were by this blur which is the hallmark of infinity in mighty distances whether from earth to heaven whether from gerrard to glasgow there is always that awful that disintegrating blur a third period succeeded i may call it the affectionately practical period instantly the blur vanishes we were at our proper distance from the essence of things and though infinity is something one yearns for passionately ones normal condition has its meed of comfort i remember once hearing a man in a government office say that the pleasantest moment of his annual holiday was when his train rolled back into paddington station and he was a man too of a naturally lazy disposition it was about the middle of this third period during a mushroomtrapping ramble that the idea occurred to us first to me then after reflection to james that mother ought to be informed how matters stood between us we went into the house handinhand and interviewed her she was in the bowwindow reading a translation of the deipnosophists of athenaeus good morning she said looking at her watch it is a little past our usual breakfast time margie i think we have been looking for mushrooms mother every investigation says athenaeus which is guided by principles of nature fixes its ultimate aim entirely on gratifying the stomach have you found any mushrooms heaps mrs goodwin said james mother i said we want to tell you something the fact is mrs goodwin we are engaged my mother liked james margie she once said to me there is good in mr cloyster he is not for ever offering to pass me things time had not caused her to modify this opinion she received our news calmly and inquired into jamess means and prospects james had forty pounds and some odd silver i had nothing the keynote of my mothers contribution to our conference was wait you are both young she said she then kissed me smiled contemplatively at james and resumed her book when we were alone my darling said james we must wait tomorrow i catch the boat for weymouth i shall go straight to london my first manuscript shall be in an editors hands on wednesday morning i will go but i will come back i put my arms round his neck my love i said i trust you go always remember that i know you will succeed i kissed him and when you have succeeded come back chapter a harmless deception miss margaret goodwins narrative continued they say that everyone is capable of one novel and in my opinion most people could write one play whether i wrote mine in an inspiration of despair i cannot say i wrote it three years had passed and james was still haggling with those who buy mens brains his earnings were enough just to keep his head above water but not enough to make us two one perhaps because everything is clear and easy for us now i am gradually losing a proper appreciation of his struggle that should never be he did not win but he did not lose which means nearly as much for it is almost less difficult to win than not to lose so my mother has told me in modern journalistic london and i know that he would have won the fact that he continued the fight as he did was in itself a pledge of ultimate victory what he went through while trying with his pen to make a living for himself and me i learned from his letters london he wrote is not paved with gold but in literary fields there are nuggets to be had by the lightest scratching and those nuggets are plays a successful play gives you money and a name automatically what the ordinary writer makes in a year the successful dramatist receives without labour in a fortnight he went on to deplore his total lack of dramatic intuition some men he said have some of the qualifications while falling short of the others they have a sense of situation without the necessary tricks of technique or they sacrifice plot to atmosphere or atmosphere to plot i worse luck have not one single qualification the nursing of a climax the tremendous omissions in the dialogue the knack of stage characterisation all these things are in some inexplicable way outside me it was this letter that set me thinking ever since james had left the island i had been chafing at the helplessness of my position while he toiled in london what was i doing nothing i suppose i helped him in a way the thought of me would be with him always spurring him on to work that the time of our separation might be less but it was not enough i wanted to be doing something and it was during these restless weeks that i wrote my play i think nothing will ever erase from my mind the moment when the central idea of the girl who waited came to me it was a boisterous october evening the wind had been rising all day now the branches of the lilac were dancing in the rush of the storm and far out in the bay one could see the white crests of the waves gleaming through the growing darkness we had just finished tea the lamp was lit in our little drawingroom and on the sofa so placed that the light fell over her left shoulder in the manner recommended by oculists sat my mother with schopenhauers art of literature ponto slept on the rug something in the unruffled peace of the scene tore at my nerves i have seldom felt so restless it may have been the storm that made me so i think myself that it was jamess letter the boat had been late that morning owing to the weather and i had not received the letter till after lunch i listened to the howl of the wind and longed to be out in it my mother looked at me over her book you are restless margie she said there is a volume of marcus aurelius on the table beside you if you care to read no thank you mother i said i think i shall go for a walk wrap up well my dear she replied she then resumed her book i went out of our little garden and stood on the cliff the wind flew at me like some wild thing spray stung my face i was filled with a wild exhilaration and then the idea came to me the simplest most dramatic idea quaint whimsical with just that suggestion of pathos blended with it which makes the fortunes of a play the central idea to be brief of the girl who waited of my maenad tramp along the clifftop with my brain afire and my return draggled and dripping an hour late for dinner of my writing and rewriting of my tears and black depression of the pens i wore out and the quires of paper i spoiled and finally of the ecstasy of the day when the piece began to move and the characters to live i need not speak anyone who has ever written will know the sensations james must have gone through a hundred times what i went through once at last at long last the play was finished for two days i gloated alone over the great pile of manuscript then i went to my mother my diffidence was exquisite it was all i could do to tell her the nature of my request when i spoke to her after lunch at last she understood that i had written a play and wished to read it to her she took me to the bowwindow with gentle solicitude and waited for me to proceed at first she encouraged me for i faltered over my opening words but as i warmed to my work and as my embarrassment left me she no longer spoke her eyes were fixed intently upon the blue space beyond the lilac i read on and on till at length my voice trailed over the last line rose gallantly at the last fence the single word curtain and abruptly broke the strain had been too much for me tenderly my mother drew me to the sofa and quietly with closed eyelids i lay there until in the soft cool of the evening i asked for her verdict seeing as she did instantly that it would be more dangerous to deny my request than to accede to it she spoke that there is an absence my dear margie of any relationship with life that not a single character is in any degree human that passion and virtue and vice and real feeling are wanting this surprises me more than i can tell you i had expected to listen to a natural ordinary unactable episode arranged more or less in steichomuthics there is no work so scholarly and engaging as the amateurs but in your play i am amazed to find the touch of the professional and experienced playwright yes my dear you have proved that you happen to possess the quality one that is most difficult to acquire of surrounding a situation which is improbable enough to be convincing with that absurdly mechanical conversation which the theatregoing public demands as your mother i am disappointed i had hoped for originality as your literary wellwisher i stifle my maternal feelings and congratulate you unreservedly i thanked my mother effusively i think i cried a little she said affectionately that the hour had been one of great interest to her and she added that she would be glad to be consulted with regard to the steps i contemplated taking in my literary future she then resumed her book i went to my room and reread the last letter i had had from james the barrel club covent garden london my darling margie i am writing this line simply and solely for the selfish pleasure i gain from the act of writing to you i know everything will come right some time or other but at present i am suffering from a bad attack of the blues i am like a general who has planned out a brilliant attack and realises that he must fail for want of sufficient troops to carry a position on the taking of which the whole success of the assault depends briefly my position is like this my name is pretty well known in a small sort of way among editors and the like as that of a man who can turn out fairly good stuff besides this i have many influential friends you see where this brings me i am in the middle of my attacking movement and i have not been beaten back but the key to the enemys position is still uncaptured you know what this key is from my other letters its the stage ah margie one acting play only one it would mean everything apart from the actual triumph and the direct profits it would bring so much with it the enemys flank would be turned and the rest of the battle would become a mere rout i should have an accepted position in the literary world which would convert all the other avenues to wealth on which i have my eye instantly into royal roads obstacles would vanish the fact that i was a successful playwright would make the acceptance of the sort of work i am doing now inevitable and i should get paid ten times as well for it and it would mean well you know what it would mean dont you darling margie tell me again that i have your love that the waiting is not too hard that you believe in me dearest it will come right in the end nothing can prevent that love and the will of a man have always beaten time and fate write to me dear ever your devoted james how utterly free from thought of self his magnificent loyalty forgot the dreadful tension of his own great battle and pictured only the tedium of waiting which it was my part to endure i finished my letter to james very late that night it was a very long and explanatory letter and it enclosed my play the main point i aimed at was not to damp his spirits he would i knew well see that the play was suitable for staging he would in short see that i an inexperienced girl had done what he a trained professional writer had failed to do lest therefore his pique should kill admiration and pleasure when he received my work i wrote as one begging a favour here i said we have the means to achieve all we want do not oh do not criticise i have written down the words but the conception is yours the play was inspired by you but for you i should never have begun it take my play james take it as your own for yours it is put your name to it and produce it if you love me under your own signature if this hurts your pride i will word my request differently you alone are able to manage the business side of the production you know the right men to go to to approach them on behalf of a strangers work is far less likely to lead to success i have assumed you will see that the play is certain to be produced but that will only be so if you adopt it as your own claim the authorship and all will be well much more i wrote to james in the same strain and my reward came next day in the shape of a telegram accept thankfully cloyster of the play and its reception by the public there is no need to speak the criticisms were all favourable neither the praise of the critics nor the applause of the public aroused any trace of jealousy in james their unanimous note of praise has been a source of pride to him he is proud ah joy that i am to be his wife i have blotted the last page of this commonplace lovestory of mine the moon has come out from behind a cloud and the whole bay is one vast sheet of silver i could sit here at my bedroom window and look at it all night but then i should be sure to oversleep myself and be late for breakfast i shall read what i have written once more and then i shall go to bed i think i shall wear my white muslin tomorrow end of miss margaret goodwins narrative part two james orlebar cloysters narrative chapter the invasion of bohemia it is curious to reflect that my marriage which takes place today week destroys once and for all my lifes ambition i have never won through to the goal i longed for and now i never shall ever since i can remember i have yearned to be known as a bohemian that was my ambition i have ceased to struggle now married bohemians live in oakley street kings road chelsea we are to rent a house in halkett place three years have passed since the excellent but unsteady steamship ibex brought me from guernsey to southampton it was a sleepy hot and sticky wreck that answered to the name of james orlebar cloyster that morning but i had my first youth and forty pounds so that soap and water followed by coffee and an omelette soon restored me the journey to waterloo gave me opportunity for tobacco and reflection what chiefly exercised me i remember was the problem whether it was possible to be a bohemian and at the same time to be in love bohemia i looked on as a region where one became inevitably entangled with women of unquestionable charm but doubtful morality there were supper parties festive gatherings in the old studio babette lucille the artists ball were these things possible for a man with an honest earnest wholehearted affection the problem engaged me tensely till my ticket was collected at vauxhall just there the solution came i would be a bohemian but a misogynist people would say dear old jimmy cloyster how he hates women it would add to my character a pleasant touch of dignity and reserve which would rather accentuate my otherwise irresponsible way of living little did the good bohemians of the metropolis know how keen a recruit the boat train was bringing to them as a piedterre i selected a cheap and dingy hotel in york street and from this base i determined to locate my proper sphere chelsea was the first place that occurred to me there was st johns wood of course but that was such a long way off chelsea was comparatively near to the heart of things and i had heard that one might find there artistic people whose handtomouth saturnalian existence was redolent of that exquisite gaiety which so attracted my own casual temperament sallying out next morning into the brilliant sunshine and the dusty rattle of york street i felt a sense of elation at the thought that the time for action had come i was in london london the home of the fragrant motoromnibus and the nightblooming hooligan london the battlefield of the literary aspirant since caxton invented the printing press it seemed to me as i walked firmly across westminster bridge that margie gazed at me with the lovelight in her eyes and that a species of amorous telepathy from guernsey was girding me for the fight manresa road i had once heard mentioned as being the heart of bohemian chelsea to manresa road accordingly i went by way of st jamess park buckingham palace road and lower sloane street thence to sloane square here i paused for i knew that i had reached the last outpost of respectable inartistic london how sudden i soliloquised is the change here i am in sloane square regular businesslike and unimaginative while a few hundred yards away kings road leads me into the very midst of genius starvation and possibly free love sloane square indeed gave me the impression not so much of a suburb as of the suburban portion of a great london railway terminus it was positively pretty people were shopping with comparative leisure omnibus horses were being rubbed down and watered on the west side of the square out of the way of the main stream of traffic a postman clearing the letterbox at the office stopped his work momentarily to read the contents of a postcard for the moment i understood caesars feelings on the brink of the rubicon and the emotions of cortes when with eagle eyes he stared at the pacific i was on the threshold of great events behind me was orthodox london before me the unknown it was distinctly a caesarian glance full of deliberate revolt that i bestowed upon the street called sloane that clean orderly thoroughfare which leads to knightsbridge and thence either to the respectabilities of kensington or the plush of piccadilly setting my hat at a wild angle i stepped with a touch of abandon along the kings road to meet the charming impoverished artists whom our country refuses to recognise my first glimpse of the manresa road was i confess a complete disappointment never was bohemianism more handicapped by its setting than that of chelsea if the manresa road was to be taken as a criterion along the uninviting uniformity of this street no trace of unorthodoxy was to be seen there came no merry roystering laughter from attic windows no talented figures of idle geniuses fetched pints of beer from the publichouse at the corner no one dressed in an ancient ulster and a battered straw hat and puffing enormous clouds of blue smoke from a treasured clay pipe gazed philosophically into space from a doorway in point of fact save for a most conventional butcherboy i was alone in the street then the explanation flashed upon me i had been seen approaching the word had been passed round a stranger the clique resents intrusion it lies hid these gay fellows see me all the time and are secretly amused but they do not know with whom they have to deal i have come to join them and join them i will i am not easily beaten i will outlast them the joke shall be eventually against them at some eccentric supper i shall chaff them about how they tried to elude me and failed the hours passed still no bohemians i began to grow hungry i sprang on to a passing bus it took me to victoria i lunched at the shakespeare hotel smoked a pipe and went out into the sunlight again it had occurred to me that night was perhaps the best time for trapping my shy quarry possibly the revels did not begin in manresa road till darkness had fallen i spent the afternoon and evening in the park dined at lyons popular caf it must be remembered that i was not yet a bohemian and consequently owed no deference to the traditions of the order and returned at nine oclock to the manresa road once more i drew blank a barrelorgan played cakewalk airs in the middle of the road but it played to an invisible audience no bearded men danced cancans around it shouting merry jests to one another solitude reigned i wait the duel continues what grim determination what perseverance can these bohemians put into a mad jest i find myself thinking how much better it would be were they to apply to their art the same earnestness and fixity of purpose which they squander on a practical joke evening fell blinds began to be drawn down lamps were lit behind them one by one despair was gnawing at my heart but still i waited then just as i was about to retire defeated i was arrested by the appearance of a house numbered a at the firstfloor window sat a man he was writing i could see his profile his long untidy hair i understood in a moment this was no ordinary writer he was one of those bohemians whose wit had been exercised upon me so successfully he was a literary man and though he enjoyed the sport as much as any of the others he was under the absolute necessity of writing his copy up to time unobserved by his gay comrades he had slipped away to his work they were still watching me but he probably owing to a contract with some journal was obliged to give up his share in their merriment and toil with his pen his pen fascinated me i leaned against the railings of the house opposite enthralled ever and anon he seemed to be consulting one or other of the books of reference piled up on each side of him doubtless he was preparing a scholarly column for a daily paper presently a printers devil would arrive clamouring for his copy i knew exactly the sort of thing that happened i had read about it in novels how unerring is instinct if properly cultivated hardly had the clocks struck twelve when the emissaries there were two of them which showed the importance of their errand walked briskly to no a and knocked at the door the writer heard the knock he rose hurriedly and began to collect his papers meanwhile the knocking had been answered from within by the shooting of bolts noises that were followed by the apparition of a female head a few brief questions and the emissaries entered a pause the litterateur is warning the menials that their charge is sacred that the sheets he has produced are impossible to replace high words abrupt reopening of the front door struggling humanity projected on to the pavement three persons my scribe in the middle an emissary on either side stagger strangely past me the scribe enters the purple night only under the stony compulsion of the emissaries what does this mean i have it the emissaries have become overanxious they dare not face the responsibility of conveying the priceless copy to fleet street they have completely lost their nerve they insist upon the author accompanying them to see with his own eyes that all is well they do not wish posterity to hand their names down to eternal infamy as the men who lost blanks manuscript so greatly against his will he is dragged off my vigil is rewarded no a harbours a bohemian let it be inhabited also by me i stepped across and rang the bell the answer was a piercing scream ah ha i said to myself complacently there are more bohemians than one then in this house the female head again appeared not another oh sir say there aint another wanted said the head in a passionate cockney accent that is precisely what there is i replied i want what for for something moderate well thats a comfort in a wiy which of em is it you want the firstfloor back i have no doubt the firstfloor back would do quite well my words had a curious effect she scrutinised me suspiciously ho she said with a sniff you dont seem to care much which it is you get i dont i said not particularly look ere she exclaimed you jest op it see i dont want none of your arflarks here and

sun had the meteorological conditions been adverse to the point of malignancy i should have closed with her terms simple agreements were ratified then and there by the light of a candle in the passage and i left the house promising to come in in the course of the following afternoon chapter i evacuate bohemia james orlebar cloisters narrative continued the three weeks which i spent at no a mark an epoch in my life it was during that period that i came nearest to realising my ambition to be a bohemian and at the end of the third week for reasons which i shall state i deserted bohemia firmly and with no longing lingering glance behind and settled down to the prosaic task of grubbing earnestly for money the secondfloor back had a cupboard of a bedroom leading out of it even i desirous as i was of seeing romance in everything could not call my lodgings anything but dingy dark and commonplace they were just like a million other of londons mean lodgings the window looked out over a sea of backyards bounded by tall depressing houses and intersected by clotheslines a cats club social musical and pugilistic used to meet on the wall to the right of my window one or two dissipated trees gave the finishing touch of gloom to the scene nor was the interior of the room more cheerful the furniture had been put in during the reign of george iii and last dusted in that of william and mary a black horsehair sofa ran along one wall there was a deal table a chair and a rickety bookcase it was a room for a realist to write in and my style such as it was was bright and optimistic once in i set about the task of ornamenting my abode with much vigour i had my own ideas of mural decoration i papered the walls with editorial rejection forms of which i was beginning to have a representative collection properly arranged these look very striking there is a good deal of variety about them the ones i liked best were those which i received at the rate of three a week bearing a very pleasing picture in green of the publishing offices at the top of the sheet of notepaper scattered about in sufficient quantities these lend an air of distinction to a room pearsons magazine also supplies a taking line in rejection forms punchs i never cared for very much neat i grant you but to my mind too cold i like a touch of colour in a rejection form in addition to these i purchased from the grocer at the corner a collection of pictorial advertisements what i had really wanted was the theatrical poster printed and signed by wellknown artists but the grocer didnt keep them and i was impatient to create my proper atmosphere my next step was to buy a corncob pipe and a quantity of rank jetblack tobacco i hated both and kept them more as ornaments than for use then having hacked my table about with a knife and battered it with a poker till it might have been the table of a shaggy and unrecognised genius i settled down to work i was not a brilliant success i had that little knowledge which is held to be such a dangerous thing i had not plunged into the literary profession without learning a few facts about it i had read nearly every journalistic novel and hints on writing for the papers book that had ever been published in theory i knew all that there was to be known about writing now all my authorities were very strong on one point write they said very loud and clear not what you like but what editors like i smiled to myself when i started i felt that i had stolen a march on my rivals all round me i said to myself are young authors bombarding editors with essays on lucretius translations of martial and disquisitions on ionic comedy i know too much for that i work on a different plan study the papers and see what they want said my authorities i studied the papers some wanted one thing apparently others another there was one group of three papers whose needs seemed to coincide and i could see an article rejected by one paper being taken by another this offered me a number of chances instead of one i could back my mss to win or for a place i began a serious siege of these three papers by the end of the second week i had had curious freaks of eccentric testators singular scenes in court actors who have died on the stage curious scenes in church and seven others rejected by all three somehow this sort of writing is not so easy as it looks a man who was on the staff of a weekly once told me that he had had two thousand of these articles printed since he started poor devil he had the knack i could never get it i sent up fiftythree in all in the first year of my literary life and only two stuck i got fifteen shillings from one periodical for men who have missed their own weddings and later a guinea from the same for single day marriages that paper has a penchant for the loveinterest yet when i sent it my duchesses who have married dustmen it came back by the early post next day that was to me the worst part of those grey days i had my victories but they were always followed by a series of defeats i would have a manuscript accepted by an editor hullo i would say heres the man at last the editorwhobelievesinme let the thing go on i would send him off another manuscript he would take it victory by jove then wonk back would come my third effort with the curtest of refusals i always imagined editors in those days to be pettish whimsical men who amused themselves by taking up a beginner and then wearying of the sport dropped him back into the slime from which they had picked him in the intervals of articles i wrote short stories again for the same three papers as before i studied these papers carefully to see what they wanted then worked out a mechanical plot invariably with a quarrel in the first part an accident and a rescue in the middle and a reconciliation at the end told it in a style that makes me hot all over when i think of it and sent it up enclosing a stamped addressed envelope in case of rejection a very useful precaution as it always turned out it was the little knowledge to which i have referred above which kept my walls so thickly covered with rejection forms i was in precisely the same condition as a man who has been taught the rudiments of boxing i knew just enough to hamper me and not enough to do me any good if i had simply blundered straight at my work and written just what occurred to me in my own style i should have done much better i have a sense of humour i deliberately stifled it for it i substituted a grisly kind of playfulness my hero called my heroine little woman and the concluding passage where he kissed her was written in a sly roguish vein for which i suppose i shall have to atone in the next world only the editor of the colney hatch argus could have accepted work like mine yet i toiled on it was about the middle of my third week at no a that i definitely decided to throw over my authorities and work by the light of my own intelligence nearly all my authorities had been very severe on the practice of versewriting it was they asserted what all young beginners tried to do and it was the one thing editors would never look at in the first ardour of my revolt i determined to do a set of verses it happened that the weather had been very bad for the last few days after a month and a half of sunshine the rain had suddenly begun to fall i took this as my topic it was raining at the time i wrote a satirical poem full of quaint rhymes i had always had rather a turn for serious verse it struck me that the rain might be treated poetically as well as satirically that night i sent off two sets of verses to a daily and an evening paper next day both were in print with my initials to them i began to see light verse is the thing i said i will reorganise my campaign first the skirmishers then the real attack i will peg along with verses till somebody begins to take my stories and articles i felt easier in my mind than i had felt for some time a story came back by the nine oclock post from a monthly magazine to which i had sent it from mere bravado but the thing did not depress me i got out my gluepot and began to fasten the rejection form to the wall whistling a lively air as i did so while i was engaged in this occupation there was a testy rap at the door and mrs driver appeared she eyed my manoeuvres with the rejection form with a severe frown after a preliminary sniff she embarked upon a rapid lecture on what she called my irregular and untidy habits i had turned her secondfloor back she declared into a pigstye sech a litter she said but i protested this is a bohemian house is it not she appeared so shocked indeed so infuriated that i dared not give her time to answer the gentleman below hes not very tidy i added diplomatically wot gent below said mrs driver i reminded her of the night of my arrival oh im she said shaken well es not come back mrs driver i said sternly you said hed gone out for a stroll i refuse to believe that any man would stroll for three weeks so i did say it was the defiant reply i said it so as you shouldnt be put off coming you looked a steady young feller and i wanted a let wish id told you the truth if it ad astopped you what is the truth e was a wrong un e wos writing begging letters to parties as was a bit soft that wos is little gime but e wos a bit too clever one day and the coppers got im now you know mrs driver paused after this outburst and allowed her eye to wander slowly and ominously round my walls i was deeply moved my one link with bohemia had turned out a fraud mrs drivers voice roused me from my meditations i must arst you to be good enough if you please kindly to remove those there bits of paper she pointed to the rejection forms i hesitated i felt that it was a thing that ought to be broken gently the fact is mrs driver i said and no one can regret it more deeply than i do the fact is theyre stuck on with glue two minutes later i had received my marching orders and the room was still echoing with the slam of the door as it closed behind the indignant form of my landlady chapter the orb james orlebar cloysters narrative continued the problem of lodgings in london is an easy one to a man with an adequate supply of money in his pocket the only difficulty is to select the most suitable to single out from the eager crowd the ideal landlady evicted from no a it seemed to me that i had better abandon bohemia postpone my connection with that land of lotuseaters for the moment while i provided myself with the means of paying rent and buying dinners farther down the kings road there were comfortable rooms to be had for a moderate sum per week they were prosaic but inexpensive i chose walpole street a fairly large bedsitting room was vacant at no i took it and settled down seriously to make my writing pay there were advantages in walpole street which manresa road had lacked for one thing there was more air and it smelt less than the manresa road air walpole street is bounded by burton court where the household brigade plays cricket and the breezes from the river come to it without much interruption there was also more quiet no is the last house in the street and even when i sat with my window open the noise of traffic from the kings road was faint and rather pleasant it was an excellent spot for a man who meant to work except for a certain difficulty in getting my landlady and her daughters out of the room when they came to clear away my meals and talk about the better days they had seen and a few imbroglios with the eight cats which infested the house it was the best spot i think that i could have chosen living a life ruled by the strictest economy i gradually forged ahead verse light and serious continued my long suit i generally managed to place two of each brand a week and that meant two guineas sometimes more one particularly pleasing thing about this versewriting was that there was no delay as there was with my prose i would write a set of verses for a daily paper after tea walk to fleet street with them at halfpast six thus getting a little exercise leave them at the office and i would see them in print in the next mornings issue payment was equally prompt the rule was send in your bill before five on wednesday and call for payment on friday at seven thus i had always enough money to keep me going during the week in addition to verses i kept turning out a great quantity of prose fiction and otherwise but without much success the visits of the postmen were the big events of the day at that time before i had been in walpole street a week i could tell by ear the difference between a rejected manuscript and an ordinary letter there is a certain solid plop about the fall of the former which not even a long envelope full of proofs can imitate successfully i worked extraordinarily hard at that time all day sometimes the thought of margie waiting in guernsey kept me writing when i should have done better to have taken a rest my earnings were small in proportion to my labour the guineas i made except from verse were like the ounce of gold to the ton of ore i no longer papered the walls with rejection forms but this was from choice not from necessity i had plenty of material had i cared to use it i made a little money of course my takings for the first month amounted to s i notched double figures in the next with ll s d then i dropped to s d it was not starvation but it was still more unlike matrimony but at the end of the sixth month there happened to me what looking back i consider to be the greatest piece of good fortune of my life i received a literary introduction some authorities scoff at literary introductions they say that editors read everything whether they know the author or not so they do and if the work is not good a letter to the editor from a man who once met his cousin at a gardenparty is not likely to induce him to print it there is no journalistic ring in the sense in which the word is generally used but there are undoubtedly a certain number of men who know the ropes and can act as pilots in a strange sea and an introduction brings one into touch with them there is a world of difference between contributing blindly work which seems suitable to the style of a paper and sending in matter designed to attract the editor personally mr macrae whose pupil i had been at cambridge was the author of my letter of introduction at st gabriels mr macrae had been a man for whom i entertained awe and respect likes and dislikes in connection with ones tutor seemed outside the question only a chance episode had shown me that my tutor was a mortal with a mortals limitations we were bicycling together one day along the trumpington road when a form appeared coming to meet us my tutors speech grew more and more halting as the form came nearer at last he stopped talking altogether and wobbled in his saddle the man bowed to him and as if he had won through some fiery ordeal he shot ahead like a gay professional rider when i drew level with him he said that mr cloyster is my tailor mr macrae was typical of the university don who is scotch he had married the senior historian of newnham he lived and still lives by proxy his publishers order his existence his honeymoon had been placed at the disposal of these gentlemen and they had allotted to that period an edition of aristotles ethics aristotle accordingly received the most scholarly attention from the recently united couple somewhere on the slopes of mount parnassus all the reviews were satisfactory in my third year at st gabriels it was popularly supposed that master pericles aeschylus mr macraes infant son was turned to correct my latin prose though my iambics were withheld from him at the request of the family doctor the letter which pericles aeschyluss father had addressed to me was one of the pleasantest surprises i have ever had it ran as follows st gabriels college cambridge my dear cloyster the divergence of our duties and pleasures during your residence here caused us to see but little of each other would it had been otherwise and too often our intercourse had on my side a distinctly professional flavour your attitude towards your religious obligations was i fear something to seek indeed the line pastor deorum cultor et infrequens might have been directly inspired by your views on the keeping of chapels on the other hand your contributions to our musical festivities had the true aristophanes panache i hear you are devoting yourself to literature and i beg that you will avail yourself of the enclosed note which is addressed to a personal friend of mine believe me your wellwisher david ossian macrae the enclosure bore this inscription charles fermin esq offices of the orb strand london i had received the letter at breakfast i took a cab and drove straight to the orb a painted hand marked editorial indicated a flight of stairs at the top of these i was confronted by a glass door beyond which entrenched behind a desk sat a cynicallooking youth a smaller boy in the background talked into a telephone both were giggling on seeing me the slightly larger of the two advanced with a halfhearted attempt at solemnity though unable to resist a parthian shaft at his companion who was seized on the instant with a paroxysm of suppressed hysteria my letter was taken down a mysterious stone passage after some waiting the messenger returned with the request that i would come back at eleven as mr fermin would be very busy till then i went out into the strand and sought a neighbouring hostelry it was essential that i should be brilliant at the coming interview if only spirituously brilliant and i wished to remove a sensation of stomachic emptiness such as i had been wont to feel at school when approaching the headmasters study at eleven i returned and asked again for mr fermin and presently he appeared a tall thin man who gave one the impression of being in a hurry i knew him by reputation as a famous quartermiler he had been president of the ouac some years back he looked as if at any moment he might dash off in any direction at quartermile pace we shook hands and i tried to look intelligent sorry to have to keep you waiting he said as we walked to his club but we are always rather busy between ten and eleven putting the column through gresham and i do on your way you know the last copy has to be down by halfpast ten we arrived at the club and sat in a corner of the lower smokingroom macrae says that you are going in for writing of course ill do anything i can but it isnt easy to help a man as it happens though i can put you in the way of something if its your style of work do you ever do verse i felt like a batsman who sees a slow fulltoss sailing through the air its the only thing i can get taken i said ive had quite a lot in the chronicle and occasional bits in other papers he seemed relieved oh thats all right then he said you know on your way perhaps youd care to come in and do that for a bit its only holiday work but itll last five weeks and if you do it all right i can get you the whole of the holiday work on the column that comes to a good lot in the year were always taking odd days off can you come up at a moments notice easily i said then you see if you did that you would drop into the next vacancy on the column theres no saying when one may occur its like the general election it may happen tomorrow or not for years still youd be on the spot in case its awfully good of you not at all as a matter of fact i was rather in difficulties about getting a holiday man im off to scotland the day after tomorrow and i had to find a sub well then will you come in on monday all right youve had no experience of newspaper work have you no well all the work at the orbs done between nine and eleven you must be there at nine sharp literally sharp i mean not halfpast and youd better do some stuff overnight for the first week or so youll find working in the office difficult till you get used to it of course though youll always have gresham there so theres no need to get worried he can fill the column himself if hes pushed four or five really good paragraphs a day and an occasional set of verses are all hell want from you i see on monday then nine sharp goodbye i walked home along piccadilly with almost a cakewalk stride at last i was in the inner circle an orb cart passed me i nodded cheerfully to the driver he was one of us chapter julian eversleigh james orlebar cloysters narrative continued i determined to celebrate the occasion by dining out going to a theatre and having supper afterwards none of which things were ordinarily within my means i had not been to a theatre since i had arrived in town and except on saturday nights i always cooked my own dinner a process which was cheap and which appealed to the passion for bohemianism which i had not wholly cast out of me the morning paper informed me that there were eleven musical comedies three shakespeare plays a blank verse drama and two comedies last weeks for me to choose from i bought a stall at the briggs theatre stanley briggs who afterwards came to bulk large in my small world was playing there in a musical comedy which had had even more than the customary musicalcomedy success london by night had always had an immense fascination for me coming out of the restaurant after supper i felt no inclination to return to my lodgings and end the greatest night of my life tamely with a book and a pipe here was i a young man fortified by an excellent supper in the heart of stevensons london why should i have no new arabian night adventure i would stroll about for half an hour and give london a chance of living up to its reputation i walked slowly along piccadilly and turned up rupert street a magic name prince florizel of bohemia had ended his days there in his tobacconists divan mr gilberts policeman forth had been discovered there by the men of london at the end of his long wanderings through soho probably if the truth were known rudolf rassendyl had spent part of his time there it could not be that rupert street would send me empty away my confidence was not abused turning into rupert court a dark and suggestive passage some short distance up the street on the right i found a curious little comedy being played a door gave on to the deserted passageway and on each side of it stood a man the lurcher type of man that is bred of london streets the door opened inwards another man stepped out the hands of one of the lurchers flew to the newcomers mouth the hands of the other lurcher flew to the newcomers pockets at that moment i advanced the lurchers vanished noiselessly and instantaneously their victim held out his hand come in wont you he said smiling sleepily at me i followed him in murmuring something about caught in the act he repeated the phrase as we went upstairs caught in the act yes they are ingenious creatures let me introduce myself my name is julian eversleigh sit down wont you excuse me for a moment he crossed to a writingtable julian eversleigh inhabited a single room of irregular shape it was small and situated immediately under the roof one side had a window which overlooked rupert court the view from it was however restricted because the window was inset so that the walls projecting on either side prevented one seeing more than a yard or two of the court the room contained a hammock a large tin bath propped up against the wall a big wardrobe a couple of bookcases a deal writingtable at which the proprietor was now sitting with a pen in his mouth gazing at the ceiling and a divanlike formation of rugs and cube sugar boxes the owner of this mixed lot of furniture wore a very faded blue serge suit the trousers baggy at the knees and the coat threadbare at the elbows he had the odd expression which green eyes combined with red hair give a man caught in the act he was murmuring caught in the act the phrase seemed to fascinate him i had established myself on the divan and was puffing at a cigar which i had bought by way of setting the copingstone on my nights extravagance before he got up from his writing those fellows he said producing a bottle of whisky and a syphon from one of the lower drawers of the wardrobe did me a double service they introduced me to you say when and they gave me when an idea but how did it happen i asked quite simple he answered you see my friends when they call on me late at night cant get in by knocking at the front door it is a shopdoor and is locked early vancott my landlord is a baker and as he has to be up making muffins somewhere about five in the morning we all have our troubles he does not stop up late so people who want me go into the court and see whether my lamp is burning by the window if it is they stand below and shout julian till i open the door into the court thats what happened tonight i heard my name called went down and walked into the arms of the enterprising gentlemen whom you chanced to notice they must have been very hungry for even if they had carried the job through they could not have expected to make their fortunes in point of fact they would have cleared oneandthreepence but when youre hungry you can see no further than the pit of your stomach do you know i almost sympathise with the poor brutes people sometimes say to me what are you i have often half a mind to reply i have been hungry my stars be hungry once and youre educated if you dont die of it for a lifetime this sort of talk from a stranger might have been the prelude to an appeal for financial assistance he dissipated that halfborn thought dont be uneasy he said you have not been lured up here by the ruse of a clever borrower i can do a bit of touching when in the mood mind you but youre safe you are here because i see that you are a pleasant fellow thank you i said besides he continued i am not hungry at present in fact i shall never be hungry again youre lucky i remarked i am i am the fortunate possessor of the knack of writing advertisements indeed i said feeling awkward for i saw that i ought to be impressed ah he said laughing outright youre not impressed in the least really but ill ask you to consider what advertisements mean first they are the lifeessence of every newspaper every periodical and every book every book practically yes most books contain some latent support of a fashion in clothes or food or drink or of some pleasant spot or phase of benevolence or vice all of which form the interest of one or other of the sections of society which sections require publicity at all costs for their respective interests i was about to probe searchingly into so optimistic a view of modern authorship but he stalled me off by proceeding rapidly with his discourse apart however from the less obvious modes of advertising youll agree that this is the age of all ages for the man who can write puffs good wine needs no bush has become a trade paradox judge by appearances a commercial platitude the man who is ambitious and industrious turns his trick of writing into purely literary channels and becomes a novelist the man who is not ambitious and not industrious and who does not relish the prospect of becoming a loafer in strand wineshops writes advertisements the goldbearing area is always growing its a tom tiddlers ground it is simply a question of picking up the gold and silver the industrious man picks up as much as he wants personally i am easily content an occasional nugget satisfies me heres tonights nugget for instance i took the paper he handed to me it bore the words caught in the act caught in the act of drinking skeffingtons sloe gin a man will always present a happy and smiling appearance skeffingtons sloe gin adds a crowning pleasure to prosperity and is a consolation in adversity of all grocers skeffingtons he said pay me well im worth money to them and they know it at present they are giving me a retainer to keep my work exclusively for them the stuff they have put on the market is neither better nor worse than the average sloe gin but my advertisements have given it a tremendous vogue it is the only brand that grocers stock since i made the firm issue a weekly paper called skeffingtons poultry farmer free to all country customers the consumption of sloe gin has been enormous among agriculturists my idea too of supplying suburban buyers gratis with a small drawingbook skeleton illustrations and four coloured chalks has made the drink popular with children you must have seen the poster i designed theres a reduced copy behind you the father of a family is unwrapping a bottle of skeffingtons sloe gin his little ones crowd round him laughing and clapping their hands the mans wife is seen peeping roguishly in through the door beneath is the popular catchphrase aint mother going to ave none youre a genius i cried hardly that he said at least i have no infinite capacity for taking pains i am one of natures slackers despite my talent for drawing up advertisements i am often in great straits owing to my natural inertia and a passionate love of sleep i sleep on the slightest provocation or excuse i will back myself to sleep against anyone in the world no age weight or colour barred you i should say are of a different temperament more energetic the get on or get out sort of thing the young hustler rather i replied briskly i am in love so am i said julian eversleigh hopelessly however give us a match after that we confirmed our friendship by smoking a number of pipes together chapter the column james orlebar cloysters narrative continued after the first week on your way on the orb offered hardly any difficulty the source of material was the morning papers which were placed in a pile on our table at nine oclock the halfpenny papers were our principal support gresham and i each took one and picked it clean we attended first to the subject of the day this was generally good for two or three paragraphs of verbal fooling there was a sort of tradition that the first halfdozen paragraphs should be topical the rest might be topical or not as occasion served the column usually opened with a oneline pun greshams invention gresham was a man of unparalleled energy and ingenuity he had created several of the typical characters who appeared from time to time in on your way as for instance mrs jenkinson our mrs malaprop and jones junior our howler manufacturing schoolboy he was also a stout apostle of a mode of expression which he called funny language thus instead of writing boldly there is a rumour that i was taught to say it has got about that this sounds funnier in print so gresham said i could never see it myself gresham had a way of seizing on any bizarre incident reported in the morning papers enfolding it in funny language adding a pun and thus making it his own he had a cunning mastery of periphrasis and a telling command of adverbs here is an illustration an account was given one morning by the central news of the breaking into of a house at johnsonville mich by a negro who had stolen a quantity of greenbacks the thief escaping across some fields was attacked by a cow which after severely injuring the negro ate the greenbacks greshams unacknowledged version of the episode ran as follows the sleepy god had got the stranglehold on john denville when caesar bones a coloured gentleman entered johns house at johnsonville mich about midnight did the nocturnal caller disturb his slumbering host no caesar bones has the finer feelings but as he was noiselessly retiring what did he see why a pile of greenbacks which john had thoughtlessly put away in a fireproof safe to prevent the story being cut out by the editor who revised all the proofs of the column with the words too long scribbled against it gresham continued his tale in another paragraph dis am berry insecure murmured the visitor to himself transplanting the notes in a neighbourly way into his pocket mark the sequel the noble caesar met on his homeward path an irritable cudster the encounter was brief caesar went weak in the second round and took the count in the third elated by her triumph and hungry from her exertions the horned quadruped nosed the wad of paper money and daringly devoured it caesar has told the court that if he is convicted of felony he will arraign the owner of the ostrichlike bovine on a charge of receiving stolen goods the owner merely ejaculates black male on his day gresham could write the column and have a hundred lines over by ten oclock i too found plenty of copy as a rule though i continued my practice of doing a few paragraphs overnight but every now and then fearful days would come when the papers were empty of material for our purposes and when two out of every halfdozen paragraphs which we did succeed in hammering out were returned deleted on the editors proof the tension at these times used to be acute the head printer would send up a relay of small and grubby boys to remind us that on your way was fifty lines short at ten oclock he would come in person and be plaintive gresham the old hand applied to such occasions desperate remedies he would manufacture out of even the most pointless item of news two paragraphs by adding to his first the words this reminds us of mr punchs famous story he would then go through the bound volumes of punch we had about a dozen in the room with lightning speed until he chanced upon a more or less appropriate tag those were mornings when verses would be padded out from three stanzas to five gresham turning them out under fifteen minutes he had a wonderful facility for verse as a last expedient one fell back upon a standing column a motheaten collection of alleged jests which had been set up years ago to meet the worst emergencies it was however considered a confession of weakness and a degradation to use this column we had also in our drawer a book of american witticisms published in new york to cut one out preface it with a good american story comes to hand and pin it on a slip was a pleasing variation of the usual mode of constructing a paragraph gresham and i each had our favourite method personally i had always a partiality for dealing with buffers the brakes refused to act and the train struck the buffers at the end of the platform invariably suggested that if elderly gentlemen would abstain from loitering on railway platforms they would not get hurt in this way gresham had a similar liking for turns the performance at the frivoli music hall was in full swing when the scenery was noticed to be on fire the audience got a turn an extra turn julian eversleigh to whom i told my experiences on the orb said he admired the spirit with which i entered into my duties he said moreover that i had a future before me not only as a journalist but as a writer nor indeed could i help seeing for myself that i was getting on i was making a fair income now and had every prospect of making a much better one my market was not restricted verses articles and fiction from my pen were being accepted with moderate regularity by many of the minor periodicals my scope was growing distinctly wider i found too that my work seemed to meet with a good deal more success when i sent it in from the orb with a letter to the editor on orb notepaper altogether my five weeks on the orb were invaluable to me i ought to have paid rather than have taken payment for working on the column by the time fermin came back from scotland to turn me out i was a professional i had learned the art of writing against time i had learned to ignore noise which for a writer in london is the most valuable quality of all every day at the orb i had had to turn out my stuff with the hum of the strand traffic in my ears varied by an occasional barrelorgan the whistling of popular songs by the printers whose window faced ours and the clatter of a typewriter in the next room often i had to turn out a paragraph or a verse while listening and making appropriate replies to some other member of the staff who had wandered into our room to pass the time of day or read out a bit of his own stuff which had happened to please him particularly all this gave me a power of concentration without which writing is difficult in this city of noises the friendship i formed with gresham too besides being pleasant was of infinite service to me he knew all about the game i followed his advice and prospered his encouragement was as valuable as his advice he was my pilot and saw me at great trouble to himself through the dangerous waters i foresaw that the future held out positive hope that my marriage with margaret would become possible and yet pausing in the midst of my castlebuilding i suffered a sense of revulsion i had been brought up to believe that the only adjective that could be coupled with the noun journalism was precarious was i not as gresham would have said solving an addition sum in infantile poultry before their mother the feathered denizen of the farmyard had lured them from their shell was i not mistaking a flash in the pan for a genuine success these thoughts numbed my fingers in the act of writing to margaret instead therefore of the jubilant letter i had intended to send her i wrote one of quite a different tone i mentioned the arduous nature of my work i referred to the struggle in which i was engaged i indicated cleverly that i was a man of extraordinary courage battling with fate i implied that i made just enough to live on it would have been cruel to arouse expectations which might never be fulfilled in this letter accordingly and in subsequent letters i rather went to the opposite extreme out of pure regard for margaret i painted my case unnecessarily black considerations of a similar nature prompted me to keep on my lodging in walpole street i had two rooms instead of one but they were furnished severely and with nothing but the barest necessaries i told myself through it all that i loved margaret as dearly as ever yet there were moments and they seemed to come more frequently as the days went on when i found myself wondering did i really want to give up all this the untidiness the scratch meals the nights with julian and when i was honest i answered no somehow margaret seemed out of place in this new world of mine chapter new years eve james orlebar cloysters narrative continued the morning of new years eve was a memorable one for me my first novel was accepted not an ambitious volume it was rather short and the plot was not obtrusive the sporting gentlemen who accepted it however messrs prodder and way seemed pleased with it though when i suggested a sum in cash in advance of royalties they displayed a most embarrassing coyness and also as events turned out good sense i carried the good news to julian whom i found as usual asleep in his hammock i had fallen into the habit of calling on him after my orb work he was generally sleepy when i arrived at halfpast eleven and while we talked i used to make his breakfast act as a sort of early lunch for myself he said that the people of the house had begun by trying to make the arrival of his breakfast coincide with the completion of his toilet that this had proved so irksome that they had struck and that finally it had been agreed on both sides that the meal should be put in his room at eleven oclock whether he was dressed or not he said that he often saw his breakfast come in and would drowsily determine to consume it hot but he had never had the energy to do so once indeed he had mistaken the time and had confidently expected that the morning of a hot breakfast had come at last he was dressed by nine and had sat for two hours gloating over the prospect of steaming coffee and frizzling bacon on that particular morning however there had been some domestic tragedy the firing of a chimney or the illness of a cook and at eleven oclock not breakfast but an apology for its absence had been brought to him this embittered julian he gave up the unequal contest and he has frequently confessed to me that cold breakfast is an acquired yet not unpleasant taste he woke up when i came in and after hearing my news and congratulating me began to open the letters that lay on the table at his side one of the envelopes had skeffingtons trade mark stamped upon it and contained a banknote and a sheet closely typewritten on both sides half a second jimmy said he and began to read i poured myself out a cup of cold coffee and avoiding the bacon and eggs which lay embalmed in frozen grease began to lunch off bread and marmalade ill do it he burst out when he had finished its a sweat a fearful sweat but skeffingtons have written urging me to undertake a rather original advertising scheme theyre very pressing and theyve enclosed a tenner in advance they want me to do them a tragedy in four acts i sent them the scenario last week i sketched out a skeleton plot in which the hero is addicted to a strictly moderate use of skeffingtons sloe gin his wife adopts every conceivable measure to wean him from this harmless even praiseworthy indulgence at the end of the second act she thinks she has cured him he has promised to gratify what he regards as merely a capricious whim on her part i will give yes i will give it up darling george george she falls on his neck over her shoulder he winks at the audience who realise that there is more to come curtain in act the husband is seen sitting alone in his study his wife has gone to a party the man searches in a cupboard for something to read instead of a novel however he lights on a bottle of skeffingtons sloe gin instantly the old overwhelming craving returns he hesitates what does it matter she will never know he gulps down glass after glass he sinks into an intoxicated stupor his wife enters curtain again act the draught of nectar tasted in the former act after a period of enforced abstinence has produced a deadly reaction the husband who previously improved his health his temper and his intellect by a strictly moderate use of skeffingtons sloe gin has now become a ghastly dipsomaniac his wife realising too late the awful effect of her idiotic antagonism to skeffingtons experiences the keenest pangs of despair she drinks laudanum and the tragedy is complete fine i said finishing the coffee in a deferential postscript said julian skeffingtons suggest an alternative ending that the wife should drink not laudanum but sloe gin and grow under its benign influence resigned to the fate she has brought on her husband and herself resignation gives way to hope she devotes her life to the care of the inebriate man and by way of pathetic retribution she lives precisely long enough to nurse him back to sanity which finale do you prefer yours i said thank you said julian considerably gratified so do i its terser more dramatic and altogether a better advertisement skeffingtons make jolly good sloe gin but they cant arouse pity and terror yes ill do it but first let me spend the tenner im taking a holiday too today i said how can we amuse ourselves julian had opened the last of his letters he held up two cards tickets for covent garden ball tonight he said why not come its sure to be a good one i should like to i said thanks julian dropped from his hammock and began to get his bath ready we arranged to dine early at the maison suisse in rupert street table dhte one franc plus twopence for madmoiselle and go on to the gallery of a first night i was to dress for covent garden at julians after the theatre because white waistcoats and the franc table dhte didnt go well together when i dined out i usually went to the maison suisse i shall never have the chance of going again even if as a married man i were allowed to do so for it has been pulled down to make room for the hicks theatre in shaftesbury avenue when i did not dine there i attended a quaint survival of last centurys coffeehouses in glasshouse street tall pewlike boxes wooden tables without tablecloths panelled walls an excellent menu of chops steaks fried eggs sausages and other british products once the resort of bucks and macaronis fords coffeehouse i found frequented by a strange assortment of individuals some of whom resembled bookmakers touts others clerks of an inexplicably rustic type who these people really were i never discovered i generally have supper at pepolos said julian as we left the theatre before a covent garden ball shall we go on there there are two entrances to pepolos restaurant one leading to the ground floor the other to the brasserie in the basement i liked to spend an hour or so there occasionally smoking and watching the crowd every sixth visit on an average i would happen upon somebody interesting among the ordinary throng of medical students and thirdrate clerks wateryeyed old fellows who remembered cremorne a mahogany derelict who had spent his youth on the sea when liners were sailingships and the apprentices terrorised by bullying mates and the rollers of the bay lay howling in the scuppers and prayed to be thrown overboard he told me of one voyage on which the malay cook went mad and escaping into the ratlines shot down a dozen of the crew before he himself was sniped the supper tables are separated from the brasserie by a line of stucco arches and as it was now a quarter to twelve the place was full at a first glance it seemed that there were no empty supper tables presently however we saw one laid for four at which only one man was sitting hullo said julian theres malim lets go and see if we can push into his table well malim how are you do you know cloyster mr malim had a lofty expression i should have put him down as a scholarly recluse his first words upset this view somewhat coming to covent garden he said genially i am so is kit shell be down soon good said julian may jimmy and i have supper at your table do said malim plenty of room wed better order our food and not wait for her we took our places and looked round us the hum of conversation was persistent it rose above the clatter of the supper tables and the sudden bursts of laughter it was now five minutes to twelve all at once those nearest the door sprang to their feet a girl in scarlet and black had come in ah theres kit at last said malim theyre cheering her said julian as he spoke the tentative murmur of a cheer was caught up by everyone men leaped upon chairs and tables hullo hullo hullo said kit reaching us kiddie when they do that it makes me feel shy she was laughing like a child she leaned across the table put her arms round malims neck and kissed him she glanced at us malim smiled quietly but said nothing she kissed julian and she kissed me now were all friends she said sitting down better know each others names said malim kit this is mr cloyster mr cloyster may i introduce you to my wife chapter i meet mr thomas blake james orlebar cloysters narrative continued someone had told me that the glory of covent garden ball had departed it may be so yet the floor with its strange conglomeration of musichall artists callow university men shady horsedealers and raucous military infants had an atmosphere of more than meretricious gaiety the close of an old year and the birth of a new one touch the toughest the band was working away with a strident brassiness which filled the room with noise the womens dresses were a shriek of colour the vulgarity of the scene was so immense as to be almost admirable it was certainly interesting watching his opportunity julian presently drew me aside into the smokingroom malim he said has paid you a great compliment really i said rather surprised for julians acquaintance had done nothing more to my knowledge than give me a cigar and a whiskeyandsoda hes introduced you to his wife very good of him im sure you dont understand you see kit for what she is a pretty goodnatured creature bred in the gutter but malim well hes in the foreign office and is secretary to sir george grant then what in heavens name i cried induced him to marry my dear jimmy said julian adroitly avoiding the arm of an exuberant lady impersonating winter and making fair practice with her detachable icicles it was kit or no one just consider malims position which was that of thousands of other men of his type they are the cleverest men of their schools they are the intellectual stars of their varsities i was at oxford with malim he was a sort of tin god doublefirst and all that just like all the rest of them they get what is looked upon as a splendid appointment under government they come to london hire comfortable chambers or a flat go off to their office in the morning leave it in the evening and are given a salary which increases by regular gradations from an initial two hundred a year say that a man begins this kind of work at twentyfour what are his matrimonial prospects his office work occupies his entire attention the idea that government clerks dont work is a fiction preserved merely for the writers of burlesque from the moment he wakes in the morning until dinner his leisure extends roughly speaking from eightthirty until twelve the man whom i am discussing and of whom malim is a type is as i have already proved intellectual he has therefore ambitions the more intellectual he is the more he loathes the stupid routine of his daily task thus his leisure is his most valuable possession there are books he wants to read those which he liked in the days previous to his slavery and new ones which he sees published every day there are plays he wants to see performed and there are subjects on which he would like to write would give his left hand to write if the loss of that limb wouldnt disqualify him for his post where is his social chance it surely exists only in the utter abandonment of his personal projects and to go out when one is tied to the clock is a poor sort of game but suppose he does seek the society of what friends he can muster in london is he made much of fussed over not a bit of it brainless subalterns ridiculous midshipmen have in the eyes of the girl whom he has come to see a reputation that he can never win theyre in the service theyre so dashing theyre so charmingly extravagant theyre so tremendous in face of an emergency that their conversational limitations of yes and no are hailed as brilliant flights of genius their inane anecdotes their pointless observations are positively courted it is they who retire to the conservatory with the divine violet whose face is like the venus of milos whose hair one hears reaches to her knees whose eyes are like blue saucers and whose complexion is a pink poem it is jane the stumpy the flatfooted jane who wears glasses and has all the virtues which are supposed to go with indigestion big hands and an enormous waist jane i repeat who is told off to talk to a man like malim if on the other hand he and his fellows refuse to put on evening clothes and be bored to death of an evening who can blame them if they deliberately find enough satisfaction for their needs in the company of a circle of men friends and the casual pleasures of the town selfishness is the last epithet with which their behaviour can be charged unselfishness has been their curse no sane person would of his own accord become the automaton that a government office requires pressure on the part of relations of parents has been brought to bear on them the steady employment the graduated income the pension that fatal pension has been danced by their fathers and their mothers and their uncle johns before their eyes appeals have been made to them on filial not to say religious grounds threats would have availed nothing but appeals downright tearful appeals from mamma husky handgripping appeals from papa that is what has made escape impossible a huge act of unselfishness has been compelled a lifetime of reactionary egotism is inevitable and legitimate i was wrong when i said malim was typical he has to the good an ingenuity which assists naturally in the solution of the problem of self and circumstance a year or two ago chance brought him in contact with kit they struck up a friendship he became an habitu at the fried fish shop in tottenham court road whenever we questioned his taste he said that a physician recommended fish as a tonic for the brain but it was not his brain that took malim to the fried fish shop it was his heart he loved kit and presently he married her one would have said this was an impossible step misery for malims people his friends himself and afterwards for kit but nature has endowed both malim and kit with extraordinary commonsense he kept to his flat she kept to her job in the fried fish shop only instead of living in she was able to retire after her days work to a little house which he hired for her in the hampstead road her work for which she is eminently fitted keeps her out of mischief his flat gives the impression to his family and the head of his department that he is still a bachelor thus all goes well ive often read in the police reports i said of persons who lead double lives and im much interested in malim and kit bore down upon us we rose its the march past observed the former come upstairs kiddie said kit give me your arm at halfpast four we were in wellington street it was a fine mild morning and in the queer light of the false dawn we betook ourselves to the old hummums for breakfast other couples had done the same the steps of the hummums facing the market harboured already a waiting crowd the doors were to be opened at five we also found places on the stone steps the market was alive with porters who hailed our appearance with every profession of delight early hours would seem to lend a certain acidity to their badinage byandby a more personal note crept into their facetious comments two guardsmen on the top step suddenly displayed in return a very creditable gift of repartee covent garden market was delighted it felt the stern joy which warriors feel with foemen worthy of their steel it suspended its juggling feats with vegetable baskets and devoted itself exclusively to the task of silencing our guns porters costers and the riffraff of the streets crowded in a semicircle around us just then it was borne in on us how small our number was a solid phalanx of the toughest customers in london faced us behind this semicircle a line of carts had been drawn up unseen enemies from behind this laager now began to amuse themselves by bombarding us with the product of the market garden tomatoes cauliflowers and potatoes came hurtling into our midst i saw julian consulting his watch five minutes more he said i had noticed some minutes back that the ardour of the attack seemed to centre round one man in particular a short very burly man in a costume that seemed somehow vaguely nautical his face wore the expression of one cheerfully conscious of being well on the road to intoxication he was the ringleader it was he who threw the largest cabbage the most pass tomato i dont suppose he had ever enjoyed himself so much in his life he was standing now on a cart full of potatoes and firing them in with tremendous force kit saw him too why theres that blackguard tom she cried she had been told to sit down behind malim for safety before anyone could stop her or had guessed her intention she had pushed her way through us and stepped out into the road it was so unexpected that there was an involuntary lull in the proceedings tom she pointed an accusing finger at the man who gaped beerily tom who pinched farvers best trousers and popped them there was a roar of laughter a moment before and tom had been the pet of the market the energetic leader the champion potatoslinger now he was a thing of derision his friends took up the question keen anxiety was expressed on all sides as to the fate of fathers trousers he was requested to be a man and speak up the uproar died away as it was seen that kit had not yet finished cheese it some of yer shouted a voice the lady wants to orsk him somefin else tom said kit who was sent with tuppence to buy postagestamps and spent it on beer the question was well received by the audience tom was beaten a potato vast and nobbly fell from his palsied hand he was speechless then he began to stammer just you stop it tom shouted kit triumphantly just you stop it dyou ear you stop it she turned towards us on the steps and taking us all into her confidence added es a nice thing to ave for a bruvver anyway then she rejoined malim amid peals of laughter from both armies it was a homeric incident only a halfhearted attempt was made to renew the attack and when the door of the hummums at last opened malim observed to julian and me as we squashed our way in that if a mans wifes relations were always as opportune as kits the greatest objection to them would be removed chapter i meet the rev john hatton james orlebar cloysters narrative continued i saw a great deal of malim after that he and julian became my two chief mainstays when i felt in need of society malim was a man of delicate literary skill a genuine lover of books a severe critic of modern fiction our tastes were in the main identical though it was always a blow to me that he could see nothing humorous in mr george ade whose fables i knew nearly by heart the more robust type of humour left him cold in all other respects we agreed there is a neverfailing fascination in a man with a secret it gave me a pleasant feeling of being behind the scenes to watch malim sitting in his armchair the essence of everything that was conventional and respectable with eton and oxford written all over him and to think that he was married all the while to an employee in a tottenham court road friedfish shop kit never appeared in the flat but malim went nearly every evening to the little villa sometimes he took julian and myself more often myself alone julian being ever disinclined to move far from his hammock the more i saw of kit the more thoroughly i realized how eminently fitted she was to be malims wife it was a union of opposites except for the type of fiction provided by penny libraries of powerful stories kit had probably not read more than half a dozen books in her life grimms fairy stories she recollected dimly and she betrayed a surprising acquaintance with at least three of ouidas novels i fancy that malim appeared to her as a sort of combination of fairy prince and ouida guardsman he exhibited the oxford manner at times rather noticeably kit loved it till i saw them together i had thought kits accent and her incessant mangling of the kings english would have jarred upon malim but i soon found that i was wrong he did not appear to notice i learned from kit in the course of my first visit to the villa some further particulars respecting her brother tom the potatothrower of covent garden market mr thomas blake it seemed was the proprietor and skipper of a barge a pleasant enough fellow when sober but too much given to what kit described as his drop he had apparently left home under something of a cloud though whether this had anything to do with fathers trousers i never knew kit said she had not seen him for some years though each had known the others address it seemed that the blake family were not great correspondents have you ever met john hatton asked malim one night after dinner at his flat john hatton i answered no who is he a parson a very good fellow you ought to know him hes a man with a number of widely different interests we were at trinity together he jumps from one thing to another but hes frightfully keen about whatever he does someone was saying that he was running a boys club in the thickest part of lambeth there might be copy in it i said or ideas for advertisements for julian said malim anyway ill introduce you to him have you ever been in the barrel whats the barrel the barrel is a club it gets the name from the fact that its the only club in england that allows and indeed urges its members to sit on a barrel john hatton is sometimes to be found there come round to it tomorrow night all right i replied where is it a hundred and fiftythree york street covent garden first floor very well i said ill meet you there at twelve oclock i cant come sooner because ive got a story to write twelve had just struck when i walked up york street looking for no the house was brilliantly lighted on the first floor the street door opened on to a staircase and as i mounted it the sound of a piano and a singing voice reached me at the top of the stairs i caught sight of a waiter loaded with glasses i called to him mr cloyster sir yessir ill find out whether mr malim can see you sir malim came out to me hattons not here he said but come in theres a smoking concert going on he took me into the room the windows of which i had seen from the street there was a burst of cheering as we entered the room the song was finished and there was a movement among the audience its the interval said malim men surged out of the packed front room into the passage and then into a sort of bar parlour malim and i also made our way there thats the fetish of the club said malim pointing to a barrel standing on end and ill introduce you to the man who is sitting on it hes little michael the musical critic they once put on an operetta of his at the court it ran about two nights but he reckons all the events of the world from the date of its production mr cloyster mr michael the musician hopped down from the barrel and shook hands he was a dapper little person and had a trick of punctuating every sentence with a snigger cheero he said genially is this your first visit i said it was then sit on the barrel we are the only club in london who can offer you the privilege accordingly i sat on the barrel and through a murmur of applause i could hear michael telling someone that hed first seen that barrel five years before his operetta came out at the court at that moment a venerable figure strode with dignity into the bar maundrell said malim to me the last of the old bohemians an old actor always wears the steeple hat and a long coat with skirts the survivor of the days of kean uttered a bellow for whiskyandwater that barrel he said reminds me of buckstones days at the haymarket after the performance we used to meet at the caf de leurope a few yards from the theatre our secret society sat there what was the society called mr maundrell asked a new member with unusual intrepidity its name replied the whiteheaded actor simply i shall not divulge it was not however altogether unconnected with the pink men of the blue mountains we used to sit we who were initiated in a circle we met to discuss the business of the society oh we were the observed of all observers i can assure you our society was extensive it had its offshoots in foreign lands well we at these meetings used to sit round a barrel a great big barrel which had a hole in the top the barrel was not merely an ornament for through the hole in the top we threw any scraps and odds and ends we did not want bits of tobacco bread marrow bones the dregs of our glasses anything and everything went into the barrel and so it happened as the barrel became fuller and fuller strange animals made their appearance animals of peculiar shape and form crawled out of the barrel and would attempt to escape across the floor but we were on their tracks we saw them we headed them off with our sticks and we chased them back again to the place where they had been born and bred we poked them in sir with our sticks mr maundrell emitted a placid chuckle at this reminiscence a good many members of this club whispered malim to me would have gone back into that barrel a bell sounded thats for the second part to begin said malim we herded back along the passage a voice cried be seated please gentlemen at the far end of the room was a table for the chairman and the committee and to the left stood a piano everyone had now sat down except the chairman who was apparently not in the room there was a pause then a man from the audience whooped sharply and clambered over the table and into the place of the chairman he tapped twice with the mallet get out of that chair yelled various voices gentlemen said the man in the chair a howl of execration went up and simultaneously the door was flung open a double file of whiterobed druids came chanting into the room the druids carried in with them a small portable tree which they proceeded to set upright the chant now became extremely topical each druid sang a verse in turn while his fellow druids danced a stately measure round the tree as the verse was being sung an imitation granite altar was hastily erected the man in the chair who had so far smoked a cigarette in silence now tapped again with his mallet gentlemen he observed the druids ended their song abruptly and made a dash at the occupant of the chair the audience stood up a victim for our ancient rites screamed the druids falling upon the man and dragging him towards the property altar the victim showed every sign of objection to early english rites but he was dislodged and after being dragged struggling across the table subsided quickly on the floor the mob surged about and around him he was hidden from view his position however could be located by a series of piercing shrieks the door again opened mr maundrell the real chairman of the evening stood on the threshold chair was now the word that arose on every side and at this signal the druids disappeared at a trot past the longbearded impassive mr maundrell their victim followed them but before he did so he picked up his trousers which were lying on the carpet all the time this scene had been going on i fancied i recognised the man in the chair in a flash i remembered it was dawkins who had coached first trinity and whom i as a visitor once at the crews training dinner had last seen going through the ancient and honourable process of debagging at the hands of his lighthearted boat come on said malim godfrey lanes going to sing a patriotic song they will let him do it well go down to the temple and find john hatton we left the barrel at about one oclock it was a typical london late autumn night quiet with the peace of a humming top warm with the heat generated from mellow asphalt and resinous woodpaving we turned from bedford street eastwards along the strand between one and two the strand is as empty as it ever is it is given over to lurchers and policemen fleet street reproduces for this one hour the sahara when i knock at the temple gate late at night said malim and am admitted by the night porter i always feel a pleasantly archaic touch i agreed with him the process seemed a quaint admixture of an oxford or cambridge college gottingen and a feudal keep and after the gate had been closed behind one it was difficult to realise that within a few yards of an academic system of lawns and buildings full of living traditions and associations which wainscoting and winding stairs engender lay the modern world its american invaders its new humour its womens clubs its long firms its musical comedies its park lane and its strand with the hub of the universe projecting from the roadway at charing cross plain for englishmen to gloat over and for foreigners to envy sixtytwo harcourt buildings is emblazoned with many names including that of the rev john hatton the oak was not sported and our rap at the inner door was immediately answered by a shout of come in as we opened it we heard a peculiar whirring sound road skates said hatton gracefully circling the table and then coming to a standstill i was introduced im very glad to see you both he said the two other men i share these rooms with have gone away so im killing time by training for my roadskate tour abroad its trying for ones ankles could you go downstairs on them said malim certainly he replied ill do so now and when were down ill have a little practice in the open whereupon he skated to the landing scrambled down the stairs sped up middle temple lane and called the porter to let us out into fleet street he struck me as a man who differed in some respects from the popular conception of a curate ill race you to ludgate circus and back said the clergyman youre too fast said malim it must be a handicap we might do it level in a cab said i for i saw a hansom crawling towards us done said the rev john hatton done for halfacrown i climbed into the hansom and malim about to follow me found that a constable to whom the soil of the city had given spontaneous birth was standing at his shoulder wots the game inquired the officer with tender solicitude a fine night perkins remarked hatton a fine morning beggin your pardon sir said the policeman facetiously he seemed to be an acquaintance of the skater reliability trials continued hatton be good enough to start us perkins very good sir said perkins drive to ludgate circus and back and beat the gentleman on the skates said malim to our driver who was taking the race as though he assisted at such events in the course of his daily duty hi shall say are you ready horf we shall have perkins applying to the jockey club for ernest willoughbys job whispered malim are you ready horf hatton was first off the mark he raced down the incline to the circus at a tremendous speed he was just in sight as he swung laboriously round and headed for home but meeting him on our outward journey we noticed that the upward slope was distressing him shall we do it we asked yessir said our driver and now we too were on the up grade we went up the hill at a gallop were equal with hatton at fetter lane and reached the temple gate yards to the good the ancient driver of a fourwheeler had been the witness of the finish he gazed with displeasure upon us this eres a nice use ter put fleet street to i dont think he said coldly this sarcastic rebuke rather damped us and after hatton had paid malim his halfcrown and had invited me to visit him we departed queer chap hatton said malim as we walked up the strand i was to discover at no distant date that he was distinctly a manysided man i have met a good many clergymen in my time but i have never come across one quite like the rev john hatton chapter julian learns my secret james orlebar cloysters narrative continued a difficulty in the life of a literary man in london is the question of getting systematic exercise at school and college i had been accustomed to play games every day and now i felt the change acutely it was through this that i first became really intimate with john hatton and incidentally with sidney price of the moon assurance company i happened to mention my trouble one night in hattons rooms i had been there frequently since my first visit none of my waistcoats fit i remarked my dear fellow said hatton ill give you exercise and to spare that is to say if you can box im not a champion i said but im fond of it i shouldnt mind taking up boxing again theres nothing like it for exercise quite right james he replied and exercise as i often tell my boys is essential what boys i asked my club boys said hatton they belong to the most dingy quarter of the whole of london south lambeth they are not hooligans they are not so interesting as that they represent the class of youth that is a stratum or two above hooliganism frightful weeds they lack the robust animalism of the class below them and they lack the intelligence of the class above them the fellows at my club are mostly hardworking mechanics and underpaid office boys they have nothing approaching a sense of humour or the instinct of sport not very encouraging i said nor picturesque said hatton and that is why theyve been so neglected there is romance in an outandout hooligan it interests people to reform him but to the outsider my boys are dull i dont find them so but then i know them boxing lessons are just what they want in fact i was telling sidney price an insurance clerk who lives in lambeth and helps me at the club only yesterday how much i wished we could teach them to use the gloves ill take it on then hatton if you like i said it ought to keep me in form i found that it did i ceased to be aware of my liver that winter i was able to work to good purpose and the result was that i arrived it dawned upon me at last that the precarious idea was played out one could see too plainly the white sheet and phosphorus and i was happy happier perhaps than i had ever hoped to be happier in a sense than i can hope to be again i had congenial work and what is more i had congenial friends what friends they were julian i seem to see him now sprawling in his hammock sucking his pipe planning an advertisement or propounding some whimsical theory of life and in his eyes he bears the pain of one whose love and life are spoilt julian no longer my friend kit and malim what evenings are suggested by those names evenings alone with malim at his flat in vernon place an unimpeachable dinner a hand at picquet midnight talk with the blue smoke wreathing round our heads well malim and i are unlikely to meet again in vernon place nor shall we foregather at the little house in the hampstead road the house which kit enveloped in an inimitable air of domesticity her past had not been unconnected with the minor stage she could play on the piano from ear and sing the songs of the street with a charming cockney twang but there was nothing of the stage about her now she was born for domesticity and as the wife of malim she wished to forget all that had gone before she even hesitated to give us her wonderful imitations of the customers at the fried fish shop because in her heart she did not think such impersonations altogether suitable for a respectable married woman it was malim who got me elected to the barrel club i take it that i shall pay few more visits there i have mentioned at this point the love of my old friends who made my first years in london a period of happiness since it was in this month of april that i had a momentous conversation with julian about margaret he had come to walpole street to use my typewriter and seemed amazed to find that i was still living in much the same style as i had always done let me see he said how long is it since i was here last you came some time before christmas ah yes he said reminiscently i was doing a lot of travelling just then and he added thoughtfully what a curious fellow you are jimmy here are you making he glanced at me oh say a thousand a year fifteen hundred a year and you live in precisely the same shoddy surroundings as you did when your manuscripts were responsible for an extra size in wastepaper baskets i was surprised to hear that you were still in walpole street i supposed that at any rate you had taken the whole house his eyes raked the little sittingroom from the sham marble mantelpiece to the bamboo cabinet i surveyed it too and suddenly it did seem unnecessarily wretched and depressing julian looked at me curiously theres some mystery here he said dont be an ass julian i replied weakly its no good denying it he retorted theres some mystery youre a materialist you dont live like this from choice if you were to follow your own inclinations youd do things in the best style you could run to youd be in jermyn street youd have your man a cottage in surrey youd entertain go out a good deal youd certainly give up these dingy quarters my friendship for you deplores a mammoth skeleton in your cupboard james my study of advertising tells me that this paltry existence of yours does not adequately push your name before the public youre losing money youre stop julian i exclaimed cherchez he continued cherchez stop confound you stop i tell you come he said laughing i mustnt force your confidence but i cant help feeling its odd when i came to london i said firmly i was most desperately in love i was to make a fortune incidentally my name marry and live happily ever after there seemed last year nothing complex about that programme it seemed almost too simple i even like a fool thought to add an extra touch of piquancy to it by endeavouring to be a bohemian i then discovered that what i was attempting was not so simple as i had imagined to begin with bohemians diffuse their brains in every direction except that where breadandbutter comes from i found too that unless one earns breadandbutter one has to sprint very fast to the workhouse door to prevent oneself starving before one gets there so i dropped bohemia and i dropped many other pleasant fictions as well i took to examining pavements saw how hard they were had a look at the gutters and saw how broad they were i noticed the accumulation of dirt on the house fronts the actual proportions of industrial buildings i observed closely the price of food clothes and roofs you became a realist yes i read a good deal of gissing about then and it scared me i pitied myself and after that came pity for the girl i loved i swore that i would never let her come to my side in the ring where the monster poverty and i were fighting if youve been there youve been in hell and if you come out with your soul alive you cant tell other people what it felt like they couldnt understand julian nodded i understand you know he said gravely yes youve been there i said well youve seen that my little turnup with the monster was short and sharp it wasnt one of the oldfashioned fortyround mostofalifetime feintforanopening inandout affairs our pace was too fast for that we went at it both hands fighting all the time i was going for the knockout in the first round not your method julian no said julian its not my method i treat the monster rather as a wild animal than as a hooligan and hearing that wild animals wont do more than sniff at you if you lie perfectly still i adopted that ruse towards him to save myself the trouble of a conflict but the effect of lying perfectly still was that i used to fall asleep and that works satisfactorily julian i said i detect a touch of envy in your voice you try to keep it out but you cant wait a bit though i havent finished as you know i had the monster down in less than no time i said to myself ive won ill write to margaret and tell her so do you know i had actually begun to write the letter when another thought struck me one that started me sweating and shaking the monster i said again to myself the monster is devilish cunning perhaps hes only shamming it looks as if he were beaten suppose its only a feint to get me off my guard suppose he just wants me to take my eyes off him so that he may get at me again as soon as ive begun to look for a comfortable chair and a mantelpiece to rest my feet on i told myself that i wouldnt risk bringing margaret over i didnt dare chance her being with me if ever i had to go back into the ring so i kept jumping and stamping on the monster the referee had given me the fight and had gone away and with no one to stop me i kicked the life out of him no you didnt interrupted julian excuse me im sure you didnt i often wake up and hear him prowling about yes but theres a separate monster set apart for each of us its fate who arranges the programme and by stress of business fate postpones many contests so late that before they can take place the man has died those who die before their fight comes on are called rich men to return however to my own monster i was at last convinced that he was dead a thousand times how long have you had this conviction asked julian the absolute certainty that my monster has ceased to exist came to me this morning whilst i brushed my hair ah said julian and now i suppose you really will write to miss margaret he paused goodwin to miss margaret goodwin he repeated look here julian i said irritably its no use your repeating every observation i make as though you were massa johnson on margate sands whats the matter i was silent for a moment then i confessed julian i said i cant write to her you need neither say that im a blackguard nor that youre sorry for us both at this present moment ive no more affection for margaret than i have for this chair when precisely i left off caring for her i dont know why i ever thought i loved her i dont know either but ever since i came to london all the love i did have for her has been ebbing away every day had you met many people before you met her asked julian slowly no one that counted not a woman that counted thats to say i am shy with women i can talk to them in a sort of way but i never seem able to get intimate margaret was different she saved my life and we spent the summer in guernsey together and you seriously expected not to fall in love julian laughed my dear jimmy you ought to write a psychological novel possibly but in the meantime what am i to do julian stood up shes in love with you i suppose yes he stood looking at me well cant you speak i said he turned away shrugging his shoulders ones got ones own right and ones own wrong he grumbled lighting his pipe i know what youre thinking i said he would not look at me youre thinking i went on what a cad i am not to have written that letter i sat down resting my head on my hands after all love and liberty theyre both very sweet im thinking said julian watching the smoke from his pipe abstractedly that you will probably write tonight and i think i know how youre feeling julian i said must it be tonight why the letter shall go but must it be tonight julian hesitated no he said but youve made up your mind so why put off the inevitable i cant i exclaimed oh i really cant i must have my freedom a little longer you must give it up some day itll be all the harder when youve got to face it i dont mind that a little more freedom just a little and then ill tell her to come to me he smoked in silence surely i said this little more freedom that i ask is a small thing compared with the sacrifice i have promised to make you wont let her know its a sacrifice of course not she shall think that i love her as i used to yes you ought to do that he said softly poor devil he added am i too selfish i asked he got up to go no he said to my mind youre entitled to a breathing space before you give up all that you love best but theres a risk of what of her finding out by some other means than yourself and before your letter comes that the letter should have been written earlier do you sign all your stuff with your own name yes well then shes bound to see how youre getting on shell see your name in the magazines in newspapers and in books shell know you dont write for nothing and shell make calculations i was staggered you mean i said why it will occur to her before long that your statement of your income doesnt square with the rest of the evidence and shell wonder why you pose as a pauper when youre really raking in the money with both hands shell think it over and then shell see it all i see i said dully well youve taken my last holiday from me ill write to her tonight telling her the truth i shouldnt necessarily wait a week or two you may quite possibly hit on some way out of the difficulty im bound to say though i cant see one myself at the moment nor can i i said chapter tom blake again james orlebar cloysters narrative continued hattons club boys took kindly to my course of instruction for a couple of months indeed it seemed that another golden age of the noble art was approaching and that the rejuvenation of boxing would occur beginning at carnation hall lambeth then the thing collapsed like a punctured tyre at first of course they fought a little shy but when i had them up in line and had shown them what a large proportion of an eightounce glove is padding they grew more at ease to be asked suddenly to fight three rounds with one of your friends before an audience also of your friends is embarrassing one feels hot and uncomfortable hattons boys jibbed nervously as a preliminary measure therefore i drilled them in a class at footwork and the left lead they found the exercise exhilarating if this was the idea they seemed to say let the thing go on then i showed them how to be highly scientific with a punch ball finally i sparred lightly with them myself in the rough they were impossible boxers after their initial distrust had evaporated under my gentle handling of them they forgot all i had taught them about position and guards they bored in heads down and arms going like semicircular pistons once or twice i had to stop them they were easily steadied they hastened to adopt a certain snakiness of attack instead of the frontal method which had left them so exposed they began to cultivate a kind of negative style they were tremendously impressed by the superiority of science over strength i am not sure that i did not harp rather too much on the scientific note perhaps if i had referred to it less the ultimate disaster would not have been quite so appalling on the other hand i had not the slightest suspicion that they would so exaggerate my meaning when i was remarking on the worth of science how it tells and how it causes the meagre stripling to play fast and loose with huge brawny ruffians no cowards mark you and hairy as to their chests but the weeds at hattons club were fascinated by my homilies on science the simplicity of the thing appealed to them irresistibly they caught at the expression science and regarded it as the hey presto of a friendly conjurer who could so arrange matters for them that powerful opponents would fall flat involuntarily at the sight of their technically correct attitude i did not like to destroy their illusions had i said to them look here science is no practical use to you unless youve got lowbridged snub noses protruding temples nostrils like the tubes of a vacuumcleaner stomach muscles like motorcar wheels hands like legs of mutton and biceps like transatlantic cables had i said that they would have voted boxing a fraud and gone away to quarrel over a game of backgammon which was precisely what i wished to avoid so i let them go on with their tapping and feinting and sideslipping to make it worse they overheard sidney price trying to pay me a compliment price was the insurance clerk who had attached himself to hatton and had proved himself to be of real service in many ways he was an honest man but he could not box he came down to the hall one night after i had given four or five lessons to watch the boys spar of course to the uninitiated eye it did seem as though they were neat in their work the sight was very different from the absurd exhibition which price had seen on the night i started with them he might easily have said if he was determined to compliment me that they had improved progressed or something equally adequate and innocuous but no the man must needs be effusive positively gushing he came to me in transports wonderful he said wonderful whats wonderful i said a shade irritably their style he said loudly so that they could all hear their style its their style that astonishes me i hustled him away as soon as i could but the mischief was done style ran through hattons club boys like an epidemic carnation hall fairly buzzed with style an apology for a blow which landed on your chest with the delicacy of an agag among butterflies was extolled to the skies because it was a stylish blow when alf joblin a recruit sent walter greenway sprawling with a random swing on the mark there was a pained shudder not only walter greenway but the whole club explained to alf that the swing was a bad swing an awful violation of style practically a crime by the time they had finished explaining alf was dazed and when invited by walter to repeat the hit with a view to his being further impressed with its want of style did so in such halfhearted fashion that walter had time to step stylishly aside and show alf how futile it is to be unscientific to the club this episode was decently buried in an unremembered past to me however it was significant though i did not imagine it would ever have the tremendous sequel which was brought about by the coming of thomas blake fate never planned a coup so successfully the psychology of blakes arrival was perfect the boxers of carnation hall had worked themselves into a mental condition which i knew was as ridiculous as it was dangerous their conceit and their imagination transformed the hall into a kind of improved national sporting club they went about with an air of subdued but tremendous athleticism they affected a sort of selfconscious nonchalance they adopted an odiously patronising attitude towards the once popular game of backgammon i daresay that picture is not yet forgotten where a british general a man of blood and iron is portrayed as playing with a baby to the utter neglect of a table full of important military dispatches well the club boys to a boy posed as generals of blood and iron when they condescended to play backgammon they did it but they let you see that they did not regard it as one of the serious things of life also knowing that each others hitting was so scientific as to be harmless they would sometimes deliberately put their eye in front of their opponents stylish left in the hope that the blow would raise a bruise it hardly ever did but occasionally oh then you should have seen the herowiththequietsmile look on their faces as they lounged ostentatiously about the place in a word they were above themselves they sighed for fresh worlds to conquer and thomas blake supplied the longfelt want personally i did not see his actual arrival i only saw his handiwork after he had been a visitor awhile within the hall but to avoid unnecessary verbiage and to avail myself of the privilege of an author i will set down from the evidence of witnesses the main points of the episode as though i myself had been present at his entrance he did not strike them i am informed as a particularly big man he was a shade under average height his shoulders seemed to them not so much broad as humpy he rolled straight in from the street on a wet saturday night at ten minutes to nine asking for free tea i should mention that on certain fridays hatton gave a free meal to his parishioners on the understanding that it was rigidly connected with a short address the preceding friday had been such an occasion the placards announcing the tea were still clinging to the outer railings of the hall when i said that blake asked for free tea i should have said shouted for free tea he cast one decisive glance at hattons placards and rolled up he shot into the gate up the steps down the passage and through the door leading into the big corrugatediron hall which i used for my lessons and all the time he kept shouting for free tea in the hall the members of my class were collected some were changing their clothes others already changed were tapping the punchball they knew that i always came punctually at nine oclock and they liked to be ready for me amongst those present was sidney price thomas blake brought up short hiccuping in the midst of them gimme that free tea he said sidney price whose moral fortitude has never been impeached was the first to handle the situation my good man he said i am sorry to say you have made a mistake a mistake said thomas quickly taking him up a mistake oh what oh my errer quite so said price diplomatically an error thomas blake sat down on the floor fumbled for a short pipe and said seems ter me im sick of errers sick of em made a bloomer this mornin this way here he took into his confidence the group which had gathered uncertainly round him my wifes brother im wots a postman owes me arf a bloomin thick un es a hardworking bloke and ter save im trouble i came down ere from brentford where my boat lies to catch im on is rounds lot of catchin e wanted too i dont think tracked im by the knocks at last and then wot dyer think e said didnt know nothing about no ruddy arf thick un and would i kindly cease to impede a public servant in the discharge of is dooty otherwise the perlice that mind you was my own brotherinlaw oh hes a nice man i dont think thomas blake nodded his head as one who though pained by the hollowness of life is resigned to it and proceeded to doze the crowd gazed at him and murmured sidney price however stepped forward with authority youd better be going he said and he gently jogged the recumbent boatmans elbow leave me be i want my tea was the muttered and lyrical reply hook it said price without my tea asked blake opening his eyes wide it was yesterday explained price brusquely there isnt any free tea tonight the effect was magical a very sinister expression came over the face of the prostrate one and he slowly clambered to his feet ho he said disengaging himself from his coat ho there aint no free tea ternight aint there bills stuck on them railings in errer i suppose another bloomin errer seems to me im sick of errers wot i says is come on all of yer im tom blake i am you can arst them down at brentford kind old tom blake wot wouldnt hurt a fly and i says come on all of yer and ill knock yer insides through yer backbones sidney price spoke again his words were honeyed but ineffectual im honest old tom i am boomed thomas blake and im ready for the lot of yer you and yer free tea and yer errers at this point alf joblin detached himself from the hovering crowd and said to price he must be cowed ill knock sense into the drunken brute well said price hes got to go but you wont hurt him alf will you no said alf i wont hurt him ill just make him look a fool this is where science comes in im honest old tom droned the boatman if you will have it said alf with fine aposiopesis he squared up to him now alf joblin like the other pugilists of my class habitually refrained from delivering any sort of attack until he was well assured that he had seen an orthodox opening a large part of every round between hattons boys was devoted to stealthy circular movements signifying nothing but thomas blake had not had the advantage of scientific tuition he came banging in with a sweeping right alf stopped him with his left again blake swung his right and again he took alfs stopping blow without a blink then he went straight in right and left in quick succession the force of the right was broken by alfs guard but the left got home on the mark and alf joblins wind left him suddenly he sat down on the floor to say that this tragedy in less than five seconds produced dismay among the onlookers would be incorrect they were not dismayed they were amused they thought that alf had laid himself open to chaff whether he had slipped or lost his head they did not know but as for thinking that alf with all his scientific knowledge was not more than a match for this ignorant intoxicated boatman such a reflection never entered their heads what is more each separate member of the audience was convinced that he individually was the proper person to illustrate the efficacy of style versus untutored savagery as soon therefore as alf joblin went writhing to the floor and thomas blakes voice was raised afresh in a universal challenge walter greenway stepped briskly forward and as soon as walters guard had been smashed down by a most unconventional attack and walter himself had been knocked senseless by a swing on the side of the jaw bill shale leaped gaily forth to take his place and so it happened that when i entered the building at nine it was as though a devastating tornado had swept down every club boy sparing only sidney price who was preparing miserably to meet his fate to me standing in the doorway the situation was plain at the first glance only by a big effort could i prevent myself laughing outright it was impossible to check a grin thomas blake saw me hullo i said whats all this he stared at me ullo he said another of em is it im honest old tom blake i am and wot i say is why honest mr blake i interrupted call me a liar then said he go on you do it call it me then and lets see he began to shuffle towards me who pinched his fathers trousers and popped them i inquired genially he stopped and blinked eh he said weakly and who i continued when sent with twopence to buy postagestamps squandered it on beer his jaw dropped as it had dropped in covent garden it must be very unpleasant to have ones past continually rising up to confront one look ere he said a conciliatory note in his voice you and mes pals mister aint we say were pals of course we are you and me dont want no fuss of course we dont then look here this is ow it is you come along with me and ave a drop it did not seem likely that my class would require any instruction in boxing that evening in addition to that which mr blake had given them so i went with him over the moisture as he facetiously described it he grew friendliness itself he did not ask after kit but gave his opinion of her gratuitously according to him she was unkind to her relations crool arsh he said a girl in fact who made no allowances for a man and was overprone to sauce and the nasty snack we parted the best of friends any time youre on the cut he said gripping my hand with painful fervour you look out for tom blake mister tom blake of the ashlade and lechton no ceremony jest drop in on me and the missis goo night at the moment of writing tom blake is rapidly acquiring an assured position in the heart of the british poetryloving public this incident in his career should interest his numerous admirers the world knows little of its greatest men chapter julians idea james orlebar cloysters narrative continued i had been relating on the morning after the blake affair the stirring episode of the previous night to julian he agreed with me that it was curious that our potatothrower of covent garden market should have crossed my path again but i noticed that though he listened intently enough he lay flat on his back in his hammock not looking at me but blinking at the ceiling and when i had finished he turned his face towards the wall which was unusual since i generally lunched on his breakfast as i was doing then to the accompaniment of quite a flow of languid abuse i was in particularly high spirits that morning for i fancied that i had found a way out of my difficulty about margaret that subject being uppermost in my mind i guessed at once what julians trouble was i think youd like to know julian i said whether id written to guernsey well its all right i said youve told her to come no but im able to take my respite without wounding her thats as good as writing isnt it we agreed on that yes that was the idea if you could find a way of keeping her from knowing how well you were getting on with your writing you were to take it whats your idea ive hit on a very simple way out of the difficulty i said it came to me only this morning all i need do is to sign my stuff with a pseudonym you only thought of that this morning yes why my dear chap i thought of it as soon as you told me of the fix you were in you might have suggested it julian slid to the floor drained the almost empty teapot rescued the last kidney and began his breakfast i would have suggested it he said if the idea had been worth anything what whats wrong with it my dear man its too risky its not as though you kept to one form of literary work youre so confoundedly versatile lets suppose you did sign your work with a nom de plume say george chandos all right george chandos well how long would it be do you think before paragraphs appeared announcing to the public not only of england but of the channel islands that george chandos was really jimmy cloyster what rot i said why the deuce should they want to write paragraphs about me im not a celebrity youre talking through your hat julian julian lit his pipe not at all he said count the number of people who must necessarily be in the secret from the beginning there are your publishers prodder and way then there are the editors of the magazine which publishes your society dialogue bilge and of all the newspapers other than the orb in which your serious verse appears my dear jimmy the news that you and george chandos were the same man would go up and down fleet street and into the barrel like wildfire and after that the paragraphs i saw the truth of his reasoning before he had finished speaking once more my spirits fell to the point where they had been before i hit upon what i thought was such a bright scheme julians pipe had gone out while he was talking he lit it again and spoke through the smoke the weak point of your idea of course is that you and george chandos are a single individual but why should the editors know that why shouldnt i simply send in my stuff typed by post and never appear myself at all my dear jimmy you know as well as i do that that wouldnt work it would do all right for a bit then one morning dear mr chandos i should be glad if you could make it convenient to call here some time between tuesday and thursday yours faithfully editor of somethingorother sooner or later a man who writes at all regularly for the papers is bound to meet the editors of them a successful author cant conduct all his business through the post of course if you chucked london and went to live in the country i couldnt i said i simply couldnt do it londons got into my bones it does said julian i like the country but i couldnt live there besides i dont believe i could write there not for long all my ideas would go julian nodded just so he said then exit george chandos my scheme is worthless you think then as you state it yes you mean i prompted quickly clutching at something in his tone which seemed to suggest that he did not consider the matter entirely hopeless i mean this the weak spot in your idea as i told you is that you and george chandos have the same body now if you could manage to provide george with separate flesh and blood of his own theres no reason by jove youve hit it go on listen here is my rough draft of what i think might be a sound working system how many divisions does your work fall into not counting the orb i reflected well of course i do a certain amount of odd work but lately ive rather narrowed it down and concentrated my output it seemed to me a better plan than sowing stuff indiscriminately through all the papers in london well how many stunts have you got theres your serious verse one and your society stuff two any more novels and short stories class them together three any more no thats all very well then what you must do is to look about you and pick carefully three men on whom you can rely divide your signed stuff between these three men they will receive your copy sign it with their own names and see that it gets to wherever you want to send it as far as the editorial world is concerned and as far as the public is concerned they will become actually the authors of the manuscripts which you have prepared for them to sign they will forward you the cheques when they arrive and keep accounts to which you will have access i suppose you will have to pay them a commission on a scale to be fixed by mutual arrangement as regards your unsigned work there is nothing to prevent your doing that yourself on your way i mean whenever theres any holiday work going general articles and light verse i say though half a moment why what ive thought of a difficulty the editors who have been taking your stuff hitherto may have a respect for the name of james orlebar cloyster which they may not extend to the name of john smith or george chandos or whoever it is i mean its quite likely the withdrawal of the name will lead to the rejection of the manuscript oh no thats all right i said its the stuff they want not the name i dont say that names dont matter they do but only if theyre big names kipling might get a story rejected if he sent it in under a false name which theyd have taken otherwise just because he was kipling what they want from me is the goods i can shove any label on them i like the editor will read my ghosts stuff see its what he wants and put it in he may say its rather like cloysters style but hell certainly add anyhow its what i want you can scratch that difficulty julian any more i think not of course theres the objection that youll lose any celebrity you might have got no onell say oh mr cloyster i enjoyed your last book so much and no onell say oh do you write mr cloyster how interesting what have you written you must send me a copy thats true in any case its celebrity against the respite obscurity against miss goodwin while the system is in operation you will be free but inglorious you choose freedom all right then pass the matches chapter the first ghost james orlebar cloysters narrative continued such was the suggestion julian made and i praised its ingenuity little thinking how bitterly i should come to curse it in the future i was immediately all anxiety to set the scheme working will you be one of my three middlemen julian i asked he shook his head thanks he said its very good of you but i darent encroach further on my hours of leisure skeffingtons sloe gin has already become an incubus i could not move him from this decision it is not everybody who in a moment of emergency can put his hand on three men of his acquaintance capable of carrying through a more or less delicate business for him certainly i found a difficulty in making my selection i ran over the list of my friends in my mind then i was compelled to take pencil and paper and settle down seriously to what i now saw would be a task of some difficulty after half an hour i read through my list and could not help smiling i had indeed a mixed lot of acquaintances first came julian and malim the two pillars of my world i scratched them out julian had been asked and had refused and as for malim i shrank from exposing my absurd compositions to his critical eye a man who could deal so trenchantly over a pipe and a whiskyandsoda with established reputations would hardly take kindly to seeing my work in print under his name i wished it had been possible to secure him but i did not disguise it from myself that it was not the rest of the list was made up of members of the barrel club impossible because of their inherent tendency to break out into personal paragraphs writers like fermin and gresham above me on the literary ladder and consequently unapproachable in a matter of this kind certain college friends who had vanished into space as men do on coming down from the varsity leaving no address john hatton sidney price and tom blake there were only three men in that list to whom i felt i could take my suggestion hatton was one price was another and blake was the third hatton should have my fiction price my society stuff blake my serious verse that evening i went off to the temple to sound hatton on the subject of signing my third book the wretched sale of my first two had acted as something of a check to my enthusiasm for novelwriting i had paused to take stock of my position my first two novels had i found on rereading them too much of the varsity tone in them to be popular that is the mistake a man falls into through being at cambridge or oxford he fancies unconsciously that the world is peopled with undergraduates he forgets that what appeals to an undergraduate public may be greek to the outside reader and unfortunately not compulsory greek the reviewers had dealt kindly with my two books this pleasant little squib full of quiet humour should amuse all who remember their undergraduate days but the great heart of the public had remained untouched as had the great purse of the public i had determined to adopt a different style and now my third book was ready it was called when it was lurid with the subtitle a tale of god and allah there was a piquant admixture of love religion and eastern scenery which seemed to point to a record number of editions i took the typescript of this book with me to the temple hatton was in i flung when it was lurid on the table and sat down whats this inquired hatton fingering the brownpaper parcel if its the corpse of a murdered editor i think its only fair to let you know that i have a prejudice against having my rooms used as a cemetery go and throw him into the river its anything but a corpse its the most lively bit of writing ever done theres enough fire in that book to singe your tablecloth you arent going to read it to me out loud he said anxiously no have i got to read it when youre gone not unless you wish to then why if i may ask do you carry about a parcel which i should say weighs anything between one and two tons simply to use it as a temporary table ornament is it the sandow system no i said its like this and suddenly it dawned on me that it was not going to be particularly easy to explain to hatton just what it was that i wanted him to do i made the thing clear at last suppressing of course my reasons for the move when he had grasped my meaning he looked at me rather curiously doesnt it strike you he said that what you propose is slightly dishonourable you mean that i have come deliberately to insult you hatton our conversation seems to be getting difficult unless you grant that honour is not one immovable intangible landmark fixed for humanity but that it is a commodity we all carry with us in varying forms personally i believe that as a help to identification honourimpressions would be as useful as fingerprints good you agree with me now you may have a different view but in my opinion if i were to pose as the writer of your books and gained credit for a literary skill i laughed you wont get credit for literary skill out of the sort of books i want you to put your name to theyre potboilers you neednt worry about fame youll be a martyr not a hero you may be right you wrote the book but in any case i should be more of a charlatan than i care about you wont do it i said im sorry it would have been a great convenience to me on the other hand continued hatton ignoring my remark there are arguments in favour of such a scheme as you suggest stout fellow i said encouragingly to examine the matter in its er financial to suppose for a moment briefly what do i get out of it ten per cent he looked thoughtful the end shall justify the means he said the money you pay me can do something to help the awful the continual poverty of lambeth yes james cloyster i will sign whatever you send me good for you i said and i shall come better out of the transaction than you no one would credit the way that man a clergyman too haggled over terms he ended by squeezing fifteen per cent out of me chapter the second ghost james orlebar cloysters narrative continued the reasons which had led me to select sidney price as the sponsor of my society dialogues will be immediately apparent to those who have read them they were just the sort of things you would expect an insurance clerk to write the humour was thin the satire as cheap as the papers in which they appeared and the vulgarity in exactly the right quantity for a public that ate it by the pound and asked for more every thing pointed to sidney price as the man it was my intention to allow each of my three ghosts to imagine that he was alone in the business so i did not get prices address from hatton who might have wondered why i wanted it and had suspicions i applied to the doorkeeper at carnation hall and on the following evening i rang the frontdoor bell of the hollyhocks belmont park road brixton whilst i was waiting on the step i was able to get a view through the slats of the venetian blind of the front groundfloor sittingroom i could scarcely restrain a cry of pure aesthetic delight at what i saw within price was sitting on a horsehair sofa with an arm round the waist of a rather goodlooking girl her eyes were fixed on his it was edwin and angelina in real life up till then i had suffered much discomfort from the illustrated record of their adventures in the comic papers is there really i had often asked myself a body of men so gifted that they can construct the impossible details of the lives of nonexistent types purely from imagination if such creative genius as theirs is unrecognized and ignored what hope of recognition is there for ones own work the thought had frequently saddened me but here at last they were edwin and angelina in the flesh i took the gallant sidney for a fifteenminute stroll up and down the length of the belmont park road poor angelina he came as he expressed it like a bird give him a sec to slip on a pair of boots he said and he would be with me in two ticks he was so busy getting his hat and stick from the stand in the passage that he quite forgot to tell the lady that he was going out and as we left i saw her with the tail of my eye sitting stolidly on the sofa still wearing patiently the expression of her comicpaper portraits the task of explaining was easier than it had been with hatton sorry to drag you out price i said as we went down the steps dont mention it mr cloyster he said norah wont mind a bit of a sit by herself looked in to have a chat or is there anything i can do its like this i said you know i write a good deal yes well it has occurred to me that if i go on turning out quantities of stuff under my own name theres a danger of the public getting tired of me he nodded now im with you there mind you he said cant have too much of a good thing some chaps say i say yes you can stands to reason a chap cant go on writing and writing without making a bloomer every now and then what he wants is to take his time over it look at all the real swells erbert spencer marie corelli and what not you dont find them pushing it out every day of the year they wait a bit and have a look round and then they start again when theyre ready stands to reason thats the only way quite right i said but the difficulty if you live by writing is that you must turn out a good deal or you dont make enough to live on ive got to go on getting stuff published but i dont want people to be always seeing my name about you mean adopt a nom de ploom thats the sort of idea but im going to vary it a little and i explained my plan but why me he asked when he had understood the scheme what made you think of me the fact is my dear fellow i said this writing is a game where personality counts to an enormous extent the man who signs my society dialogues will probably come into personal contact with the editors of the papers in which they appear he will be asked to call at their offices so you see i must have a man who looks as if he had written the stuff i see he said complacently dressy sort of chap chap who looks as if he knew a thing or two yes i couldnt get alf joblin for instance we laughed together at the notion poor old alf said sidney price now you probably know a good deal about society rather said sidney theyre a hot lot my word saw the walls of jericho three times gives it em pretty straight that does visits of elizabeth too chase me used to think some of us chaps in the moon were a bit ot but we arent in it not in the same street chaps i mean whod call a girl behind the bar by her christian name as soon as look at you one chap i knew used to give the girl at the cashdesk of the mecca he went to bottles of scent bottles of it regular here you are tottie he used to say heres another little donation from yours truly kissed her once slap in front of everybody saw him do it but bless you theyd think nothing of that in the smart set ever read gods good man theres a book my stars lets you see what goes on scorchers they are thats just what my dialogues point out i can count on you then he said i could he was an intelligent young man and he gave me to understand that all would be well he would carry the job through on the strict qt he closely willingly with my offer of ten per cent thus affording a striking contrast to the grasping hatton he assured me he had found literary chaps not half bad had occasionally had an idea of writing a bit himself we parted on good terms and i was pleased to think that i was placing my dialogues of mayfair and my london and country house tales in really competent and appreciative hands chapter the third ghost james orlebar cloysters narrative continued there only remained now my serious verse of which i turned out an enormous quantity it won a ready acceptance in many quarters notably the st stephens gazette already i was beginning to oust from their positions on that excellent journal the old crusted poetesses who had supplied it from its foundation with verse the prices they paid on the st stephens were in excellent taste in the musical world too i was making way rapidly lyrics of the teaandmuffin type streamed from my pen sleep whilst i sing love had brought me in an astonishing amount of money in spite of the musicpirates it was on the barrelorgans adults hummed it infants crooned it in their cots comic men at musichalls opened their turns by remarking soothingly to the conductor of the orchestra im going to sing now so you go to sleep love in a word while the boom lasted it was a little goldmine to me thomas blake was as obviously the man for me here as sidney price had been in the case of my society dialogues the public would find something infinitely piquant in the thought that its most sentimental ditties were given to it by the hornyhanded steerer of a canal barge he would be greeted as the modern burns people would ask him how he thought of his poems and he would say ooer and they would hail him as delightfully original in the case of thomas blake i saw my earnings going up with a bound his personality would be a noble advertisement he was aboard the ashlade or lechton on the cut so i was informed by kit which information was not luminous to me further inquiries however led me to the bridge at brentford whence starts that almost unknown system of inland navigation which extends to manchester and birmingham here i accosted at a venture a ruminative bargee tom blake he repeated reflectively oh es been off this three hours on a trip to braunston hell tie up tonight at the shovel wheres the shovel past cowley the shovel is this was spoken in a tired drawl which was evidently meant to preclude further chitchat to clinch things he slouched away waving me in an abstracted manner to the towpath i took the hint it was now three oclock in the afternoon judging by the pace of the barges i had seen i should catch blake easily before nightfall i set out briskly an hours walking brought me to hanwell and i was glad to see a regular chain of locks which must have considerably delayed the ashlade and lechton the afternoon wore on i went steadily forward making inquiries as to thomass whereabouts from the boats which met me and always hearing that he was still ahead footsore and hungry i overtook him at cowley the two boats were in the lock thomas and a lady presumably his wife were ashore on the ashlades raised cabin cover was a baby two patriarchallooking boys were respectively at the ashlades and lechtons tillers the lady was attending to the horse the water in the lock rose gradually to a higher level hold them tillers straight yelled thomas at which point i saluted him he was a little blank at first but when i reminded him of our last meeting his face lit up at once why youre the mister wot nuppie came in a shrill scream from the lady with the horse nuppie yes ada answered the boy on the ashlade liz aint tied to the can dyou want er to be drownded didnt i tell you to be sure and tie her up tight so i did ada shes untied herself again yes she as asnt she albert this appeal for corroboration was directed to the other small boy on the lechton it failed signally no you did not tie liz to the chimney you know you never nuppie wait till we get out of this lock said nuppie earnestly the water pouring in from the northern sluice was forcing the tillers violently against the southern sluice gates if them boys said tom blake in an overwrought voice lets them tillers go round its all up with my pair o boats lemme do it you the rest of the sentence was mercifully lost in the thump with which thomass feet bounded on the ashlades cabintop he made liz fast to the circular foot of iron chimney projecting from the boards then jumping back to the land he said more in sorrow than in anger lazy little brats an theyve ad their tea too clear of the locks i walked with thomas and his ancient horse trying to explain what i wanted done but it was not until we had tied up for the night had had beer at the shovel and nuppie and albert being safely asleep in the second cabin had met at supper that my instructions had been fully grasped thomas himself was inclined to be diffident and had it not been for ada would i think have let my offer slide she was enthusiastic it was she who told me of the cottage they had at fenny stratford which they used as headquarters whilst waiting for a cargo that can be used as a permanent address i said all you have to do is to write your name at the end of each typewritten sheet enclose it in the stamped envelope which i will send you and send it by post when the cheques come sign them on the back and forward them to me for every ten pounds you forward me ill give you one for yourself in any difficulty simply write to me heres my own address and ill see you through it we cant go to prison for it can we mister asked ada suddenly after a pause no i said theres nothing dishonest in what i propose oh she didnt so much mean that said thomas thoughtfully they gave me a shakedown for the night in the cargo just before turning in i said casually if anyone except me cashed the cheques by mistake hed go to prison quick yes mister came back thomass voice again a shade thoughtfully modulated chapter eva eversleigh james orlebar cloysters narrative continued with my system thus in full swing i experienced the intoxication of assured freedom to say i was elated does not describe it i walked on air this was my state of mind when i determined to pay a visit to the guntoncresswells i had known them in my college days but since i had been engaged in literature i had sedulously avoided them because i remembered that margaret had once told me they were her friends but now there was no need for me to fear them on that account and thinking that the solid comfort of their house in kensington would be far from disagreeable thither one afternoon in spring i made my way it is wonderful how friendly convention is to art when art does not appear to want to borrow money no kensington lane w is the stronghold of british respectability it is more respectable than the most respectable suburb its attitude to mayfair is that of a mother to a daughter who has gone on the stage and made a success kensington lane is almost tolerant of mayfair but not quite it admits the success but shakes its head mrs guntoncresswell took an early opportunity of drawing me aside and began gently to pump me after i had responded with sufficient docility to her leads she reiterated her delight at seeing me again i had concluded my replies with the words i am a struggling journalist mrs cresswell i accompanied the phrase with a halfsmile which she took to mean as i intended she should that i was amusing myself by dabbling in literature backed by a small but adequate private income oh come james she said smiling approvingly you know you will make a quite too dreadfully clever success how dare you try to deceive me like that a struggling journalist indeed but i knew she liked that struggling journalist immensely she would couple me and my own epithet together before her friends she would enjoy unconsciously an imperceptible but exquisite sensation of patronage by having me at her house even if she discussed me with margaret i was safe for margaret would give an altogether different interpretation of the smile with which i described myself as struggling my smile would be mentally catalogued by her as brave for it must not be forgotten that as suddenly as my name had achieved a little publicity just so suddenly had it utterly disappeared towards the end of may it happened that julian dropped into my rooms about three oclock and found me gazing critically at a tophat ive seen you he remarked rather often in that getup lately it is perhaps losing its first gloss i answered inspecting my hat closely i cared not a bit for julians sneers for the smell of the fleshpots of kensington had laid hold of my soul and i was resolved to make the most of the respite which my system gave me what salon is to have the honour today he asked spreading himself on my sofa im going to the guntoncresswells i replied julian slowly sat up ah he said conversationally ive been asked to meet their niece a miss eversleigh whom theyve invited to stop with them funny by the way that her name should be the same as yours not particularly said julian shortly shes my cousin my cousin eva this was startling there was a pause presently julian said do you know jimmy that if i were not the philosopher i am id curse this awful indolence of mine i saw it in a flash and went up to him holding out my hand in sympathy thanks he said gripping it but dont speak of it i couldnt endure that even from you james its too hard for talking if it was only myself whose life id spoilt if it was only myself he broke off and then hers too shes true as steel i had heard no more bitter cry than that i began to busy myself amongst some manuscripts to give julian time to compose himself and so an hour passed at a quarter past four i got up to go out julian lay recumbent it seemed terrible to leave him brooding alone over his misery a closer inspection however showed me he was asleep meanwhile eva eversleigh and i became firm friends of her person i need simply say that it was the most beautiful that nature ever created pressed as to details i should add that she was petite dark had brown hair very big blue eyes a retrouss nose and a rather wide mouth julian had said she was true as steel therefore i felt no diffidence in manoeuvring myself into her society on every conceivable occasion sometimes she spoke to me of julian whom i admitted i knew and with feminine courage she hid her hopeless alldevouring affection for her cousin under the cloak of ingenuous levity she laughed nearly every time his name was mentioned about this time the guntoncresswells gave a dance i looked forward to it with almost painful pleasure i had not been to a dance since my last mayweek at cambridge also no kensington lane had completely usurped the position i had previously assigned to paradise to waltz with julians cousin that was the ambition which now dwarfed my former hankering for the fame of authorship or a habitation in bohemia mrs goodwin once said that happiness consists in anticipating an impossible future be that as it may i certainly thought my sensations were pleasant enough when at length my hansom pulled up jerkily beside the redcarpeted steps of no kensington lane as i paid the fare i could hear the murmur from within of a waltz tune and i kept repeating to myself that eva had promised me the privilege of taking her in to supper and had given me the last two waltzes and the first two extras i went to pay my devoirs to my hostess she was supinely gamesome ah she said showing her excellent teeth genius attendant at the revels of terpsichore where beauty mrs guntoncresswell i responded cutting it as though mutton thick teaches een the humblest visitor the reigning muses art you may have this one if you like said mrs guntoncresswell simply supper came at last and with supper eva i must now write it down that she was not a type of english beauty she was not i mean queenly impassive neveranythingbuthercoolcalm self tonight for instance her eyes were as i had never seen them there danced in them the merriest glitter which was more than a mere glorification of the ordinary merry glitter which scores of girls possess at every ball to begin with there was a diabolical abandon in evas glitter which raised it instantly above the common herds and behind it all was that very misty mist i dont know whether all men have seen that mist but i am sure that no man has seen it more than once and from what ive seen of the average man i doubt if most of them have ever seen it at all well there it was for me to see in eva eversleighs eyes that night at supper it made me think of things unspeakable i felt a rush of classic aestheticism arcadia helen of troy the happy valleys of the early greeks supper i believe i gave her oyster pts but i was far away deep deep deep in evas eyes i saw a craft sighting neath a cloudless azure sky the dark blue symplegades heard in my ears the jargon loud and near me of the sailors and faintly oer the distance of the deadcalm sea rose intermittently the sound of brinefoam at the clashing rocks as we sat there ttette she smiled across the table at me with such perfect friendliness it seemed as though a magic barrier separated our two selves from all the chattering rustling crowd around us when she spoke a little quiver of feeling blended adorably with the low sweet tones of her voice we talked indeed of trifles but with just that charming hint of intimacy which men friends have who may have known one another from birth and may know one another for a lifetime but never become bores never change only when it comes between a woman and a man it is incomparably finer it is the talk of course of lovers who have not realised they are in love the two last waltzes i murmured when parting with her she nodded i roamed the guntoncresswellss rooms awaiting them she danced those two last waltzes with strangers the thing was utterly beyond me at the time looking back i am still amazed to what lengths deliberate coquetry can go she actually took pains to elude me and gave those waltzes to strangers from being comfortably rocked in the dark blue waters of a grecian sea i was suddenly transported to the realities of the ballroom my theoretical love for eva was now a substantial truth i was in an agony of desire in a frenzy of jealousy i wanted to hurl the two strangers to opposite corners of the ballroom but civilisation forbade it i was now in an altogether indescribable state of nerves and suspense had she definitely and for some unfathomable reason decided to cut me the first extra drew languorously to a close couples swept from the room to the grounds the gallery or the conservatory i tried to steady my whirling head with a cigarette and a whiskyandsoda in the smokingroom the orchestra like a train starting tentatively on a long run launched itself mildly into the preliminary bars of tout passe i sought the ballroom blinded by my feelings pulling myself together with an effort i saw her standing alone it struck me for the first time that she was clothed in cream her skin gleamed shining white she stood erect her arms by her sides behind her was a huge black velvet portire of many folds supported by two dull brazen columns as i advanced towards her two or three men bowed and spoke to her she smiled and dismissed them and still smiling pleasantly her glance traversed the crowd and rested upon me i was drawing now quite near her eyes met mine nor did she avert them and stooping a little to address her i heard her sigh youre tired i said forgetting my two last dances forgetting everything but that i loved her perhaps i am she said taking my arm we turned in silence to the portire and found ourselves in the hall the doors were opened some servants were there at the bottom of the steps i chanced to see a yellow light find out if that cabs engaged i said to a footman the cool air i said to eva the cab is not engaged sir said the footman returning yes said eva in answer to my glance drive to the corner of sloane street by way of the park i told the driver i have said that i had forgotten everything except that i loved her could it help remembrance now that we two sped alone through empty streets her warm palpitating body touching mine julian his friendship for me his love for eva margaret and her love for me my own honour these things were blotted from my brain eva i murmured and i took her hand eva her wonderful eyes met mine the mist in them seemed to turn to dew my darling she whispered very low and the road being deserted i drew her face to mine and kissed her chapter i tell julian james orlebar cloysters narrative continued is any man really honourable i wonder hundreds thousands go triumphantly through life with that reputation but how far is this due to absence of temptation life which is like cricket in so many ways resembles the game in this also a batsman makes a century and having made it is bowled by a ball which he is utterly unable to play what if that ball had come at the beginning of his innings instead of at the end of it men go through life without a stain on their honour i wonder if it simply means that they had the luck not to have the good ball bowled to them early in their innings to take my own case i had always considered myself a man of honour i had a code that was rigid compared with that of a large number of men in theory i should never have swerved from it i was fully prepared to carry out my promise and marry margaret at the expense of my happiness until i met eva i would have done anything to avoid injuring julian my friend until i met eva eva was my temptation and i fell nothing in the world mattered so that she was mine i ought to have had a revulsion of feeling as i walked back to my rooms in walpole street the dance was over the music had ceased the dawn was chill and at a point midway between kensington lane and the brompton oratory i had proposed to eversleighs cousin his eva true as steel and had been accepted yet i had no remorse i did not even try to justify my behaviour to julian or to margaret or for she must suffer too to mrs guntoncresswell who i knew well was socially ambitious for her niece to all these things i was indifferent i repeated softly to myself we love each other from this state of coma however i was aroused by the appearance of my windowblind i saw in fact that my room was illuminated remembering that i had been careful to put out my lamp before i left i feared as i opened the hall door a troublesome encounter with a mad housebreaker mad for no room such as mine could attract a burglar who has even the slightest pretensions to sanity it was not a burglar it was julian eversleigh and he was lying asleep on my sofa there was nothing peculiar in this i roused him julian i said im glad youre back he said sitting up ive some news for you so have i said i for i had resolved to tell him what i had done hear mine first its urgent miss margaret goodwin has been here my heart seemed to leap today i cried yes i had called to see you and was waiting a little while on the chance of your coming in when i happened to look out of the window a girl was coming down the street looking at the numbers of the houses she stopped here intuition told me she was miss goodwin while she was ringing the bell i did all i could to increase the shabby squalor of your room she was shown in here and i introduced myself as your friend we chatted i drew an agonising picture of your struggle for existence you were brave talented and unsuccessful though you went often hungry you had a plucky smile upon your lips it was a meritorious bit of work miss goodwin cried a good deal she is charming i was so sorry for her that i laid it on all the thicker where is she now nearing guernsey shes gone gone i said without seeing me i dont understand you dont understand how she loves you james but shes gone gone without a word she has gone because she loved you so she had intended to stay with the guntoncresswells she knows them it seems they didnt know she was coming she didnt know herself until this morning she happened to be walking on the quay at st peters port the outwardbound boat was on the point of starting for england a wave of affection swept over miss goodwin she felt she must see you scribbling a note which she despatched to her mother she went aboard she came straight here then when i had finished with her when i had lied consistently about you for an hour she told me she must return i must not see james she said you have torn my heart i should break down and she said speaking i think half to herself your courage is so noble so different from mine and i must not impose a needless strain upon it you shall not see me weep for you and then she went away julians voice broke he was genuinely affected by his own recital for my part i saw that i had bludgeon work to do it is childish to grumble at the part fate forces one to play sympathetic or otherwise one can only enact ones rle to the utmost of ones ability mine was now essentially unsympathetic but i was determined that it should be adequately played i went to the fireplace and poked the fire into a blaze then throwing my hat on the table and lighting a cigarette i regarded julian cynically youre a nice sort of person arent you i said what do you mean asked julian startled as i had meant that he should be by the question i laughed arent you just a little transparent my dear julian he stared blankly i took up a position in front of the fire disloyalty i said tolerantly where a woman is concerned is in the eyes of some people almost a negative virtue i dont know what on earth youre talking about dont you i was sorry for him all the time in a curiously impersonal way i could realise the depths to which i was sinking in putting this insult upon him but my better feelings were gagged and bound that night the one thought uppermost in my mind was that i must tell julian of eva and that by his story of margaret he had given me an opening for making my confession with the minimum of discomfort to myself it was pitiful to see the first shaft of my insinuation slowly sink into him i could see by the look in his eyes that he had grasped my meaning jimmy he gasped you cant think are you joking i am not surprised at your asking that question i replied pleasantly you know how tolerant i am but im not joking not that i blame you my dear fellow margaret is or used to be very goodlooking you seem to be in earnest he said in a dazed way my dear fellow i said i have a certain amount of intuition you spend an hour here alone with margaret she is young and very pretty you are placed immediately on terms of intimacy by the fact that you have in myself a subject of mutual interest that breaks the ice you are at crosspurposes but your main sympathies are identical also you have a strong objective sympathy for margaret i think we may presuppose that this second sympathy is stronger than the first it pivots on a woman not on a man and on a woman who is present not on a man who is absent you see my meaning at any rate the solid fact remains that she stayed an hour with you whom she had met for the first time today and did not feel equal to meeting me whom she has loved for two years if you want me to explain myself further i have no objection to doing so i mean that you made love to her i watched him narrowly to see how he would take it the dazed expression deepened on his face you are apparently sane he said very wearily you seem to be sober i am both i said there was a pause its no use for me he began evidently collecting his thoughts with a strong effort to say your charge is preposterous i dont suppose mere denial would convince you i can only say instead that the charge is too wild to be replied to except in one way which is this employ for a moment your own standard of right and wrong i know your love story and you know mine miss eversleigh my cousin is to me what miss goodwin is to you true as steel my loyalty and my friendship for you are the same as your loyalty and your friendship for me well well if i have spent an hour with miss goodwin you have spent more than an hour with my cousin what right have you to suspect me more than i have to suspect you judge me by your own standard i do i said and i find myself still suspecting you he stared i dont understand you perhaps you will when you have heard the piece of news which i mentioned earlier in our conversation that i had for you well i proposed to your cousin at the guntoncresswellss dance tonight and she accepted me the news had a surprising effect on julian first he blinked then he craned his head forward in the manner of a deaf man listening with difficulty then he left the room without a word he had not been gone two minutes when there were three short sharp taps at my window julian returned impossible yet who else could have called on me at that hour i went to the front door and opened it on the steps stood the rev john hatton beside him sidney price and lurking in the background tom blake of the ashlade and lechton end of james orlebar cloisters narrative sidney prices narrative chapter a ghostly gathering norah perkins is a peach and i dont care who knows it but all the same theres no need to tell her every little detail of a mans past life not that ive been a don whatshisname far from it costs a bit too much that game you simply cant do it on sixty quid a year paid monthly and thats all there is about it not but what i dont often think of going it a bit when things are slack at the office and my pal in the new business department is out for lunch its the loneliness makes you think of going a regular plunger more than once when tommy milner hasnt been there to talk to i tell you ive half a mind to take out some girl or other to tea at the cabin i have straight yet somehow when the assist cash comes round with the wicker tray on the st and gives you the envelope mr price and you take out the five sovereigns well somehow theres such a lot of other things which you dont want to buy but have just got to tommy milner said the other day and i quite agree with him when i took my clean handkerchief out last fortnight he said i couldnt help totting up what a lot i spend on trifles thats it there youve got it in a nutshell washing bootlaces bustickets trifles in fact thats where the coin goes only the other morning i bust my braces i was late already and pinning them together all but lost me the only it was a bit behind time it struck me then as i ran to the station that the average person would never count braces an expense trifles thats what it is no i may have smoked a cig too much and been so chippy next day that i had to go out and get a cup of tea at the abc or i may now and again have gone up west of an evening for a bit of a look round but beyond that ive never been really what youd call vicious very likely its been my friendship for mr hatton thats curbed me breaking out as ive sometimes imagined myself doing when ive been alone in the new business room though i must say in common honesty to myself that theres always been the fear of getting the sack from the moon the moon isnt like some other insurance companies i could mention whichll take anyone your refs must be a or you dont stand an earthly simply not an earthly besides the moon isnt an insurance company at all its an assurance company of course now ive chucked the moon shot the moon as tommy milner whos the office comic put it and taken to literature i could do pretty well what i liked if it werent for norah which brings me back to what i was saying just now that im not sure whether i shall tell her the past i may and i may not ill have to think it over anyway im going to write it down first and see how it looks if its all right it can go into my autobiography if it isnt then i shall lie low about it thats the posish it all started from my friendship with mr hatton the rev mr hatton if it hadnt have been for that man i should still be working out rates of percentage for the moon and listening to tommy milners socalled witticisms of course ive cut him now a literary man a man who supplies the strawberry leaf with two columns of social interludes at a salary im not going to mention in case norah gets to hear of it and wants to lash out a man whose society novels are competed for by every publisher in london and new york well can a man in that position be expected to keep up with an impudent little ledgerlugger like tommy milner it cant be done i first met the reverend on the top of box hill one saturday afternoon bike had punctured and the reverend gave me the loan of his cyclists repairing outfit we had our tea together watercress breadandbutter and two sorts of jam one bob per head he issued an invite to his diggings in the temple cocoa and cigs of an evening regular pally him and me was then he got into the way of taking me down to a boys club that he had started terrors they were so to put it fair outandout terrors but they all thought a lot of the reverend and so did i consequently it was all right the next link in the chain was a chap called cloyster james orlebar cloyster the reverend brought him down to teach boxing for my own part i dont fancy anything in the way of brutality the club so i thought had got on very nicely with more intellectual pursuits draughts chess bagatelle and whatnot but the rev wanted boxing and boxing it had to be not that it would have done for him or me to have mixed ourselves up in it he had his congregation to consider and i am often on duty at the downstairs counter before the very heart of the public a black eye or a missing tooth wouldnt have done at all for either of us being as we were in a sense officials but cloyster never seemed to realise this not to put too fine a point upon it cloyster was not my idea of a gentleman he had no tact the next link was a confirmed dipsomaniac a terrible phrase unavoidable though a very evil man is tom blake yet out of evil cometh good and it was tom blake who indirectly stopped the boxing lessons the club boys never wore the gloves after drunken blakes visit i shall never no positively never forget that night in june when matters came to a head in shaftesbury avenue oh i say it was a bit hot very warm each successive phase is limned indelibly thats the sort of literary style ive got if wanted on the tablets of my memory id been up west and who should i run across in oxford street but my old friend charlie cookson very good company is charlie cookson see him at a shilling hop at the holborn hes pretty much all there all the time wellknown follower of course purely as an amateur of the late dan leno king of comedians good penetrating voice writes his own inbetween bits you know what i mean the funny observations on mothersinlaw motors and marriage marked spoken in the songbooks fellows often tell him hed make a mint of money in the halls and theres a rumour flying round among us who knew him in the moon that he was seen coming out of a bedford street variety agency the other day well i met charlie at something after ten directly he spotted me he was at his antics standing stock still on the pavement in a crouching attitude and grasping his umbrella like a tomahawk his humours always highclass but hes the sort of fellow who doesnt care a blow what he does chronic in that respect absolutely the passersby couldnt think what he was up to whoopwhoopwhoop thats what he said he did straight only yelled it i thought it was going a bit too far in a public place so to show him i just said good evening cookson how are you this evening with all his entertaining ways hes sometimes slow at taking a hint no tact if you see what i mean in this case for instance he answered at the top of his voice bolly golly yah and pretended to scalp me with his umbrella i immediately ducked and somehow knocked my bowler against his elbow he caught it as it was falling off my head then he said indian brave give little pale face chief his hat this was really too much and i felt relieved when a policeman told us to move on charlie said come and have two pennorth of something well we stayed chatting over our drinks in fact i was well into my second lemon and dash at the stockwood hotel until nearly eleven at five to charlie said goodbye because he was living in and i walked out into the charing cross road meaning to turn down shaftesbury avenue so as to get a breath of fresh air outside the oxford there was a bit of a crowd i asked a man standing outside a tobacconists what the trouble was says he wont go away without kissing the girl that sang empire boys was the reply bin shiftin it e as not arf sure enough from the midst of the crowd came yew are ther boys of the empire steady an brave an trew yew are the wuns she calls er sons an i luv yew i had gone out of curiosity to the outskirts of the crowd and before i knew what had happened i found myself close to the centre of it a large man in dirty corduroys stood with his back to me his shape seemed strangely familiar still singing and swaying to horrible angles all over the shop he slowly pivoted round in a moment i recognised the bleary features of tom blake at the same time he recognised me he stretched out a long arm and seized me by the shoulder oh he sobbed i thought i ad no friend in the wide world except er but now ive got yew its orlright yus yus its orlright a murmur almost a cheer it was circulated among the crowd but a policeman stepped up to me now then said the policeman wots all this about yew are the wuns she calls er sons shouted blake ho thats yer little game is it said the policeman move on dyer hear pop off i will said blake ill never do it again i promise faithful never to do it again ive found a fren do you know this covey asked the policeman deny it if yer dare said blake jus you deny it thats orl an ill tell the parson slightly constable i said i mean ive seen him before then youd better take im off if you dont want im locked up im want me locked up were bosum frens aint we old dear said blake linking his arm in mine and dragging me away with him behind us the policeman was shunting the spectators oh it was excessively displeasing to any man of culture i can assure you how we got along shaftesbury i dont know its a subject i do not care to think about by leaning heavily on my shoulder and using me so to speak as ballast drunken blake just managed to make progress i cannot say unostentatiously but at any rate not so noticeably as to be taken into custody i didnt know mind you where we were going to and i didnt know when we were going to stop in this frightful manner of progression we had actually gained sight of piccadilly circus when all of a sudden a voice hissed in my ear sidney price i am disappointed in you hissed mind you i tell you i jumped thought id bitten my tongue off at first if drunken blake hadnt been clutching me so tight you could have knocked me down with a feather bowled me over clean it startled blake a goodish bit too all along the avenue hed been making just a quiet sort of snivelling noise crikey if he didnt speak up quite perky o my fren he says so drunk and yet so young meaning me if you please it was too thick you blighter i says you blooming blighter you talk to me like that let go of my arm and see me knock you down i must have been a bit excited you see to say that then i looked round to see who the other individual was youll hardly credit me when i tell you it was the reverend but it was honest truth it was the rev john hatton and no error his face fairly frightened me simply blazing red fair scarlet he kept by the side of us and let me have it all he could i thought you knew better price thats what he said i thought you knew better here are you a friend of mine a member of the club a man ive trusted going about the streets of london in a bestial state of disgusting intoxication thats enough in itself but youve done worse than that youve lured poor blake into intemperance yes with all your advantages of education and upbringing you deliberately set to work to put temptation in the way of poor weak hardworking blake drunkenness is blakes besetting sin and you blake had been silently wagging his head as pleased as punch at being called hardworking but here he shoved in his oar ow dare yer he burst out i aint never tasted a drop o beer in my natural born an bred teetotal thats wot i was and dont yew forget it neither blake said the reverend thats not the truth call me a drunkard do yer replied blake go on say it again say im a blarsted liar wont yer orlright then i shall run away and with that he wrenched himself away from me and set off towards the circus he was trying to run but his advance took the form of semicircular sweeps all over the pavement he had circled off so unexpectedly that he had gained some fifty yards before we realised what was happening we must stop him said the reverend as im intoxicated i said coldly being a bit fed up with things i should recommend you stopping him mr hatton ive done you an injustice said the reverend you have said i blake was now nearing a policeman stop him we both shouted starting to run forward the policeman brought blake to a standstill friend of yours said the constable when we got up to him yes said the reverend you ought to look after him better said the constable well really i like that said the reverend but he caught my eye and began laughing our best plan he said is to get a fourwheeler and go down to the temple theres some supper there what do you say im on i said and to the temple we accordingly journeyed tom blake was sleepy and immobile we spread him without hindrance on a sofa where he snored peacefully whilst the reverend brought eggs and a slab of bacon out of a cupboard in the kitchen he also brought a fryingpan and a bowl of fat is your cooking anything extra good he asked no mr hatton i answered rather stiff ive never cooked anything in my life i may not be in a very high position in the moon but ive never descended to menials work yet for about five minutes after that the reverend was too busy to speak then he said without turning his head away from the hissing pan i wish youd do me a favour price certainly i said look in the cupboard and see whether there are any knives forks plates and a loaf and a bit of butter will you i looked and sure enough they were there yes theyre all here i called to him and is there a tray yes theres a tray now its a funny thing that my laundress he shouted back cant bring in breakfast things for more than one on that particular tray shes always complaining its too small and says i ought to buy a bigger one nonsense i exclaimed shes quite wrong about that you watch what i can carry in one load and i packed the tray with everything he had mentioned what price that i said putting the whole boiling on the sittingroom table the reverend began to roar with laughter its ridiculous he chuckled i shall tell her its ridiculous she ought to be ashamed of herself shortly after we had supper previously having aroused blake the drunken fellow seemed completely restored by his repose he ate more than his share of the eggs and bacon and drank five cups of tea then he stretched himself lit a clay pipe and offered us his tobacco box from which the reverend filled his briar i remained true to my packet of queen of the harem i shall think twice before chucking up cig smoking as long as queen of the harem dont go above tuppencehalfpenny per ten we were sitting there smoking in front of the fire it was a shade parky for the time of year and not talking a great deal when the reverend said to blake things are looking up on the canal arent they tom no said blake things aint lookin up on the canal got a little house property said the reverend to spend when you feel like it no said the other i aint got no ouse property to spend ah said the reverend cheesing it and sucking his pipe dessay yer think im free with the rhino said blake after a while i was only wondering said the reverend blake stared first at the reverend and then at me ever remember a party of the name of cloyster mr james orlebar cloyster he inquired yes we both said es a good man said blake been giving you money asked the reverend es put me into the way of earning it its the sorfest job ever i struck e told me not to say nothin and i said as ow i wouldnt but it aint fair to mr cloyster not keeping of it dark aint yew dont know what a noble eart that mans got an if you werent fren of is i couldnt have told you but as you are frens of is as were all frens of is ill take it on myself to tell you wot that noblenatured man is giving me money for blowed if e shall ide his bloomin light under a blanky bushel any longer and then he explained that for putting his name to a sheet or two of paper and addressing a few envelopes he was getting more money than he knew what to do with mind you he said i play it fair i only take wot he says im to take the rest goes to im my old missus sees to all that part of it cos shes quicker at figures nor wot i am while he was speaking i could hardly contain myself the reverend was listening so carefully to every word that i kept myself from interrupting but when hed got it off his chest i clutched the reverends arm and said whats it mean cant say said he knitting his brows is he straight i said all on the jump i hope so hope so you dont think theres a doubt of it i suppose not but surely its very unselfish of you to be so concerned over blakes business blakes business be jiggered i said its my business too im doing for mister james orlebar cloyster exactly what blakes doing and im making money you dont understand on the contrary im just beginning to understand you see im doing for mr james orlebar cloyster exactly the same service as you and blake and im getting money from him too chapter one in the eye sidney prices narrative continued serpose i oughtnt ter ave let on thats it aint it from tom blake seemed to me that if one of the three gave the show away to the other two the compact made by each of the other two came to an end automatically from myself the reason i have broken my promise of secrecy is this that im determined we three shall make a united demand for a higher rate of payment you of course have your own uses for the money i need mine for those humanitarian objects for which my whole life is lived from the reverend wot o said blake more coin wot o might ave thought o that before im with you sir said i were entitled to a higher rate ill make a memo to that effect no no said the reverend we can do better than that we three should have a personal interview with cloyster and tell him our decision when i asked now at once we are here together and i see no reason to prevent our arranging the matter within the hour but hell be asleep i objected he wont be asleep much longer yus roust im outer bed thats wot i say wot o for more coin it was now halfpast two in the morning id missed the back to brixton slap bang pop hours ago so i thought i might just as well make a night of it we jumped into our overcoats and hats and hurried to fleet street we walked towards the strand until we found a fourwheeler we then drove to no walpole street the clocks struck three as the reverend paid the cab hullo said he why theres a light in cloysters sittingroom he cant have gone to bed yet his late hours save us a great deal of trouble and he went up the two or three steps which led to the front door a glance at tom blake showed me that the bargedriver was alarmed he looked solemn and did not speak i felt funny too like when i first handed round the collectionplate in our parish church sort of empty feeling but the reverend was all there spry and businesslike he leaned over the area railing and gave three short sharp taps on the ground floor window with his walkingstick behind the lighted blind appeared the shadow of a mans figure its he its him came respectively and simultaneously from the reverend and myself after a bit of waiting the latch clicked and the door opened the door was opened by mr cloyster himself he was in evening dress and hysterics i thought i had heard a rummy sound from the other side of the door couldnt account for it at the time must have been him laughing at the sight of us he tried to pull himself together he half succeeded after a bit and asked us to come in to say his room was plainly furnished doesnt express it the apartment was like a prison cell ive never been in gaol of course but i read convict when it ran in a serial the fire was out the chairs were hard and the whole thing was uncomfortable never struck such a shoddy place in my natural ever since i called on a man i know slightly who was in the hand of blood travelling company no b delighted to see you im sure said mr cloyster in fact i was just going to sit down and write to you really said the reverend well weve come of our own accord and weve come to talk business then turning to blake and me he added may i state our case most certainly sir i answered and blake gave a nod briefly then said the reverend our mission is this that we three want our contracts revised what contracts said mr cloyster our contracts connected with your manuscripts since when have the several matters of business which i arranged privately with each of you become public tonight it was quite unavoidable we met by chance we are not to blame tom blake was yes he looks as if he had been our amended offer is half profits more coin murmured blake huskily wot o i regret that youve had your journey for nothing you refuse absolutely my dear cloyster i had expected you to take this attitude but surely its childish of you you are bound to accede why not do so at once bound to accede i dont follow you yes bound the present system which you are working is one you cannot afford to destroy that is clear because had it not been so you would never have initiated it i do not know for what reason you were forced to employ this system but i do know that powerful circumstances must have compelled you to do so you are entirely in our hands i said just now i was delighted to see you and that i had intended to ask you to come to me one by one of course for i had no idea that the promise of secrecy which you gave me had been broken the reverend shrugged his shoulders do you know why i wanted to see you no to tell you that i had decided to abandon my system to notify you that you would in future receive no more of my work there was a dead silence i think ill go home to bed said the reverend blake and myself followed him out mr cloyster thanked us all warmly for the excellent way in which we had helped him he said that he was now engaged to be married and had to save every penny otherwise i should have tried to meet you in this affair of the halfprofits he added that we had omitted to congratulate him on his engagement his words came faintly to our ears as we tramped down walpole street nor did we as far as i can remember give back any direct reply tell you what it was just like reminded me of it even at the time that picture of napoleon coming back from moscow the reverend was napoleon and we were the generals and if there were three humpier men walking the streets of london at that moment i should have liked to have seen them chapter in the soup sidney prices narrative continued they give you a small bonus at the moon if you get through a quarter without being late which just shows the sort of scale on which the moon does things cookson down at the oxford street emporium gets fined regular when hes late shilling the first hour and twopence every five minutes after ive known gentlemen in banks railway companies dry goods and woollen offices the indian trade jute tea every manner of shop but they all say the same thing we are ruled by fear its fear that drags them out of bed in the morning its fear that makes them bolt or even miss their sausages its fear that makes them run to catch their train but the moons method is of a different standard the moon does not intimidate no it entwines itself round it insinuates itself into the hearts of its employees it suggests in fact that we should not be late by offering us this small bonus no insurance office and up to the time of writing no other assurance office has been able to boast as much the same cause is at the bottom of the moons high reputation both inside and outside it does things in a big way its spacious the moons timing system is great too great in its simplicity the regulation says youve got to be in the office by ten oclock suppose you arrive with ten minutes to spare you go into the outer office theres only one entrance the big one in threadneedle street and find on the righthand side of the circular counter a ledger the ledger is open there is blottingpaper and a quill pen beside it everyones name is written in alphabetical order on the one side of the ledger and on the other side there is a blank page ruled down the middle with a red line having made your appearance at ten to ten you put your initials in a line with your name on the page opposite and to the left of the division if on the other hand youve missed your train and dont turn up till ten minutes past ten youve got to initial your name on the other side of the red line in the space on the right of the line a thick black dash has been drawn by leach the cashier he does this on the last stroke of ten it makes the page look neat he says which is quite right and proper i see his point of view entirely the ledger must look decent in an office like the moon tommy milner agrees with me he says that not only does it look better but it prevents unfortunate mistakes on the part of those who come in late they might forget and initial the wrong side after ten the book goes into mr leachs private partition and youve got to go in there to sign it was there when i came into the office on the morning after wed been to talk business with mr cloyster it had been there about an hour and a half lost your bonus price my boy said genial mr leach and the general manager mr fennell who had stepped out of his own room close by heard him say it i do not imagine that mr price is greatly perturbed on that account he will no doubt shortly be forsaking us for literature what commerce loses art gains said the gm he may have meant to be funny or he may not some of those standing near took him one way others the other some gravely bowed their heads others burst into guffaws the gm often puzzled his staff in that way all were anxious to do the right thing by him but he made it so difficult to tell what the right thing was but as i went down the basement stairs to change my coat in the clerks lockerroom i understood from the gms words how humiliating my position was i had always been a booky sort of person at home it had been a standing joke that when a boy i would sooner spend a penny on titbits than liquorice and it was true not that i disliked liquorice i liked titbits better though so the thing had gone on i advanced from deadwood dick to hall caine and guy boothby and since i had joined the moon i had actually gone a buster and bought omar khayyam in the golden treasury series added to which i had recently composed a little lyric for a singer at the moons annual smoking concert the lines were topical and were descriptive of our complete compensation policy tommy milner was the vocalist he sang my composition to a hymn tune the refrain went come and buy a ccpeeee if you want immuniteeee from the accidents which come please plank down your premium life is diffrent youll agree repeat when youve got a ccp the throne room of the holborn fairly rocked with applause well it was shortly afterwards that i had received a visit from mr cloyster the visit which ended in my agreeing to sign whatever manuscripts he sent me and forward him all cheques for a consideration of ten per cent softest job ever a man had easy money kudos i had almost too much of it which takes me back to the gms remark about my leaving the office since hes bought that big house at regents park hes done a lot of entertaining at the restaurants his names always cropping up in the here and there column and naturally hes a subscriber to the strawberry leaf the gm has everything of the best and plenty of it you dont see the gm with memo forms tucked round his cuffs he wears a clean shirt every morning of his life all tiptop people have their little eccentricities and the strawberry leaf the smartest goeyest personalest weekly is never missing from his drawingroom whatnot every week its there regular as clockwork thats what started my literary reputation among the fellows at the moon mr cloyster was contributing a series of short dialogues to the strawberry leaf called in town these on publication bore my own signature as a matter of fact i happened to see the gm showing the first of the series to mr leach in his private room ive kept it by me and i dont wonder the news created a bit of a furore this was it in town by sidney price no i the secrecy of the ballet you are standing under the shelter of the criterions awning it is of a summers morning it is pouring in torrents a quick and sudden rain storm it wont last long and it doesnt mean any harm but whats sport to it is death to you you were touring the circus in a new hat brand new couldnt spot your tame cabby hadnt a token spied the cris awning dashed at it but it leaks not so much as the sky though just enough however to do your hat no good you mention this to friendly creature with umbrella and hint that you would like to share that weapon friendly creature cant give you all boysie mines new too you in your charming way well of course you wouldnt be a woman if you hadnt a new hat friendly creature do women always have new hats you edging under the umbrella women have new hats new women have hats friendly creature dont call me a woman ducky im a lady you i must be careful if i dont flatter you youll take your umbrella away friendly creature changing subject theres matilda you where friendly creature coming towards us in that landaulette you looks fit doesnt she friendly creature her shes a blooming rotter you not so loud shell hear you friendly creature raising her voice good job i want her to stumer

perfectly gorell barnes said friendly creature drop it whats the good of the secrecy of the ballet if people are going to remember every single thing about you at this point the rain stops by an adroit flanking movement you get away without having to buy her a lunch everyone congratulated me always knew he had it in him found his vocation a distinctly clever head reaping in the shekels that was the worst part the moon to a man was bent on finding out how much sidney price makes out of his bits in the papers some dropped hints the gm leach and the men at the counter others like tommy milner asked slap out you may be sure i didnt tell them a fixed sum but it was hopeless to say i was getting the small sum which my ten per cent commission worked out at on the other hand i dared not pretend i was being paid at the usual rates i should have gone broke in twentyfour hours you have no idea how constantly i was given the opportunity of lending five shillings to important members of the moon staff it struck me then and i have found out for certain since that there is a popular anxiety to borrow from a man who earns money by writing the earnings of a successful writer are to the common intelligence something he ought not really to have and anyone in default of abstracting his income may fall back upon taking up his time it did no doubt appear that i was coining the ready besides the strawberry leaf features and the key of the street were printing my signed contributions in weekly series the mayfair too had announced on its placards a story in dialogue by sidney price this then was my position on the morning when i was late at the moon and lost my bonus whilst i went up in the lift to the new business room and whilst i was entering the names and addresses of inquirers in the proposal book i was trying to gather courage to meet what was in store for the future held this that my name would disappear from the papers as suddenly as it had arrived there people would want to know why i had given up writing written himself out no staying power as shortlived as a barnum monstrosity these would be the remarks which would herald ridicule and possibly pity and i should be in just the same beastly fix at the hollyhocks as i was at the moon what would my people say what would norah say there was another reason too why a stoppage of the ten per cent cheques would be a whack in the eye you see i had been doing myself well on them uncommonly well i had ordered as a present to my parents new furniture for the drawingroom i had pressed my father to have a small greenhouse put up at my expense he had always wanted one but had never been able to run to it and i had taken norah about a good deal our weekly visit to a matine upper circle and ices followed by tea at the cabin or lyons popular had become an institution we had gone occasionally to a ball at the town hall what would norah say when all this ended abruptly without any explanation there was no getting away from it sidney price was in the soup chapter norah wins home sidney prices narrative continued my signed work had run out for two weeks nothing had been printed over my signature so far no comment had been raised but it was only a question of days but then one afternoon it all came right it was like this i was sitting eating my lunch at elizas in birchin lane twenty minutes was the official allowance for the meal and i took my twenty minutes at two oclock the st stephens gazette was lying near me i picked it up anything to distract my thoughts from the trouble to come that was how i felt reading mechanically the front page i saw a poem and started violently this was the poem a cry hands at the tiller to steer a star in the murky sky water and waste of mere whither and why sting of absorbent night journey of weal or woe and overhead the light we go we go darkness a mortals part mortals of whom we are come to a mortals heart immortal star thos blake june th rummy very rummy i exclaimed the poem was dated yesterday had mr cloyster then continued to work his system with thomas blake to the exclusion of the reverend and myself still worrying over the thing i turned over the pages of the paper until i chanced to see the following paragraph literary gossip few will be surprised to learn that the rev john hatton intends to publish another novel in the immediate future mr hattons first book when it was lurid created little less than a furore the work on which he is now engaged which will bear the title of the browns of brixton is a tender sketch of english domesticity this new vein of mr hattons will doubtless be distinguished by the naturalness of dialogue and sanity of characterisation of his first novel messrs prodder and way are to publish it in the autumn hes running the reverend again is he said i to myself and im the only one left out its a bit thick that night i wrote to blake and to the reverend asking whether they had been taken on afresh and if so couldnt i get a look in as things were pretty serious the reverends reply arrived first the temple june th dear price as you have seen i am hard at work at my new novel the leisure of a novelist is so scanty that i know youll forgive my writing only a line i am in no way associated with james orlebar cloyster nor do i wish to be rather i would forget his very existence you are aware of the interests which i have at heart social reform the education of the submerged the physical needs of the young there is no necessity for me to enumerate my ideals further to get quick returns from philanthropy to put remedial organisation into speedy working order wants capital cloysters system was one way of obtaining some of it but when that failed i had to look out for another im glad i helped in the system for it made me realise how large an income a novelist can obtain im glad it failed because its failure suggested that i should try to get for myself those vast sums which i had been getting for the selfish purse of an already wealthy man unconsciously he has played into my hands i read his books before i signed them and i find that i have thoroughly absorbed those tricks of his of style and construction which opened the publics coffers to him the browns of brixton will eclipse anything that cloyster has previously done for this reason that it will outcloyster cloyster it is cloyster with improvements in thus abducting his novelreading public i shall feel no compunction his serious verse and his society dialogues bring him in so much that he cannot be in danger of financial embarrassment yours sincerely john hatton now this letter set my brain buzzing like the engine of a stationary vanguard i too had been in the habit of reading mr cloysters dialogues before i signed and sent them off i had often thought to myself also that they couldnt take much writing that it was all a knack and the more i read of them the more transparent the knack appeared to me to be just for a lark i sat down that very evening and had a go at one taking the park for my scene i made two or three theatrical celebrities whose names i had seen in the newspapers talk about a horse race at least one talked about a horse race and the others thought she was gassing about a new musical comedy the name of the play being the same as the name of the horse the oriental belle a very amusing muddle with lots of doubles entendres and heaps of adverbial explanation in small print such as miss adeline gene with the faint incipient blush which mrs adair uses to test her rouge imperial that sort of thing i had it typed and i said price my boy theres more mr cloyster in this than ever mr cloyster could have put into it and the editor of the strawberry leaf printed it next issue as a matter of course i say as a matter of course with intention because the fellows at the moon took it as a matter of course too you see when it first appeared i left the copy about the desk in the new business room hoping tommy milner or some of them would rush up and congratulate me but they didnt they simply said dont litter the place up old man keep your papers if you must bring em here in your locker downstairs one of them did say i fancy something about its not being quite up to my usual they didnt know it was my maiden effort at original composition and i couldnt tell them it was galling youll admit however i quickly forgot my own troubles in wondering what mr cloyster was doing no editor i foresaw would accept his society stuff as long as mine was in the market they wouldnt pay for cloyster whilst they were offered the refusal of supercloyster wasnt likely you must understand i wasnt overeasy in my conscience about the affair i had in a manner of speaking pinched mr cloysters job but then i argued to myself he was earning quite as much as was good for any one man by his serious verse and at that very minute our slavey little ethelbertina knocked at my bedroom door and gave me a postcard it was addressed to me in thick straggly writing and was so covered with thumbmarks that a bertillon expert would have gone straight off his nut at the sight of it my usbend began the postcard as received yourn e as no truk wif the other man e is a pots imself an e can do a job of potry as orfen as e as a mine to your obegent servent ada blake ps me an is ole ant do is writin up for im so then i saw how that cry thing in the st stephens had come there you heard me give my opinion about telling norah my past life well youll agree with me now that theres practically nothing to tell her there is of course little miss richards the waitress in the smokingroom of the piccadilly cabin her i mean with the fuzzy golden hair done low youve often exchanged good evening with her im sure her hairs done low she used to make rather a point of telling me that why i dont know especially as it was always tidy and well off her shoulders and then there was the haughty lady who sold programmes in the haymarket amphitheatre but shes got the sack so cookson informs me therefore as i shall tell norah plainly that i disapprove of the cabin the past can hatch no egg of discord in the shape of the castoff glove the only thing that i can think of as needing suppression is the part i played in mr cloysters system theres no doubt that the reverend blake and i have between us put a fairly considerable spoke in mr cloysters literary wheel but what am i to do to begin with its no use my telling norah about the affair because it would do her no good and might tend possibly to lessen her valuation of my capabilities at present my dialogues dazzle her and once your fiance is dazzled the basis of matrimonial happiness is assured again looking at it from mr cloysters point of view what good would it be to him if i were to stop writing both the editor and the public have realised by now that his work is only secondrate he can never hope to get a tenth of his original prices even if his work is accepted which it wont be for directly i leave his market clear someone else will collar it slap off besides ive no right to stop my dialogues my duty to norah is greater than my duty to mr cloyster unless i continue to be paid by literature i shall not be able to marry norah until three years next quarter the moon has passed a rule about it and an official who marries on an income not larger than eighty pounds per annum is liable to dismissal without notice norahs mother wouldnt let her wait three years and though fellows have been known to have had a couple of kids at the time of their official marriage i personally couldnt stand the wear and tear of that holeandcorner business it couldnt be done end of sidney prices narrative julian eversleighs narrative chapter the transposition of sentiment it is all very very queer i do not understand it at all it makes me sleepy to think about it a month ago i hated eva tomorrow i marry her by special licence now what about this my brain is not working properly i am becoming jerky i tried to work the thing out algebraically i wrote it down as an equation thus hatred denoted by x eva reverse of hatred y eva one month z from which we get x eva y evaz and if anybody can tell me what that means if it means anything which i doubt i shall be grateful as i said before my brain is not working properly there is no doubt that my temperament has changed and in a very short space of time a month ago i was soured cynical i didnt brush my hair and i slept too much i talked a good deal about life now i am blithe and optimistic i use pomade part in the middle and sleep eight hours and no more i have not made an epigram for days it is all very queer i took a new attitude towards life at about a quarter to three on the morning after the guntoncresswellss dance i had waited for james in his rooms he had been to the dance examine me for a moment as i wait there i had been james friend for more than two years and a half i had watched his career from the start i knew him before he had located exactly the short cut to fortune our friendship embraced the whole period of his sudden extraordinary success had not envy by that time been dead in me it might have been pain to me to watch him accomplish unswervingly with his effortless genius the things i had once dreamt i too would laboriously achieve but i grudged him nothing rather i had pleasure in those triumphs of my friend there was no confidence we had withheld from one another when he told me of his relations with margaret goodwin he had counted on my sympathy as naturally as he had requested and received my advice to no living soul save james would i have confessed my own tragedy my hopeless love for eva it is inconceivable that i should have misjudged a man so utterly as i misjudged james that is the latent factor at the root of my problem the innate rottenness the cardiac villainy of james orlebar cloyster in a measure it was my own hand that laid the train which eventually blew james hidden smoulder of fire into the blazing beacon of wickedness in which my friends satanic soul is visible in all its lurid nakedness i remember well that evening mild with the prelude of spring when i evolved for james benefit the system it was a device which was to preserve my friends liberty and at the same time to preserve my friends honour how perfect in its irony margaret goodwin mark you was not to know he could afford to marry her and my system was an instrument to hide from her the truth he employed that system it gave him the holiday he asked for he went into society among his acquaintances were the guntoncresswells and at their house he met eva whether his determination to treat eva as he had treated margaret came to him instantly or by degrees i do not know inwardly he may have had his scheme matured in embryo but outwardly he was still the accomplished hypocrite he was the soul of honour outwardly he was the essence of sympathetic tact as far as his specious exterior went then came the th of may on that date the first of james orlebar cloysters masks was removed i had breakfasted earlier than usual so that by the time i had walked from rupert court to walpole street it was not yet four oclock james was out i thought i would wait for him i stood at his window then i saw margaret goodwin what features what a complexion and james i murmured is actually giving this the miss in baulk i discovered at that instant that i did not know james he was a fool in a few hours i was to discover he was a villain too she came in and i introduced myself to her i almost forget what pretext i manufactured but i remember i persuaded her to go back to guernsey that very day i think i said that james was spending friday till monday in the country and had left no address i was determined that they should not meet she was far too good for a man who obviously did not appreciate her in the least we had a very pleasant chat she was charming at first she was apt to touch on james a shade too frequently but before long i succeeded in diverting our conversation into less uninteresting topics she talked of guernsey i of london i said i felt i had known her all my life she said that one had undeniably ones affinities i said might i think of her as margaret she said it was rather unconventional but that she could not control my thoughts i said there you are wrong margaret she said oh what are you saying mr eversleigh i said i was thinking out loud on the doorstep she said well yes julian you may write to me sometimes but i wont promise to answer angel the next thing that awakened me was the coming of james after i had given him a suitable version of margarets visit he told me he was engaged to eva that was an astounding thing but what was more astounding was that james had somehow got wind of the real spirit of my interview with margaret i have called james orlebar cloyster a fool i have called him a villain i will never cease to call him a genius for by some marvellous capacity for introspection by some incredible projection of his own mind into other peoples matters he was able to tax me to my face with an attempt to win his former fiances affections i tried to choke him off i used every ounce of bluff i possessed in vain i left walpole street in a state approaching mental revolution my exact feelings towards james were too intricate to be defined in a single word not so my feelings towards eva hate supplied the lacuna in her case thus the month began the next point of importance is my interview with mrs guntoncresswell she had known all along how matters stood in regard to eva and myself she had not been hostile to me on that account she had only pointed out that as i could do nothing towards supporting eva i had better keep away when my cousin was in london that was many years ago since then we had seldom met latterly not at all invitations still arrived from her but her afternoon parties clashed with my afterbreakfast pipe and as for her evening receptions well by the time i had pieced together the various component parts of my dress clothes i found myself ready for bed that is to say more ready for bed than i usually am i went to mrs guntoncresswell in a very bitter mood i was bent on trouble ive come to congratulate eva i said mrs guntoncresswell sighed i was afraid of this she said the announcement was the more pleasant i went on because james has been a bosom friend of mine im afraid you are going to be extremely disagreeable about your cousins engagement she said i am i answered her very disagreeable i intend to shadow the young couple to be constantly meeting them calling attention to them james will most likely have to try to assault me that may mean a black eye for dear james it will certainly mean the police court their engagement will be in short a succession of hideous contretemps a series of laughable scenes julian said mrs guntoncresswell hitherto you have acted manfully toward eva you have been brave have you no regard for eva none i said nor for mr cloyster not a scrap but why are you behaving in this appallingly selfish way this was a facer i couldnt quite explain to her how things really were so i said never you mind selfish or not mrs guntoncresswell im out for trouble that night i had a letter from her she said that in order to avoid all unpleasantness evas engagement would be of the briefest nature possible that the marriage was fixed for the twelfth of next month that the wedding would be a very quiet one and that until the day of the wedding eva would not be in london it amused me to find how thoroughly i had terrified mrs guntoncresswell how excellently i must have acted for of course i had not meant a word i had said to that good lady in the days preceding the twelfth of june i confess i rather softened to james the entente cordiale was established between us he told me how irresistible eva had been that night mentioned how completely she had carried him away had she not carried me away in precisely the same manner once upon a time he swore he loved her as dearly as i cant call to mind the simile he employed though it was masterly and impressive i even hinted that the threats i had used in the presence of mrs guntoncresswell were not serious he thanked me but said i had frightened her to such good purpose that the date would now have to stand you will not he surprised to hear he added that i have called in all my work i shall want every penny i make the expenses of an engaged man are hairraising i send her a lot of flowers every morning youve no conception how much a few orchids cost then whenever i go to see her i take her some little present a goldmounted umbrella a bicycle lamp or a patent scentbottle im indebted to you julian positively indebted to you for cutting short our engagement i now go on to point two the morning of the twelfth of june hurried footsteps on my staircase a loud tapping at my door the church clock chiming twelve the agitated weeping figure of mrs guntoncresswell approaching my hammock a telegram thrust into my hand mrs guntoncresswells hysterical exclamation you infamous monster you you are at the bottom of this all very disconcerting all fortunately very unusual my eyes were leaden with slumber but i forced myself to decipher the following message which had been telegraphed to west kensington lane wedding must be postponed cloyster ive had no hand in this i cried but i added enthusiastically it serves eva jolly well right chapter a chat with james julian eversleighs narrative continued mrs guntoncresswell seemed somehow to drift away after that apparently i went to sleep again and she didnt wait when i woke it was getting on for two oclock i breakfasted with that magnificent telegram propped up against the teapot had a bath dressed and shortly before five was well on my way to walpole street the more i thought over the thing the more it puzzled me why had james done this why should he wish to treat eva in this manner i was delighted that he had done so but why had he a very unexpected person james james was lying back in his shabby old armchair smoking a pipe there was tea on the table the room seemed more dishevelled than ever it would have been difficult to say which presented the sorrier spectacle the room or its owner he looked up as i came in and nodded listlessly i poured myself out a cup of tea and took a muffin both were cold and clammy i went to the bell what are you doing asked james only going to ring for some more tea i said no dont do that ill go down and ask for it you dont mind using my cup do you he went out of the room and reappeared with a jug of hot water you see he explained if mrs blankley brings in another cup shell charge for two teas instead of one it didnt occur to me i said sorry it sounds mean mumbled james not at all i said youre quite right not to plunge into reckless extravagance james blushed slightly a feat of which i was surprised to see that he was capable the fact is he began i interrupted him never mind about that i said what i want to know is whats the meaning of this and i shoved the bilioushued telegraph form under his nose just as mrs guntoncresswell had shoved it under mine it means that im done he said i dont understand ill explain i have postponed my marriage for the same reason that i refused you a clean cup because i cannot afford luxuries it may be my dulness but still i dont follow you what exactly are you driving at im done for im on the rocks im a pauper a what a pauper i laughed the man was splendid there was no other word for it and shall i tell you something else that you are i said you are a low sneaking liar you are playing it low down on eva he laughed this time it irritated me unspeakably dont try to work off the hollow mirthless laugh dodge on me i said because it wont do youre a blackguard and you know it i tell you im done for ive barely a penny in the world rot i said dont try that on me youve let eva down plop and im jolly glad but all the same youre a skunk nothing can alter that why dont you marry the girl i cant he said it would be too dishonourable dishonourable yes i havent got enough money i couldnt ask her to share my poverty with me i love her too dearly i was nearly sick the beast spoke in a sort of hushed softmusic voice as if he were the selfsacrificing hero in a melodrama the stainedglass expression on his face made me feel homicidal oh drop it i said poverty good lord isnt two thousand a year enough to start on but i havent got two thousand a year oh i dont pretend to give the figures to a shilling you dont understand all i have to live on is my holiday work at the orb what oh yes and im doing some lyrics for briggs for the second edition of the belle of wells thatll keep me going for a bit but its absolutely out of the question to think of marrying anyone if i can keep my own head above water till the next vacancy occurs at the orb i shall be lucky youre mad im not though i dare say i shall be soon if this sort of thing goes on i tell you you are mad otherwise youd have called in your work and saved yourself having to pay those commissions to hatton and the others as it is i believe theyve somehow done you out of your cheques and the shock of it has affected your brain my dear julian its a good suggestion that about calling in my work but it comes a little late i called it in weeks ago my irritation increased what is the use of lying like that i said angrily you dont seem to credit me with any sense at all do you think i never read the papers and magazines you cant have called in your work the stuffs still being printed over the signatures of sidney price tom blake and the rev john hatton i caught sight of a strawberry leaf lying on the floor beside his chair i picked it up here you are i said page short story lady marys mistake by sidney price how about that thats it julian he said dismally thats just it those three devils have pinched my job theyve learned the trick of the thing through reading my stuff and now theyre turning it out for themselves theyve cut me out my markets gone the editors and publishers wont look at me i have had eleven printed rejection forms this week one editor wrote and said that he did not want johnhattonandwater thats why i sent the wire lets see those rejection forms you cant theyre burnt they got on my nerves and i burnt them oh i said theyre burnt are they he got up and began to pace the room but i shant give up julian he cried with a sickening return of the melodrama hero manner i shant give up i shall still persevere the fight will be terrible often i shall feel on the point of despair yet i shall win through i feel it julian i have the grit in me to do it and meanwhile he lowered his voice and seemed surprised that the orchestra did not strike up the slow music meanwhile i shall ask eva to wait to wait the colossal the napoleonic impudence of the man i have known men who seemed literally to exude gall but never one so overflowing with it as james orlebar cloyster as i looked at him standing there and uttering that great speech i admired him i ceased to wonder at his success in life i shook my head i cant do it i said regretfully i simply cannot begin to say what i think of you the english language isnt equal to it i cannot offhand coin a new phraseology to meet the situation all i can say is that you are unique what do you mean absolutely unique though i had hoped you would have known me better than to believe that i would swallow the ludicrous yarn youve prepared dont you ever stop and ask yourself on these occasions if its good enough you dont believe me my dear james i protested believe you i swear its all true every word of it you seem to forget that ive been behind the scenes im not simply an ordinary member of the audience i know how the illusion is produced ive seen the strings pulled why dash it i showed you how to pull them i never came across a finer example of seething the kid in its mothers milk i put you up to the system and you turn round and try to take me in with it yes youre a wonder james you dont mean to say you think dont be an ass james of course i do youve had the brazen audacity to attempt to work off on eva the game you played on margaret but youve made a mistake youve forgotten to count me i paused and ate a muffin james watched me with fascinated eyes you i resumed ethically i despise eva personally i detest it seems therefore that i may expect to extract a certain amount of amusement from the situation the fun will be inaugurated by your telling eva that she may have to wait five years you will state also the amount of your present income suppose i decline you wont you think not i am sure what would you do if i declined i should call upon mrs guntoncresswell and give her a quarter of an hours entertainment by telling her of the system and explaining to her in detail the exact method of its working and the reason why you set it going having amused mrs guntoncresswell in this manner i should make similar revelations to eva it would not be pleasant for you subsequently i suppose but we all have our troubles that would be yours he hesitated as if theyd believe it he said weakly i think they would theyd laugh at you theyd think you were mad not when i produced john hatton sidney price and tom blake in a solid phalanx and asked them to corroborate me they wouldnt do it he said snatching at a straw they wouldnt give themselves away hatton might hesitate to but tom blake would do it like a shot as i did not know tom blake a moments reflection might have told james that this was bluff but i had gathered a certain knowledge of the bargees character from jamess conversation and i knew that he was a drunken indiscreet sort of person who might be expected to reveal everything in circumstances such as i had described so i risked the shot and it went home jamess opposition collapsed i shall then administering the coup de grce arrange a meeting between the guntoncresswells and old mrs goodwin thank you said james but dont bother on second thoughts i will tell eva about my income and the five years wait thanks i said its very good of you goodbye and i retired chuckling to rupert street chapter in a hansom julian eversleighs narrative continued i spent a pleasant week in my hammock awaiting developments at the end of the week came a letter from eva she wrote my dear julian you havent been to see us for ages is kensington lane beyond the pale your affectionate cousin eva you vixen i thought yes ill come and see you fast enough it will give me the greatest pleasure to see you crushed and humiliated i collected my evening clothes from a man of the name of attenborough whom i employ to take care of them when they are not likely to be wanted found a white shirt which looked presentable after a little pruning of the cuffs with a razor and drove to the guntoncresswellss in time for dinner there was a certain atmosphere of unrest about the house i attributed this at first to the effects of the james orlebar cloyster bombshell but discovered that it was in reality due to the fact that eva was going out to a fancydress ball that night she was having dinner sent up to her room they told me and would be down presently there was a good deal of flitting about going on maids on mysterious errands shot up and down stairs old mr guntoncresswell looking rather wry was taking cover in his study when i arrived mrs guntoncresswell was in the drawingroom before eva came down i got a word alone with her ive had a nice straightforward letter from james she said and he has done all he can to put things straight with us ah said i that telegram he tells me was the outcome of a sudden panic dear me i said it seems that he made some most ghastly mistake about his finances what exactly happened i cant quite understand but the gist of it is he thought he was quite well off whereas really his income is infinitesimal how odd i remarked it sounds odd in fact i could scarcely believe it until i got his letter of explanation ill show it to you here it is i read james orlebar cloysters letter with care it was not particularly long but i wish i had a copy of it for it is the finest work in an imaginative vein that has ever been penned masterly i exclaimed involuntarily yes isnt it she echoed enables one to grasp thoroughly how the mistake managed to occur has eva seen it yes i notice he mentions five years as being about the period yes its rather a long engagement but of course shell wait she loves him so eva now entered the room when i caught sight of her i remembered i had pictured her crushed and humiliated i had expected to gloat over a certain dewiness of her eyes a patient drooping of her lips i will say plainly there was nothing of that kind about eva tonight she had decided to go to the ball as peter pan the costume had rather scandalised old mr guntoncresswell a venerable tory who rarely spoke except to grumble even mrs guntoncresswell who had lately been elected to the newlyformed les serfs davenir was inclined to deprecate it but i was sure eva had chosen the better part the dress suited her to perfection her legs are the legs of a boy as i looked at her with concentrated hatred i realised i had never seen a human soul so radiant so brimming with espiglerie so altogether to be desired why julian is it you this is good of you it was evident that the past was to be waived i took my cue thanks eva i said it suits you admirably events at this point move quickly another card of invitation is produced would i care to use it and take eva to the ball but im not in fancy dress overruled fancy dress not an essential crowds of men there in ordinary evening clothes so we drove off we hardly exchanged a syllable no one has much to say just before a dance i looked at eva out of the corner of my eye trying to discover just what it was in her that attracted men i knew her charm though i flattered myself that i was proof against it i wanted to analyse it her photograph is on the table before me as i write i look at it critically she is not what i should describe as exactly a type of english beauty you know the sort of beauty i mean queenly statuesque a daughter of the gods divinely fair her charm is not in her features it is in her expression tonight for instance as we drove to the ball there sparkled in her eyes a light such as i had never seen in them before every girl is animated at a ball but this was more than mere animation there was a latent devilry about her and behind the sparkle and the glitter a film a mist as it were which lent almost a pathos to her appearance the effect it had on me was to make me tend to forget that i hated her we arrive i mutter something about having the pleasure eva says i can have the last two waltzes here comes a hiatus i am told that i was seen dancing was observed to eat an excellent supper and was noticed in the smokingroom with a cigarette in my mouth at last the first of my two waltzes the eton boating song one of my favourites i threaded my way through the room in search of her she was in neither of the doorways i cast my eyes about the room her costume was so distinctive that i could hardly fail to see her i did see her she was dancing my waltz with another man the thing seemed to numb my faculties i stood in the doorway gaping i couldnt understand it the illogical nature of my position did not strike me it did not occur to me that as i hated the girl so much it was much the best thing that could happen that i should see as little of her as possible my hatred was entirely concentrated on the bounder who had stolen my dance he was a small pinkfaced little beast and it maddened me to see that he danced better than i could ever have done as they whirled past me she smiled at him i rushed to the smokingroom whether she gave my other waltz to the same man or whether she chose some other partner or sat alone waiting for me i do not know when i returned to the ballroom the last waltz was over and the orchestra was beginning softly to play the first extra it was tout passe an air that has always had the power to thrill me my heart gave a bound standing in the doorway just in front of me was eva i drew back two or three men came up and asked her for the dance she sent them away and my heart leaped as they went she was standing with her back towards me now she turned our eyes met we stood for a moment looking at one another then i heard her give a little sigh and instantly i forgot everything my hatred my two lost dances the pinkfaced blighter everything everything but that i loved her tired eva i said perhaps i am she replied yes i am julian give me this one i whispered well sit it out very well its so hot in here well go and sit it out in a hansom shall we ill get my cloak i waited numbed by her absence her cloak was pale pink we walked out together into the starry night a few yards off stood a hansom drive to the corner of sloane street i said to the man by way of the park the night was very still i have said that i had forgotten everything except that i loved her could i remember now now as we drove together through the empty streets alone her warm palpitating body touching mine james and his awful predicament which would last till eva gave him up evas callous treatment of my former love for her my own newlyacquired affection for margaret my selfrespect these things had become suddenly of no account eva i murmured and i took her hand eva her wonderful eyes met mine the mist in them seemed to turn to dew my darling she whispered very low the road was deserted we were alone i drew her face to mine and kissed her my love for her grows daily old guntoncresswell has introduced me to a big firm of linoleum manufacturers i am taking over their huge system of advertising next week my salary will be enormous it almost frightens me old mr cresswell tells me that he had had the job in his mind for me for some time and had indeed mentioned to his wife and eva at lunch that day that he intended to write to me about it i am more grateful to him than i can ever make him understand eva i know cares nothing for money she told me so but it is a comfort to feel that i can keep her almost in luxury i have given up my rooms in rupert street i sleep in a bed i do sandow exercises i am always down to breakfast at eightthirty sharp i smoke less i am the happiest man on earth end of julian eversleighs narrative narrative resumed by james orlebar cloyster chapter a rift in the clouds o perfidy of woman o feminine inconstancy that is the only allusion i shall permit to escape me on the subject of eva eversleighs engagement to that scoundrel julian i had the news by telegraph and the heavens darkened above me whilst the solid earth rocked below i had been trapped into dishonour and even the bait had been withheld from me but it was not the loss of eva that troubled me most it should have outweighed all my other misfortunes and made them seem of no account but it did not man is essentially a materialist the prospect of an empty stomach is more serious to him than a broken heart a broken heart is the luxury of the welltodo what troubled me more than all other things at this juncture was the thought that i was face to face with starvation and that only the grimmest of fights could enable me to avoid it i quaked at the prospect the early struggles of the writer to keep his head above water form an experience which does not bear repetition the hopeless feeling of chipping a little niche for oneself out of the solid rock with a nib is a nightmare even in times of prosperity i remembered the grey days of my literary apprenticeship and i shivered at the thought that i must go through them again i examined my position dispassionately over a cup of coffee at grooms in fleet street grooms was a recognised orb rendezvous when i was doing on your way one or two of us used to go down fleet street for coffee after the mornings work with the regularity of machines it formed a recognised break in the day i thought things over how did i stand holiday work at the orb would begin very shortly so that i should get a good start in my race fermin would be going away in a few weeks then gresham and after that fane the man who did the people and things column with luck i ought to get a clear fifteen weeks of regular work it would just save me in fifteen weeks i ought to have got going again the difficulty was that i had dropped out editors had forgotten my work john hatton they knew and sidney price they knew but who was james orlebar cloyster there would be much creaking of joints and wobbling of wheels before my triumphal car could gather speed again but with a regular salary coming in week by week from the orb i could endure this i became almost cheerful it is an exhilarating sensation having ones back against the wall then there was briggs the actor the very thought of him was a tonic a born fighter with the energy of six men he was an ideal model for me if i could work with a sixth of his dash and pluck i should be safe he was giving me work he might give me more the new edition of the belle of wells was due in another fortnight my lyrics would be used and i should get paid for them add this to my orb salary and i should be a man of substance i glared over my coffeecup at an imaginary john hatton you thought youd done me did you i said to him by gad ill have the laugh of you all yet i was shaking my fist at him when the door opened i hurriedly tilted back my chair and looked out of the window hullo cloyster i looked round it was fermin just the man i wanted to see he seemed depressed even embarrassed hows the column i asked oh all right he said awkwardly i wanted to see you about that i was going to write to you oh yes i said of course about the holiday work when are you off i was thinking of starting next week good sorry to lose you of course but he shuffled his feet youre doing pretty well now at the game arent you cloyster he said it was not to my interests to cry myself down so i said that i was doing quite decently he seemed relieved youre making quite a good income i suppose i mean no difficulty about placing your stuff editors squeal for it because otherwise what i wanted to say to you might have been something of a blow but it wont affect you much if youre doing plenty of work elsewhere a cold hand seemed laid upon my heart my mind leaped to what he meant something had gone wrong with the orb holiday work my sheetanchor do you remember writing a par about stickney the butterscotch man you know ragging him when he got his peerage yes it was one of the best paragraphs i had ever done a twoline thing full of point and sting i had been editing on your way that day fermin being on a holiday and gresham ill and i had put the paragraph conspicuously at the top of the column well said fermin im afraid there was rather trouble about it hamilton came into our room yesterday and asked if i should be seeing you i said i thought i should well tell him said hamilton that that paragraph of his about stickney has only cost us five hundred pounds thats all and he went out again apparently stickney was on the point of advertising largely with the orb and had backed out in a huff today i went to see him about my holiday and he wanted to know who was coming in to do my work i mentioned you and he absolutely refused to have you in im awfully sorry about it i was silent the shock was too great instead of drifting easily into my struggle on a comfortable weekly salary i should have to start the toothandnail fighting at once i wanted to get away somewhere by myself and grapple with the position i said goodbye to fermin retaining sufficient presence of mind to treat the thing lightly and walked swiftly along the restless strand marvelling at what i had suffered at the hands of fortune the deceiver of margaret deceived by eva a pauper i covered the distance between grooms and walpole street in sombre meditation in a sort of dull panic i sat down immediately on my arrival and tried to work i told myself that i must turn out something that it would be madness to waste a moment i sat and chewed my pen from two oclock till five but not a page of printable stuff could i turn out looking back at myself at that moment i am not surprised that my ideas did not flow it would have been a wonderful triumph of strength of mind if i had been able to write after all that had happened dr johnson has laid it down that a man can write at any time if he sets himself to it earnestly but mine were exceptional circumstances my lifes happiness and my means for supporting life at all happy or otherwise had been swept away in a single morning and i found myself utterly unable to pen a coherent sentence at five oclock i gave up the struggle and rang for tea while i was having tea there was a ring at the bell and my landlady brought in a large parcel i recognised the writing on the label the hand was margarets i wondered in an impersonal sort of way what margaret could be sending to me from the feel of it the contents were paper it amuses me now to think that it was a good halfhour before i took the trouble to cut the string fortune and happiness were waiting for me in that parcel and i would not bother to open it i sat in my chair smoking and thinking and occasionally cast a gloomy eye at the parcel but i did not open it then my pipe went out and i found that i had no matches in my pocket there were some at the farther end of the mantelpiece i had to get up to reach them and once up i found myself filled with a sufficient amount of energy to take a knife from the table and cut the string languidly i undid the brown paper the contents were a pile of typewritten pages and a letter it was the letter over which my glassy eyes travelled first my own dear brave old darling james it began and its purport was that she had written a play and wished me to put my name to it and hawk it round to pass off as my work her own amateurish effort at playwriting ludicrous and so immoral too i had always imagined that margaret had a perfectly flawless sense of honesty yet here she was asking me deliberately to impose on the credulity of some poor trusting theatrical manager the dreadful disillusionment of it shocked me most men would have salved their wounded susceptibilities by putting a match to the manuscript without further thought or investigation but i have ever been haunted by a somewhat overstrict conscience and i sat down there and then to read the stupid stuff at seven oclock i was still reading my dinner was brought in i bolted it with margarets play propped up against the potato dish i read on and on i could not leave it incredible as it would appear from anyone but me i solemnly assure you that the typewritten nonsense i read that evening was nothing else than the girl who waited chapter briggs to the rescue james orlebar cloysters narrative continued i finished the last page and i laid down the typescript reverently the thing amazed me unable as i was to turn out a good acting play of my own i was nevertheless sufficiently gifted with an appreciation of the dramatic to be able to recognise such a play when i saw it there were situations in margarets comedy which would grip a london audience and force laughter and tears from it well the public side of that idiotic play is history everyone knows how many nights it ran and the press from time to time tells its readers what were the profits from it that accrued to the author i turned to margarets letter and reread the last page she put the thing very well very sensibly as i read my scruples began to vanish after all was it so very immoral this little deception that she proposed i have written down the words she said but the conception is yours the play was inspired by you but for you i should never have begun it well if she put it like that you alone are able to manage the business side of the production you know the right men to go to to approach them on behalf of a strangers work is far less likely to lead to success true true i have assumed you will see that the play is certain to be produced but that will only be so if you adopt it as your own there was sense in this claim the authorship and all will be well i will i said i packed up the play in its brown paper and rushed from the house at the postoffice at the bottom of the kings road i stopped to send a telegram it consisted of the words accept thankfully cloyster then i took a cab from the rank at sloane square and told the man to drive to the stagedoor of the briggs theatre in shaftesbury avenue the cabrank in sloane square is really a home for superannuated horses it is a sort of equine athenaeum no horse is ever seen there till it has passed well into the sere and yellow a sloane square cabhorse may be distinguished by the dignity of its movements it is happiest when walking the animal which had the privilege of making history by conveying me and the girl who waited to the briggs theatre was asthmatic and i think sickening for the botts i had plenty of time to cool my brain and think out a plan of campaign stanley briggs whom i proposed to try first was the one man i should have liked to see in the part of james the hero of the piece the part might have been written round him there was the objection of course that the girl who waited was not a musical comedy but i knew he would consider a straight play and put it on if it suited him i was confident that the girl who waited would be just what he wanted the problem was how to get him to himself for a sufficient space of time when a man is doing the work of half a dozen he is likely to get on in the world but he has as a rule little leisure for conversation my octogenarian came to a standstill at last at the stagedoor and seemed relieved at having won safely through a strenuous bit of work i went through in search of my man his dressingroom was the first place i drew i knew that he was not due on the stage for another ten minutes mr richard belsey his valet was tidying up the room as i entered mr briggs anywhere about richard i asked down on the side sir i think theres a new song in tonight for mrs briggs and hes gone to listen how it goes which side do you know op sir i think i went downstairs and through the foldingdoors into the wings the op corner was packed standing room only and the overflow reached nearly to the doors the black hole of calcutta was roomy compared with the wings on the night of a new song everybody who had the least excuse for being out of his or her dressingroom at that moment was peering through odd chinks in the scenery chorusgirls showgirls chorusmen principals children sceneshifters and other theatrical fauna waited in a solid mass for the arrival of the musiccue the atmosphere behind the scenes has always had the effect of making me feel as if my boots were number fourteens and my hands if anything larger directly i have passed the swingdoors i shuffle like one oppressed with a guilty conscience outside i may have been composed even jaunty inside i am hangdog beads of perspiration form on my brow my collar tightens my boots begin to squeak i smile vacuously i shuffled smiling vacuously and clutching the typescript of the girl who waited to the op corner i caught the eye of a tall lady in salmonpink and said good evening huskily my voice is always husky behind the scenes elsewhere it is like some beautiful bell a piercing whisper of shhh came from somewhere close at hand this sort of thing does not help bright and sparkling conversation i shhhed and passed on at the back of the op corner timothy prince the comedian was filling in the time before the next entrance by waltzing with one of the stagecarpenters he suspended the operation to greet me hullo dear heart he said how goes it seen briggs anywhere i asked round on the prompt side i think he was here a second ago but he dashed off at this moment the musiccue was given and a considerable section of the multitude passed on to the stage locomotion being rendered easier i hurried round to the prompt side but when i arrived there were no signs of the missing man seen mr briggs anywhere i asked here a moment ago said one of the carpenters he went out after miss lewins song began i think hes gone round the other side i dashed round to the op corner again he had just left taking up the trail i went to his dressingroom once more youre just too late sir said richard he was here a moment ago i decided to wait i wonder it hell be back soon hes probably downstairs his call is in another two minutes i went downstairs and waited on the prompt side sir boyle roches bird was sedentary compared with this elusive man presently he appeared hullo dear old boy he said welcome to elsmore come and see me before you go will you ive got an idea for a song i say i said as he flitted past can i tell me later on and he sprang on to the stage by the time i had worked my way at the end of the performance through the crowd of visitors who were waiting to see him in his dressingroom i found that he had just three minutes in which to get to the savoy to keep an urgent appointment he explained that he was just dashing off i shall be at the theatre all tomorrow morning though he said come round about twelve will you there was a rehearsal at halfpast eleven next morning when i got to the theatre i found him on the stage he was superintending the chorus talking to one man about a song and to two others about motors and dictating letters to his secretary taking advantage of this spell of comparative idleness i advanced lc with the typescript hullo old boy he said just a minute sit down wont you have a cigar i sat down on the act one sofa and he resumed his conversations you see laddie he said what you want in a song like this is tune its no good doing stuff that your wife and family and your aunts say is better than wagner they dont want that sort of thing here dears we simply cant get on if you wont do what youre told begin going off while youre singing the last line of the refrain not after youve finished all back ive told you a hundred times do try and get it right i simply darent look at a motor bill these fellers at the garage cram it on i mean what can you do youre up against it miss hinckel ive got seventyfive letters i want you to take down ready mrs robert boodle sandringham mafeking road balham dear madam mr briggs

firemen came up carrying a card hullo whats this oh confound the feller hes always coming here look here tell him that im just gone out to lunch but can see him at three come along old boy he began to read the play over the coffee and cigars he read it straight through as i had done what rot he said as he turned the last page isnt it i exclaimed enthusiastically but wont it go go he shouted with such energy that several lunchers spun round in their chairs and a rand magnate who was eating peas at the next table started and cut his mouth go its the limit this is just the sort of thing to get right at them itll hit them where they live what made you think of that drivel at the end of act two genius i suppose what do you think of james as a part for you top hole good lord i havent congratulated you consider it done thanks we drained our liqueur glasses to the girl who waited and to ourselves briggs after a lifetime spent in doing three things at once is not a man who lets a great deal of grass grow under his feet before i left him that night the ideal cast of the play had been jotted down and much of the actual cast settled rehearsals were in full swing within a week and the play was produced within ten days of the demise of its predecessor meanwhile the satisfactory sum which i received in advance of royalties was sufficient to remove any regrets as to the loss of the orb holiday work with the girl who waited in active rehearsal on your way lost in importance chapter my triumph james orlebar cloysters narrative continued on the morning of the day for which the production had been fixed it dawned upon me that i had to meet mrs goodwin and margaret at waterloo all through the busy days of rehearsal even on those awful days when everything went wrong and actresses breaking down sobbed in the wings and refused to be comforted i had dimly recognised the fact that when i met margaret i should have to be honest with her plans for evasion had been halfmatured by my inventive faculties only to be discarded unpolished on account of the insistent claims of the endless rehearsals to have concocted a story with which to persuade margaret that i stood to lose money if the play succeeded would have been a clear days work and i had no clear days but this was not all there was another reason somehow my sentiments with regard to her were changing again it was as if i were awaking from some dream i felt as if my eyes had been blindfolded to prevent me seeing margaret as she really was and that now the bandage had been removed as the day of production drew nearer and the play began to take shape i caught myself sincerely admiring the girl who could hit off first shot the exact shade of drivel which the london stage required what culture what excessive brainpower she must have how absurdly nave how impossibly melodramatic how maudlinly sentimental how improbable in fact how altogether womanly she must have grown womanly that did it i felt that she was womanly and it came about that it was my margaret of the cobo shrimping journeys that i was prepared to welcome as i drove that morning to waterloo station and so when the train rolled in and the goodwins alighted and margaret kissed me by an extraordinarily lucky chance i found that i loved her more dearly than ever that premire is still fresh in my memory mrs goodwin margaret and myself occupied the stage box and in various parts of the house i could see the familiar faces of those whom i had invited as my guests i felt it was the supreme event of my life it was the moment and surely i should have spoilt it all unless my oldtime friends had been sitting near me eva and julian were with mr and mrs guntoncresswell in the box opposite us to the barrel club i had sent the first row of the dress circle it was expensive but worth it hatton and sidney price were in the stalls tom blake had preferred a free pass to the gallery kit and malim were at the back of the upper circle this was malim told me kits own choice one by one the members of the orchestra took their places for the overture and it was to the appropriate strains of land of hope and glory that the curtain rose on the first act of my play the first act i should mention though it is no doubt superfluous to do so is bright and suggestive but ends on a clear firm note of pathos that is why as soon as the lights went up i levelled my glasses at the eyes of the critics certainly in two cases and i think in a third i caught the glint of teardrops one critic was blowing his nose another sobbed like a child and i had a hurried vision of a third staggering out to the foyer with his hand to his eyes margaret was removing her own tears with a handkerchief mrs goodwins unmoved face may have hidden a lacerated soul but she did not betray herself hers may have been the thoughts that lie too deep for tears at any rate she did not weep instead she drew from her reticule the fragmentary writings of an early portuguese author these she perused during the present and succeeding entractes pressing margarets hand i walked round to the guntoncresswellss box to see what effect the act had had on them one glance at their faces was enough they were long and hard this is a real compliment i said to myself for the whole party cut me dead i withdrew delighted they had come of course to assist at my failure i had often observed to julian how curiously lacking i was in dramatic instinct and julian had predicted to eva and her aunt and uncle a glorious fiasco they were furious at their hopes being so egregiously disappointed had they dreamt of a success they would have declined to be present indeed halfway through act two i saw them creeping away into the night the barrel club i discovered in the bar as i approached i heard michael declare that thered not been such an act produced since his show was put on at he was interrupted by old maundrell asserting that the business arranged for valet reminded him of a story about leopold lewis they too added their quota to my cup of pleasure by being distinctly frigid ascending to the gallery i found another compliment awaiting me tom blake was fast asleep the quality of blakes intellect was in inverse ratio to that of mrs goodwin neither of them appreciated the stuff that suited so well the tastes of the million and it was consequently quite consistent that while mrs goodwin dozed in spirit tom blake should snore in reality with hatton and price i did not come into contact i noticed however that they wore an expression of relief at the enthusiastic reception my play had received but an encounter with kit and malim was altogether charming they had had some slight quarrel on the way to the theatre and had found a means of reconciliation in their mutual emotion at the pathos of the first acts finale they were now sitting hand in hand telling each other how sorry they were they congratulated me warmly a couple of hours more and the curtain had fallen the roar the frenzied scene the picture of a vast audience halfmad with excitement how it all comes back to me and now as i sit in this quiet smokingroom of a st peters port hotel i hear again the shout of author i see myself again stepping forward from the wings that short appearance of mine that brief speech behind the footlights fixed my future james orlebar cloyster the plutocratic playwright to margaret only daughter of the late eugene grandison goodwin lld
