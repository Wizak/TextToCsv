bell a last word epilogue to the unfortunate reader in this little extravaganza i have done just what i intended i have attempted to describe in an autobiographical sort of way a wellmeaning but somewhat vain young gentleman who having flirted desperately with the magazines takes it into his silly head to write a novel all the chapters of which are laid before the reader with some running criticism by t james barescythe esquire the booknoticer of the morning glory a journal devoted to the fine arts and the amelioration of all mankind and the type of a certain class which need not be distinctly specified for recognition i have endeavored to make the novel of my literary hero such a one as a young man with fine taste and crude talent might produce and i think i have succeeded it is certainly sufficiently unfinished in drawing the character of barescythe the point of my quill may have pierced a friend and if you ask like ludovico what shall be said of thee i shall answer like othello why anything an honorable murderer if you will for nought i did in hate but all in honor the only audacious thing i have done is the writing of this preface if there is anything more stupid than a preface it is a bookcritic if anything could be more stupid than a bookcritic it would be a preface but thank heaven there is not in saying this i refer to a particular critic for i would not for the sake of a tenth edition malign in such a wholesale manner those capital good fellows of the press those verbal accoucheurs who are so pleasantly officious at the birth of each new genius not i i have a fellowfeeling and a love for them which would seem like a bid for their good nature if expressed here i have put my name on the titlepage of this trifle from principle my penchildren are all mine and i cannot think of disowning one though it may happen to be born humpbacked but i beg of you gentlest of unfortunate readers not to take daisys necklace as a serious exponent of my skill at storytelling it is not printed at the urgent request of numerous friends i am so fortunate as not to have many but a seductive little argument in the shape of a cheque is the sole cause of its present form otherwise i should be content to let it die an easy death in the columns of the journal which first had the temerity to publish it if the world could always know as it may in this case why a book is printed it would look with kindlier eyes on dullness bound in muslin it would say with honest sancho panza let us not look the gifthorse in the mouth when the sunshine of this dear old world has reddened the wine in my heart melted down its sparkles to a creamy flavor i will give you a richer draught mayhap a beaker of hippocrene till then may gods blessing be on us both though neither of us deserve it clinton place prologue it hath beene sayed and it seemeth soe untoe me that ye man who writes a booke maist have much vanitie and vexation of spirite ye two poore authors prologue mrs muggins yes sir say that i am sick say i am dead buried out of town in short say anything you will but deny my existence to every one who calls with the exception of mr barescythe yes sir i am going to write a novel mrs muggins that lady did not exhibit much emotion yes sir and mrs muggins ambled out of the roomdoor to which she had been summoned by some peremptory appeals of my bell i was somewhat shocked at the cool manner with which mrs muggins received the literary intelligence but she poor simple soul did not know that my greatness was aripening some of these days said i to myself turning toward the window some of these days mayhap a hundred years hence as the stranger passes through washington parade ground this house wrinkled and old then will be pointed out to his wonderloving eyes as the one in which my novel was written and the curious stranger will cut his name on the walls of the room which i never occupied and carry away a slice of the doorstep i immediately fell in love with this fascinating thought and followed it up the slender trees which now inhabit the parade ground had grown immensely the trunks of some were three feet in diameter and around them all was a massive iron railing the brick and brownstone houses on waverly place and fourthstreet had long been removed and huge edifices with castiron fronts supplanted them i looked in vain for the little drugstore on the corner with its red and green bottles and the fruitmans below with its show of yellow bananas and sour oranges the university dimly seen through the interlacing branches was a classic ruin everything was changed and new all the old landmarks were gone save the parade ground and one quaint old house facing mac dougalstreet the which house was propped up with beams for long and long ago before the memory of the oldest inhabitant even an author a sweet quiet man once wrote a famous book there and the world of would preserve the very floors he trod on and so i sat there by my window in the autumnal sunshine and watched the golden clouds as the wind blew them against the square white turrets of the university which peered above the trees ah mrs muggins thought i though you only said yes sir when i spoke of my novel though your name is carved in solid brass on the halldoor yet you will be forgotten like a rain that fell a thousand years ago when my name only stamped with printers ink on ephemeral slips of paper is a household word so i came to pity mrs muggins and harbored no ill feelings toward the simple creature who was so speedily to be gathered under the dusty wings of oblivion i wondered how she could be cheerful i wondered if she ever thought of being dead and forgotten and if it troubled her lost in the aromatic fumes of a regalia i sat waiting the advent of my friend barescythe barry for short to whom i had addressed a laconic note begging him to visit me at my rooms without delay i like barescythe he is conceited but thats a small fault with genius his idea of literature does not exactly chime with mine for he believes that there have been no novels to speak of since scotts and little poetry since popes but aside from this he is a noble fellow he carries his heart like a falcon on his hand where everybody can see it barry is fond of wine but thats a failing not peculiar to genius and not confined to bookcritics he is a trifle rough in speech not always the thing in manners but the elements so mix in him that i have a great mind to finish that excellent quotation i heard his familiar step on the stairs and a second afterwards he kicked open my roomdoor with his characteristic disregard of ceremony ralph said he with some anxiety whats up sit down are you sick no are you going to be no then why in the name of the manyheaded hydra did you send me such an article as this read it the note ran as follows mac dougalstreet june dear barry come and see me without delay i have got a eternally ralph o yes said i laughing i left out a word i meant to have said i have got an idea humph i thought it was a colic mr barescythe had left a host of editorial duties in the middle and busiest time of the day expecting to find me lying at the point of death and was quite out of humor because i was not there is something extremely human in barescythe criticus i spoke as deliberately as the subject would allow i am going to write a novel this unfortunate avowal was the roseleaf which caused the cup of his indignation to overflow if it had been a case of cholera commenced barescythe with visible emotion or the measles or the croup or the chickenpox if you had broken your thigh spine or neck i wouldnt have complained but a novel and barry began whistling wildly illustration musical score as he invariably does when annoyed after using up a variety of popular airs the shadow of his goodhumor returned to him ralph he said taking my hand i have a great respect for you i dont know why to be frank but i have i like your little song of what do you call it in putnams monthly and your prose sketches in the knickerbocker but dont be a fool ralph with which piece of friendly advice he put on his brown felt hat drew it over his brows and stalked out of the room with a countenance more in sorrow than in anger like mr hamlets father i saw no more of barescythe for two weeks the summer months flew away the nights were growing longer the air had a vein of sparkling cold in it at every gust the trees in the parade ground shook down golden ingots and the grassplots and the graveled walks and the marble bowl of the fountain were paved with emerald and amethyst a mosaic flooring of tinted leaves the clouds were haggard faces and the wind wailed like a broken heart indeed the melancholy days had come the saddest of the year and mrs muggins had made a fire in my grate blessings on him who invented fireplaces a poor daydreamers benediction go with him the world in the grate i have watched its fantastic palaces and crimson inhabitants dipped my pen as it were into its stained rivers and written their grotesqueness dizzy bridges feudal castles great yawning caves and redhot gnomes are to be found in the grate mimic volcanos and ships that sail into sparry grottos and delicate fireshells with pink and blue lips crash the coals sink down and new figures are born like the transient pictures in a kaleidescope so it came to pass that i dozed over the metempsychosis of my fireworld and commenced the novel give me crisp winter days for writing and the long snowy nights for dreamy slumber o antique humorist quaintmouthed sancho panza with you i say blessings on the man who invented sleep sleep pleasant sleep that little airy nothing on the eyelids that little spell of thought which comes from no place and goes nowhere which comes upon us silently and splendidly like a falling star and trails its golden fancies on our waking hours sleep for the young fresh dewy sleep sleep for the sick sleep for the weary and disconsolate sweet dreams and sweet forgetfulness for them smooth the white hairs of the old place thy invisible fingers on their lips close their eyes gently gently sleep and let them pass into nothingness in a dreamy mood half awake and half asleep i filled sheet after sheet with my curious backhanded chirography the white feathery snow came down cygnetsoft and i wrote i heard the wind ditties in the chimney the merry wrangling of sleighbells the sonorous clash of firebells and the manuscript grew under my pen as if by magic i came to love the nurslings of my fancy as no one else will i liked the cold cynical features of mr flint with his undertakers aspect the childspirit bell daisy snarles eyes the heartbroken old sailor the pale bookkeeper tim the office boy mr hardwill the great publisher joe wilkes and all of them mrs muggins occasionally looked in on me mrs muggins regard for me was increasing she never left the coalscuttle on the stairs for my benefit as she used to she was eternally hearing my bell ring when it didnt and answering it so promptly when it did that i began to think that she lived night and day just outside my door pleasant mrs muggins i tried not to feel elated at these little widowy attentions but los hombres son mortales she handed me my coffee with a motherly tenderness that was perfectly touching she looked at me with the eyes of solicitude and spoke with the lips of culminating respect and once in a burst of confidence she told me that she had six orphan sons who were sealurs my respect increased for mrs muggins my novel might run through only one edition but she she had six editions of herself afloat and i thought that after all a woman like her who had produced a half a dozen neptunes founded perhaps a half a dozen races was rendering more service to this applelike globe than one poor devil of an author prolifically pregnant with indifferent books i spoke to barescythe about it and it was pleasant to have him coincide with me once it is an agreeable fact that the world goes up and the world goes down and the sunshine follows the rain the new year was four months old the flowers were teething the tiny robins were able to go alone and above the breezy hum of many thousand voices above the monotonous and oceanlike jar of omnibus wheels i could hear the babbling of hyaline rills in pleasant woodland places i could not see the silver threads of water winding in and out among the cool young grass i could not guess where they were but through the city smoke over the dingy chimneytops they spake to me with kindly voices i knew that daisies were fulling in sunny meadows and that the dandelion trailed its gold by the dusty roadsides for the delicatefooted spring was come i knew it by the geranium at my window it had put forth two sickly leaves two sickly leaves for me and the world alive with vernal things spring thou queen of the twelve dainty dewy spring give me a golden pen and let me lean on heapedup flowers when i write of thee thy breath is the amber sunshine and thy footprints are violets hide winter in thy mantle crown his cold brow with mignionette hang morningglories on his icicles keep him from me forever for winter maketh the light heart sad and thou thou makest the sad heart gay barry said i the sunshine has taken me by the hand to lead me into a sweet newengland village there is my manuscript read it if you can condemn it if you will and tell me what you think of it when i return that awful critic put daisys necklace under his arm and walked away a victim to friendship a literary damon of the nineteenth century i as children gathering pebbles on the shore milton no daintie flower or herbe that growes on grownd no arborett with painted blossomes drest and smelling sweete but there it might be found to bud out faire and throwe her sweete smels al around edmund spencer i the little castlebuilders the house by the sea the round window gods eyes in flowers the daydreamers a picture an angel old nanny on the seashore shellhunting bells freak and mortimers dream asleep imagine if you will one of the quaintest old country mansions that was ever built a bigchimneyed antiquegabled timebrowned old pile and you have a picture of the ivyton house as it was in summers gone by the pillars of the porch were not to be seen for the fragrant vines which clambered over them liptempting grapes purpleda on the southern gable of the house and the full bright cherries clustered thicker than stars among the leaves the walks of the garden were white with pebbles brought from the seashore the dewy cloverbeds on each side lay red with luscious strawberries as if some one had sprinkled drops of fire over them and among the larches and the cherry trees there was a salt seasmell pleasantly mingled with the breathing of wild roses a large round window in one of the gables looked toward the ocean a fine place for a summer view or to watch of a gusty afternoon the billows as they swell and break in long waving battalions on the beach one evening near the end of summer two children were sitting at this circular window ten aprils had half ripened them the boy had dark hair and a touch of sunlight in his darker eyes the girl was light and delicate with a face of spiritual beauty dreamlike heavenly like the pictures of the madonna which genius has hung on the chapel walls of the old world bell said the boy we never grow weary of looking at the sea no because while we are watching we think that father may be coming home to us across its bosom and we count the waves as if they were moments we like to see them roll away and feel that time grows shorter between father and us yes that is so he replied but then we love night almost as much as the sea that is because we have a father in heaven as well as one at sea and the girl shaded her angel face with a dainty little hand and we love the sunbeams and the flowers bell we do indeed cried bell and the sunshine nestled among her curls we do indeed because god like the good fairy in our storybook comes in sunlight or hides in flowers and he reveals himself in ever so many ways to all who love him hides in flowers repeated the boy musingly i never thought of that then perhaps only perhaps the dewdrops which i showed you last night in the white japonica were gods eyes may be so returned bell simply they were two strange children nature and perhaps circumstances had made them so they were born and had always lived in the old house their mother was in heaven and their father was one of those who go down to the sea in ships with no one to teach them save the old housekeeper nanny their minds had taken odd turns and conceits they had grown up old people in a hundred ways the roar of the winds and the sea had been in their ears from infancy in the summer months they wandered late on the sandy beaches or slept with the silent sunshine under the cherry trees they had grown up with nature and nature beat in them like another heart she had imbued them with her richer and tenderer moods bell was the wildest and strangest of the two she was one of those жrial little creatures who somehow or other get into this world sometimes it must be by slipping through the fingers of the angels for they seem strangely out of place and i am sure that they are missed somewhere they never stay long they come to earth and sometimes ripen for heaven in a twelve month the sweetest flowers are those that die in the springtime they touch the world with beauty and are gone before a ruder breath than that of god scatters their perfume bell was a gipsy angel one of those who wander for awhile outside the walls of heaven in the shady pastures and byways of the world mortimer said bell after a long silence how nice it is to sit here and watch the bits of sails coming and going coming and going never weary i wonder how long we have sat at this window and watched the white specks i wonder if it will always be so if you and i will still be here loving the sea and stars when our heads are as white as nannys no cried the boy impetuously i am going out into the broad deep world and write books full of wonderful thought like the arabian nights and he repeated it the broad deep world ah child what have such dreamers as you to do in the broad deep world the wonderful restless sea where men cast the net of thought and bring up pebbles i would like that mort cried bell clapping her hands but then what a grand place this would be to write them in you can have your desk by the open window here and when your eyes are tired you can rest them on the sea and i will be so quiet as gentle as pussy even and do nothing but make pens for you all the time wouldnt that be fine yes and father should go no more away in ships he might have a yacht to leap over the surge in to sail around all those little islands and in the green bays but never go off to sea the books i am going to write will bring us money enough so the little castlebuilders talked until the sun had melted into the waves and twilight like a pilgrim that had been resting by the roadside rose up from the beach and came slowly toward the old house mortimer who had been gazing dreamily at the beach which grew fainter and fainter till it seemed like a white thread running through the selvage of blue drapery turned his eyes on bell bell said he quietly as you sit there in the shadows with your beautiful hair folded over your forehead you look like an angel do i i can put my hand on your neck yet you seem far away from me come rest your head in my lap mort said the girl tenderly and i will tell you of a real true angel who once came into this world the chestnut locks of the boy looked darker against her white dress as bell bent over him and commenced in a low silvery voice an old angel legend she was in the midst of a strange description of paradise when a tremulous voice came up the stairway come to tea children then the two looked at each other curiously it was so odd to be called to tea and they in heaven it was a long step from paradise to the suppertable but the dream was shattered bell laughed then they closed the window and descended to the room below where nanny had prepared the evening meal of snowy bread and milk and ripe purple whortleberries it was very queer to see the three sitting at table to see homelylooking but kindhearted nanny between the two children like a twilight between two pleasant mornings when supper was over and while nanny was washing the teathings the children went down to the beach shell hunting the white moon stood directly over the sea and the waves were full of silvery arrows as if diana had scattered them from her quiver mortimers eyes drank in the sight as they had a thousand times before for nature is ever new to her lovers in the measured roll of the sea he heard the diapason of a grand poem and the faroff thunder heard now and then was the chorus of the gods but heaven rapt the heart of little bell the waves fell on her finer ear like subtlest music to her they were harps and the fingers of angels were touching them while the thunder was god walking overhead they wandered along the sands picking up curious shells and creamwhite pebbles dashed with red or clouded with mazarine bell would hold them up to her ear and listen to the little whispers as she called them but the boy would skim them along the wavetips and shout when some great billow caught one and hurled it back scornfully at his feet bell saw a ridge of rocks which looked like the back of a whale running out some distance into the sea where the water was whiter and leaped higher than anywhere else and soon her dainty feet picked a way over the jagged rocks the boy was about to send a light shell skipping through the surf when his glance caught bell standing on the highest jut of the ledge the wind lifting her long hair and the folds of her dress bell bell the stars are in the sea brother she replied and the winds are wild here bell bell i cannot come to you i fear to walk over the rocks again but it is beautiful here and i am not afraid ah bell he spoke sadly thats what i dreamt i thought that there was a gulf between us and when i called bell bell you answered i cannot come to you brother but you can come to me o bell sister bell as you love me come back i tremble when you look so like an angel come to me sister mortimer ran out on the slender bridge of stone and led bell back by the hand after a little while they heard nanny calling them to come home the children occupied a small chamber over the front door a scented vine clomb all about the window and taught the ruddy sun at morning to throw a subdued light into the room and it broke the orange stream of sunset at night the dreamers from their bed could see the stars hanging like fruit among its cloudy leaves when bell and mortimer came up from the seabeach the moonlight breaking through this leafy lattice made the chamber as that of abon ben adhem like a lily in bloom nanny brought a lamp and kissed them goodnight o we dont want a lamp all this moon cried bell the boy sat half undressed at the window bell loves moonlight like a fairy he said bells robe fell to her knees in snowy folds and she stood like a petite venus rising from the froth then brother and sister braided their voices in a simple prayer to our father in heaven they prayed for kind old nanny and for one on the wide sea when will father come home asked bell for the hundredth time that day it will not be long now when the boughs of the cherry trees are an inch deep with ice and the logs crackle in the fireplace then he will come let us go to sleep and dream of him and thus hand in hand the two went in to dreamland the world of sleep the beautiful old world the dreamy palestine of pilgrim thought the lotus garden where the soul may lie lost in elysium while the music moan of some unearthly river faintly caught seems like the whispering of angels blown upon жolian harpstrings and we change into a seeming something that is not ii ah yes with joy the april rain thrills natures breast but mine with pain sigheth he will not come again albert laighton ii the dead hope times changes falldown castles little bell waiting when will father come home little bell weary what the sea said never more longfellow beautifully asks in hyperion what is time but the shadow of the hourhand on a dialplate the flowers of the earth and the hearts of men are dialplates the shadows coming and going on them are the hourhands when a flower fades or a heart ceases to beat it is only a weight run down the whole universe is but one immense timepiece throbbing with innumerable wheels heavy with weights and wearing itself away desire is a restless pendulum one end linked to the heart and the other pointing downward a year had added another link to that chain which stretches through eternity a year battles lost and won nations in mourning for their dead ships gone down at sea and new paths worn to graveyards o for the castles that blow down in a year but time fell gently on the inmates of the old house the trees and vines were a little larger and winter had somewhat browned the gables bell was paler and more beautiful and mortimer was still the same dreamer there was a question which haunted the old house it was heard in the garden at the round window and on the stair when will father come home the months flew away like carrier doves with memories beneath their wings when will father come home and the question was asked again and again till the little lips and heart of bell grew weary then she folded her hands and said he will never come her blue eyes became more dreamy and her slight form so very slight glided about the house she would listen to the sea once she said never more and the sea repeated it with a human voice in the still night she asked when will father come home never more said the sea and she heard it through the open window never more she waited and the months went by was the child bell the only one in this world waiting who has not some hope at sea who has not waited and watched and grown weary who has not a question in his heart to which a low spiritvoice replies never more iii i saw our little gertrude die she left off breathing and no more i smoothed the pillow beneath her head she was more beautiful than before like violets faded were her eyes by this we knew that she was dead through the open window looked the skies into the chamber where she lay and the wind was like the sound of wings as if angels came to bear her away the golden legend iii soulland autumn and winter by the fireside where little bell is going nanny sings about cloe bell reads a poem the flight of an angel the funeral the good parson the two gravestones it was autumn the wind with its chilly fingers picked off the sere leaves and made mounds of them in the garden walks the boom of the sea was heavier and the pale moon fell oftener on stormy waves than in the summer months change and decay had come over the face of earth even as they come over the features of one dead in woods and hollow places vines lay rotting and venturesome buds that dared to bloom on the hem of winter and the winds made wail over the graves of last years flowers then winter came winter with its beard of snow winter with its frosty breath and icy fingers turning everything to pearl the wind whistled odd tunes down the chimney the plumtree brushed against the house and the hail played a merry tattoo on the windowglass how the logs blazed in the sitting room bell did not leave her room now her fairy footsteps were never heard tripping nor her voice vibrating through the entry in some sweet song she scarcely ever looked out at the window all was dreary there besides she fancied that the wind looked at her it was in her armchair by the antique fireplace that she was most comfortable she never wearied of watching the pictured tiles and one representing the infant christ in the manger was her favorite there she sat from sunny morn until shadowy twilight with her delicate hands crossed on her lap while mortimer read to her sometimes she would fix her large thoughtful eyes on the fantastic grouping of the embers at her feet and then she did not hear him reading she was wandering in soulland heavens gates are open when the worlds are shut the gates of this world were closing on bell and her feet were hesitating at the threshold of heaven waiting only for the mystic word to enter very beautiful bell was her perfect soul could not hide itself in the pale spiritual face it was visible in her thought and in her eyes there was a world of tender meaning in her smile the angel of patience had folded her in its wings and she was meek holy as mortimer sat by her before the evening lamps were lighted and watched the curious pictures which the flickering driftwood painted on the walls he knew that she could not last till the violets came again she spoke so gently of death the bridge which spans the darkness between us and heaven so softened its dark dreadful outlines that it seemed as beautiful as a path of flowers to the boy and nanny death said bell one day is a folding of the hands to sleep how quiet is death there is no more yearning no more waiting in the grave it comes to me pleasantly the thought that i shall lie under the daisies gods daisies and the robins will sing over me in the trees everything is so holy in the churchyard the moss on the walls the willows and the long grass that moves in the wind poor nanny tried to hum one of her old ditties about cloe and her lover then suddenly she found something interesting at the window but it would not do the tears would come and she knelt down by bells side and bells little hand fell like a strip of white moonlight on nannys hair we shall miss you darling sobbed mortimer at first wont you and bell smiled and who knows what sights she saw in the illumined fireplace were they pictures of heaven little bell what shall i read to you pet asked mortimer one morning she had been prattling for an hour in her wise childlike way and was more than usually bright you shall not read to me at all replied bell chirpingly but sit at my feet and i will read to you she took a slip of paper from her workbasket and her voice ran along the sweetest lines that the sweetest poet ever wrote they are from alfred tennysons may queen i did not hear the dog howl mother or the deathwatch beat there came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet but sit beside my bed mother and put your hand in mine and effie on the other side and i will tell the sign all in the wild march morning i heard the angels call it was when the moon was setting and the dark was over all the trees began to whisper and the wind began to roll and in the wild march morning i heard them call my soul for lying broad awake i thought of you and effie dear i saw you sitting in the house and i no longer here with all my strength i prayed for both and so i felt resigned and up the valley came a swell of music on the wind i thought that it was fancy and i listened in my bed and then did something speak to me i know not what was said for great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind and up the valley came again the music on the wind but you were sleeping and i said its not for them its mine and if it comes three times i thought i take it for a sign and once again it came and close beside the windowbars then seemed to go right up to heaven and die among the stars so now i think my time is near i trust it is i know the blessed music went that way my soul will have to go and for myself indeed i care not if i go today but effie you must comfort her when i am past away and say to robin a kind word and tell him not to fret theres many worthier than i would make him happy yet if i had lived i cannot tell i might have been his wife but all these things have ceased to be with my desire of life oh look the sun begins to rise the heavens are in a glow he shines upon a hundred fields and all of them i know and there i move no longer now and there his light may shine wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine o sweet and strange it seems to me that ere this day is done the voice that now is speaking may be beyond the sun to lie within the light of god as i lie upon your breast and the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest when bell had finished reading she took mortimers hand in her own i shall not die until the violet comes the beautiful violet with its clouded bell march melted into april the month of tears then came blossoming may and still bell lingered like a strain of music so sweet that the echoes will not let it die one morning in june the sun with noiseless feet came creeping into the room and bell was dying mortimer was telling her of some seaside walk when the unseen angel came between them bells voice went from her her heart grew chilly and she knew that it was death the boy did not notice the change but when her hand lay cold in his he looked up with fear he saw her beautiful eyes looking heavenward and those smiles which wreathe the lips of the young after death the sunset of smiles bell bell bell but she did not hear him the viewless spirits of flowers came through the open window into the quiet room and the winds which made the curtains tremble gently lifted the tresses of the sleeping angel then the chiming of village bells came and went in pulses of soft sound how musical they were that morning how the robins showered their silvery notes like raindrops among the leaves there was holy life in everything the lilacscented atmosphere the brooks the grass and the flowers that lay budding on the bosom of delicious june and thus it was in the exquisite springtime that the hand of death led little bell into soulland one afternoon the blinds were turned down not a ray of light stole through them only the spicy air there was something solemn stalking in the entries and all through the house it seemed as if there was a corpse in every room the way the chairs were placed the darkened parlor the faded flowers on the mantelpiece and the brooding silence said it said that bell was dead yes in the little parlor she lay in her white shroud bell no it was not bell it was only the beautiful robe which her spirit in its flight had cast aside there was a moving of feet to and fro gradually the room became full of forms the village parson stood among them his hair had the white touch of age and his heart knew the chastening hand of god exceeding peace was written on his meek face he lifted up his soul on the arms of prayer he spoke of the dead whose life had been as pure as a new snow he spoke cheerfully and tenderly and sometimes smiled for his faith was large in time and that which shapes it to some perfect end he had drank at the fountain of gods word his soul had been refreshed and his were not the lips to preach the doctrine of an endless wail he knew that there are many mansions in our fathers house and he said that bell was happier there than here he glanced back upon her infant days and ran along the various threads of her life to the moment death disentangled them from the world this little one in her shroud he said is an eloquent sermon she passed through the dark valley without fear and sits like mary at the feet of our saviour of this life he said it is but an imperfect prelude to the next of death it is only a brief sleep some sunny morning we shall wake up with the child bell and find ourselves in heaven the coffin was closed and the train passed through the gravelled walk then came that dull heavy sound of earth falling on the coffinlid which makes ones heart throb did you ever hear it when bell had been a year in heaven a plain headstone was placed over nanny she lingered only a little while after her darling she folded her arms and fell asleep one summer twilight and never again opened her kind old eyes on this world age had weakened her frame and the parting of soul and body was only the severing of a fragile cord mortimer did not remain long in the old house its light and pleasantness had passed away the little stock of money which his father had left previous to his last voyage was exhausted he could earn nothing in the village his early dream of the great city came over him again he yearned for its ceaseless excitement its grandeur he never thought of its misery its sin and pollution through the length of one july night he lay awake in bed while his eyes were like kaleidoscopes taking a thousand arabesque forms and fancies toward morning he fell asleep having built some falldown castles in the air the next day he took a last lingering look at the old rooms a last ramble on the seashore he sat an hour under the braided branches of the cherry trees gave a parting look at the white caps of the sea and turned his eyes to the city in the dim distance the great cityocean with no one to point out to him its sunken reefs its quicksands and maelstroms next to bells grave he placed a simple tablet to the memory of his father this sod does not enfold him said mortimer to himself but it will be pleasant for me to think when i am far away that their names are near together so he left them in the quiet churchyard at ivyton left them sleeping among the thick muskroses in the warm sunshine and the same berylline moss was creeping over the two mounds one headstone said little bell and the other sacred to the memory of our

iv a few specimens of humanity down town messrs flint snarle tim the office boy and the pale bookkeeper the escritoire the purloined package mr flint goes home midnight miss daisy snarle the poor author in one of those thousand and one veinlike streets which cross and recross the mercantile heart of gotham is situated a red brick edifice which like the beggar who solicits your charity in the park has seen better days in the time of our knickerbocker sires it was an aristocratic dwelling fronting on a fashionable street and jeems in green livery opened the hall door the street was a quiet orderly street in those days a certain air of conscious respectability hung about it sometimes a private cabriolet rolled augustly along and of summer evenings the city beaux with extraordinary shoebuckles might have been seen promenading the grassfringed sidewalks today it is a miasmatic miserable muddy thoroughfare your ears are startled by the extray rival of the rabia and the omnibuses dash through the little confined street with a perfect madness instead of the whitekidded beruffled gallants of eld you meet a hurrying throng of pale anxious faces with tare tret and speculation in their eyes it is a business street for mammon has banished fashion to the golden precincts of fifth avenue the green of jeems livery is like himself invisible he has departed this life gone like hiawatha to the land of the hereafter to the land of spirits where we can conceive him to be in his element but he has a town residence in an obscure graveyard with his name and recommendation on a stone doorplate his mundane superiors are reclining beneath the shadow of st pauls steeple where they are regaled with some delectable music if you would only think so from the balcony of the museum opposite and have the combined benefit of barnums scenicartist and the drummond light the massive doorplate and highly polished distorted knocker no longer grace the oaken panels of number but a republican sign over the familylooking doorway tells you that the front room second floor is occupied by messrs flint snarle after passing up a flight of broad uncarpeted stairs you again see the name of that respectable firm painted on a light of ground glass set in the office door once on the other side of that threshold you breathe mercantile air there have been so many braintrying interest calculations worked out on those high desks that the very atmosphere figuratively speaking is mathematical the sign should not read flint snarle for snarle has been dead six months and it is not pleasant to contemplate a name without an owner it is not to every one but mr flint likes to read the sign and think that snarle is dead he was the reverse of flint and that his name should have been snarle at all is odd for in life he was the quintessence of quietness and the oil of good nature but flint is well named he is chalcedony at heart nobody says this but everybody knows it nell the pretty matchgirl who sells her wares in wallstreet never approaches him nor the newsboys and blind men with sagacious halffed dogs steer clear of him by instinct he doesnt tolerate paupers and italian handorgans with monkey accompaniments not he the man who has not as much money as the surviving senior of flint snarle is a dog in flints distinguished estimation his god is not that divine presence whose thought shaped the world and laid it in the sunbeams flints god is gold gold gold gold gold bright and yellow hard and cold molten graven hammered and rolled heavy to get and light to hold hoarded bartered bought and sold stolen borrowed squandered doled spurned by the young but hugged by the old to the very verge of the churchyard mould price of many a crime untold gold gold gold gold flint is about fiftythree years of age but if you could forget his gray hair and look only at those small piercing black eyes you would hardly think him forty his black dresscoat is buttoned around his somewhat attenuated form and he wears a stiff white cravat because it looks religious in this respect and perhaps in others you will find flints prototype on every corner people who look religious if religion can be associated with the aspect of an undertaker it is monday morning mr flint sits in his private office reading the letters there is a window cut in the wall and he glances through it now and then eyeing the bookkeeper as if the poor careworn fellow were making false entries on a high consumptivelooking stool sits the office boy filing away answered letters and sundry bills paid the stool seems so high and the boy so small that he at once suggests some one occupying a dangerous position at a masthead or on the golden ball of a churchsteeple for thus risking his life he receives thirty dollars per year and clothing we like to have forgotten that the said clothing consists of one white cravat full of hinges and a dilapidated coat twelve sizes too large for him his widowed mother supplying the deficiency save the monotonous ticking of a thickset croupy clock and the nervous scratching of pens not a sound is heard mr flint in deep thought with his thumbs lost in the armholes of a white vest paces up and down his limited sanctum just as a thoughtfuleyed velvetmouthed leopard walks its confined cage only waiting for a chance to put its paws on somebody the stool on which the boy is sitting is a rickety concern and its creakings annoy mr flint who comes out and looks over the orphans shoulder if his lynx eyes discover a document incorrectly filed he pinches the delinquents ears till he the orphan is as red in the face as an august sunset mr flint chuckles when he gets back to his desk and seems to enjoy it immensely for he drums out an exhilarating dead march with his long wiry fingers on the cover of the letterbook the pale bookkeeper his hair and eyes are darker than when we first saw him sitting with little bell at the round window in the old house continues to write assiduously and the orphan thinks that he hears firebells his ears ring so hes an unfortunate atom of humanity that officeboy he was never young he never passed through the degrading cycles of infancy never had any marbles or hoops his limbs were never ignominiously confined by those triangular arrangements incidental to babyhood at five when other children are bumping their heads over steep stairs he smoked cinnamon segars and was a precocious astute little villain at seven for thirtysix months he folded books for harper brothers and at the advanced age of ten years three months was bound over to the tender mercies of flint snarle for thirty dollars per year and clothing so the indentures read but as he is charged with all the inkstands demolished during the term and one gross of imaginary lead pencils he generally has about twentyfive dollars to his credit on the st of january which flint generously offers to keep for him at four per cent interest and which offer the ungrateful orphan firmly but respectfully declines mortimer cries mr flint in a quick snarly voice from the inner office the bookkeeper lays down the pen which he has just dipped in the ink and disappears in the little room mr flint is turning over the leaves of the invoice book in thirteen pages there are no less than two blots and five erasures you have grown careless in your penmanship lately and mr flint closes the book with a report like that of a pocketpistol and opens it again one would suppose the officeboy to be shot directly through the heart but he survives and is attacked with a wonderful fit of industry do you write in your sleep inquires mr flint with a quiet insolence mortimer thinks how often he has toiled over those same pages at hours when he should have been sleeping hours taken from his life but he makes no reply he only bites his lips and lets his eyes flash suddenly a thought strikes him and bending over mr flints shoulder as if to examine more closely his careless chirography he takes a small key from an open drawer in the escritoire behind him and drops it into his vestpocket after receiving a petulant reprimand mortimer returns to his desk and again that weary weary pen scratches over the paper after the bank deposit is made up and mr flint looks over the billbook and startles the orphan from a state of semisomnolency he goes on change he is no sooner out than mortimer throws tim a bit of silver coin get some apples for yourself tim tim hes small of his age slides down from the high stool with agility while his two eyes look like interrogation points he is wondering at this sudden outbreak of munificence for though mr mortimer always had a kind word for tim and tried to extricate him from the web of mistakes which tim was forever spinning around himself yet tim never knew him to come down with the block tin before as he eloquently expressed it and he looks at mortimer all the time he is getting his cap and pauses a moment at the door to see if he doesnt repent when tims feet cease sounding on the stairs mortimer goes into the back office and with the key which he had taken from the drawer unlocks a small iron handsafe his trembling fingers turn over package after package at last he finds one which seems to be the object of his search this he hastily conceals in the bosom of his coat after carefully relocking the safe he approaches the escritoire to return the purloined key but to his dismay he finds the drawer locked the one above it however is unfastened drawing this out he places the key in its right compartment mortimer in searching for the paper which he has hidden in his bosom had removed several others from the safe but in his nervousness he had neglected to replace a small morocco case he discovers his negligence and hears footfalls on the stairs at the same moment there is no time to reopen the chest he wraps the case in his handkerchief and resumes his place at the desk tim returns munching the remains of a gigantic apple and bearing about him a convicting smell of peanuts suddenly mr flint enters and tim is necessitated to swallow the core of his russet without that usual preparatory mastication which natures kindly law suggests mr flint has made a capital bargain on change and his face is lighted up with a smile if fancy can coax such an expression into one it looks like a gaslight in an undertakers window it is five oclock mr flint goes home to doze over a diminutive glass of sherry he holds it up between his eyes and the light smiling to see the liquid jewels and wishes that they were real rubies flint they are red tears and not jewels which glisten in your glass for you crushed the poor and took advantage of the unfortunate to buy this pleasant blood which pulses in your brittle chalice that night he thought of a pair of blue innocent eyes which once looked pleadingly in his of two tiny arms that were once wound fondly around his neck those eyes haunted him into the misty realm of dreams where myriads of little arms were stretched out to him and he turned restlessly on his pillow ah flint there is an invisible and powerful spirit in the heart of every man that will speak it whispers to the criminal in his cell and the downy pillows and sumptuous drapery around the couch of wealth cannot keep it away at midnight there is not a house but has its skeleton there is a ghastly one in flints the silvery lips in trinity steeple chime the hour of eleven st pauls catch it up and hosts of belfrys toss the hour to and fro like a shuttlecork then the goblin bells hush themselves to sleep again in their dizzy nests murmuring murmuring and the pen of the pale bookkeeper keeps time with the ticking of the office timepiece it is nearly twelve oclock when he reaches the door of a common twostory house in marionstreet the door is opened before he can turn the bolt with his nightkey and the whitest possible little hand presses his he draws it within his own and places his arm around the daintiest little waist that ever submitted to the operation then the two enter the front parlor where the dim light falls on mortimer and a beautiful girl on the verge of womanhood she looks into his face and his lips touch a tress of chestnut hair which has fallen over his shoulder you are very pale have you been unwell today no daisy and he bends down and kisses her why do you persist in sitting up for me i shall scold if you spoil your cheeks kiss me daisy the girl pouts and declares she wont as she coquettishly twines her arms around his neck and mortimer has such a kiss as all flints bank stock could not buy him a pure earnest kiss he was rich poor in the worlds eye richer than flint with his corpulent money bags god pity him they sit a long while without speaking mortimer breaks the silence we are very poor daisy yes but happy sometimes tonight i am not i am weary of this daily toiling the world is not a workshop to wear out souls in man has perverted its use life and thought and brain are but crucibles to smelt gold in nobleness is made the slave of avarice just as a pure stream is taught to turn a millwheel and become foul and muddied the rich are scornful and the poor sorrowful o daisy such things should not be my heart beats when i think how poorly you and your mother are living o how much we owe you mortimer you are selling your life for us from morning till night day after day you have been our slave poor dear mortimer how can we thank you we can only give you love and prayers you will not let me help you last night when you found me embroidering a collar a bit of work which mrs potiphar had kindly given me you pleasantly cut it in pieces with your penknife and then pawned your gold pencil to pay for ruining mrs potiphars muslin too proud to have me work why will you pain me darling i was complaining for others not myself i do not toil as thousands do i am impulsive and irascible and do not mean all i say i am ungrateful my heart should be full of gratitude tonight for the cloud which has hung over me the last six months has shown its silver lining what do you mean cries daisy do you know that you are an heiress asks mortimer gaily daisy laughs at the idea and mockingly says yes an heiress to a good name daisy which is better than purple and linen and fine gold daisy looks mystified but forbears to question him for he complains of sleep the lovers part at the head of the stairs mortimer on reaching his room draws a paper from his bosom he weeps over it reads it again and again then he holds it in the flame of a candle when the ashes have fallen at his feet he exclaims i have kept my promise harvey snarle peace to your memory from a writingdesk in a corner of the room he takes a pile of manuscript and weary as he is adds several pages to it the dream of his boyhood has grown with him that delightful dream of authorship how this willothewisp of the brain entices one into mental fogs how it coaxes and pets one cheats and ruins one and so that appalling pile of closelywritten manuscript is mortimers romance wasted hours and wasted thought who would buy or read it a downtown clock strikes the hour of two so gently that it sounds like the tinkling of sheepbells coming through the misty twilight air from the green meadows with which felicitous simile we will give our hero a little sleep after having kept him up two hours after midnight slumber touches his eyelids gently but daisy lies awake for hours at last falling into a trouble sleep she dreams that she is an heiress oh daisy snarle v the bitter cups of death are mixed and we must drink and drink again r h stoddard v daisy snarle sunday morning harvey snarle and mortimer a tale of sorrow the snowchild mortimer takes daisys hand snarles death six months previous to the commencement of the last chapter mr harvey snarle lay dying slowly in a front room of the little house in marionstreet it was sunday morning the church bells were ringing speaking with musical lips to ye goode folk and chiming a sermon to the pomp and pride of the city as mortimer sat by the window the houses opposite melted before his vision and again he saw the old homestead buried in a world of leaves heard the lapping of the sea and a pleasant chime of bells from the humble church at ivytown and more beautiful than all was a child with clouds of golden hair wandering up and down the seashore mortimer said the sick man then the dream melted and the commonlooking brick buildings came back again the doctor thought i could not live said the man inquiringly he thought there was little hope replied mortimer but doctors are not fortunetellers he added cheerfully i feel that he is right little hope where is daisy she has lain down for a moment shall i call her wearied poor angel she watched me last night i did not sleep much i closed my eyes and she smiled to think that i was slumbering quietly no do not call her after a pause the sick man said wet my lips i have something to tell you mortimer moistened his feverish lips and sat on the bedside it comes over me said the consumptive what that pain no my life there is something drearier than death in the world sometimes life thought mortimer half aloud the sick man looked at him why did you say that i thought it life is a bitter gift sometimes an ambition or a passion possess us flatters and mocks us death is not so dreary a thing as life then he felt that who the devil his mind is wandering murmured mortimer wandering it isnt said snarle slowly a passion a love made flints life bitter flint did he ever love anything but gold yes but it was long ago we are cousins we were schoolmates and friends sharing our boyish sports and troubles with that confiding friendship which leaves us in our teens we lived together i can see the old white frame house at hampton falls and the man passed his emaciated hand over his eyes as if to wipe out some unpleasant picture a niece of my fathers came to spend a winter with us young mens thoughts run to love i could but love her she was so beautiful and good and while she did a thousand kind things to win my affection she took a strange aversion to my cousin flint who grew rude and impetuous we were married but long before that flint packed up his little trunk and without a word of farewell left us one night for a neighboring city years went by and from time to time tidings reached us of his prosperity and growing wealth we were proud of his industry and thought of him kindly we too were prospering but the tide of our fortune changed my fathers affairs and mine became complicated he died and the farm was sold one day i stood at flints office door and asked for employment evil day better for me if i had toiled in the fields from morning till night wringing a reluctant livelihood from the earth which is even more human than flint wet my lips boy and come near to me that i may tell you how i became his slave softly so the air may not hear me mortimer drew nearer to him it was a hard winter for the poor my darling wife was suffering from the mere want of proper medicines and food i asked flint for a little more than the pitiable salary which he allowed me he smiled and said that i was extravagant we had not clothes enough to shield us from the cold i told him that my wife was sick and he replied bitterly poor men should not have wives wet my lips again can you love me boy after what i shall tell you i forged a check for a trivial amount and snarles voice sunk to a hoarse whisper can you love me can i love you cried mortimer he could not see the sick man for his tears can i forget all your kindness years ago when i was a mere child toiling early and late in flints office did you not take me to your home a poor hopebroken boy have i not grown up with daisy like your own child not love you mortimer laid his face on the same pillow with the sick mans i was not sent to prison continued snarle with a shudder only my own mind and soul and actions were prisoners i was flints flint owned me that little paper which he guards so carefully is the titledeed o mortimer as you hold my memory dear destroy that paper tear it burn it trample it out of the world with these words snarle sank back upon the pillow from which he had half risen he went on speaking in a lower tone i have suffered so much that i am sure god will forgive me never let the world know never let my wife and daisy know that i was a o i will promise you dear father cried mortimer before he could finish the dreadful word i will destroy the paper though twenty flints guarded it the man who steals a loaf of bread for famishing lips is not such a criminal in gods sight as he who steals a million times its value by law to feed his avarice think no more of it the angel who records in his book has written a hundred good deeds over that unfortunate one the worlds frown is not gods frown and his heart is open when mans is barred with unforgiveness thank you thank you said snarle brightening up a little your words give me comfort i have not much more to tell flint took me into the firm but i was the same slave i worked and worked and the reapings were his you have seen it you know it and this was his revenge his wounded love and pride have wrecked themselves on me he has never crossed the threshold of our door never laid his eyes on my wife since the time when we were thoughtless boys together o how cruel he has been to me evening after evening in midwinter he has made me bring the last editions of the express to his house and never asked me in this was said with such a ludicrous expression that mortimer would have laughed if it had been anybody but poor snarle exhausted with talking the sick man sank into a quiet slumber mortimer sat by his bedside for an hour watching the change of expressions in the sleepers face the shadow of his dreams coming and going then his head drooped upon his bosom and he slept so soundly that he did not know that daisy came in the room and stood beside him looking in his face with her fond quiet eyes when he awoke one long dark shadow from the houses opposite slanted into the apartment snarle was looking at him i have been asleep said snarle and have had such pleasant thoughts that it is painful to find myself in this poor little world again ah me what will wife and daisy do in it all alone not alone said mortimer i will watch over them love them then after a pause father i love daisy i would make her my wife ah i wished that but i did not think it and snarle paused a moment have you told daisy so yes but well said snarle waiting but she does not love me and that is why i said love would make life bitter perhaps she does no what did daisy say she said there were clouds in the morning of her life these were her own words which had no sunshine in them then she called me brother and kissed me and told me that i must never think of her as my wife she would be my sister always and when i speak to her of this she turns away or hums a pleasant air to mock me she is not our child mortimer what no i am not wandering said snarle in reply to mortimers look she is not our child we adopted her under strange circumstances i have not told you this before daisy did not wish me to but it is right that you should know it now sit nearer to me mortimer obeyed mechanically one stormy night we were sitting my wife and i in the room below i remember as if it were yesterday how the wind slammed the windowblinds and blew out the streetlamps it was just a year ago that night we lost our little maye and we were very sad we sat in silence while without the storm increased the hail and snow dashed against the windowpanes and down the chimney every now and then the wind lulled and everything was still heaven knows why mr snarle ceased speaking just then but he did and seemed lost in reverie what was i saying you were speaking of the storm yes yes it was in one of those pauses of the wind that we heard a low sob under our windows we did not heed it at first for sometimes a storm moans like a human voice it came again so distinctly as to leave no doubt i opened the halldoor and groped about in the snow when i returned to the sittingroom i held little daisy in my arms she was no larger than our maye who died our little threeyearold the child was half frozen and nothing but a coarse cloak thrown over her nightdress had saved her from perishing i reported the circumstance at the policestation but such things were of too common occurrence to excite much interest weeks passed and then months and no one answered the advertisements at last we had learned to love the child so dearly that we dreaded the thought of parting with it i asked and obtained permission to adopt the pet and so daisy became ours she is very proud and the mystery of her birth troubles her and this before snarle could finish the sentence daisy herself opened the room door and came tripping up to the bedside mortimer took her hand very quietly daisy he said i love you daisy hid her face in the pillow he has told me everything and i love you daisy daisy looked up with the tears and sunshine of april in her eyes do you love me he asked the girl was silent for a moment then a sweet little yes budded on her lips then mortimer kissed daisy and poor snarle died happy for that evening his lifestream ebbed with the tide and mingled with that ocean which is forever and forever requiescat in pace vi a lone ship sailing on the sea before the north twas driven like a cloud high on the poop a man sat mournfully the wind was whistling through mast and shroud and to the whistling wind thus did he sing aloud smiths barbara vi the phantom at sea a storm in the tropics the lone ship the man at the wheel how he sang strange songs the apparition the drifting bark the bloodred sun had gone down into the atlantic faint purple streaks streamed up the western horizon like the fingers of some great shadowy hand clutching at the world huge masses of dark agatelooking clouds were gathering in the zenith and the heavy close atmosphere told the coming of a storm now and then the snaky lightning darted across the heavens and coiled itself away in a cloud a lone ship stood almost motionless in the twilight the sails were closereefed here and there on the forecastle were groups of lazylooking seamen and a man walked the quarterdeck glancing anxiously aloft the sea was as smooth as a mirror and that dreadful stillness was in the air which so often preludes a terrific storm in the tropics a rumbling was heard in the sky like the sound of distant artillery or heavy bodies of water falling from immense heights then the surface of the sea was broken by mimic waves tipped with froth and the vast expanse seemed like a prairie in a snow fall the lightning became more frequent and vivid and the thunder seemed breaking on the very topmasts of the vessel then the starless night sunk down on the ocean and the sea raved in the gathering darkness the storm was at its height the wind through unseen sluices of the air tore the shrouds to strings and bent the dizzy tapering masts till they threatened to snap but the bark bore bravely through it while the huge waves seemed bearing her down to those coral labyrinths where nothing goes but doth suffer a seachange into something rich and strange the thunder sent forth peal after peal and the heaven was like a looming bastion fringed with fire on through the slanting rain sped the ship creaking and groaning with its ribs warped and its great oaken spine trembling the sailors on deck clung to the bulwarks and below not a soul could sleep for the thunder and the creaking of cordage filled their ears at midnight the storm abated but the sea still ran dangerously high and the wind sobbed through the rigging mournfully the heaven was spangled with tremulous stars and at the horizon the clouds hung down in gossamer folds gods robe trailing in the sea toward morning the waves grew suddenly calm as if they had again heard that voice which of old said peace be still there was no one above decks save the man at the wheel who ever and anon muttered to himself or hummed bits of poetry he was a man in the mellow of life in the indian summer of manhood which comes a little while before one falls into the sere and yellow leaf once he must have been eminently handsome but there were furrows on his intellectual forehead not traced by times fingers his eyes were peculiarly wild and restless the slightest tinge of red fringed the east and as the man watched it grow deeper and deeper he sang snatches of those odd seasongs which shakespeare scatters through his plays the master the swabber the boatswain and i the gunner and his mate loved mall meg and marian and margary but none of us cared for kate for she had a tongue with a twang would cry to a sailor go hang she loved not the savor of tar or of pitch then to sea boys and let her go hang then his sonorous voice rang out these quaint words to the night full fathom five thy father lies of his bones are coral made those are pearls that were his eyes nothing of him that doth fade he abruptly broke off and commenced break break break on thy cold gray stones o sea and i would that my tongue could utter the thoughts that arise in me o well for the fishermans boy that he shouts with his sister at play o well for the sailor lad that he sings in his boat on the bay and the stately ships go on to the haven under the hill but oh for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still break break break at the foot of thy crags o sea but the tender grace of a day that is dead will never come back to me suddenly he paused while a paleness like death overspread his face the spokes of the wheel slipped from his hold and he called for help but the wind went moaning through the shrouds and drowned his voice the sea moaned and the ship drifted with the wind it comes again he cried the graveyard face go i cannot bear those sad reproachful eyes those arms outstretched asking mercy send foul fiends to torture me and make my dreams hideous nightmares but not this beautiful form to mock me with its purity and kill me with its mild reproach it has gone but it will come again it steals on me in the awful hours of night when the air seems supernatural and the mind is accessible to fear it stood by my hammock last night my conscious soul looked through my closed eyelids and sleep felt its dreadful presence if it comes again i will throw myself into the sea hush he whispered it stands by the cabin door so pale so pale come not near me pensive ghost give me help somebody help help he sunk down by the wheel the stars at the approach of morning had grown as white as pondlilies and the wind had died away but the same moan came up from the sea on in the morning twilight drifted the ship for an hour without a helmsman save that unseen hand which guides all things which balances with equal love and tenderness a dewdrop or a world vii i was not always a man of woe walter scott vii in which there is a madman mr flint sips vino doro the stranger the letter mr flint outwitted mr flints photograph the madmans story the wrecked soul how mr flint is troubled by his conscience and dreams of a pair of eyes the same night on which mortimer was writing in the books of flint snarle mr flint sat in the library of his bachelor home sipping a glass of vino doro and as the bells of trinity church fell faintly on his ear he drew a massive gold watch from his fob and patting it complacently on the back scrutinized its face as if he would look it out of countenance then he yawned a couple of times and thought of bed theres a gintleman without sur said michel putting his comical head in at the library door theres a gintleman without sur and he emphasized the gintleman what sort of a person michel a very quare one indade is mr flint in sez he he is sur sez i i want to see him sez he your kard sur sez i he stared at me a minit and laughed then sez he without the least riverence for your worship give this to owld flint and michel exploding with laughter handed flint a knave of clubs very much soiled michel said mr flint drawing himself up to his full altitude kick him down the steps thanks said a voice directly behind michel who had retreated to the doorway the voice was so near and unexpected that michels crisp hair stood on end with fright the door was thrown wide open and a fine looking man with the bearing of a sailor stood between them mr flint turned as white as his immaculate shirtbosom and michel whose love of fun had got the better of his scare regarded the intruder with a quizzical inquiring air peculiarly irish michel said mr flint you may go that gentleman not expecting such an order hesitated yes sur michel said the stranger your master speaks to you sure i heard him sur michel left the room and carefully closed the door after him but flint who knew his inquiring proclivities opened it suddenly and found michel on all fours with his ear to the keyhole the door was opened so unexpectedly that the listener did not discover the fact for the space of ten seconds when he looked up and beheld his master the intense expression of his face was superbly ludicrous to say that he shot to the subterranean regions of the kitchen like a flash of lightning does not border on fiction the man laughed it was a low peculiar laugh sadder than some mens tears flint well are you glad to see me and the man repeated his laugh no you are a devil i have been away three years as i promised you well what do you want money have i ever seen you when you did not no flint you never did but you saw me once when i had an unstained soul when i could have looked up to heaven and said i am poor father but i am honest have you enough money to pay for a lost soul oh flint i am a wrecked man if it had only been murder if i had killed a man in the heat of passion but a poor innocent babe in the cold snow the child the little babe ah flint i never see the white snow coming down but i think of it those eyes are always with me they follow me out to sea they haunt me in the long watches one night when a storm had torn our rigging to tatters and we heard the breakers on the leeshore i saw her standing by the binnacle light and so help me heaven she had grown to be a woman i fainted at the wheel you heard of the shipwreck how could a ship keep clear of the rocks and the helmsman in a trance forty souls went down down hist who said that not i no not i i am a maniac dont go on that way pleaded flint giving uneasy looks toward the door which he regretted having locked why it is not pleasant what isnt your eyes your words what can i do for you the mans excitement lulled for a moment he replied carelessly i am not a chameleon i cannot live on air i can earn no money the elements are against me storms and shipwrecks follow me i have not found him yet he said abruptly who my boy flint turned aside his head and laughed quietly i am tired of searching for him said the man sorrowfully i am not going to sea any more after a pause i wish to live among the fishermen off nantucket you ask me what i want yes i want two or three hundred dollars to fit up a fishingsmack give me this and i will not trouble you again god knows i dont want to look on your face and the letter will you give me the letter yes when i take the money the man drew from his bosom several letters and selected one more worn and crumpled than the rest flints eyes fed upon it of course said flint i have not such an amount in the house i have a hundred dollars up stairs and will give you a check for the remainder will that do no and yes but get the money and ill see flint left him alone from a safe in his bedchamber he took a small bag of gold and caressed it for a moment very much as ones grandmother would a pet cat then he filled up a check and called michel run to the police station michel and tell captain lto send me three or four men michel shot down stairs and his master followed him leisurely patting the goldbag lovingly at every other step does he think said flints visitor to himself as the library door closed can he think i would part with this paper he so full of worldly shrewdness so simple after awhile the door opened there gasped flint placing the bag on the table before the man the letter the letter the stranger carelessly threw a rumpled paper toward flint who grasped it convulsively his hand touched a bellrope and before the bell had ceased tinkling a heavy measured tramp came through the entry four policemen entered the room in single file with michel behind them making comical efforts to keep step arrest him cried flint hoarse with passion and triumph he has extorted money from me flint said the man walking toward him you know thats a lie mr flint retreated behind the policeman this person he cried is a stranger to me he forced his way into my house and has threatened my life arrest him quickly for he is no doubt armed gentlemen said the stranger turning to the officers mr flint i fear has given you useless trouble michel more glasses at this that astonished individual went off like a rocket for the love you bear your good name mr flint he continued look at the paper which you so innocently put in your pocket an idea struck flint which caused him to turn pale he tore open the letter but it was not the one for which he would have given half his fortune oh sagacious wily clearsighted mr flint you had better tell these gentlemen that you have made a mistake flint but before they go they must have a glass of wine michel had failed to appear with the extra glasses but the want of them was elegantly supplied by three silver goblets which stood on the beaufait and poor collapsed flint he could only bid the officers go with a wave of his hand they were alone the sailor with a scornful curl in his lip stood by the chair of the merchant whose dejected countenance taken in connection with his white cravat was delightfully comical flint commenced the man your verdancy is refreshing your sweet and childlike simplicity is like a draught of your old wine its rare its rare if anything touched flint it was sarcasm he stood in dread of ridicule as most men do whose foibles and vices deserve lashing edward walters he cried springing to his feet you have outwitted me well you are a knave it is your pride to be one your companions will shout tonight in some obscure den of this city as you tell them of your ingenuity and you will be a hero among stop john flint for sixteen years tonight my life has been as pure as a childs the vices of passion and avarice have not touched me i have borne a sorrow in my heart which shrunk instinctively from sin during these years i have been poor very poor the man paused there is a link lost somewhere in my life was i an age in a madhouse let it go i have loved my fellowman i have lingered at the hammock of a sick messmate and closed his eyes kindly when he died i have spoken words of cheer when my heart was bitterness i do not say this boastfully for gods eyes are upon us all i have done these things to atone for the one great sin of my life which has stalked through memory like a plague john flint i have had the misfortune to know you for twenty years and during that time you never have to my knowledge performed a single act worthy of being remembered you have a narrow malicious mind you have been tyrannical when you should have been generous you have been the devils emissary under the cant of religion you call jesus master but you crucify him daily there is your photograph john flint you flatter me remarked that personage sarcastically but go on it is seldom that a rich man has the truth spoken to him plainly the poor man hears it often enough consider yourself favored you have called me a knave i will draw some pictures and i wish you to look at them many years ago a seafaring man who had just lost his ship in which his little fortune had been invested returned to this city sick at heart and weak from a wound which he had received in the wreck he had battled many a year against misfortune and his utmost exertions had barely found bread for his children he owed money to a heartless and exacting man he stood before his creditor and said i am beggared but i will work for you the merchant replied come to my house tonight and i will find means by which this debt can be liquidated the sailor expected reproaches and hard words so he was surprised at the softness of this speech and his heart was full of gratitude that night he sat in the parlor of the merchant who plied him with rare wines until his mind went from him then he made a proposal to the sailor who if he had had his senses would have felled him to the floor the merchant had been appointed guardian to a motherless babe which his brother dying begged him to love and educate his ship on the sea and the bales of merchandize in his warehouses were not enough to feed his hungry avarice he needs must have the little inheritance of the babe well while he was speaking making artful pictures in the eyes of his drugged dupe the child ran into the room and twined her arms around the neck of him who should have worshiped her but he coldly unclasped the little hands and pushed her from him john flint when that man on judgment day shall cringe before the throne of god the evil angel will trample him down flint was as white as the marble mantelpiece on which he leaned edward walters stood a short distance in front of him his eyes were fixed and he spoke like one who sees what he is describing then the man the merchant wrapped the child in the sailors cloak in a few minutes the sailor stood in the stormy street with a frightened little heart throbbing against his own the cutting sleet and snow beat in his face and the wine made a veil before his eyes it was a fearful night not a human form was to be seen the street lamps were blown out and the poor mariner drifted to and fro like a deserted ship he had become mad the strange events had eaten into his brain he wrapped the babe closer in his cloak and placed her in a doorway out of the cold he wandered from street to street then he sank down in the snow when his senses came to him he had been in a madhouse god how many years was it ten the june wind broke through the barred window it touched his forehead and it was like a human hand rousing one from a dreamless sleep one evening soon after he stood before the merchant who was sipping his choice cordials as you were tonight flint and the sailor asked for the child the man replied the child is dead you left it in the cold and it died or you threw it into the river i saw a body at the deadhouse weeks afterward which looked like the child you committed murder it was your own act suppose you were to be hung for it have i a good memory john flint and the man turned his wild eyes on mr flint who gave no other evidence of not being a statue than a slight tremor of his upper lip what did the madman say to the merchant he took the cool calculating villain by the throat and cried write me out in your round clerkly hand a full avowal of your guilt in this matter or ill strangle you the merchant knew he would so he wrote this document with trembling fingers and he signed it john flint then the sailor drew from his pocket an old stained letter and held it up to the light he looked at it sadly and then his mind seemed to wander off through a gloomy mist of memories for his eyes grew gentle and dreamy he spoke softly almost tenderly john flint you never saw me weep look at me then i am thinking of an old countryhouse which stood in a cluster of trees near a seashore it once held everything that was dear to me my children three years ago i stood with my hand on the gate and looked into the little garden it had gone to waste the wind had beaten down the flower frames the honeysuckle vines were running wild and there was the moss of ten years growth on the broken chimneypots the rain had washed the paint off the house and the windows were boarded up there was something in the ruin and stillness of the place which spoke to me twilight added a gloomy background to the picture i broke the rusty fastenings of a side door and entered the deserted building it may have been fancy but i saw two forms wandering from room to room and through the darkened entries now they would pause as if listening for footsteps then they would move on again sorrowfully sorrowfully in the bedroom over the front door i saw the shadow of a little coffin she used to sleep there where were my children where was trustful old nanny that she did not come to me the house was full of strange shadows and i fled from it i did not dare go to the village hard by there were too many who might have known me i sat down in the quiet churchyard where my wife had slept many a long year i sat by a little mound on which a wreath of flowers had been laid nothing remained of them but stems and the rotting string that had bound them it had a peaceful look the grave and i wished that i had died when my mound would not have been made longer than the one at my side what did the simple headstone say it said little bell that was all the sailor grasped flints arm only little bell that was all but it was all the world to me what a tale it told what a tale of weary waiting and despair and death did her little heart wait for me did she sicken and die when i did not come to her aye it said all this and more and my boy was he living was he searching for me no not searching for close by my childs grave a white stone had these words carved on it and the man repeated them slowly sacred to the memory of our father lost at sea not lost at sea he said almost inaudibly but lost ah i could have died in that quiet place with the moonlight on me but i was startled from my grief by the shouts of some men on the roadside and i turned and fled have you looked at the picture john flint he spoke so mournfully that flint raised his little sharp eyes which all this time had been fixed on the carpet but he made no reply ill have none of your gold man i was weak to want it give it to the poor the shining round pieces may fall like sunlight into some wretched home to me they are like drops of blood and he pushed the gold from him and went to the window he saw the dim eyes of heaven looking down through the mist heard the murmurs of the city dying away and the calm of night entered his soul may you be a better man when we meet again he said turning to flint but the letter cried flint fearfully you wont the sailors lips curled and something of his former severity returned take off your sanctimonious cravat he answered wrap charity around you like a robe that you may be pleasing in gods sight you sent some gold to convert the hindoos the papers said so why man there is a heathen land at your doorstep john flint good night the merchant stood alone the night wind swayed the heavy curtains to and fro and half extinguished the brilliant jets of gas he threw himself into a chair and a vision of the past rose up before him the terrible past the ghosts of dead years haunted his brain and remorse sat on his heart boding and mysterious like the raven of the sweet poet that unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore that night as we have said he dreamt of two blue innocent eyes which once looked confidingly in his of two infant arms which encircled his neck those eyes haunted him into the realm of sleep where myriads of little arms were stretched out to him and he turned restlessly on his pillow viii he trudged along unknowing what he sought and whistled as he went for want of thought dryden viii mr flint is perfectly astonished and mortimer has a vision the light heart a scene the sunny heart a dream of little bell a hint now that mortimer walters had destroyed the record of poor snarles guilt he determined to be no longer a subject of flints authority he had watched for months for an opportunity to become possessed of the forged cheque and it was with a heart as light as a singing birds that he tripped up the office stairs an hour before his time the next morning tim was sweeping out sleep had left no cobwebs in his young eyes but when he saw mortimer throw open the office door humming a lighthearted air he rubbed his eyelids with the sleeve of his dusty coat as if it were a question in his mind whether or not he was dreaming my last day here said mortimer gaily to himself weary tiresome old books my soul has grown sick over you for the last time he brushed the dust from off the dulllooking ledger and went to work wont i astonish him he thought looking up and he laughed so pleasantly that tim who was sweeping the rubbish into a dustpan suspended operations and expressed his surprise in a somewhat dubious ejaculation i vum when mr flint came in he saw the same tall form bending over the accustomed desk that had met his eyes every morning for the last ten years but he did not see the heart that was leaping with new life and when in his usual snarly way he gave mortimer orders to make up certain invoices which would have employed the clerk till midnight he opened a brief conversation which ended in his utter amazement you will render bowen cleet their account current and make up the pork sale it has been standing open long enough and added mr flint fill up bills of lading for the d d coffee i dont think i will was the quiet reply mr flint did not believe his ears mr walters mr flint you will fill up those bills of lading immediately i wont plumply this caused mr flint to sink in a chair with astonishment and mortimer went on writing did you say that you wouldnt asked mr flint looking at him yes sir you did my year said mortimer leisurely expires today and with it i am happy to state my connection with flint snarle mr flint hunted twenty seconds for his lost voice you insolent sir cried mortimer turning to him abruptly until now i have borne your tyranny with meekness we are no longer employer and clerk we are man and man with the advantage on my side if you apply an insulting epithet to me i shall pull your ears o tim how you rubbed your hands you little villain how your limbs seemed to be receiving a series of galvanic shocks from an invisible battery how your eyes sparkled and your proclivity for fight got uppermost till you cried out pitch into him old boy go hissed flint through his closed teeth go that was all the word he could master mortimer passed out of the office the genial sunshine slid from the housetops and fell under his feet a thousand airy forms walked with him and he felt their presence though he could not see them he wandered through the park april had breathed on the cold ground and the green grass was springing up to welcome her the leaves were unfolding themselves and the air was full of spring the fountain had thrown off its icy manacles and leaped up with a sense of freedom his dreamy eyes saw it all the black shadows had fallen from him he had left them with flint and a bright day had dawned within him and without him everything was tinged with iridescent light for he looked at the world as it were through dewdrops happy morning happy life when one can put aside the trailing vines of painful memory and let the warm sunshine of heaven find its way into the heart in this sunny mood he turned his way homeward he passed mrs snarle on the stairs with a smile he heard daisy singing in the sittingroom and he sat himself down in the yellow light which streamed through the window of his bedroom making a hundred golden fancies on the worn carpet the shadows of the coming flowers the phantoms of forgetmenots and roses red and sweet his eyes made pictures his fancy inverted the hourglass of his life and the old sands ran back he floated down the stream of time instead of onward the sunshine grew deeper and broader and filled the little room then it became condensed and brighter gradually it moulded itself into form and little bell in her golden ringlets stood at the side of mortimer her white hand touched his shoulder and he looked up not in surprise but with tenderness with the air of a man who can gaze with unclouded eyes into the spiritual world and lose himself i knew you were near he said dreamily i thought you would come you have something to tell me what is it my little bell thus you stood at my side thus you looked into my eyes the day on which i told daisy that i loved her thus you come to me whenever the current of my life changes to love and advise me what is it bell dainty little bell a sunny lip rested on his for a moment be strong said little bell a cloud of sunlight floated around mortimer slipped down at his feet and lost itself in the orange stream which flooded the window he is dreaming of bell said daisy as she bent over him dreaming of lost bell and she closed the door after her softly then mortimers vision of sister bell was a dream perhaps it was not perhaps this real world is linked more closely to the invisible sphere than in our guesses it may be an angels hand which touches our cheek when we think that it is only the breeze їquien sabe who can say that in sleep we do not touch hands with the spirits of another world the angels of hereafter and what may death be but an intellectual dream who knows nobody knows but suggests the gentle reader suppose you dispense with your hamletlike philosophy and go on with your story like the pleasant author that you are instead of putting us to sleep as you have your hero reader the hint was merited ix my eyes make pictures when they are shut coleridge ix daisy and the necklace our petite heroine how she talked to the poets the morocco case daisys eyes make pictures tears idle tears mortimer was still sleeping an azurelidded sleep as keats has it when daisy again came softly to the door a pretty little woman was daisy snarle she had one of those faces which you sometimes pass in the street and remember afterward ever connecting it with some exquisite picture or if you happen to be in a poetical mood a dainty bit of music that face was very sweet in the coquettish red and white kissmequick which used to shade it sunny mornings when daisy went to market a very beautiful face when she looked up earnestly a very holy face when she sat thoughtfully in her room at twilight her hair was dark chestnut and she wore it in one heavy braid over her forehead her eyes were so gentle and saucy by turns that i could never tell whether they were gray or hazel but her smile was frank her laugh musical and her whole presence so purely womanly that one could not but be better for knowing her yet daisy was not faultless she had a wild little will of her own none the worse for that however she could put her foot down and a sweet little foot it was a temptation of a foot cased in a tight boot high in the instep and arched like the proud neck of an arabian mare or the eyebrows of a georgian girl and then the heel of said boot but i darent trust myself further daisy stood looking at mortimer with her fond thoughtful eyes soon she grew tired of this and placing a stool by his chair sat down and commenced sewing from time to time she looked up from her work and smiled quietly how he sleeps said daisy with a low laugh will he be cross if i disturb him and she laughed again i wonder she said at length if a tiny song would awaken him so she sang in a gentle voice those touching lines of barry cornwall commencing with touch us gently father time as we glide adown the stream she sang them bewitchingly the music must have stolen into mortimers dream for he slept a quieter sleep than before miss daisy did not like that and pouted quite prettily and shook her finger at him o how tiresome you are she said then she sewed for ten minutes quite steadily i guess ill arrange your books rip van winkle and when you wake up a half century hence you wont know them theyll be in such good order and facetious miss daisy broke out in such a wild merry laugh that an early robin perched on a tree beside the window ceased chirping and listened to her her fingers grew very busy with mortimers books having dusted them carefully she commenced to place them in an old blackwalnut bookcase which must have had an antique look fifty years ago and daisy went on laughing and talking to herself in a most comical manner here mr theocritus she cried taking up that venerable poet and placing him upside down ill just set you on your head for absorbing all that stupid boys attention one livelong evening when i wanted to chat with him an author is supposed to know everything about his characters but i cannot tell why daisy placed mortimers poet in such an uncomfortable position unless she thought that the blood might run into the head of mr theocritus and cause him to be taken off with a brain fever and you mr byron daisy continued youre a very wicked young fellow and i wont let you sit next to mrs hemans so she placed plutarch between them but you and shelly daisy said resting her hand on keats you are different sort of persons you are too earnest and beautiful to be impure and you shall sit side by side between l e l and our own alice cary and chatterton poor boy chatterton ill place you in that shadowy corner of the bookcase where the sunshine never comes so daisy made merry or sad as the case might be over her lovers few volumes and when she had arranged them to suit her capricious self she kissed her hand to tom hood and locked them all poets romancers and historians in the black sombre old bookcase our friend daisy was in one of those playful halfchildish moods which came upon her not unfrequently now she looked around the room for some other piece of useful mischief to do she would turn over mortimers papers ah what made her blush and laugh so prettily then it was only a sheet of notepaper on which mortimer in a dreamy moment had written her name innumerable times for know good world that true love takes the silliest ways to express itself now she was curious she stood thoughtfully with a small morocco case in her hand the reader has seen it once in flints office an undefined feeling stole over her and it was some time before she thought of opening the case she did so however and took from it a pearl necklace of rare design and workmanship the necklace was in three parts linked together by exquisitely carved clasps from the largest of which hung a illustration cross composed of smaller and more costly pearls how beautiful and she grew more thoughtful something within her recognized the jewels it was not her sight it was not her touch but an intuitive something which is finer and subtler than either i have seen this somewhere somewhere she said but where and she closed her eyes as if the sunlight blinded some timid memory that was stealing through her brain her fancy painted pictures of strange places and things now she saw a countryhouse among cool quiet trees then a man dying some one she loved but who now she was in a large city and heard the rumbling of wheels and confused voices now the snow was coming down flake after flake and everything was white then it was night dark stormy and dreadful and she was cold bitter cold some one had left her in the white clinging snow and she was freezing daisy opened her eyes the snow and wind were gone and aprils sunny breath blew shadows through the open window the house the death the storm how were they connected with the string of pearls and daisy held the necklace on her fingertips and wondered somewhere somewhere but where daisy could not tell where i may have seen one like it daisy thought perhaps this was bells and these stones may have rested many a time on her little neck i wish i had known bell with this she placed the necklace in the case again and tears gathered in her eyes she knew not why tears idle tears i know not what they mean she laid the box in the place where she had found it and thought she would not speak to mortimer of the necklace he might be displeased to have her touch it her gaiety had given place to sadness and when she knelt by mortimers chair she could not help sobbing mortimer awoke and bent over her what weeping daisy x full kneedeep lies the winter snow and the winter winds are wearily sighing toll ye the churchbell sad and slow and tread softly and speak low for the old year lies adying old year you must not die you came to us so readily you lived with us so steadily old year you must not die he lieth still he doth not move he will not see the dawn of day he hath no other life above he gave me a friend and a true love and the new year will take em away old year you must not go so long as you have been with us such joy as you have seen with us old year you shall not go he frothed his bumpers to the brim a jollier year we shall not see but though his eyes are waxing dim and though his foes speak ill of him he was a friend to me old year you shall not die we did so laugh and cry with you ive half a mind to die with you old year if you must die alfred tennyson x st agnes eve the old year st agnes keats poem the circlet of pearls a cloud the promise mrs snarle continues her knitting the old year had just gone by the dear sad old year he died in the blustering wind out in the cold he lay down in the shadows moaned and died something has gone with thee old year which will never come again kind words sweet smiles warm lips ah no they will never come again hold them near your heart for love of us old year they came with you they went with you kyrie eleyson i wish you could tarry with us said mortimer you were kind to us merry and sad with us and he repeated the lines old year you shall not die we did so laugh and cry with you ive half a mind to die with you old year if you must die tonight daisy will be st agnes eve and if i sell my prose sketch to filbertys magazine ill be in a good humor to read you keats poem since leaving mr flints employ mortimer had entirely supported himself with his pen his piquant paragraphs and touching verses over the signature of il penseroso had attracted some attention and he found but little difficulty in disposing of his articles at starving prices it is true but he bore up seeing a brighter time ahead he had been so occupied in writing short stories and essays that his romance which lacked but one chapter of completion was still unfinished filbertys magazine paid him so generously for the prose article that he could afford to devote himself to a task which did not promise immediate profit he completed the novel at sundown that day and after supper daisy reminded him of his promise to read keats eve of st agnes i sometimes think said mortimer as good mrs snarle seated herself in a low rockingchair preparatory to a dose while daisy sat on a stool at his feet i sometimes think that this poem is the most exquisite definition of one phase of poetry in our language musical rhythm imperial words gorgeous color and luxurious conceit seem to have culminated in it and the story itself is so touching that it would be poetical even if narrated in the plainest prose how surpassingly beautiful is it then worked out with all the richness of that sweetest poet who in intricate verbal music and dreamy imagery stands almost alone mrs snarles head was inclined on one side and the whole posй of her form was one of profound attention she was fast asleep the busy knittingneedles were placid in her motionless fingers and pinky the kitten was spinning a yarn on her own account from the ball in mrs snarles lap who was st agnes asked daisy she was a saint who suffered martyrdom for her religious views during the persecution of the christians in the reign of the emperor diocletian but let us read the poem which will make her more immortal than her heroism mortimer opened the book and his voice touched the verse with new music for daisys ears now his tones would be low and sad as he read of the old beadsman who told his beads in the cold night air while his frosted breath like pious incense from a censer old seemed taking flight for heaven then his voice grew as tender as a lovers when he came to the place where porphyro concealed beholds madeline as she disrobes of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees unclasps her warmed jewels one by one loosens her fragrant boddice by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees how few poets know how to handle color said mortimer azure red orange and all poetic hues are mixed up in their pictures like a shattered rainbow but how artistlike is keats his famous window scene has not been surpassed a casement high and triplearched there was all garlanded with carven imageries of fruits and flowers and bunches of knotgrass and diamonded with panes of quaint device innumerable of stains and splendid dyes as are the tigermoths deepdamaskd wings and in the midst mong thousand heraldries and twilight saints and dim emblazonings a shielded scutcheon blushd with blood of queens and kings full on this casement shone the wintry moon and threw warm gules on madelines fair breast as down she knelt for heavens grace and boon rosebloom fell on her hands together pressed and on her silver cross soft amethyst and on her hair a glory like a saint she seemed a splendid angel newly dressed save wings for heaven is it not exquisite asked mortimer looking in daisys face she nodded assent mortimer fixed his eyes on a pearl necklace which gently clasped the girls neck and started the cross undulated on her bosom which rose and fell like two full white roses in the wind where did you get that and mortimer laid his hand on her arm nervously it was a freak said daisy blushing are you angry not angry daisy but you look so do i i am not i grow unhappy when i see that necklace it was bells then yes no dont ask me daisy why a shadow came over mortimers face that morning daisy had been tempted to open the morocco case and a desire to clasp the white necklace on her neck became irresistible something drew her to it and the same feeling of mystery and longing which stole on her when she first held the circlet in her hand while mortimer was sleeping overpowered her almost unconsciously she fastened the gold clasp and when the little cross sunk down on her bosom her heart grew lighter and she went over the house singing like a canary she wore it the whole day pausing at times in her household duties to admire the pearls after a while she forgot its existence and her intention to replace it before mortimer returned when mortimers eye caught sight of the necklace daisy was much embarrassed for she could in no intelligible way account for having taken it mortimer was equally pained he had unwillingly become possessed of the ornament and saw no means by which he could return it to mr flint without acknowledging that he had also taken the check he dreaded to make so humiliating a confession and perhaps he stood a little in fear of mr flints anger the circumstance had caused him many moments of anxiety and an unpleasant thought came to him as he saw the purloined necklace on daisys innocent bosom but you are angry said daisy looking up with dimmed eyes no pet then you will kiss me said daisy in a most winning way mortimer did what most every one would have done in the premises an act which was quite sufficient to make one break that part of the commandment which refers to envy surely a man would be inhuman not to having once seen daisy snarle i am not angry but pained i cannot tell you why i wish you to promise me something i will what is it that you will not doubt me whatever may occur in connection with this necklace that you will love me though i may be unable to explain condemning circumstances or dispel the doubts of others i promise that but how strange thought daisy i am sorry that i was so childish as to take the necklace put it away mortimer and forget that i did so mortimers cheerfulness returned and he commenced reading the poem at the place where he had interrupted himself just as he finished the last verse telling how ages long ago the lovers fled away into the storm mrs snarle awoke with a jerk and went to knitting as though she had been doing nothing else the whole evening a harmless subterfuge peculiar to old people xi of making many books there is no end ecclesiastes xii xi mortimer has an interview with the great publisher and mr flint makes a discovery h h hardwill publisher criminal literature alliterative titles goldwood poor authors a heaven for them in the perspective flints discovery and the horns of his dilemma mortimer looked up and read the sign h h hardwill publisher his heart halffailed him and he stood looking in the large bookfilled window with that romance which was to startle the literary world folded quietly under his arm like any common paper what kind of a man is mr hardwill he thought is he a large man with a heavy watchchain or a thin skyrockety piece of humanity dressed in black and tipped off with red hair was he a cold castiron man like flint or a simple sorrowful one like snarle that was but this last idea melted of itself how could the famous publisher resemble the poor unobtrusive snarle he mr hardwill who received notes from the great hiawatha and hobnobbed with knickerbocker irving he who owned a phial of yellow sand which had been taken from a scorching desert with an unpronounceable name and presented to him by the oriental bayard he who chatted with genial mr sparrowgrass god bless him sparrowgrass and joked with orpheus stoddard he like simple snarle pooh is mr hardwill in asked mortimer he came near adding the great publisher the clerk to whom his eyes looked said he believed he was and went on calling off from a slip of paper murdered milkmaid two copies bloody hatchet twelve copies the seducers victim thirty copies the young mother five copies the deranged daughter seven copies hifiluten and other poems one copy can i speak with him ventured mortimer as the clerk who was calling off the criminal literature paused for breath the merry maniacs ten copies yes sir but hes engaged wait awhile continued the clerk as mortimer turned to go the wizard of wehawkin six copies the phantom of philadelphia twelve copies etc etc so our author seated himself on a case of books and looked at the wall of volumes which encompassed him somehow or another it suggested the great wall of china and the cordilleras he could give no reason why no more can i perhaps he felt that light literature paradoxical as it may seem is always heavy and so his mind ran on the prodigious freaks of man and nature after the clerk had finished calling off from the slip of paper that promising young gentleman suddenly discovered that mr hardwill was not engaged and offered to conduct our friend into his august presence mortimer gathered up his heart as it were and his loosened manuscript at the same moment her heart and morning broke together and followed the clerk through an avenue of literature to a snug inner office that literary sebastopol which is forever being stormed by seedy poets and their allies historians romancers and strongminded eves could it be possible was that middlesized darkeyed lighthaired pleasantlooking man the napoleon of publishers however there was something shrewd in his dark eye or rather eyes for he had two of them and a certain expression of the mouth which seemed full of dealings with the world is this mr hardwill asked mortimer yes sir will you be seated i have a romance commenced mortimer with hesitation which i would offer you for publication i have written it carefully and i think it possesses several new features here his voice broke down for he felt those dark scrutinizing eyes in his face besides the intense attention with which he was listened to disconcerted him mr hardwill came to his relief what is the title of your book it is called goldwood that is not happy no no said mr hardwill it should be something striking something to catch the eye in an advertisement for instance the the frantic father suggested mortimer quietly and he gazed at the carpet to keep from smiling mr hardwill eyed him and displayed his white teeth there was a little satire in our authors remark which pleased mr h who could not be hired to read the spasmodic books which he published it was policy in him to cater for that largest class of readers whose tastes are morbid or inflamed and he did so mortimer had thrown aside his timidity he gave a concise sketch of the plot touching here and there on some supposedtobe felicitous incident and grew so autorially eloquent over his romance that the careful mr hardwill requested mortimer to leave his manuscript with him saying i cannot give you much hope i have more books ready for press than i can well attend to if you will call on me the latter part of next week you shall have my decision with these words spoken in an offhand businesslike way mr hardwill made a bow which said as kindly as such a thing can be said you neednt stay any longer mortimer returned his bland smile frankly and retired though he would fain have called mr hardwills attention to that delightful and exciting scene in which mr adine st clair meets arabella clementina after an estrangement of two weeks but he didnt he again threaded his way through the labyrinth of literature and the last sound which fell on his ear as he turned from the bookstore into the street was the ruined cigar girl twenty copies what on earth could anybody want of a ruined cigar girl or a young mother and mortimer laughed outright the wand of prospero is neither more cunning nor more powerful than the pen of a well bred author it creates something out of nothing more frequently nothing out of something changes time place and human nature it lifts up the blue roofing of ocean and gives you a glimpse of fishlife and deeper still shows you the coral forests of the naiads and their aquatic palaces it draws back the curtain of cloudland and feeds your fancy with forms that never have been and never will be summons spirits from the air and gives melodious voices to all vernal things pleasant magician that waves this wand what curious people are walking in the chambers of your brain what dreams are yours and what cruel cuts this real world sometimes gives you you have no right to be here poor devil you are somewhat misplanted you belong to some sphere between earth and heaven and not very near either that such a place is provided for you i am certain there it is that all your books will run through countless editions there it is you can afford to hire some one to write your autograph for besieging admirers and feed as you should on the roses and lay in the lilies of life but i was speaking of penmagic it is not my present mood to do anything fantastical in that way i only wish to give you a sight of mr flint as he appeared one afternoon some months after mortimer had left his office he was standing in that innerroom of his countinghouse to which i have introduced the reader i change my mind he was not standing he had just thrown himself into a chair in which he did not seem at all easy i take peculiar delight in placing mr flint in uncomfortable positions he was surprised alarmed and angry he missed the forged check and the morocco case which he had watched so many years that they had been purloined he could not doubt and his keen thought fell on mortimer the loss of the check troubled him he liked to look at it occasionally for snarles sake but the necklace that gave him strange alarm snake he hissed you have crawled into my affairs and ill tread on you tread on you and kill you you stole the check to save snarles name and the necklace why did you steal that was it valuable yes that is it ill grind you in the dust ill put you in a prison and let your brainless father look at you through the bars this humane idea caused mr flint to rub his dry hands and chuckle violently but here mr flints countenance fell if i do this wont walters ruin me with that unfortunate letter o i was a fool to write it yet he would have murdered me if i had not and mr flint thought and thought to obtain the letter was impossible walters might have left the city even if he had not there was a method in his madness which flint knew he could not circumvent he could not lose such a chance of crushing mortimer as presented itself and yet to attempt it while walters had possession of the letter was unwise mr flint was in a brown study he walked up and down his sanctum solemnly neglecting to watch tim and the bookkeeper who had succeeded mortimer an half hour passed and still he continued his walk and reverie without any visible intention of stopping his face lights up he rubs his knuckles with ecstacy he has got it got it at last he will have mortimer arrested he will have mortimers name suppressed or give the newspapers a fictitious one this will shield him from walters whose heart he will wring some of these days ah that will be revenge it may strike the ingenious reader as strange that mortimer having charge of flint snarles books never came across his fathers name this would have been the case and somewhat interfered with our novel if mortimer when he applied for a clerkship with the firm had not given mr flint all the particulars of his life for reasons best known to himself mr flint took every opportunity to strengthen mortimer in the belief of his fathers death and every precaution to keep walters from meeting him once indeed they stood face to face in the office but taking into consideration the number of years they had been separated and the circumstances under which they met it would have been most strange if a recognition had taken place as to mr snarle being profoundly ignorant of mortimers early history he could throw no light on mortimers mind and everything worked to flints satisfaction every circumstance seemed to mould itself to his will there is an evil spirit and a very powerful one that holds the wires which move some of us puppets the good are made to take the humblest seats in the worlds synagogue and the wily and the evilhearted are clothed in purple fed on honey and throned in the highest places there will be a surprising revolution some of these times as mr sparrowgrass would say a revolution is a good thing to have in the country xii why true her heart was all humanity her soul all gods in spirit and in form like fair her cheek had the pale pearly pink of seashells the worlds sweetest tint as though she lived onehalf might deem on roses sopped in silver dew she spoke as with the voice of spheral harmony which greets the soul when at the hour of death the saved one knows his sister angels near her eye was as the golden pane the setting sun doth just imblaze which shows till heaven comes down again all other lights but grades of gloom her dark long rolling locks were as a stream the slave might search for gold and searching find festus xii what daisy did the arrest doubt and love daisy and the necklace the search the heart of daisy snarle in an upper room of a miserable dingy house which faced the spot where the old brewery used to stand edward walters sat one january evening reading the express there was one paragraph among the city items which he had read several times and each reading seemed to strengthen a determination which had at the first perusal grown up with him right or wrong ill do it with which words he folded the paper and placed it in his pocket daisy too read the paragraph that night and the blood rushed into her cheeks then left them very pale it was simply a police report such as you read over your morning coffee without thinking how many hearts may be broken by the sight of that little cluster of wornout type a young man no name given recently a clerk in the house of messrs flint snarle had been arrested on the charge of stealing a case of jewels from his employers daisy with dry eyes read it again and again dark doubt and trusting love were at conflict for a moment for doubt had pride for its ally and love was only love but the woman conquered mortimer who had been arrested early in the forenoon found means to send daisy a note in which he simply said i am charged with stealing the necklace but i am as guiltless of the crime as you daisy mrs snarle came in the room while our little heroine held the note in her hand mother said daisy averting her head mortimer will not come home tonight with this she threw the note into the fire and left mrs snarle alone before the good lady asked any questions thats very odd soliloquized mrs snarle briefly you tell me that you are innocent said daisy looking at a small portrait of mortimer which hung over the fireplace i do not question i only believe you and then daisy did a very strange thing and yet it was very like daisy she untied the brown ribbon which bound her dark lengths of hair allowing them to fall over her shoulders then she braided the string of pearls with her tresses and brought the whole in a beautiful band over her forehead and she looked like a little queen with this coronal of jet and pearl shading her brows daisy next picked the jewelcase to pieces and threw the minute shreds into the street this was scarcely done when the doorbell rang impatiently the girl peeped from the window the two men at the doorstep were not to be mistaken daisys fingers trembled as she undid the fastenings of the door we have orders to search this house miss said one of the officers touching the vizor of his cap respectfully daisy choked down a sob and led them with an unnatural calmness from room to room every place in the little house was investigated but in vain no necklace was to be found yet twice the breath of one of the searchers fell on the pearls in daisys hair the two officers left the house in evident chagrin when they had gone the girl sat on the stairs and sobbed happily for her wishes mrs snarle had been absent during the search and thus far had been kept in ignorance of mortimers disgrace but daisy could not hope to keep it a secret from her long for they both would probably be summoned as witnesses in open court the thought of giving evidence against mortimer went through daisys heart like an intense pain it terrified her and her warm little heart was floating on tears all day the cloud which had fallen on her seemed to have no silver lining all was cold black and sunless but there is no mortal wound to which some unseen angel does not bring a balm there are gains for all our losses daisy remembered mortimers words promise that you will not doubt me whatever may occur in connection with this necklace that you will love me though i may be unable to explain condemning circumstances or dispel the doubts of others and the words came to her freighted with such hope and tenderness that her sleep that night was deep and refreshing doubt had folded its wings in the heart of daisy snarle xiii ludwick now heres a man half ruined by ill luck as true a man as breathes the summer air launcelot ill luck erratic jade but yesterday she might have made him king old play xiii in the tombs the authors summer residence the egyptian prison without and within a picture sunshine in shadow joe wilkes and his unique proposal gloomy prospects the face at the cellwindow there is not a pleasanter place in the world for a summer residence than blackwells island the chief edifices are substantial and the grounds are laid out with exceeding care the waterscape is delightfully invigorating and the sojourners at this wateringplace are not of that transient class which one finds at nahant newport and other pet resorts indeed it is usual to spend from six to eight months on the island and one has the advantage of contracting friendships which are not severed at the first approach of the cold term for the particulars of which cold term see that funny old savant of brooklyn heights who has a facetious way of telling us that it has been raining after the shower is over bless him such institutions as blackwells island are godsends to the literati a poor devil of an author who has a refined taste for suburban air but whose finances preclude his dreaming of nahant has only to mix himself up in a street fight or some other interesting city episode to be entitled to a countryseat at the expense of his grateful admirers owing to a little oversight on his part the author of this veracious history took a passage for blackwells island a trifle earlier in the season than he had anticipated and it is at that delightful region these pages are indited but the tombs heaven save us from that there are many pleasanter places in newyork than the tombs for that clumsy piece of egyptian architecture its dingy marble walls its nailstudded doors and sickening atmosphere is uncommonly disagreeable as a dwelling many startling tragedies have been enacted there scenes of eternal farewells and lawful murders i could not count on my fingers the number of men who have entered its iron gates full of life and come out cold still and dreadful it was here that mortimer was brought within all was sombre and repulsive without there was hum of voices and the frosty rails which ran in front of the prison creaked dismally as the heavy freight cars passed over them but these sounds of life were not heard inside the cell of mortimer and its occupants the morning after his arrest presented a scene of gloomy picturesqueness through a grated window some six feet from the stone floor a strip of sunshine came and went falling on mortimer who leaned thoughtfully against the damp wall the room if we may call it one was devoid of furniture with the exception of a low iron bedstead whose strawstuffed mattress and ragged coverlid suggested anything but sleep daisy snarle was standing with downcast eyes near the door which a few minutes before had closed on its creaking hinges and outside of which the jailor stood listening the long dark lashes were resting on her cheek the pearls of the necklace which gleamed here and there in the queenly braid looked whiter by contrast with daisys chestnut hair in one hand she had gathered the folds of her shawl the other hung negligently at her side from beneath the skirt of her simple dress peeped one of the loveliest feet ever seen and her whole attitude was unconsciously exquisite she had just ceased speaking and the faintest possible tinge of crimson was on her cheeks daisy you are one of gods good angels or you would never have come to me in this repulsive place daisys eyes were still bent on the floor speak to me again daisy said mortimer taking her hand your voice gives me heart and your words make me forget everything but you daisy lifted her dreamy hands and said softly they could not find it could not find what daisy the necklace said daisy smiling no she continued in a low musical voice they searched in all the rooms in all the trunks turned over your papers and mothers workbasket but they could not find it and daisy smiled again where was it daisy here and daisy smiling all the while lifted mortimers hand in hers and placed it on the braid of hair mortimer started o daisy daisy why did you do that the little foot tapped gently on the stone floor because said daisy dropping her eyes because when i read your note yesterday i doubted you for a moment but when i looked at the portrait in your room i believed you and i hid the necklace in my hair and came to ask your pardon let any misfortune come to me darling said mortimer touched with this ingenious act let come what will i am strong as sure as little bell looks down from heaven you do not wear a stolen necklace how it came into my hands i cannot tell without wronging the dead but daisy it was imprudent for you to run this risk oh no they hunted for something hidden and could not see what was before their eyes replied daisy giving a quick low laugh and then she grew thoughtful again but if they had seen it daisy well you would have been implicated in this unhappy affair to your certain ruin without benefiting me you must leave the necklace here but i wont this time the pretty little foot was set firmly on the flagging the jailor who had been an attentive listener to the foregoing conversation thrust his hands into the capacious pockets of his overcoat with the bearing of a man who is completely satisfied i knowed it he said emphatically the boy is misfortunate somehow and the young girls a trump she is lord help em but times up and i must stop their talk with this the man tapped on the door mortimer held daisy in his arms for a moment and then sat down on the bed daisy was gone and it seemed as if the sunlight had gone with her the cell grew so gloomy to the prisoner young man said the jailor with a solemn look the young lady is very unprudent to go circumventing round with that necklace twisted up on the top ov her skull she is mortimer groaned you heard all then and you will betray us part ov what you say is true returned the man bluntly and part isnt i heard yer talk but my name isnt joe wilkes ef i blow on yer mortimer looked at the ruddy honest face of joe wilkes and gave him his hand i believe you my good man that individual appeared to be turning something over in his mind which refused to be turned over them keys young man he said at length drawing forth from his pocket a bunch weighing some four pounds opens the door at the end ov the passage and this one opens the street gate now jist take that bit ov wood and bang me on one side ov my hed not savagely you know but jist enough to flatten me and make me look stunned like at this novel proposition mortimer broke into a loud laugh but mr wilkes was in earnest and insisted on being flattened i couldnt think of it mr wilkes cried mortimer weak with laughter i couldnt strike you systematically i should be certain to demolish your head and mr wilkes retired perforce with the air of an injured man mortimer sat on the edge of the bed reflecting on the strange chain of circumstances which had placed him in his present position and boldly facing the fact of how little chance he had of escaping mr flints malice the excitement attending his arrest had passed away and the reality of his utter helplessness came full upon him for himself he dreaded little for no punishment for a supposed crime however disgraceful could make him guilty but a prolonged imprisonment would leave daisy and mrs snarle without means of support this caused him more anxiety than the thought of any suffering attendant on his conviction more than this troubled him it was daisys devotion he had indeed wished her to believe him innocent but his generous mind revolted at holding her to promises made in happier moments he could not make daisy his wife while a blemish remained on his honor and the circumstances relative to the forged check with which the reader is conversant he could not think of revealing for snarles dying words haunted him strangely while mortimer was thus meditating two hands grasped the iron bars of the window which was directly opposite the bed and a moment afterwards a mans head threw a shadow into the cell mortimer absorbed in thought had failed to notice it the first expression of the face was that of mere curiosity this was followed by a startled look and then an intense emotion distorted the features the face grew deathly pale and the eyeballs glowed into the cell more resembling those of a wildcat than a human beings a deep groan came from the window and the head disappeared instantaneously mortimer looked up and glanced around the narrow room suspiciously and then smiled to think how his fancy had cheated him the face was edward walters xiv where more is meant than meets the ear il penseroso xiv a cloud with a silver lining the strange visit the lawyer walter and mr flint the clouds a strip of sunshine mortimer about two hours after the incident related at the close of our last chapter edward walters stepped from the door of mrs snarles house waving his hand kindly to daisy who stood on the steps and watched him till he turned out of marionstreet but we must turn back a little after leaving the tombs our friend went in search of mortimers residence actuated by an impulse which he neither attempted to control nor understand an impulse like that which had prompted him to visit the prison he was led into the little parlor by mrs snarle to whom he represented himself as one deeply interested in the misfortunes of mortimer and desirous of assisting him his own astonishment surpassed that of mrs snarle when he found her entirely ignorant of the arrest while he was speaking and mrs snarle who stood with her hand on the back of a chair from which she had just risen was regarding him with a vacant stare daisy stepped into the room without knowing that it was occupied edward walters ceased speaking and fixed his eyes on what to him seemed an apparition he had seen that pale pensive face in his dreams for years it had followed him out to sea and in far lands where he sought to avoid it he arose from the sofa and approached daisy with hesitating steps as if he were afraid she would vanish into thin air before he reached her daisy shrunk from him and looked inquiringly at her mother walters laid his hand on the girls arm sometimes he said looking her full in the eyes sometimes the mind wanders back to childhood and we have visions of pleasant fields and familiar places something we had forgotten comes back to us in shadow voices faces incidents did you ever see a snowstorm in your thought daisy started as if in sudden pain walters watched the effect of his question with unconcealed emotion yes said daisy lifting up her eyes wonderingly i knew it said the man abstractedly taking daisys hand the girl drew back in fear and mrs snarle stepped between them my words seem strange lady but i knew her when she was a babe and he turned his frank face to daisy what do you know of me cried daisy grasping his arm eagerly everything o sir do not deal in mystery if you know aught of this childs life in mercy speak and mrs snarle caught his hand i can tell nothing now and with this he abruptly put on his hat strode into the hall and out of the front door waving his hand to daisy who as we have said stood on the steps and watched him till he was out of sight we will leave mrs snarle and daisy to their astonishment and follow on the quick footsteps of our marine friend to whom that day seemed crowded with wonderful events it did not take long for walters to reach wallstreet where he disappeared in one of those many law offices which fringe that somewhat suspected and muchabused locality on the door through which mr walters passed was a tin sign bearing in gilt letters illustration j g burbank attorney at law what transpired between him and that gentleman we will leave to the surmises of the reader after being closeted for an hour in a room whose only furniture consisted of one or two green baizecovered tables piled with papers and a bookcase crowded with solidlooking volumes our friend turned his thoughtful face toward the office of messrs flint snarle mr flint looked up from his writing and found edward walters quietly seated beside him they had not met since the interview we described at mr flints house and the captains presence at the present time was not a thing to be desired by mr flint the visit looked ominous whatever doubts he entertained respecting its object were immediately dispelled i read the arrest in yesterdays paper said walters flint with an effort went on writing and this morning i visited the boy in his cell well cried flint nervously and i found my son john flint mr flint found himself cornered and like a rat or any small animal he grew cowardly desperate you found a thief sir a miserable thief we will do mr flint the justice to say that he considered mortimer in that light i am not sure of that was the calm reply a man may be in prison and yet be no felon and i should doubt the guilt of any man whom you persecuted but i did not come here to quarrel the boy is my son and he must be released must be mr walters i think i said so flint regarded him with his cold cynical smile john flint there is nothing i would not do to serve the boy there is nothing i will not do to crush you if you persist in convicting him i do not know that he is innocent i do not know that he is worthy of my love i only know that he is my child there was an agony in the tone with which these words were spoken that was music to mr flint he smiled that undertakers smile of his the law must take its course he said it is impossible to stop that not so the examination takes place this afternoon if you do not appear against him mortimer will be discharged you have forgotten that i have the letter stop cried flint as walters turned to the door and he assumed his usual fawning hypocritical air if i do as you wish what then you shall have the letter what assurance have i of that my word is that all said flint would you take mine in such a case no replied walters with delightful candor your word is worthless mine was never broken do we understand each other yes there must be another stipulation what is it you are not to mention my name to mortimer he does not know of my existence i shall not be likely to meet him returned flint a little surprised i thought you had seen him i did through the bars of his cell and mr flint was left alone in no enviable state of mind so absorbed was he in his disappointment that tim several times that afternoon whistled snatches from poor dog tray with impunity the twilight came stealing into the room in which mrs snarle and daisy were sitting the food on the supper table remained untouched neither of them had spoken for the last half hour the twilight grew denser and denser and the shadows on their faces deepened daisy had told her mother all the search of the officers for the necklace her visit to the tombs and mortimers protestation of innocence mrs snarle never doubted it for a moment but she saw how strong their evidence might be against him god only knows how it will end daisy as god wills it mother as these words were said a shadow fell across the entry and a pair of arms was thrown tenderly around daisys neck mortimer xv quin is all our company here midsummers night dream xv important disclosures a picture the lawyers note mr hardwill once more the scene at the law office mr flint hors du combat face to face mortimer that was all daisy said the candles were lighted the dim sad twilight driven out of the room and a happy trio sat around the supper table mrs snarle smoothed her silk apron complacently daisys eyes and smiles were full of silent happiness and mortimer in watching the variations of her face all so charming forgot the misfortunes which had so recently threatened him daisy gave mortimer an account of the unknowns strange visit and inexplicable to himself mortimer connected it in some way with his unexpected release soon after mrs snarle had retired the lovers sat in the little room which was only lighted by a pleasant fire in the grate wavering fingers of flame drew grotesque pictures on the papered walls then a thin puff of smoke would break the enchantment and the firelight tracery fled into the shadows of the room it was a delicate picture mortimer was sitting at daisys feet playing with the fingers of a very diminutive and dainty hand daisy was bending over him and as the glow from the fire came and went in their eyes one could see that a long brown tress of daisys hair rested on mortimers what if their lips touched o cried daisy drawing back a note was left here this afternoon while you were in the tombs finished mortimer smiling yes replied daisy i was afraid to open it though were you yes she said laughing i thought it might be from that charming young lady whom you assisted to cross broadway last month and of whom you speak so pleasantly when i am the least bit out of humor and the girl looked at him quizzically with her impudent eyes mortimer by kneeling close to the fire was enabled to read the note that is strange read it daisy daisy read sir by calling at my office no wallstreet tomorrow at p m you will learn something of importance it is necessary that mrs snarle and her daughter should accompany you respectfully j c burbank attorney at law about the same hour that evening mr flint received a communication of similar import after reading which he said hum and thrust the note into his vestpocket hum indeed mr flint there was something in store for you the next morning mortimer bethought himself of his romance and directed his steps toward the sanctum of mr hardwill he found that gentleman talking with three new geniuses in pantelets who were attempting to convince the great pub of his mistake in refusing to bring out a pregnantlooking manuscript which the authoress was holding in her hand with a tenderness that was touching to behold when they had retired mr hardwill extended his hand to mortimer sharp young man he said displaying his white teeth you didnt wish to appear anxious about your book i was on the point of sending for you you were to have called on me three days since well sir i like the story mortimer bowed did you read it all sir i not a line of it returned mr hardwill i never look at anything but the size of the manuscript then you buy by the weight said mortimer smiling not precisely i never publish anything of less than four hundred pages as to weight i sometimes find a ms of the right size altogether too heavy but yours is not my reader says your reader sir yes i am a mere business man quoth mr hardwill explanatorily i seldom read my publications i merely sell them sometimes i dont do that i have a reader who looks over sizeable mss and i abide by his judgment ah he is a man of fine scholarship and literary attainments mr hardwill might have added and has the sway of the morning rabid and the evening twilight but he did not arrangements were made to publish goldwood with the euphonious and striking title of picklebeet papers now whether picklebeet was a vegetable in vinegar or the name of some charming countryplace i cannot say but picklebeet whatever it was had as much to do with the contents of the book as the biography of my readers grandmother on what terms the picklebeet papers were published concern neither the reader nor myself but while remarking en passant that the book owing to some extraordinary freak on the part of the public never went to a second edition we will fix the hands of the city clock to suit ourselves it is p m without further preamble we will lead the reader mine not mr hardwills to mr burbanks law office at which place the threads of our story become somewhat disentangled we are not sorry at this we doubt if the reader is for there is a satisfaction in rounding off a plot in coming to the last page where the author can write finis which no one but a scribbler may know but this pleasure is not a little touched with regret as he sweeps the carefullymoved images from the chessboard of his brain and tells you in those five letters that the game is finished the personages in the law office are not strangers to us if we except the lawyer mrs snarle and daisy with their veils down are sitting in the back part of the room and mortimer stands behind them speaking in a low voice to daisy edward walters is seated at a desk the screen around which prevents him from being observed by the firstdescribed group mr burbank a darkeyed largemouthed man occupies a table in the centre of the apartment near which is a chair for mr flint who has not yet made his appearance this was the position of the parties on mr flints entrance the merchant gave the lawyer three bony fingers bestowed a stiff surprised bow on mortimer and glanced suspiciously around him evidently not liking the company he was in mr flint glanced inquiringly at the lawyer as all the parties concerned in this meeting are present commenced the devotee of blackstone i will at once proceed to business you are too much of a business man mr flint to require a prelude to interrogations which will explain themselves mr flint looked very doubtful the lawyer ran his fingers through a crop of shaggy hair with professional dignity it is something over twenty years since your brother henry flint died is it not the merchant nodded he left no heirs i believe continued the lawyer with a delightful appearance of hesitation he left one child said flint nervously mr flint did not like the turn which the conversation was taking ah yes a daughter if i remember correctly let me see maude flint was the name this slight dialogue caused daisys breath to come and go quickly maude flint she whispered hastily to mortimer listen m f the initials in the necklace i drew up the will at the time said mr burbank thoughtfully but my memory has been tasked with more important things he turned abruptly to mr flint what became of this child maude died returned flint briefly with an uncomfortable air and the property came to me the child having no other relative said flint rallying the lawyer was silent for a moment now mr flint suppose i should tell you that your brothers child is still living what would you say i should say sir cried the startled merchant springing to his feet i should say sir that it was a lie i see through it all this is a miserable conspiracy to force money from me your plot sir is transparent and i see that snaky individual crawling at the bottom of it he pointed at mortimer but it wont do he thundered it wont do of course it wont for you to get in a passion the man who gets into a passion continued mr burbank philosophically never acts with judgment and what is the use mr flint i am acquainted with all the circumstances of the childs disappearance indeed i have a full account of them in your own handwriting mr flint turned white this letter which i shall give you by and by said the man of law divulges a plot of villainy which heaven happily thought fit to prostrate and ill prove the truth of what i say and the lawyer motioned for daisy to approach him she did so mechanically this lady said mr burbank smiling blandly is my first witness will you raise your veil daisy complied with the request and looked mr flint in the face flint turned his eyes on her with such earnestness that she shrunk back then he staggered to a chair and exclaimed involuntarily so help me god it is henrys child edward walters rested his hands on the desk and looked over the baize screen mortimer stepped to daisys side this necklace he said in a trembling voice i return to the owner it was my misfortune to take it by mistake and it is happiness to return it to one who does not require any proof of my innocence daisy pressed his hand let me go exclaimed mr flint presently mr flint you must first witness the denouement of our little drama with this the lawyer turned to mortimer and handed him a paper what this fails to explain relative to your father you must seek from his own lips my father his lips repeated mortimer bewildered he opened the paper my father where is he mortimer cried walters pushing aside the screen and they stood face to face xvi our revels now are ended these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air thin air and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloudcapped towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this insubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack behind shakespeare xvi the old house by the sea claptrap john flint the old house by the sea joe wilkes strephon and chloe tim enjoying himself edward walters and little bell a last word it is an artistic little weakness we scribblers have of seducing our dramatis personж into tableaux vivants and deserting them abruptly in a story of this kind which depends rather on action than fine writing for interest this species of autorial claptrap is very effective if cleverly done so we will make no excuse for leaving nuestros amigos at the lawyers office and drawing a green curtain as it were on the actors of this humble comedy some six years are supposed to have elapsed since the dropscene fell on our last act from this out our story is rather a pantomime than a play we give pictures and figures instead of dialogues and soliloquies will the reader follow us i time has not touched mr flint gently his hair is grayer his step more feeble and his eyes have a lacklustre look his cravat is whiter and stiffer if possible than ever and he looks more religious god grant that he is so but we doubt it for to such as he nor april with its purplemouthed violets nor red ripe summer with its wealth of roses nor the rich fruitharvest of autumnal suns bring wisdoms goodness the various months teach him no lesson let him go he came like a shadow into our plot so let him depart he is not a myth however but flesh and blood mortality and though we have only outlined his weakness his love of gold his cold intriguing spirit yet the sketch is such that if he looks at it he will have the felicity of seeing himself as others see him ii it is a day in june an hour before sunset the lanes leading to an old house situated between ivyton and the sea are fringed with pink peach blossoms and the air is freighted with their odors the violets with dew in their azure eyes peep from every possible nook and those sweet peris of the summer wood wild roses are grouping everywhere surely titania has been in this spot breathing exquisite beauty upon the flowers or perhaps floras dainty self the bluebells these yellowchaliced buttercups are fit haunts for fairies and perchance wild puck or prosperos good ariel has been slumbering in them but let us draw near to the fine old house which stands in this new eden it was here that we first met the little castlebuilders the child bell and mortimer the place is not changed much the same emerald waves break on the white beach the same cherrytrees are spreading their green tresses and the simple churchyard sleeps as it used in sunshine and shadow the house has been newly painted and the fresh green blinds make one feel a sense of shade and coolness the garden in front has been remade with a careful eye to its old beauties the white pebbled walks the strawberry and clover beds the globes of pansies and the clambering honeysuckle vines are all as they were years ago even the groups of wild roses by the door bud and bloom as if the autumn winds had never beaten them down we shall accuse the reader with having a bad memory if he does not recognise joe wilkes in the stalwart form and honest face of the gardener who occupies himself with tying up a refractory vine which persists in running wild over the new summerhouse it is he indeed the whilome jailor of the tombs who has laid aside his ponderous prisonkeys and taken up the shovel and the hoe iii two persons are standing at the round window where bell and her brother used to linger dreamily in the twilights of long ago the rays of the setting sun glance over the waves and fall on the faces of mortimer and daisy daisy snarle no more but little maude walters their honeymoon has been of six years duration and to such as they that sweet moon of tenderness never wanes but runs from full to full never new and never old strephon woos chloe as of yore the lover as in some antique picture is ever kneeling at the feet of his mistress and she through the gathering of years looks down on him with the olden tenderness and the april blushes of womanhood to such as they life plays on a dulcimer the golden age is not dead to them they see the shepherd daphnis seated on the slopes of жtna and hear him pipe to the nymph eschenais this banknote world to them is arcady and their lives are sweet and simple as pastoral hymns but we the author of this ms are growing pastoral ourselves and heaven forbid that we should venture into a field which one of our poets has recently brought into disrepute by his indifferent blank verse mortimer leaning on the sill of the window is looking at daisy who stands a little in the background with that kissable white hand of hers shading the sun from as dangerous a pair of black eyes as ever looked no when they meant yes she is watching a speck of a boat which is dancing up and down on the waves like a cork mortimer has just brought a telescope to bear on the distant object and we with that lack of goodbreeding which has characterized all romancers from time immemorial will look over his shoulder the delighted occupant of the boat is that audacious fellow tim who has taken a trip up to ivyton from the great city to spend a week with mr mortimer it may be well to say that tim timothy jones esq mr reader has ceased to have a proclivity for the machine and nowadays the city hall alarm bell never disturbs his equanimity indeed he is so metamorphosed by time and a respectable tailor that the gentle reader stands in some danger of not recognizing him at all hence the above formal introduction just notice the set of those creamcolored pants falling without a wrinkle over those mirrorlike patent leathers and the graceful curve of that shanghai over the hips just notice and more than all that incipient moustachй which only the utmost perseverance on the part of tim and mr phalon has coaxed out into mundane existence the writer of this veritable history has a great mind to drown tim for his impudence but as that young gentleman has a good situation in a frontstreet commissionhouse he refrains for a capsize a mile from land would considerably interfere with young americas prospects iv captain edward walters sits on the doorstep of the old house and through a curtain of honeysuckle vines which he draws aside is watching the fawnlike motions of a six years loss to paradise is it little bell come back again it is very like her walters thinks so as the child runs from flower to flower like a goldenbelted bee and a mist comes over his fine eyes and he can scarcely see his grandchild for tears his lips move and perhaps he is saying little bell little bell and he thinks of the angel whom he left years ago playing on the partarrй in front of the gate he hears her clear crystal laugh and sees her golden ringlets floating among the flowers and cannot tell if they be curls or sunshine the child in the garden resembles the dead bell as one white lily does another she has the same wavy tresses shading the same dreamy eyes with their longing languid expression her form has the abandon of childhood with a certain shadow of dignity that is charming she is very fragile and spiritual and it seems to us as if heaven in moulding the child had hesitated whether to make her an angel or a flower and so gave her the better parts of each let us take one more look at her sweet young face a thing of beauty is a joy forever its loveliness increases it will never pass into nothingness but still will keep a bower quiet for us and a sleep full of sweet dreams and health and quiet breathing little bell holds an armful of lilacs against her bosom and with her eyes running over with childish merriment trips toward the house but two arms stretching out from the vines catch her she utters a pretty scream and then sits quietly on walters knee he kisses her laughingly but his face grows serious as his eyes fall on a string of almondshaped pearls which encircle the childs delicate neck on the innocent white bosom lies a illustration cross it is daisys necklace that is what came of it and here gentle reader is the end of the chain epilogue don sebastian you have no plot fabricio but such characters and every one is as true as truth copied right off from nature don sebastian badly done sir poet lope de vega epilogue what a mournful glory falls upon the october woods it seems as if a broken rainbow were strained through a sieve of gray clouds and sprinkled over the crisp leaves ochre vermillion dappled russet and all rare tintings and then the wind that rushes so gloriously through the woodlands bearing with it a rich earthy smell and scattering the purple wealth the hoarded gold of the autumnal days pleasant forest with your oaken harps pleasant little town lying quietly in sunshine and moonlight how sad i was to leave ye pleasant river that stealest up from the sea past the fort and into the old weatherbeaten seaport town crawling lazily among the rotting piers of deserted wharves then gliding off through the shaky bridge squirming and curveting into a world of greenery like a great serpent with an emerald back and the girls village belles rustic flirts eyes lips shady curls white hands little feet enchanting pouts ah me pleasant it was when woods were green and winds were soft and low this rhapsodical soliloquy was interrupted one fine october morning two days after my return from the seaside by a voice there was no mistaking it was barescythe who startled mrs muggins with the following pertinent inquiry prolific producer of seaprodigies is ralph at home i could not see mrs muggins face for that good soul was standing at the foot of the stairs but i knew her feelings were injured and i hastened out of my room to prevent any verbal combat that might ensue mrs muggins after a long silence and with some asperity what sir barescythe petulantly is ralph in sycorax what reply the relick of joshua muggins might have made to this interrogation is only to be imagined for i immediately discovered myself to use a theatrical phrase and led my solemn friend from hostile ground my dear barry said i after greeting him cordially you shouldnt shouldnt what call mrs muggins names sycorax she deserved it women are cleopatras until they are thirty then they are old witches with broomstick propensities dont interrupt me dont speak to me i choked down a panegyric on woman for i knew that barry was thinking of a cold heartless piece of femininity that years and years ago forgot her troth to an honest man and ran away with a moustache and twentyfour gilt buttons i could never see why he regretted it for mrs captain mary odonehugh never stopped growing till she could turn down a two hundred weight and she looks anything but interesting with her long file of little odonehughs nascent captains and middies in the bud i knew that barescythe was not in a mood to be critically just yet for the sake of turning his thoughts into different channels i glanced significantly at the ms under his arm my novel i ventured like the man in the play said barescythe the world should ask somebody to write it down an ass with which he threw the manuscript on the table before me his remark was uttered with such an air of logic that i nodded assent for i never disagree with logicians the world is widemouthed longeared and stupid it will probably like that affair of yours though i doubt if the book sells and barry pointed to the curled up novel on the table i bowed with i hope it will the world he continued that gave milton ј for paradise lost ought surely to be in ecstacies over daisys necklace barry said i somewhat nettled is it my good nature or your lack of it that seduces you into saying such disagreeable things neither ralph for i no more lack good nature than you possess it but we wont quarrel i am sore because the day of great books has gone by once we could boast of giant minds we have only pigmies now but let them speak barry there may be some among us that are not for a day who foresaw in the strolling player in the wild thoughtless will shakespeare of stratforduponavon the dramatist of all time your pet homer was a mendicant legions of our best poets were not acknowledged until the brain that thought was worn out the hand that toiled cold and the lips that murmured patient forever so angels walked unknown on earth but when they flew were recognized what if my poor story is stale and flat beside the chefdoeuvre of sir walter scotts genius barry there is a little bird in our newengland woods known only by its pleasant chirp yet who would break its amber bill because the nightingales in eastern lands warble so deliciously barry laughed there you come ralph with your birdconceits you flap the wings of some threadbare metaphor in my face and i cannot see for the feathers you are not a man to argue with poetical men never are they make up in sentiment what they lack in sense and very often it happens that a bit of poetry is more than a match for a piece of logic no more of that hal an thou lovest me your book is a miserable one all your voluble ingenuity cannot controvert that barrys better nature had slipped out of him for a moment into the sunshine like a turtles head but it slipped back again and the speech that commenced with a laugh ended with a snarl it shows he said rumpling the manuscript with a careless hand a want of art the construction of the tale is crude the characters are all old friends with new names broken down stagehorses with new harnesses and the prose throughout is uneven how can it be otherwise since it is only an intolerable echo of hood dickens and charles reade your want of artistic genius is shown in taking three chapters to elaborate little bell who has no kind of influence in working out the plot and who dies conveniently at chapter iii your imitative proclivities are prominent in the chapter headed a few specimens of humanity was ever anything more like the author of the old curiosity shop your short jerky sentences are modeled after reades peg woffington and christie johnstone or any of dumas thefts as to the plot that is altogether too improbable and silly for serious criticism and then the title daisys necklace betsys garter ah barry this is only fadladeen and feramorz over again do you remember that after all the strictures of the eastern savant feramorz turned out to be not only a poet but a prince i could take you to be blackwood slashing an american book rather than a yankee editor looking over a friends virgin novel you are like all critics barry they ignore what might please them greatly if they had not their critical behavior on and grow savage over that part of an author which they should speedily forget like a dog on a country highway that turns up his cold nose at the delicate hedgeblossoms and growls over a decayed bone so you find nothing to admire in my sixteen chapters not much then say a good word for that little there are some lines ralph some whole paragraphs may be that would be very fine in a poem but in an everyday novel they are strikingly out of place your jewels heartjewels i suppose you call em seem to me like diamonds on the bosom of a calicoed and untidy chambermaid that sentimental chapter with the dead hope caption is quite as good as your blank verse and i would wager a copy of griswolds poets of america against a doubtful threecent piece that you wrote it in rhyme its not very difficult you know to turn your poetry into prose you neednt stare in a word your book is as tame as a sick kitten i hate kittens theres something diabolical in a yellow cat i nipped a smile in the bud and said quietly i intended to write a tame simple domestic story the facts are garnered from my own experience and garnered from your maternal grandparent ralph very much i believe it very much anybody will its a wonder to me that you didnt call the book heartlife by an anatomy i will acknowledge barescythe that i have not done my best in this affair yet consider as fabricio says in the play twas done at a sitting a single sitting by all the saints i will do better when i have those pistoles and may use time local tales of this school have been popular i wrote mine to sell but it wont why lets see how many sunsets have you in the book not many i think that was an oversight there should be one at the end of each chapter twenty sunsets at least then you have no seduction a seduction horrified of course what modern novel is complete without one it gives a spicy flavor to the story people of propriety like it prim ladies of an uncertain age always dote on the gallant gay lothario and wish that he wasnt so very wicked and barry raised his eyebrows and broke out in such a clear belllike canorous laugh so contagious in its merriment that i joined him and i fancied i heard mrs muggins beating a hasty retreat down the front stairs it seems improbable to me that mrs muggins had been listening at the keyhole of my door respectable mrs muggins then sir said barry reassuming his mockserious air there should be a dreadful duel in which the hero is shot in his hyacinthine curls falls mortally wounded dripping all over with gory blood and is borne to his ladyelove on a shutter you have none of these fine points then the names of your characters are absurdly commonplace mortimer walters should be montaldo st clare daisy snarle how plebeian should be gertrude flemming john flint clarence lester and so on to the end of the text how mrs mac elegant will turn up her celestial nose at a book written all about common people mrs mac elegant be shot i exclaimed i used to be sweet on mrs mac elegant and barescythe has a disagreeable way of referring to that delicate fact it was not for such as she i wrote i sought to touch that finer pulse of humanity which throbs the wide world over the sequel will prove whether or not i have failed barry laughed at my illconcealed chagrin barry said i carelessly meditating a bit of revenge and unfolding at the same time a copy of the morning glory did you write the book criticisms in todays paper yes returned barry coloring slightly they are very fine barrys blood went up to his forehead so consistent i continued with what you have been saying i have neither read the scavengers daughter nor the life of obadiah zecariah jinkings but judging from the opinion here expressed i take them to be immortal works i could never be led to think so by reading the extracts you have made from the volumes for the prose is badly constructed indeed barry heres a sentence which lacks a personal pronoun and a verb i see what you are aiming at replied barescythe sharply you twit me with praising these books so extravagantly i grant you that worse trash was never in type daisy is not printed yet you know but will you allow me to ask you a question si usted gusta my dear fellow do you think that gabriel ravel at niblos turns spasmodic summersets on a chalked rope for the sake of any peculiar pleasure derived therefrom why barry i can scarcely imagine anything more unpleasant than to be turned upside down fifteen feet from maternal earth with an undeniable chance of breaking ones neck on a fourinch rope but why do you ask m ravel distorts himself for a salary and no questions asked i do the same i throw literary summersets for a golden consideration it is a very simple arrangement here barescythe drew a diagram on the palm of his hand messrs printem sellem my thumb give us the morning glory my forefinger costly advertisements and i barescythe the little finger am expected to laud all the books they publish out of respect to barescythe i restrained my laughter he went on with a ruthful face here is the life of jinkings the life of a puppy an individual of whom nobody ever heard till now a very clever harmless good man in his way no doubt the big gun of a little village but no more worthy of a biography than a printers devil with which words barescythe hit an imaginary mr jinkings in the stomach with evident satisfaction yet i am called upon to tell the world that this individual this what do you call him jinkings is one of the luminaries of the age a mental hercules a new prometheus the clown why on earth did his friends want to resurrectionize the insipid incidents of this mans milkandwater existence if he made a speech on the introduction of a townpump or delivered an essay at the bell tavern it was very kind of him to be sure but why not bury his bad english with him in the country churchyard i wish they had for i am expected to say that ten thousand copies of the work have been sold when i know that only five hundred were printed or else messrs printem sellem withdraw their advertisements in which case my occupations gone and this scavengers daughter a book written by a sentimental schoolgirl and smelling of breadandbutter see how i have plastered it all over with panegyric and so barry i said with some malice you wantingly abuse my book because i cannot injure you pecuniarily perhaps i do growled barescythe it is a relief to say an honest thing now and then but wait ralph till i start the weekly critique then look out for honest slashing criticism no longer hedged in by the interests and timidity of the proprietors i shall handle books for themselves and not their advertisements friendly to all save caitiffs foul and wrong but stern to guard the holy land of song what a comment is this on american criticism o barry it is such men as you with fine taste and fine talent who bring literature into disrepute your genius gives you responsible places in the world of letters and how you wrong the trust thank you returned barescythe coldly you blend flattery and insult so ingeniously that i hesitate whether to give you the assurance of my distinguished consideration or knock you down either you please barry i have spoken quite as honestly if not so bluntly as you and i regret that i have so little to say in favor of your inconsistent criticism i am sorry you dislike my novel but i looked toward the chair in which barescythe had been sitting he was gone i was not surprised for barry does few things after the manner of men and a ceremonious departure is something he never dreams of i sat and thought of what had been said i wondered if we were the dregs of time the worthless leaves of trees that had borne their fruit if there were none among us like some of the simple great ones gone forever and ever by and lastly i wondered if any of our city papers had such a critical appendage as t j barescythe it is pleasant to have your friend mr smith pat you patronisingly on the back and say my dear fellow when is your book coming out of course you send mrs smith a copy after that and all mrs smiths relations daisys necklace is nearly ready the following advertisement which i cut from the evening looking glass of last thursday illustrates the manner in which my publishers messrs printem sellem make their literary announcements we have in press and shall publish in the course of a few days a new work of rare merit entitled daisys necklace and what came of it a thrilling novel surpasing in pathos and quiet satire the most felicitous efforts of dickens printem sellem publishers that was rather modest and pleasant but it is pleasanter than all to have an early copy of your book placed on the breakfasttable unexpectedly some sunshiny morning to behold for the first time the darling of your meditation in a suit of embossed muslin how your heart turns over if you are not used to the thing how you make pauses between your coffee and muffins to admire the clear typography the luxurious paper the gold letters on the back messrs printem sellem sent me two outoftown papers containing notices of daisy these notices were solicited by advance copies of the work for the purpose of being used in the publication advertisement it is curious to remark how great minds will differ from the blundertown journal new publications daisys necklace and what came of it newyork printem and sellem this production is an emanation from the culminating mind of glorious genius nothing like it has been produced in this century it possesses all the fine elements of dickens novels without any of their numerous defects its scope its pathos and wit isb beyond all praise our britannic brethren will no longer ask who reads an american book for we can reply the world we learn from good authority that the publishers have received orders for twenty thousand copies of the work in advance of its publication we have no doubt of it for daisys necklace will shed new lustre on the name of american literature envious authors will abuse the work as the immortal goethe says de gustibus non est disputandum our rush of advertisements prevents us from making voluminous extracts from the novel this however would be useless as everybody will read it for themselves orders addressed to higgins co of this town will be promptly filled i should take the editor of the blundertown journal to be a man of cultured taste appreciative and discriminating the second review was not quite so favorable and can scarcely be called a firstrate notice from the frogpond gazette daisys necklace is the silly title of an absurd novel about to be issued by printem sellem of newyork from the fact that the authors name is withheld from the titlepage we infer that he had some friends some few who were not wholly willing that he should make a donkey of himself we have read a great deal of trash in our day but daisys necklace is the king of all vapid novels sentimental in sentiment flaccid in fiction and entirely intolerable from beginning to end the first forty pages put us to sleep we advise all druggists to keep the book for sale as an anodyne the binding is good and that is all the praise we can give so contemptible an abortion a reading public that tolerates a novel like this must be made up of very goodnatured persons assinine in temperament and mentally obtuse this work we presume is written by that muchabused and prolific myth a young gentleman of this city distinguished of course we believe that he writes all of printem sellems books at all events those enterprising gentlemen always have a startling novel in press from his immortal pen what a long string of sins these gentlemen have to answer for what a commotion there would be among the shelves of their bookstore if dead authors could come back and reclaim stolen property if the shade of lindley murray could stalk among them for our part we had rather see the hudson river railroads list of dead and wounded than printem sellems list of popular publications but it is consoling to know that books like daisys necklace in spite of purchased puffery find their level at last as linings for portmanteaus and thirdrate trunks we shall make cigarlighters of our copy and thank the stars that we were not born a bookmaking genius not a line quoted to prove the justice of the unstrained censure i could not account for the malignant personality of this critique until barry informed me that my publishers never advertised their books in the columns of the frogpond gazette this of course explained it i only wish i had the stubborn editor of the frogpond at arms length i would try the consistency of his ears i was somewhat astonished the next day to find how ingeniously messrs printem sellem made the adverse criticism subservient to their interests my lucubration was out the post said so the morning rabid said it the evening lookingglass said it and a host of small fry echoed the important fact i unfolded the rabid and beheld the following advertisement published this day a novel of unprecedented power entitled daisys necklace and what came of it the frogpond gazette high authority in a long review of this work says daisys necklace is the king of all novels the blundertown journal also high authority remarks this book is an emanation from the culminating mind of glorious genius nothing like it has been produced in this century it has all the fine elements of dickens novels without any of their numerous defects our first edition copies is exhausted and we beg our friends to have patience for a few days wanted agents to sell the above work printem sellem publishers four thousand agents quoth barry looking over my shoulder i rather think it would take forty thousand to sell an edition of daisy i laughed at my irate friend and igniting a fresh regalia crossed my feet on the mantelpiece and remarked composedly now for the critics finis erratum the greek of my bookmaking genius ralph esq seems decidedly rusty he has evidently given his lexicon an icy shoulder will the intellectual and erudite reader substitute kyrie eleyson for kyrie elyson on page footnotes a mr barescythe with his characteristic wordcatching spirit wishes to know if grapes and cherries are ripe at one and the same time in newengland b barescythe says that the wrong verb used in this paragraph is what editors call a typographical error
