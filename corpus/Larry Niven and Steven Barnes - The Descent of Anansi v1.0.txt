 one high finance on october the comsat board of directors declared a dividend of cents per share this was approximately one million dollars and represented a milestone they first money made by the general public from a space enterprise it took a little over six years for comsat to go from initial startup to a dividendpaying operation the brazil techimetalelectromotores building was the second tallest in all of sao paulo a glistening golden spire that sprouted from a cluster of drab fivestory structures an egotistical giant among dwarves xavier parked his mercedes in the underground parking structure and took yamada up to the thirtyfirst floor in a public elevator there they changed to a security elevator jorge xavier stood perfectly erect and nearly a foot taller than his companion his face was dark his hair thick and fluffy and prematurely white he was altogether a tailors dream now his generous mouth was drawn into a slender line his brows wrinkled in concentration he askedin english he had learned that yamadas portuguese was pooryou are sure of the amount absolutely oyama construction wants the cable at all costs the transkorea bridge will make their reputation xavier slammed the edge of his palm into the elevator wall swearing in portuguese i know i know it is why we must have it with the stonecypher cable in our hands we can force oyama construction into a merger such a merger would combine the raw materials and manpower available to bte with the technical resources and world respectability of oyama construction with terms favorable to beth sides such a merger could be he groped for words i do not care what it takes we will have that cable your company president your senhor castellon he will not match oyamas bid castellon is a sick old man he spends half of the year in caxambu drinking the waters to heal a faulty liver his problem is not in the liverit is in the heart he has no heart for a gamble an electriceye scan of the bte executives identification card admitted them to the fiftyfourth floor yamada stepped out and smiled reflexively at the pleasant softness of the carpet he said and you do i would not have brought you here otherwise i and a few others in my company we have the heart we are young and strong we will gamble yamada wondered too late if it had been wise to betray oyama construction to this man he was suddenly very aware of what he himself was gambling income reputation honor freedom if he lost the bte executive suite was as luxurious as practicality would allow muted music flowed from the inner walls and many of the outer walls were goldtinted plastic the tinting reduced the glare without obstructing the view of the city it was a view worthy of appreciation a vista of silver and red buildings sparkling in the sun almost as far as the eye could see the receptionist was alert and smiling a greeting as the elevator door slid open boa tarde senhor xavier boa tarde luisa apresentolhe o senhor he turned to yamada apologetically excuse me luisa this is mr yamada we will be in conference call mr da silva mr costa and mr giorgi have them come to my office obrigado mr yamada this way please xavier led the slender oriental down the hallway and steered him around a right corner this corridor ended in a huge oakpanelled door with the name j xavier centered on a rectangle of brass the door swung open without a sound and they entered there was a large conference desk in the front part of the office with a setup for videophone conferences yarnada doubted that xavier would want the contents of this particular conference broadcast over any line no matter how secure please be seated drink yamada shook his head no accepting the invitation to sit xavier busied himself at a small wetbar coming back with a short glass of ice and clear liquid garnished with a twisted slice of lime he sat across from yamada sipped his drink and gazed at him speculatively yamada felt naked stripped to the skin and then flensed to the bone xavier probed and examined and weighed finally laying the meat arid organs back in place slipping the skin back onto the body no japanese would have stared so the rooms silence was oppressive and yamada fought to escape that gaze to break contact with those bottomless black eyes he found a painting to look at a garish thing of oranges and blacks concentric rings of color surrounded plastic bubbles that rose inches out from the canvas sprays of yellow arcing through the black background like comets through space a name clicked in his mind this is your mr castellars work is it not xavier smiled some of the coolness leaving his face yes you know our painters he was one of the finest emilio castellar dreamed of space when much of our country was trying merely to enter the industrial age a man of vision the office door opened and two men entered followed a moment later by a third one of them was xaviers height a fraction over six feet but heavy in the stomach and thighs he nodded without speaking xavier filled the silence this is mr da silva edson da silva the second was a small neat man with a beard that had been trimmed to a razor point his hazel eyes seemed to be in constant quick movement his skin was lighter than xaviers or da silvas he sized yamada up in two intense seconds then stretched out his hand djalma costa he said djalma with a d takayuki yamada yamada turned to the third man noting the limp and the silver wolfs head cane that corrected it and of course you are mr giorgi lucio giorgi giorgi was as tall as da silva but much thinner his eyes were hollow and the skin on his face was stretched taut over the bones as if a long illness had stripped away the fat giorgi nodded with satisfaction and spoke with excellent though accented english i see that news of my accident precedes me we were interested in your work on the parana dam project of course when the scaffolding collapsed we knew that the famous giorgi had been the only survivor i am perhaps too old to continue onsite inspections if this project is as successful as we hope we will definitely desire your expertise they shook hands and all five men were seated there was a moment of uncomfortable tension then xavier cleared his throat and slapped his palms on the table well mr yamada if you would be so kind as to share your information with us certainly all hesitation had left him now he swung his briefcase up to the table and dialed its fivedigit combination there was a sharp click and yamada eased it open and removed a thin folder of papers he locked the case and set it on the floor yamada thumbed through the folder talking to himself in barely audible japanese ah yes i trust that i do not have to fill you three gentlemen nodding in the direction of the newcomers in on much of the background material skim through to todays business xavier suggested agreed the item of interest is a cable recently extruded by falling angel enterprises put as simply as possible the cable is a strand of singlecrystal iron filaments locked in an epoxy matrix he looked up at them with a distracted look on his face it is eighttenths of a millimeter thick and fourteen hundred kilometers long all preliminary tests indicate that it is much stronger than kevlar at least ten or twenty times stronger his eyes slid over a page and a half of notes suffice it to say that the ah delicate situation existing between americas national aeronautics and space administration and falling angel enterprises has severely limited buyers for the cable da silva nodded enthusiastically this is true pressure from the u s of a has caused four nations to drop out of the bidding great britain just this morning saving face costa laughed they knew they would be outbid quitting now earns them a few points in the eyes of the americans there was a twist on the word american as if he was sharing a private joke no we and the japanese are the only ones remaining in the bidding i think that i can guarantee that oyama construction will win the bid the bridge project is entirely too important xavier caught his breath how high is oyama going one hundred and eighty million dollars there was a hiss of exhaled breath and costa cursed vividly hes insane no xavier said his voice a solid weight in the room it is one of a kind a thousand miles of the strongest cable even produced by man an option on the next five thousand to be produced oyama is taking the kind of gamble that castellon would have taken twenty years ago before he lost his ovos unlike any material ever produced on earth now in orbit around the moon waiting for someone with the will to defy the stockholders and the u s of a there is no hope that your mr castellon will commit more funds to the project none one hundred million is as high as he is prepared to go then oyama will win the bid the five men looked at each other saying nothing costa watched xavier carefully watched him turn to giorgi and measure his words before speaking lucio in your opinion how important is that cable to the construction of the japansouth korea bridge giorgis hollow pale face took on some colon as he sat forward fingers twining animatedly mr da silva will correct me if i am wrong but oyama construction is overextended financially if the project is successful oyama will be in an exceedingly advantageous position if it fails or if the bridge goes disastrously over budget they will be in considerable difficulty certainly the present administration of the company would undergo considerable upheaval therefore they need the cable even at the cost of one hundred and eighty million dollars it is cheap they will save money time and establish a permanent advertisement for their most advanced engineering techniques oh yes they need it oh yes xaviers eyes were cold and calm well then if it is certain that oyama needs the cable then we can proceed with phase two again mr yamada the japanese swallowed stepping over the edge of a mental cliff trusting that there was water at the base i can supply you with course data for the space shuttle anansi with this information you will know where the vehicle is during every second of its descent to kwanto spaceport if all the other elements are in readiness interception will be possible excellent xavier took a thoughtful sip of his drink eyes focused on the wall behind yamada giorgi you are sure of yours pilots their loyalty is to me to us they understand their reward for efficiency and discretion will be handsome we will need hours startup time costa your friends in the umaf ready and eager it has been a dry time for them and a headline of such magnitude will do much to revitalize the organization i try never to denegrate our allies but one would think that these people would forget the zionites and find themselves another war it has been sixty years costa laughed loudly the laughter dimming to chuckles then a private smile as no one else joined in xavier drummed his fingers on the table he said it is a holy war soldiers in a holy war win or die they do not seek new wars mr da silva as of today for a short operation i believe that we can divert nearly eight million dollars from the central computer without any danger until the july audit da silva twisted slightly in his chair and wiped a thin sheen of perspiration from his forehead yamada noted that it wasnt warm in the conference room today is november the seventeenth that gives us almost seven months by that time it will all be over one way on the other well gentlemen there is the gamble disgrace and prosecution or control of brasil tecimetalelectromotores again there was no sound in the room except for the subdued hum of the air conditioner then giorgi cleared his throat and spoke i myself have always been a gambling man there was a murmur of agreement and yamada joined in quietly good said xavier then gentlemen let us drink to our venture he rose halfway from the table then turned back his expression of content tinged with doubt lucio he asked are you quite certain about the missile we can trust the umaf to operate it properly we will have our own man on hand to supervise good good it is best not to take chances he dusted his hands against each other well that drink eh two grand theft a dull murmur wound its way through the audience a murmur which could erupt into a roar at any moment thomas de camp shifted uncomfortably and whispered dont like this his small dark eyes flickered around the room i really dont need to be here all they need from me is my vote janet de camp squeezed his hand brought her lips close to his ear look at these people most of them dont want to be here either they just want it to be over one way or the other we need you here tommy he looked down at their locked hands her pale fingers forming a crisscross pattern against his dark brown skin and sighed knowing she was right someone had to be here someone who cared he just wished that it didnt have to be him janet pressed his hand again then released it her iceblue eyes were alive with eagerness and the contrast to his own feelings was as marked as their physical contrast her nordic blood against his african and oriental features her five foot eight against his five and a half the differences went deeper deeper than he wanted to think about now a circular magnification screen glowed at one end of the space shuttle external tank that served as a meeting hail nobody had used chairs for free fall since skylab the hundred and fifty foot tank was a maze of netting one hundred and eighty barefoot audience members clung to the lines by fingers and toes like flies in a spiderweb with this one difference their feet all pointed in one direction a tacitly agreedupon down the magnification screen was still blank fleming the head of falling angel enterprises had yet to mount the podium there was a trickle of excitement from the back of the meeting hall and de camp turned his head in time to see fleming and one of his aides gliding up the center safety line he might have been going handoverhand up a rope but no marine fitness instructor ever floated up a line so effortlessly reaching the screen fleming unhooked his safety and nudged himself into position refastening himself to the podium his aide fastened herself to a nearby strand and handed him his briefcase fleming cleaned his glasses his gently humorous face seeming too long until he slipped them on again good afternoon i know that seems a cruel joke to those of you on the shift but bear with an old man eh a tensioneasing chuckle warmed the room as fleming inserted a cartridge into the podium and flashed through his notes a brawny solar satellite tech in front of the de camps unhooked his fingers from the web and stretched his arms this isnt going to be good he said to no one in particular fleming is smiling give him a chance thomas said before he realized he was speaking aloud the tech turned and looked at him with a bemused smile fleming took his usual position at the mike hands braced at the side of the podium pulling down to make his own gravity can all of you hear me good good he arched his back and long muscles flexed he spent more time in the centrifugal gravity of the administrative offices than anyone in falling angel he looked every inch the patriarch and the fatigue lines in his face only strengthened the image well i have just finished a short conversation with our friends in nasa he let the ripple of laughter run its course not totally to my surprise they still refuse to deal with us i believe that the most popular term being applied to us is lunatic pirates a thin womanher name escaped thomas although he knew she worked in air quality raised her hand and why shouldnt they call us pirates she asked testily everything that we have up here was paid for by the taxpayers of the united states as far as theyre concerned were robbing them miss ellinshaw fleming said adjusting his glasses the last thing in this world i intend is to turn my back on the american people you must understand that the incorporation of falling angel was a matter of much debate and controversy before any announcement was made youre still stealing her words were set in concrete beyond argument and de camp was suddenly glad he had never had to requisition a recycler filter from her flemings face reddened when she said that and his teeth were set tightly little muscles at the hinge of the jaw twitching he had risked health and reputation to build falling angel from a single spacecraft in close orbit around the moon to a collection of clumped space junk to one of the finest laboratory complexes in the world he had supervised the expansion personally scuffling and battling every inch of the way with the earthlocked nasa honchos balding now eyes weakened from long hours pouring over computer displays fleming had personally suited up and led rescue operations supervised the construction of the big mass driver in mare crisium and for the past twelve years had poured his life and organizational genius into falling angel at another time this same roomful of people might have soberly discussed spacing ellenshaw for those words today there was merely a whisper of assent stealing fleming asked softly i think not in the twelve years that falling angel has been in existence we have repaid the original investment in our facility one and one half times adjusting for inflation and interest on the original loan it is arguable that we still owe the united states a few million dollars believe meevery effort will be made to set this right the truth of the situation is that unless we are freed from the present crippling bureaucracy we will soon be unable to operate at all friends we are a quarter of a million miles from the folks who do most of the voting to usto each other herefalling angel is our whole world to america we are a few hundred people engaged in an exotic operation which has taken twelve years to break even when the next budget cutback comes down the pipe most voters will vote for something they can see and touch and understand and one day without any noise falling angel will die like so much of our space program he paused and it was easy now to feel the weariness in him thomas chewed at the inside of his cheek finding it difficult to watch and like so many other noble efforts so many other dreams one day well all pack up and go home fleming gripped the side of the lecturn and leaned forward augeralive in his voice im an old man and ive given my life to falling angel and the technology that build her im too damned old to start over and too damned mean to take this thing gracefully were going to show the american people that we can survive as a business that we can make moneyfor them if we cant appeal to their hearts well try their wallets but were not going to lose we need things that only earth has and earth needs things that only we can make were americans here but were something else too were the future if america doesnt believe in her future anymore then maybe its up to us to show her were not dead yet at least half of the audience applauded loudly as fleming pushed himself back from the podium and scanned them janet de camp whispered to her husband round one for the good guys the floor was opened for discussion and controversy raged could falling angel truly survive as an independent could nasa or the american military retaliate the second question fleming answered immediately if you ask that you dont understand the situation we arent sitting on top of a diamond mine up here at present we are considered a marginal enterprise while we do have products we can sell congress will expect us to collapse without their support when we dont they may have some ideas about taking over but remember the real wealth of falling angel is its experienced personnel at worst they might make an example of me and a few of my most conspicuous officers the rest of you will be even more valuable to them than you are now the american voter can see falling angel if he owns a telescope and knows enough to aim it right when were rounding the edge of the moon that voter is fairly rare and hes on our side anyway and what does he see a junkyard of expended shuttle main tanks hardly something worth fighting over what else a fleet of six antiquated space shuttles two of which nasa has already confiscated because they were on the ground and three cesiumfueled ion drive tugs capable of moving them between earth and lunar orbit there were a few more minutes of talk then ellinshaw raised her hand and stood again mr fleming she said i move that we put this to a vote now he nodded all right seconded the silence lasted too long for thomas comfort and he raised a stocky arm seconded then a vote it is all in favor of independence for falling angel for an instant there was no movement in the room then hands began to rise like sprouted seedlings until just under half of the personnel had raised their arms there was a quick count opposed flemings assistant counted again and handed her tally up to the administrator he looked it over with a neutral expression janets face flattened with dismay we lost she sounded numb wait its not over yet fleming handed the tally back then addressed them all postessential personnel and lunar personnel have submitted proxies the initialedvote sheets have been tabulated and are available for inspection in my office the official tally is independence opposed the motion passes there were a few cheers but also a rumbling undercurrent of discontent fleming raised his hand for attention those of you who voted to remain under control of nasa may leave falling angel if you wish we have made arrangements to ferry you back this will relieve you of any fear of prosecution those of you who stay well i hope you know how badly we need each and every one of you now more than ever let it be a matter between you and your conscience just rememberits your future were fighting for fleming left the lecturn to scattered applause much of the audience already divided into percolating knots of controversy thomas turned to his wife unhooking fingers and toes from the net well thats that we did it tommy she grinned broadly look at this are you sure you dont want to stick around you wont find action like this out in the belt her smile was a mask her voice part wheedle and part sorrowful acceptance i need quiet makes it easier to do the job anyway ill be wherever the ion drives are ive done my part here their eyes met and locked and janet tore hers away first she tugged at him as he launched himself towards the safety line see you for dinner there was quiet humor in the dark mongol face humor that rose to a smile sure ill be in the shop if you need me she nodded watched him swim up the line with the smile fading from her lips for a moment her vision misted then she shook her head clear no time for that she said fiercely quietly then damn it theres no time for anything anymore janet flexed the cramp from her fingers and joined the exodus dozens of barefooted figures waiting for a place in line heading for the locks three the auction most of those leaving the meeting hall donned pressure suits or took one of the connection tubes but the administrator of falling angel had a scooter waiting the pressurized threeman vehicles were in short supply and generally reserved for the repair crews fleming eased into the control seat and waited for his assistant to climb in next to him mrs kelly was a chunky woman on the far end of forty married to one of the solar engineers bright competent and fiercely loyal to falling angel enterprises but she never moved quickly enough for flemings taste after more than thirty months at the facility she still wasnt used to zero gravity no problems with it in fact just the opposite unless there was a specific demand for speed she seemed to linger over each separate movement savoring it she had buckled herself in and sealed the door fleming broke anchor manually and they floated away accelerating the universe was silence and razoredged shadow as they cruised along the sprawling structure of falling angel a score of shuttle external tanks were splayed out in orbit around the moon serving as a basis for the industrial complexes that served the needs of america the soviet union and the european combine suddenly flemings crowsfeet squeezed flat and he pointed at a dimly lit rounded object like a water smoothed rock equipped with tailfins notation kelly find out why strickland still has men working on the cable reentry package i was told it was ready to go she nodded scribbling glad that he had broken the silence what do you think about the meeting they were passing through a cluster of shuttles she ticked the names of the winged boxcars as they passed susanoo lucifer haephestus and the newest addition anansi fleming said nothing for a few seconds only the flickering dim lights of the computer display bringing his face to life he watched the spinning bulk of the exercise room pass to their right well make it well be down to half strength but the people who stay theyre the real workers the deadweight just voted itself out his hands played delicately over the controls and his voice never wavered it took someone very familiar with his ways to sense the bitterness in him but mrs kelly was that close and more we can count on them youll see his eyes never left the shadowcrested shapes rising beneath and around the scooter he smiled now and she was happy to see it was his private smile not the one he pulled out and glued on for meetings she could imagine him smiling thus at an hours worth of sand castle fifty years ago you know sometimes when im sitting at my desk it gets easy to be abstract about this junk sculpture its just so much metal and plastic tubing consuming so many pounds of oxygen and water and so many millions of dollars a month a thing but here she could see his eyes building infrastructures as they scanned the complex building changing improving and never satisfied the scooter went into an approach path for the administration buildings a flat disk connecting three shuttle tanks the tanks rotated about the axis of the disk providing gravity for the offices the center disk housed the filing and supply warehouse he docked without a bump and kelly sealed their door on waiting for safety to approve and admit them to the tiny airlock she barely noticed the sensation of weight returning as she lifted flemings briefcase from the rear seat and carried it off with her the alarm in kellys wristwatch buzzed until she flicked it off looks like were just in time she said helping fleming from the scooter the calls are coming through good good put them on hold well be there in a minute the inner lock opened and let them through the hallways and corridors were largely plain but not severely so kelly could remember infinities of bare plastic trim laid on foam steel now the niceties of gracious living were creeping aboard the crew invited to assist with the decorating had responded with a generous sampling of their talents oil paintings sculpture an achingly beautiful tinsel and blown glass mobile there were many moonscapes including one spectacular view of the apennine mountains which had won second prize in the venice arts festival earthside kelly still remembered passing the hat to pay for the shipping space aboard a shuttle closer to the center of the hub the floor was carpetted in velcro but that was unnecessary out at the edge with twothirds earth gravity to hold a traveler down the office section was largely deserted which made the narrow hallways seem more spacious it was a feeling to cherish and to dread if this desperate plan didnt work fleming was reaching for the doorknob when it slid away under his hand dr stonecypher popped his head out bending so that his greying hair barely grazed the top of the sixfoot doorframe his thick eyebrows knitted in perplexity there you are benjamin he checked his watch with poorly concealed irritation i was beginning to worry he moved his towering frame aside to let them pass moving with the strange disjointed grace of a praying mantis dr stonecypher was one of the original falling angels and held the record for time spent in nullgrav beating out the nearest contender a russian communications specialist in orbit around earth by several thousand hours he virtually lived in the metallurgy and special projects lab he had built over the past fifteen years spinning out the miracles that made falling angel what it was the most advanced zerogravity research and production facility in the world during that time he had undergone one of the rarer effects of longterm work in space unhampered by gravitys fierce and constant tug fed a constant high mineral diet to counteract the negative calcium transport oftenexperienced by long term astronauts his skeletal structure had experienced a second anabolic stage the bones were growing again he was nearly seven inches taller than the stonecypher who had matured on earth and the medics were frankly baffled as to when the sixtythreeyearold metallurgist could expect it to stop eight years older than fleming stonecypher was one of the few people who addressed him by name and the only man kelly had ever seen upbraid him fleming took it well there was only one dexter stonecypher and his expertise in a very special field was irreplaceable come come dexter said shooing fleming along with a thinfingered hand stonecypher walked along behind him with the painstaking delicacy he always adopted on his infrequent sojourns into the centrifugal zone i still have to supervise mating of gabriel and the cable pod special projects is going crazy over dead rats and dead fleas for gosh sake mark my wordyoull push me too far one day dead rats indeed and oh he added almost as an afterthought were holding japan and brazil on the line fleming took the briefcase from kelly and took his position at the conference table lets not fall apart now dexter a bit of teasing never hurt a sale if its worth buying its worth waiting for an unexpected result of overexposure to moonlight stonecypher growled to kelly as he took his place next to fleming he looked down at the top of the administrators head hes turning into a merchant some bizarre variant of lycanthropy no doubt hush kelly said absorbing the giants petulant expression without a flinch im bringing the line on ready ready ive been ready for seven minutes kelly hovered over the intercom console three two one live ghostly images of two men flickered into existence in two of the three empty chairs at the table the slender dark one was jorge xavier the other was a solidlybuilt japanese whom kelly recognized as retsudo oyama the son of the founder of oyama construction gentlemen kelly said using clear careful diction are you receiving us clearly there was a perceptible delay before retsudo answered her crisply yes thank you reception is fine and you mr xavier his english sounded more british than american yes thank you xavier said at once we had a problem with resolution but it has been adjusted he seemed somewhat stiff and unspontaneous a handsome man kelly thought but not an attractive one please proceed gentlemen dr stonecypher the head of the team which created the cable is on my left mrs kelly is recording do we have any opening comments xavier cleared his throat i would like to point out that the sale of the cable should be influenced by other factors than sheer weight of gold indeed it has mr xavier stonecypher said with infinite gravity the fact that only two of you are left at this stage of the bidding indicates that quite clearly excuse me i didnt mean the political pressures it is possible that bte can make an offer based upon a mutually profitable future relationship we have shuttle launch and refueling capabilities which you may find useful in your present situation we have already made arrangements with the japanese government mr xavier a trace of annoyance thinned flemings lips you may rest assured that these arrangements will in no way affect todays bidding the outcome will be based solely on the highest offer oyama seemed curious mr xavier you speak as if you have already conceded defeat not at all we are prepared to top your bid i merely wished to point out that there are many ways that payment can be made and that liquid assets are only one form but what falling angel needs now are liquid assets fleming said quietly the item in question is already packaged for reentry and can be available for shipping within ten hours shipping can be completed within five days and will commence after the first third of the payment has been transferred to our bank in zurich we trust that this will be satisfactory dr stonecypher will accompany the cable personally to guarantee its safety fleming looked from face to face are there any further questions no then let the bidding conclude a small white rectangle appeared in front of each holographic image and hovered there you understand the rules gentlemen each of you will be allowed one bid and one bid only the highest bid buys the cable tension had eased some of the depth from his voice making it higher and thinner than usual may i have your bids please xaviers rectangle filled at once fleming nodded approvingly mr oyama are you ready the oriental could not see xaviers bidding box but still he gazed studiedly at xavier xaviers remarks earlier had that been trickery to lull him into lowering his bid if bte topped oyama by one dollar the cable was theirs oyamas rectangle filled with a ninedigit number retsudo was poised on the edge of his seat as if ready to fly or fight his hands were knotted painfully tight on the desk in front of him thank you mr oyama mr xavier im afraid oyama construction has topped your bid xavier made a little bow in his seat congratulations mr oyama perhaps another time mr fleming his image fuzzed out if a ton of steel girders had been lifted from retsudos chest his relief could have been no greater now mr fleming i can assure you that the first payment will be deposited to your account within fortyeight hours may i ask that the cable be ready for shipment as soon as you have received word the rest of the detailshigh finance and ground controlwere relatively easy to work out and within fifteen minutes oyama had faded from the room fleming and stonecypher grinned at each other with the unaffected pleasure of two children let loose in a toy store we did it flemings voice was muted with wonder a hundred and seventysix million dollars even inflation doesnt bite that too badly falling angel has definitely hung out the shingle stonecypher ran skeletal fingers through his thinning shock of white hair we need to make decisions now though our pilots are going to be busy ferrying the candypants back to terra firma well need the very best pilots for the cable fleming glanced at kelly who raised an eyebrow and silently mouthed a single syllable fleming nodded and turned back that would be janet de camp her husband thomas would be my choice for ion drive tech theyre both space crazywouldnt think of going back yes thomas good man weve traded pawns a few times isnt he prepping one of the ion drives for the juno mining project right thats gabriel the one with the thermonuclear backup motor hes been working on the others too nothing wrong with them but he wont be here if anything does need repair we were lucky there the ion drive components came up before the political situation came apart nasa could have stopped those flights kelly was fidgeting uncomfortably boss this isnt anything official but in a community this size its hard not to pick up rumors stonecypher clicked his puzzlement leaning forward at the table this has some bearing on thomass fitness to accompany the cable it might affect his compatability profile he and his wife are separating nothing hostile just well dexter you know thomas introvert lives in his machines hes never been much of a socializer stonecyphers long frame stiffened slightly ive never heard of his having problems with anyone were here to work not socialize de camp is a worker i can understand that kelly spread her hands helplessly im not passing judgment im just trying to put my finger on the problem what it boils down to is that his wife janet started playing the field there are six men for every woman up here and thats an awful temptation to a healthy girl how serious is the rift fleming asked theyre being very civil about it but hes heading for the asteroids and janet is staying in the earthmoon system separation for sure i dont know about divorce and your judgment thomas puts his job first always we can trust him janets every bit as much the pro she just knows how to cut loose and be doesnt all right i think we can let janet choose her own copilot from whoevers available and that will round out the crew what ship isnt anansi due for repairs yes sir cargo bay doors need realignment the other shuttles are in go condition but haephestus is still in japan okay four shuttles and only two cans right and the cans hold fiftyfour passengers each we can take our departures deserters stonecypher corrected politely down in three loads lucifer and susanoo bring a can back and send haephestus anansi goes with the cable pod tell gomez that we want anansi ready by the time oyamas check clears yes sir ill get on it immediately kelly stood in a smooth graceful motion that took years to master the trick was to thrust against coriolis force and keep ones feet on the floor she paused before leaving sir fleming lifted a bushy gray eyebrow im glad oyama got the bid theres something about that man xavier that bothers me her boss merely laughed quietly before turning back to stonecypher kelly left the room still unable to dispel the disquieting image of the toohandsome man with the silver hair and the oily smile perhaps another time just a personal reaction she decided very unprofessional of her janet de camp detached her helmet and took a deep breath as the airlock opened it wasnt bottled air she hated though she thought it was all air was bottled air at falling angel except in the greenhouse bubbles themselves what ruined the taste of pressure suit air was being confined in that helmet she stripped down to a light green leotard and hung her pressure suit on the rack near the inner door there was one other suit on the rack she poised on the lip of the lock and took off sailing into the air like a competition diver she caught the first bar of the jungle gym and twisted her body lithely working through it with practiced ease the exercise room was another shuttle tank hauled up out of earths gravity well fitted with an oxygen recycler and spun from one end the gradient of weight return was sharp enough to provide a thorough and totally unique workout to those who used the monkey bars instead of the ladder which ran down the back wall leg at full extension she hooked her heel on a bar above her head and hoisted herself up with one leg spun in a tight ball and caught another bar her performance would have been impossible under any but the weakest of gravities she climbed and twisted down the bars working against coriolis force and increasing spinweight she turned a horizontal bar into a side horse doing a quick series of leg circles and then a backward scissors she was beginning to perspire now she descended the rest of the way as if she were working parallel bars swinging up then dropping to the next level hoisting herself into a handstandand banging her ankle on another bar janets grip faltered and she fell a few feet catching herself frantically with a grip that would have shattered her wrist on earth somewhat shamefaced she lowered herself the rest of the way the returning weight pressing the bars into her bare feet the monkey bars welded to the sides of the tank ended eight feet above the floor and she dropped favoring the bruised ankle lazy applause praised her efforts bravo wonder woman displays another of her myriad skills the speaker was a slender blond man with finely chiseled muscles his features were delicate enough to seem pretty except for his nose which was a trifle too large he was stripped to the waist and glistened with the sweat of exertion he shook his head violently and an expanding halo of droplets flew from his hair ill make it all the way marion youll see she limped over to himan exaggerated limp certainlyand watched as he slid back under the handles of the exercise machine he pressed the handles up against two hundred pounds of air pressure and pumped it twice it went halfway up the third time then with a despairing whoof he let it clatter back down janet applauded sarcastically bravo ive been doing this for almost an hour if you must know he sat up and wiped his face with his cotton tshirt gazing at her with narrowed eyes may i assume that you arent here just for a workout i hear that youre leaving marion swung one leg over the bench sitting sideways and mopped his chest with the shirt is that question business or pleasure we need you marion his eyes were chips of green ice i never realized how impersonal a plural could be look were fighting for something you believe in dont try to tell that what happened between us changed your mind about falling angel he said nothing but leaned away from her a bare fraction she tried to smile will you fly with me just this last time i really cant janet his face softened and he seemed even younger than his twentyeight years i have assets in american banks a savings account uncle gavins trust fundthey could be frozen or attached i cant afford to stay and i cant afford to help you get that cable down she watched him without speaking and at last he shrugged pulling his shirt on over his sweatslick torso it stuck on the dampness and he had to tug it down i wont be surprised if you dont understand okay without a backward glance he headed toward the ladder marion she called after him he stopped one hand on the bottom rung would you do it if it were safe would you do it if i werent the pilot he rolled his shoulders under the pullover turned to face her maybe since it doesnt matter maybe i would even if you were the pilot but thats not the way things are so why dont we cut the conversation janet i think we could swing it she said carefully she watched his eyebrows arch in disbelief and hurried on listen we can list you as a deserter one of the cargos of earthbound can land in japan a few days before us you change places with their copilot once weve landed and go back to america they may suspect something but not enough to stand up in court hope flared for a moment in his face and her heart lifted he did care about falling angel he tucked his emotions back in as soon as he realised they were showing what if it doesnt work i stand to lose quite a bit that will be our department you help us get this cable down and if anything goes wrong youll find yourself with a numbered swiss account in the amount of your losses please marion i wouldnt trust anyone else to be with me on this run we i need you there was the embryo of a smile tugging his thin lips into a bow he shook his head ruefully damn you janet youve always got everything figured out dont you all but one thing she said im still not sure youre going to say yes he saw her smile waver for an instant and knew her words were true all right he said finally ive always had this thing about being needed until he said those words she hadnt realized that there was a tiny packet of constricted air in the base of her lungs it went now hot and stale and she felt pounds lighter dont go gushy on me he said without sarcasm ive got to pack and this is no time for a scene he turned and started up the ladder whistling he seemed lighter too janet noticed some people just need an excuse to do the things they wanted to do in the first place four the man with no friends the splintered brown expanse of the elbьrz mountains fell away from under the boac jet as it made its approach to mehiabad airport djalma costa buckled his seatbelt and pushed his body back into the seat gripping his armrests with moist hands the industrial relations liason of bte had never enjoyed flying had never trusted planes totally the feeling of unease frequently blossomed into airsickness during the landing approach djalma could never eradicate the image of flames and twisted steel and mangled bodies but he had learned to leech the color from them now his mind was filled with savage black and white arabesques of destruction unnerving but tolerable the eurasian stewardess walked the aisle checking the passengers she paused at his seat please place your briefcase under the seat in front of you unless youd like me to he nodded with nervous quickness he slid the black case gingerly under the seat then placed his right foot atop the ease so that it took only a slight pressure to reassure himself that it was still there he closed his eyes and breathed slowly concentrating on the fact that within minutes he would be in teheran costas contact met him as soon as he had passed through customs welcome to iran the man said politely making a shallow bow mr hoveida sent me costa nodded only the barest spark of suspicion still alive in his mind and who is mr hoveidas friend the mans light brown face crinkled into a knowing smile mr hoveida has no friends sir his partner however is mr reza mansur costa nodded all right take my bags ill carry the briefcase the waiting car was a battered chevrolet station wagon inconspicuous good he slid into the front seat and waited for the driver to finish stowing the luggage they moved out into traffic and costa closed his eyes running through a mental file on hoveida born in maad jordan he had attended the university of amman and became involved in radical politics he first came to the attention of interpol in as the result of a plo bombing raid on an israeli synagogue he went underground soon afterward surfacing in afghanistan as an arms dealer in baghdad as a hired gun and once in paris soliciting financial support for a new organization the united moslim activist front claiming to represent the interests of all arabs he gained backing from several sourcessome said that middle eastern opec interests were heavily involvedand was suspected to have been behind some of the most audacious acts of terrorism of the s it was known that he had acquired a critical mass of plutonium with plans to blackmail a western nation most probably the united states word had leaked and the enforcement arm of the united nations nuclear limitations committee descended on his headquarters in edmonton alberta spearheaded by the rcmp the operation had been a complete successthe plutonium recovered the terrorist organization smashed only hoveida had escaped hoveida knew that one of three people had betrayed him all three of them were close friends of his unable to determine which of them was the traitor he had taken the only expedient course of action killing all three since that time hassan ali hoveida had been known as the man with no friends here in iran hoveida had found a new home for the united moslim activist front officially denounced and outlawed by the iranian parliament they had nonetheless operated out of teheran for the past six years with a minimum of difficulty costa feared notice by american and soviet agents more than any iranian security forces djalma was jarred from his musing by a jolt as the station wagon pulled up to the curb they were in front of a fairly modern twostory dwelling by its weathering perhaps ten years old it clearly showed the influence of westernization on iranian culture being barely distinguishable from any suburban house in america he waited for the chauffeur to remove the bags from the back then followed him to the house there was a fivesecond pause after a rhythmic knock and the door opened he was led down a narrow woodpaneled hall decorated with hanging rugs and lit with a single dull bulb it jarred with the modern exterior perhaps a misguided attempt to capture a bygone simplicity the hallway opened into a circular room where a plain wooden table sat holding an electric lamp there were three men in the room he recognized mansur by his cadaverous thinness and precisely groomed beard mansur sat at the table using a crust of bread to sop the last drops of gravy from a plate behind him stood a huge man with a discernable lump beneath his light coat bodyguard the third man sat at the table paring an apple very precisely with a folding knife he was light for a jordanian and his face was a calm oval his shoulders were broad but slack relaxed almost lethargically costa had met him twice before and both times had been stricken by the lack of warmth in the room regardless of the temperature elsewhere in the house hoveidas presence was always like a draft of cold air sit down please hoveidas english was heavily accented a strong element of french mixed with the arabic djalma sat laying out his briefcase and crossing his legs carefully i am prepared to offer you a half million pounds sterling for your organizations participation in this venture hoveida nodded soberly as agreed i believe that our combined resources can accomplish this thing the money will buy much ammunition many guns and bribes there is no problem with manpower none it is after all a holy cause a flicker of grim amusement curled hoveidas mouth in a smile so long as the equipment arrives on schedule mansur said quietly there should be no problem with the firing a wedge of apple vanished into hoveidas mouth and he chewed thoughtfully f course it is good that the men understand that this spaceship of yours does indeed threaten us if they didnt understand this thing it might seem as if the money were a primary motivation djalma glanced at the bodyguard a huge dark man with hollow eyes the man was too tense let me explain again djalma said taking the hint smoothly the developing nations of the world have always been stripped of their resources by the industrial nations many of us have based our economy chiefly on the exportation of materials and energy and through great struggles have forced the robber nations to pay us a fair price for our goods now they prepare to rape the asteroid belt and a network of solar power satellites is under construction which will soon ring the earth perhaps the two best forms of storing solar energy are one using it to dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen the hydrogen can be liquified and used as fuel two use solar power to make methyl alcohol from water and air and garbage either method reduces the dependency of the industrial nations on petroleum products weakening the economy of any oil producing country particularly in the middle east it is time to show america russia and japan that they cannot despoil the earth then escape to the stars they must be shown their vulnerability as graphically as possible the spacecraft of falling angel enterprises provide an ideal target due to the present dispute between falling angel and americas national aeronautics and space administration falling angel has declared its independence costa grinned wolfishly this means that they are no longer under the direct protection of the united states we can attack them and america will shake her head and say isnt it terrible the things that can happen to wayward children come back to the fold and we will protect you now is the time to strike gentlemen hoveida nodded watching mansur out of the corner of his eye after devouring another slice of apple he turned to the thin man i am satisfied with the money and the justification the men will do as i say the rest is your end mansur it would be best to ask any basic questions now costa had the distinct feeling that mansur did not like him or trust him it was in the slow turning of the head the moistening of narrow lips with a brownish tongue it mattered little the man was a weapons and explosives expert perhaps the finest who had ever gone underground in the middle east he had been responsible for the design of the plutonium device captured in edmonton experts had determined that the hellish thing briefcasesized could have done more damage than the one detonated over nagasaki in i do not doubt mansur began his accent so thick that costa had difficulty distinguishing the consonants that you can obtain a prometheus missile the resources of brazil techimetal and electromotores are well known in shock costa looked to hoveida and to the guard who stood quietly against the wall hoveida laughed harshly no little man i didnt give your secret away but then how no one was supposed to know i am not ignorant of international business affairs mr costa i am well aware of btes recent bid for falling angels products your bid failed i can understand vengeance quite well mansurs head bobbed on his pipestem neck like a puppet on a string and his colorless eyes shone with pleasure did you really think that i would involve myself in a project of this kind without knowing all of the details vengeance against falling angel and what would oyama construction call your actions preemptive competition his body shook as he laughed very well costa mopped his forehead but i trust that this information will go no further certainly as i was saying before you became so upset i have no doubt that you can obtain a groundtoorbit missile i need to know how you plan to deliver it to our launch site the smile on costas face was an uneasy thing held by force of will alone he riffled through his briefcase until he found the papers he needed and laid them out on the table now he began breath rasping in his throat the prometheus missile will be brought in by tanker through the persian gulf to bandareshahpur it will be contained in twentythree boxes labeled machine parts the necessary officials have already been bribed or he glanced at hoveida who expressionless was slipping the last section of apple into his mouth removed he skipped to another sheet of paper reading down a quarter ofa page before continuing from there it will be shipped by rail north to qom and from there southeast to ardestan then we will need trucks to relay the boxes to the launch site you have kept the exact coordinates of the site a secret although we know it is in the desert near isfahan hoveida had stopped moving was totally motionless and again costa had the feeling that the room temperature had dropped that is all you need to know it is actually more than you need to know mansur broke the icy silence your communications and telemetry personnel will be accompanying the missile no only the missile crew will actually accompany it the rest will come in by helicopter from kuwait mansur and hoveida spoke for a minute in arabic then mansur rose and left the room his bodyguard following silently hoveida grinned broadly exposing a split tooth in the back of his mouth come we must make you at home after all you are to be our guest for the next several days there is much work to do and it will be good for you to rest yes i didnt get any coming in from moscow yes the russians they did not open your briefcase good hoveida stretched yawning then snapped his head around as if a thought had just occurred to him i think that you had better give me the money now it will be much safer dont you think of course costa peeled off a false lining in his briefcase and stripped out six short stacks of paper he riffled through them then placed the stack on the table in front of hoveida count it i am sure there is no need we understand each other all too well please go now rest yourself he waved an arm expansively i am sure you will find the accomodations to your liking rest there is much work to be done tomorrow costa clicked his case shut and rose well then i will see you later this evening no tomorrow tomorrow he bowed slightly and took his leave noticing that the temperature seemed to rise as he left hoveidas presence he was sweating but he didnt think that his hands were trembling too badly he was playing a deadly game here deadly mansur thought that the united moslim activist front had all of the details they didnt they didnt know about the helicopter which would carry costa to safety at the proper moment they didnt know about btes plan for the cable they didnt understand the true role of the prometheus missile window dressing he had to be very careful so much depended upon nuances and proper timing costa trudged up the staircase clutching his briefcase tightly feeling a headache coming on death and unimaginable riches were hovering in the air about him he wondered which would come to roost first five the pressure cooker falling angel emerged from the shadow of the moon and glaring sunlight swept across the clusters of cylinders it picked up the cable assembly like a spotlight marion guiness sucking gravy from his fingers in the commissary barked startled laughter he covered his mouth with his hand and peered around guiltily nobody seemed to have noticed how did i miss that yesterday he wondered its grotesque it looks like some kids tried to make a pickaxe out of old spacecraft models the space shuttle anansi formed the bluntbeaked blade of the pickaxe the haft was two components the ion drive tug gabriel and the reentry pod sandwiched between the reentry pod housed the stonecypher cable designed for one use only it looked like a long flatbellied boulder with fins embedded in the tail the hull and fins were covered with handholds ten small solid rocket motorslimpet motorswere mounted around the tail prongs anchored in its nose were moored to anansis belly in the support points where an external tank would ride during a shuttles ascent into orbit the ion drive floated behind the cable pod not yet docked shaping the rest of the pickaxe handle gabriel looked like a steel brick with lumps on it the dustless vacuum robbed the cable assembly of all sense of scale marion knew its size he had worked twelve hours yesterday in anansis cargo bay though new to falling angel the shuttle had served nasa for fourteen years wide areas of kitchentile heat shielding had worn thin enough to need replacing and the rest was examined before every flight into earths lethal atmosphere payload was light this trip mostly widgetry for handling the cable but if those masses started bouncing around during reentry anansi alone was huge the cable pod was almost as big and equally massive gabriel was smaller by a third but there was no blurring to show the size of that crude pickaxe it might well have been toysized until the eye found other cues there tiny human forms pudgy in pressure suits swarming around anansi the cargo bay doors flapped like slow wings opening closing testing the repaired hinge systems she was a lovely beast at thirtyseven meters she and her sister shuttles were the largest selfpropelled objects in the earthmoon system marion remembered the thrill of surfing a flaming shock wave through earths upper atmosphere and fought an urge to shiver one more flight pressuresuited men and women surrounded gabriel too readying it for its maiden flight it bothered marion to know that one of the men working on gabriel was janets husband he didnt wonder why she hadnt told him that shed needed his promise first he wasnt even particularly angry that was just janet but it was something that ought to be settled soon marion finished his coffee dumped his tray and was on his way to the airlock lines still moored anansi to the hangar and storage cylinders marion crossed by one of these pushing his pressureduffle ahead of him letting its mass tow him he entered via the airlock in the cargo bay the pressure suit was uncomfortably tight now but he left it on while he climbed to the cockpit janet was already there but busy she nodded perfunctorily before returning to her checkout she played her hands over the instruments like a master pianist caressing the keyboard he knew that blank look only her body occupied the command chair her mind was in the miles of wire and tubing reestablishing an almost symbiotic link with anansi he had spent hundreds of hours in the cockpit with her and knew that her flying was less an intellectual appreciation of readout than a kind of kinesthetic perception whereby she became one with her craft its engines her muscles its thermalinsulated aluminum sheathing her skin he went back down to the airlock the pump whirred down to silence his pressure suit lost its tightness the cargo bay doors had been left open marion coasted down the vast empty space his gaze picked out bulges in the sprayed foamplastic padding that covered the floor and walls cargo crates some pressurized all protected against a turbulent reentry above him the foamtitanium roof curved away in a great arc he moored a safety line at the back wall then used mobility pack jets to go over the side the cable package was locked beneath anansis tiled belly those prongs like the handholds like the mating ring at the cable pods tail were only lunar pig iron they would melt away during reentry marion sailed along the length of the cable pod and across the gap to gabriel marion knew something about space propulsion systemsion drives solar sails linear acceleratorsenough to hold his own in a conversation and no more those things didnt fly they pushed or fell or sailed but since his earliest school days the thing that had fascinated marion guiness was flight when other children were torn between wanting to be policemen or baseball players marion watched the skies when boys his age were thinking of proms and drivers licenses marion was an honors student at the air force flight academy be it hang gliding or riding a supersonic shock wave across the sky in a combination meteor surfboard winged metal building or anything in between he loved it life in free fall didnt bother him as long as he exercised and falling angel gave him the chance to fly occasionally he found thomas de camp in the ion drives tiny cockpit it was open and de camp was in full pressure suit taking readings from one of the computer screens he dictated into his suit mike while liquidcrystal readouts flashed before him marion scanned his helmet radio band to find thomass frequency hey there tom whats the problem he winced at the somewhat forced jollity in his voice de camp looked up and spotted guiness and bent back down to his work just a minute marion waited worrying he and the halfeskimo tech had never been good friends but there had never been animosity either many of the married men in space had had to face the fact of infidelity so rampant that it transcended the abnormal but many men reacted as points on a graph how thomas de camp cuckold would react to being shut up for a week with his wife and his wifes exlover was another topic altogether de camp pushed himself up out of the cockpit braked with a tug on his safety line hello marion the voice coming over the receiver was flat with tension that might be for personal reasons or professional marion gambled on professional is there a problem his fathers dark skin his mothers fatpadded face made thomas resemble a sooty buddha when he pouted wouldnt be a problem if i had the extra month i was supposed to have hell you were on your way to the asteroids id think a shakedown is a good idea if theres trouble on the way to earth were still close enough to yell for help thomas was shaking his head if theres trouble then i fluffed it if i fluff it its because they shortchanged me by a month this is my job and i should have a chance to do it right his eyes narrowed i would think youd understand that marion broke eye contact clearing his throat he eyed the steelandglass bubble moored to the ion drive assembly it wasnt small but food and water and oxygen storage and instrumentation panels left little room for a man id want a cockpit that was bigger than this think of it as a small igloo thomas said turning back to his work itll be enlarged before gabriel goes out to the asteroids anyway ive got more room than the old mercury capsules youll be four days coming back to the moon ill be all right the sentence was tantamount to a dismissal marion listened to the sound of his own breathing in his helmet then tried again tom the ion drive tech turned back irritation showing yes were going to be spending the next week together i just thought you should now that its over between janet and me congratulations marion felt himself bristle how do you mean that i could be wrong but id think you had too much intelligence to be one of her trinkets oh youre pretty enough but you dont seem to be an inverterbrate he laughed harshly without looking up anyway im glad you directed her to the playground down the street youre pretty dry about all this another laugh what am i supposed to do jump and scream were about through with each other anyway after this trip its me for juno and janet can do what she pleases no divorce if she wants to file papers ill be glad to sign looking at the way things turned out thats not too likely though is it i dont understand you youre not required to he turned back to his work now if youll excuse me were about ready to mate this thing to the cable pod youd better get yourself clear he released his safety line and jumped toward the looming belly of anansi sparing his backpack fuel marion watched him for a few seconds then called after him thomasi loved her de camps voice came back did it make a difference i dont think she ever believed it she will now this is an open frequency marion swore and looked down at his chin display it wasnt an open frequency he heard dc camps chuckle cut off as he passed behind the shuttle bay doors dexter stonecyphers office was roughly spherical a videobeam projector illuminated a third of the curving white inner shell at the moment the beam was split into ten separate images dominating the center was a view of gabriel a huge steel brick closing massively on the mating ring at the stern of the cable pod surrounding that image were nine smaller views giving alternate angles on the pod technical readouts and video feeds from his special projects division from a couch webbing set flush against the opposing wall stonecypher watched the progress on the center screen while he sucked coffee from a squeeze bottle his eyes were red and his hand trembled thirty hours without sleep had nearly laid him low he trusted his subordinates but the cable was his child his concept his creation to allow anyone else to oversee its journey to earth would have been dereliction of duty he spoke softly command swap four for one the central image traded places with one of the smaller screens he was looking over the pod now watching the approach of the ion drive the cable over twenty tons of it was coiled on an immense reel and sheltered within a steel housing the housing was cased thickly in foamed lunar slag forming a shape halfway between an airplane and a boulder flattened at the belly rounded at the nose with three hatchetblade fins and the motors to turn them mounted at the tail despite its makeshift look it was aerodynamically sound hed worked on the computer animated reentry test major restructuring of the exterior housing had been necessary though that was no problem it only involved adding more of the lunar rock mountains of raw material were available from the lunar surface and hemispherical mirrors provided the heat to turn ore into pure metal and alloy indeed falling angel made alloys that would have been impossible on earth a gravitational field can cause materials of varying densities to layer up like a poussecafe that doesnt happen in free fall and neither does heat convection that had been a serious problem once it had been solved falling angels zerogravity labs had made possible the gallium bismide semiconductors which had revolutionized the home electronics field but that was in the dead past and right now stonecyphers nearweightless body felt heavy with fatigue he was alone in his office his door do not disturbed to stop his assistants from reminding him to go to bed he sat with knees drawn up strapped into his vertical couching and blinked slowly as one of the peripheral screens blinked rapidly demanding his attention biolab the small screen blossomed into center position a pressuresuited technician faced the camera holding a polyethylene bag filled with redblotched gray fur balls oh yes dexter thought wearily the rats every experiment that didnt fall under an established heading came under the scope of special projects including project plague when pasteurella pestis confines itself to an infection cycle of ratflearat it is untroublesome to man when the disease kills off so many of the rat population that the fleas cannot find proper hosts they will accept human beings instead but in general it spreads from man to man only with the cooperation of migrating fleas when the disease becomes pneumonic attacking the lungs infesting phlegm and saliva with virulent bacteria plague becomes most fearsome spreading directly from human to human leaving death in its path pasteurella pestis is extinct of course one with the dead in jamshedpur eastern india a bulldozer had torn up several unmarked makeshift graves the black death lived again isolated from earth possessed of a unique environment for the preparation of plague vaccine falling angel had accepted the challenge rats fleas and infected human blood and tissue had been shuttled out to lunar orbit rats in the hundreds had sickened and been studied dissected reinfected allowed to die plague was extracted from blood solutions with electric fields the process electrophoresis couldnt be used in a gravity field because the heat caused convection within the fluid medium contaminating or destroying the biological materials falling angel offered another advantage the results of which stonecypher watched with illdisguised irritation dr quinn it seems that youve captured the errant rodents quinn shook the plastic bag the freezedried puffballs rattled like so many hard meringues whats left of them yes and the xenopsyllfrastia the face on the screen went blank for a moment and dexter leapt into the breech the fleas dammit man i want each and every carapaced corpse ennumerated and accounted for behind dr quinn other workers in pressure suits ran magnifying viewers along the corners and crevices inspecting the rows of anchored glass tubes and hooded flasks equipment was being dismantled and removed from the room for further disinfection after diverting my funds personnel and administrative time for the past fourteen hours i should like to hear that something positive has come of our little excitement dr stonecypher were doing the best we can quinn said apologetically were just glad we could contain the problem by depressurizing the section he tried a grin can you imagine the results if this happened at the mayo clinic there shouldnt have been a problem now doctor youve had your own problems with contaminants ruptured lines true enough young man but the plastics and metals i work with dont actively attempt to chew through rubber flanges if they did i would be somewhat more attentive than you seem to have been doctor i have no more time proceed please or must i come down there with a whiskbroom and a pan to help quinn shook his head uneasily and broke the contact dexter rubbed his eyes and had the momentary good sense to check his pulse forefinger gently pressing the vein in his wrist his heart was racing near fatigue he told himself stress the coffee or but that was unthinkable not now not when he was needed so badly his cable would buy freedom for falling angel and nothing else mattered he had taken three years of his life to design it and two to set up the facility adding two more for the actual extrusion process and the damned cable had stolen seven years of his life perhaps he was becoming a little obsessive about the project but who wouldnt be again he fingered his wrist searching for the pulse he felt it flutter and sucked air if he wasnt careful very careful despite the do not disturb on his door he heard a hesitant knock then a swish as it opened stonecypher stretched his long frame forcing crispness into the motion a familiar profile blotted out the videobeam mrs kelly he said wearily as she swung herself up onto the webbing have you lost the ability to read the sign is most explicit dr stonecypher i dont want to hear it i am extremely busy right now lips pursed kelly studied dexters face she didnt like what she saw youre too tired fleming is worried about you he is is he well you just march right back to fleming and tell him that i can jolly well take care of he lunged forward eyes fixed on one of the smaller screens command swap six for one it flashed onto the darkened center screen and he snatched at his throat mike this is stonecypher are you monitoring this strickland gabriels picked up some angular momentum and its still moving youll mess up the cable pod unless you chill that right now stricklands voice crackled over the speakers got you doc weve already caught it correction was started twenty seconds ago see stonecypher leaned closer computer animation he said distinctly and a blue rotating skeleton popped onto the right corner screen he checked the numbers right sorry to bother you no problem doc stonecypher sighed hugely waved a shaking hand at the multiple screens do you see you see what i have to worry about by gosh woman who do you think is going to do the work around here it seems to me that strickland was doing just fine hmm yes for the moment tell that to quinn i cant relax now do you think i like being in a pressure cooker kelly seemed to be considering the question and stonecypher reacted with rage if fleming ever stops cutting corners and gets some competent help up here maybe then ill believe that i can turn my back without the whole show going straight to hell he was almost screaming now and she could see how his hands were shaking there was a light sheen of perspiration on his forehead and kelly bet herself that it was sticky and cool she said doctor you have only seven hours before the cable is due to leave they have to make their delivery deadline you need your rest the hell i do the side of his fist slammed down on his desk he scraped a little skin off his knuckle and his body jerked up against his couching in weightless reaction all right doctor ill leave but im going to turn off your terminal stonecyphers heavy eyebrows nearly shot through the ceiling what were not going to let you kill yourself on this project if you want to commit suicide swallow a tube of silicone patch she turned like a wraith and glided through the door pausing a moment to hear dexters inevitable sigh of defeat damn you woman you dont fight fair im not playing for points doctor and she was gone stonecypher turned back to his screen it was all over the ion drive was firmly mated to the rear of the cable pod now two cylinders alongside the steel brick began to unroll themselves he watched until the solar power collectors stood out from gabriel like a pair of long rectangular wings a moment later the screen went dead kellys promise had been mercifully delayed but not forgotten he looked out his window seeing the same approximate view but without the closeup detail stonecypher sighed and reached out a pipestem arm for the blanket tucked folded on one of his horizontal shelves thank god for kelly sometimes he felt like an old machine whose automatic shutoff had frozen years back he would just run on and on until something broke or someone pulled his plug one day he would have to let kelly know how much he appreciated her not soon but someday he tucked the blanket around him and fastened two velcro straps turning the couch into a sleepweb command lights out he said and faded into fitful sleep six earthbound there were four seats on the command level of anansi three standard and one stretchedout monstrosity to handle the stretchedout frame of falling angels chief metallurgist thomas patted the older mans shoulder as he edged past good to have you along he said stonecypher nodded still relaxed from his nap i assume you brought your board thomas nodded vigorously buckling himself into his own seat behind janet you bet and weve got a chess program in the onboard so take your pick he leaned forward to speak to his wife we werent getting enough efficiency from the atomic plant everythings fine now tommy check the monitor janet leaned left in the command chair so that her husband could peek over her shoulder ahead of her out the front window there was nothing but pinpoint stars and low in her horizon a bluewhite halfdisk earth she could feel the adrenalin beginning to flow as it always did before a mission regardless of its size or importance joining with her craft becoming part of the most advanced piece of flying machinery ever created by man was an excitement beyond anything else in her life she glanced from thomas to marion and back again marion didnt feel that way about his work and thomas did why cant i forgive him that thomas leaned forward and checked her readout he matched it with figures in his mind and nodded good enough well use the fission plant for departure then damp it sunpowers free anansi this is falling angel the intercom hissed you have completed all test sequences and everything here is go comments captain de camp she adjusted the sound level on her mike everything in order here go she glanced back at stonecypher he looked to be half asleep but his straps were in place professional paranoia fuel tanks a swiveled motor and an electromagnetic plate that was a limpet motor it weighed as much as a man and was half a mans size and it was generally handled manually it was relatively cheap and very useful in free fall whatever you wanted moved enough limpet motors would move it there were twenty now on gabriel ten more on the cable pod would drop it from earth orbit to japan a score of limpets fired and the cable assembly moved away from falling angel after a minute or so their carefully measured fuel ran out not all at once and as they did the magnets cut off the cable assembly left a trail of limpet motors behind itself all joined by a hundred meters of safety cord the last to go was a sled bearing two limpet motors and a man they watched the sled heading back trailing dead limpet motors we picked up a touch of spin janet said disapprovingly and she keyed attitude jets her crews bellies rolled with the peculiar motion when it stopped the cable assemblys pickaxe handle was parallel to the lunar surface and falling angel had grown small enough to be cupped in two hands ion drive in ten thomas said janet fine anansi this is falling angel we monitor all systems as go have a good trip check back when you round the moon cesium vapor flowed into gabriels motor system positively charged grids stripped electrons from the cesium atoms then sent them fleeing away pluscharges repelling each other anansi accelerated with imperceptible gentleness on a breath of cesiumion breeze its path wound out from the moon became an expanding spiral falling angel monitored through relays at the end of six hours falling angel had become invisibly small below them the moon had become a good deal smaller and their orbit was cometary if the ion motor failed now the cable assembly would not return to lunar orbit its target was earth bishop to queens knight three thomas said stonecypher watched him move the magnetic piece and a smile tugged at the corners of his mouth stonecypher castled the next move was pivotal and thomas relaxed a moment to think but he found his thoughts drifting along other lines it was easy to lose himself in abstractions once the mission was underway easy to begin a good game of chess with a friend or to watch the pinpoint stars or the hazy blue disk of earth his coworkers the game the myriad calculations and adjustments forever coalescing in the back of his mind his memories of alaska would all blend into a single complete pattern a tapestry of contented thought which was as close to poetry as he ever allowed himself to come thoughts of alaska were particularly close now as he hovered over a game board in the forward compartment in a week he would be in orbit around earth the closest he had been for months he alone would not land he would return to lunar orbit in that tiny cabin aboard the ion drive and from there head out to juno a hundred and fifty million miles from earth how long would he stay as long as he was needed as long as there was work to absorb him to help him forget the cold crisp alaskan mornings when it seemed that distance had no meaning that far off mountains crisp and sharp in his vision were near enough to reach out and touch to help the memory of janet die away or at least lose its sharp cutting edges he frowned and concentrated on the board in front of him whos hungry marion said from the top of the ladder thomas heard janets musical laugh pictured her slipping off her headset and stretching cool blue eyes alive with pleasure i feel like i havent eaten for a week she said good enough marion started down the ladder ill see whats in the food locker he saw thomas and stonecypher absorbed in their game cocked his head sideways to get a better look at the board pretty quiet down here whos slaughtering whom well know in a move or two meanwhile hush marion raised a blond eyebrow i hope tom beats your pants off then i think ill take a crack at it the metallurgist tskd no respect for age he studied the board then looked up i am getting a bit itchy almost time to check on the cable marion produced plastic envelopes filled with club sandwiches and hershey bars food stonecypher smiled thomas nodded without looking up from the board the copilot dropped off an envelope apiece and a pouch of cold milk then climbed up the ladder to the flight deck after he was gone thomas made his move stonecypher watched his opponent place the piece and chuckled you dont like him very much do you the small man chewed a hole in his plastic pouch and ripped it open its your move his eyes flickered up to the flight deck he heard marion laugh and the barest trace of a grimace kissed his lips normally i wouldnt worry about you thomas stonecypher said fingers brushing the ivory tip of a knights mane but youre going to indulge an old mans nosiness youre not letting it get to you are you thomass forehead creased in parallel rows why do you ask because you arent thinking youngster he moved his knight mate in three i think thomas savaged a great hunk from his sandwich eyeing the board with his irritation giving way to humor your game he said and your point too ill try to keep a lid on it stonecypher nodded tore open his own package and started to eat he barely nibbled at his meal fatigue syruped his movements making them clumsy making a lie of the lightness in his voice thomas started to speak to give warning but he knew that part of that urge was the wish to give stonecypher a taste of his own medicine unfair the only thing that would relax falling angels elder statesman was an opportunity to do something useful a mental state thomas understood perfectly when stonecypher pushed the remains of his sandwich aside and the plasticware was gathered for the dishwasher thomas unhooked himself from his seat let me stow this he said then we can get some work done the thin face nodded yes its time to check our cargo there was little sound even from footsteps as they moved to the back of the lower deck shuffling carefully down a strip of velcro flooring surrounding them were lockers and a good deal of working space including plugs and attachments and mountings for instrument boards in the rear was mounted the elaborate control board thomas used to monitor and steer the ion drive next to it equally elaborate the flight controls that would guide the cable pod down through earths atmosphere neither was equipped with chairs just handholds and more velcro rug stonecypher glided to the cable pod controls moving his preyingmantis frame with eery grace lets have a look his hands played over the console color video images sprang to life a not very interesting view of anansis tiled belly another of the ion drive haloed in the faint violet glow of its exhaust both relayed from a camera on the pods vertical fin stonecypher must have found the cryptic streams of numbers on other screens more interesting but still he relaxed noticeably the pods riding well he said no vibration no heat buildup good but thomas was watching stonecyphers thickly veined hands noting the tremble he weighed his motivations found them pure dexter youre not well are you stonecypher blew through his lips a sound of disgust when you get to be my age its a rare day when some part or other isnt acting up he turned back to his work a shade too quickly im not talking generally ive been watching you your hands shake you have no appetite your face is drawn were you checked out at falling angel stonecypher looked down from his towering height imperiously or something like it just what are you talking about im asking you if you have any business going down into earths gravity well youll have to take three gees to get out again and im beginning to doubt you can take that safely a gnarled hand rubbed across a forehead that was suddenly damp with perspiration he started to frame a sharper response then sighed in defeat all right all right thomas im not well perhaps i shouldnt make this trip he waved off dc camps attempt to interject a word perhaps i shouldntif all i care about is my own life he ran a hand through thinning white hair trying to find a way to make his friend understand falling angel is my life it used to be space when i was a kid i read heinlein and doc smith and asimov and everything in between i could foresee mankind spreading out through the solar system and into the stars world after world until the stars themselves burn outbut i never thought id see it well were making it happen i wish i could jump a thousand years and see but in this age its falling angel or nothing this cable is our salvation someone needs to be here right here who understands everything about it if that entails a certain degree of risk then so be it i placed myself under risk when i first became involved in the project things were a lot different in those dayswe lost some good men and women we all held a common dream and we bet everything we had on it and some lost but you didnt have to come you could have sent mannering or no no no they are my assistants why are they my assistants because they are not qualified to run the department youve got to learn to delegate some responsibility not with the cable not when it concerns the product i have spent seven years designing and extruding not when it spells the difference between life and death for falling angel no suddenly his voice was whiplash strong this is where i should be i thought that you of all people would understand that but if you dont its irrelevant whether you or anyone else understands doesnt matter at all but falling angel needs you no not if ive done my work properly if all goes well here then falling angel has a new lease on life and the younger people will have their chance to run things mannering is running things now while im gone the dinosaurs me flemingwe wont matter we got it going the rest belongs to you would you have denied me this last chance to do my part thomas shook his head in confusion i just think his words dwindled away yes i just wish you didnt make it sound so final thats all thats my right young man and nobody elses now what do you propose to do about all this it was not instantly obvious that thomas had lost his temper oh i suppose well have to turn around and take you back and start over after we load more cesium and more supplies the conquest of the stars can wait a week and a half no dammit dexter dexter was stunned speechless it was as if his wallet had bitten his fingers no of course we cant turn around its just youre my friend maybe my only friend and i dont have the slightest idea how to keep you from committing suicide its not quite so bad as that the giant said quietly ive merely made a decision that here with my cable is where i belong all right well doctor it looks like youre along for the ride i hope you know what it is about you that scares me the most dexter looked down into the round almost petulant dark face and nodded laying a skeletally thin hand on thomass shoulder to see madness is one thing but to see it and understand it too is a different breed of unicorn were all wild to conquer the stars arent we ive just gone a little further over the line than you at last the smaller man smiled a neutral twitch of the lips that grew warm in the light of dexters calm resolve good dexter said slapping him on the shoulder now if we are finished here shall we rejoin our companions above thomas prodded dexter in the middle of the chest with a stubby forefinger in eight hours youre going to bed stonecypher looked at him you sound just like kelly someone has to do it stonecypher nodded seven course change a day and a half out from falling angel stonecypher was looking better at dinner he volunteered to take their meal trays down to the compactor he started to turn turned too far lost his grip on one of the trays thomas noticed his sharp intake of breath the wideeyed puzzlement the way his face lost color thomas frowned but did nothing he didnt understand even after years in space somehow one expects a heart attack victim to fall over velcro slippers anchored stonecyphers feet but his body swayed like an undersea polyp while his mouth gaped and his fingers massaged his chest then the pressoreceptor reflex a sympathetic reflex triggered by diminished arterial pressure cut in and increased the efficacy of the unaffected heart muscle giving stonecypher respite from the immediate agony janet and thomas reached him almost simultaneously steadying comforting marion was there a moment later feebly he tried to push them away damn it im fine he gasped just need to catch my breath marion was taking his pulse the hell you are i think youre having a heart attack help me thomas the metallurgist was hardly pretending to fight now he needed all of his strength to breathe they towed him headfirst down the ladder and never bumped him once he was still protesting while they hooked him up to the ships diagnostic display damn it dexter marion said nervously waiting for falling angel to respond you of all people just arent allowed to get sick on us the radio came to life three minutes not bad this is fleming at falling angel janet how is he im not dead yet stonecypher opened his eyes better better now janet was studying the diagnostic and stonecypher took a few minutes to breathe before attracting her attention he reached out and found her hand and tried to squeeze it perhaps only then did he fully appreciate how weak he was whats it say the lightspeed gap was a second or so but flemings answer took longer than that fleming wasnt as calm as he tried to sound bilateral cardiac failure triggered by stress and deconditioning of the heart muscle dexter the records show that you havent kept up your aerobic points one of the metallurgists frail hands gestured helplessly ive been busy but dexter fleming caught himself then spoke more softly all right dexter we can talk about it later the main question now is what do we do with you we cant let you go down to earth color came back into dexters face you dont have any choice and its stupid to even consider turning back dexter your life the ailing man cursed shaking with his frustration fleming if you do anything that impedes falling angel dont you dare think youre doing it to help me ill be fine you just get the cable pod into the sea of japan and take anansi down so we can deliver the other tools and this old heart will heal just fine his outburst seemed to drain him and he sank back coughing thomas opened a small package into a silvery strip he pulled it through the elastic lines that webbed his patient then opened it further it was a thin heatreflective blanket thomas spread it out beneath the web tucked it around stonecyphers chin then his legs his thin knobby feet protruded out the far end and thomas cursed under his breath he turned it into a wan smile is there anything about you thats standard stonecypher tried to smile gulping air you have to make allowances for genius thomas tucked the edges in janet saw the tension shaping his round face into planes and angles stonecypher closed his eyes and breathed rhythmically trying to relax thomas took the microphone what are the chances of his condition being aggravated by descent into earths gravity well even if he lived through it suddenly he didnt want to say the words stonecypher looked to be asleep but he knew that within the still body was an active worried mind whispering would make it worse how could he ever leave again a liftoff would kill him for sure hes spent the last eighteen years in low gravity again there was silence on the radio then fleming said i dont see that we have a choice unlesslet me work on something without opening his eyes stonecypher growled you dont have any choice at all lets stop this idle chatter and get on with our work or does anyone but me remember what that word means we know thomas was thinking hard but we do have an option we can deliver the cable pod then take dexter home in anansi marion looked up but janet shook her head thomas anansi doesnt have fuel to reach the moon we can maneuver in orbit marion jumped in with can we use gabriel without docking facilities thomas was nodding shouldnt be a problem thats what an ion drive tug does it pushes a shuttle between the earth and the moon docking facilities hell well just glue the pushpad to anansis belly with the molecular glue in the cargo bay god knows its strong enough flemings radio voice said i thought maybe we could send you another shuttle to take dexter home but its no go haephestus is ready to go but the tugs are tied up pushing lucifer and susanoo lucifer and susanoo were launched from ryukyь five days ago theyre almost back to falling angel itd take a week to send one of them back theres nothing to bring him home except anansi stonecypher inhaled sharply the japanese wont like that screw the japanese theyll have the cable they can wait two weeks for the rest how fast can you get him home thomas closed his eyes relaxing tension turned clenched fists into hands his moon shaped face took on the full moons sad calm his mind was in the country of orbital mechanics now janet envied him this ability only by its absence did she realize the terrible strain he had been under thomas said if we just turn around i could have him home in just over four days were a day and a half out another day and a half to decelerate three more to get back to falling angel stonecypher tried to protest and janet laid a silencing finger against his lips if we make orbit and land the cable pod call it seven days plus its faster coming home without the mass of the cable pod he licked his lips and his breathing quickened as he juggled possibilities i can speed things up a little too give me room he wedged himself past dexter and the others to reach gabriels control board ill start up the fission plant and give us more power in the ion motors were carrying more cesium fuel than we need too because its a test run he was talking rapidly now holding conversation with himself janet watched him with pride excitement and an irritating grain of jealousy dexter stirred we should deliver the entire cargo its what oyama paid for our reputation the radio cut in again it looks like if he doesnt die in four days he wont die in eight either dexter i hate to say it but you either stabilize or you dont and we sure as hell cant have you dying during reentry did you give one seconds thought to the publicity when you pulled this stunt thats not my department dexter laughed raggedly thomas how are you doing ask me again in a couple of hours fleming this is a trial run but ive got the fission plant running in tandem with the solar power cells which gives me more electrical power in the grids that ionize the cesium which lets me increase the cesium flow too that gets us better than half again as much thrust if everything works i can get us to earthorbit eight hours early back to falling angel in seven days one hour not counting the time it takes to land the cable pod and moor anansi and gabriel i know youll do your best dexter if you wanted to be a martyr couldnt you do it at home a faint chuckle bubbled out of stonecyphers throat nope damned kelly always gets in the way had to get away from her he began to cough the racking sounds shaking his thin frame and cutting off his words all right marion keep his heart and vital functions monitored dexter you do nothing but rest for seven days by then well have you in the best hospital in the solar system the only one with pacemakers and free fall too djalma costa awakened quickly as he had learned to do in the past week coming overland from mehrabad he had first felt it the little sourness in the stomach the touch of cool air at the back of the neck the preconscious thrill that warned of danger his hosts treated him well but hoveida especially had eyes which questioned too often the conversation had drifted innocently to stes other business concerns to questions concerning the programming of the missile costa could honestly deny access to technical information he wondered if they believed him and tension had grown the men of the united muslim activist front provided manpower moving the machinery constructing the launch site and the camouflaged bivoac then there were the men sent by bte the actual technicians who would direct the assembly of missile and scaffolding who would send it streaking into the heavens on a grim rendezvous there were twice as many muslims as bte personnel and the primarily brazilian technicians kept to themselves except for djalma from the first hoveida had made sure that the little man was near to hand that he slept nearer the muslims than the brazilians that a bodyguard be with him at all times that the constant small prickle of fear continue to grow so costa awakened in his tent his eyes opened to a slit and he assessed the room there was someone in the tent a shallow stream of light shone under the tent flap and costa could make out an outline hoveida the terrorists voice was very low and calm all is prepared we need to talk costa nodded in the dark ill be with you in a moment the head a dull oval in the dim light inclined in agreement the tall man left the tent costa pulled himself upright and realized that he was shaking damn he whispered rubbing thin shoulders why did hoveida have to have the same impact on him every time his body was misted with cold sweat and once again it seemed that the room temperature had dropped get hold of yourself he told himself softly pulling on pants and shoes todays the day that thought seemed to banish the fears soon he would be through with this phase of the project and on to a more familiar and rewarding phase he emerged from his tent a moment later the sun was still an orange ball on the horizon and had not yet cut the chill from the air he looked out across the flat packed sand of the iranian central plateau past the clusters of brown and dull green tents and huts to the towering shape of the prometheus missile held in the skeletal embrace of its scaffolding bathed in the warm light of the morning sun it seemed a thing of beauty not destruction and for a moment all seemed right with the world then he remembered his place and purpose he hurried to the main hut hoveida and mansur were there dressed in brown fatigues mansur was scribbling notes on the last sheet of a stack in front of him he folded the rest of the sheets back down and squared the pile and shoved it toward the center of the green metal table this project is somewhat different from those i have been involved with in the past again it was difficult to decipher his words so thick was his accent but the basic idea is the same we wish to relay an explosive charge to a vulnerable area it matters little if the courier is a truck the postal service a child on a bicycle or he gestured in the direction of the prometheus a guided missilл he drummed his fingers on the table then looked at costa there are many things that i do not understand about the guidance system of your rocket there has been little time for exchange of ideas between my team and yours at times i have wondered if this was deliberate his eyes flared and djalma felt the impact of his suspicion then the eyes were hooded again and mansur went on however if your people have performed in all respects as i know mine have then we are totally prepared we are monitoring the conversations between falling angel and oyama construction so we will know when anansi has moved into orbit if i understand the procedure correctly anansi will send the cable on ahead monitoring its entry path they are planning for splashdown in the sea of japan it will be simple for us to monitor their position for the first time the ghost of a smile played on mansurs face a touch of pride in craft when this day is done it will have opened a new era this is history hoveida grunted but his lips were curled in a smile your people will be ready by sunset we expect anansi to establish orbit at that time and then now the smile was savage predatory so that mansur laughed aloud then the bird will fly costa waited the laughter out and by that time the men will be ready to disperse of course and the announcement of the attack will be made from mehrabad hoveidas long fingers played through his beard there was real pleasure in that angular face now the world will learn of our power then with a touch of mischief but not of our friends good good djalma looked at his watch there is much to be done if you will excuse me he turned to the door he had reached it and was halfway through when he heard hoveidas voice softer than usual mr costa your money has paid for this he waved his hand vaguely all of this and it has not been cheap i hope that you enjoy the show the small man nodded smiled briefly and left the hut the sun was higher in the sky brighter hotter it would be hotter still before the day was done but everything was moving on schedule jorge xavier had not slept for two nights again he lay alone in his bed sleeping blinders snugly fitted to his eyes two tranquilizer pills dissolving in his stomach and his wideawake mind played with details extrapolating and inverting logical constructs and examining minutiae with fanatic thoroughness something was wrong some factor had changed and was as yet unaccounted for information with precise accurate information adjustments could be made disaster averted errors rectified but something had been lost he could feel it it kept him awake and staring into the blackness of his night turning the known over and over in a fruitless search for the unknown he ran a hand through his hair feeling the cold sticky perspiration that clogged his scalp in a few hours when the final phase of the project came into play brazil techimetal electromotores president castellon would certainly learn of xaviers plotting and the final power play would begin if he was as intelligent as xavier thought castellon would wait to learn the outcome of xaviers gamble if it was successful he would not bring the law into the matter that would destroy btes salvage claim to the cable he would surely wait and attempt to ease xavier out of the company before the younger man could challenge his leadership xavier was prepared to fight that prepared to prove to the stockholders that it was his own decisive action that had saved the company from castellons craven timidity xavier smiled at that thought he welcomed an open battle for power but if the plan failed failed how a fresh wave of nausea and fatigue flushed his system sweat beading his forehead how i know people i know where they will go if prodded here tempted there threatened rewarded my own people castellon the arab fanatics the japanese though they will do nothing at all for what can they do like the men of space there it was the men of space were not like the men he knew it wasnt his country this factory complex falling around and aroundthe moon with death waiting outside every wall xavier knew how to move people but these people he did not know what they could do was nothing he had seen to that the telephone buzzed and xavier rolled over to push the intercom button all in one galvanic spasm yes da silva the financiers voice was low urgent and xavier propped himself nearer the speaker tearing away his blinders faint light streamed in through his apartment window the distant blinking of a neon billboard we have received a message from yamada all fatigue fell away from xavier continue he is aboard the oyama flagship in the sea of japan as you know two days ago they received word that dr dexter stonecypher the metallurgist who developed the cable has fallen ill xavier felt a momentary fury at being wakened for such trivia then the thought clicked into place hes aboard the shuttle isnt he yes anansi has made plans to get back to falling angel as soon as possible they will be making orbit and dropping the package approximately eight hours early eight he sat bolt upright have you alerted costa yet the prometheusit must be launched early have you of course xavier da silva protested but the time lag why he screamed how did this happen oyama is being very cautious and maintaining radio silence it took two days for yamada to put a cipher message through to his mistress who relayed it to us two days eight hours im coming in xavier said rolling off the bed and finding his slippers in the dark patch any new information through to me as soon as it arrives yes sir xavier paused for a moment at his window opened his blinds to look out over the nightdark jeweled city so trouble he did not doubt or question the instinct that had warned him as it had warned him so many times before such he felt sure were the faculties of superior men of warriors winners he pulled the blinds closed and drew on a robe there was nothing to do but act now driving all uncertainties from his mind with an iron will that too was the mark of a superior man thomas stood on a broad icy plain its horizon shrouded in mist there were no mountains no distinct clouds no sound he looked for landmarks there were none he walked and never moved the horizon receding perfectly evenly until it seemed he was merely strolling in place the ice stealing his traction he knew that there was a reason for him to be there it would reveal itself if he could only think about it long enough slowly with infinite patience the patience of the hunter in his blood he sat upon the ice and waited there was a sound he looked up into the whitehazed sky and saw a streak of greater light arcing down from the heavens cleaving the mists boiling away the vapor and leaving clear blue sky behind it was coming directly at him new but he merely saw and watched even as his instinct screamed for him to run why run i cannot move it was closer now and the closer it came the slower it seemed to move a fireball that wailed its unliving pain as it fell it struck the ice directly in front of him and before it struck he could almost see what it was it wasnt lifeless at all it seemed to be a face or faces and the more he strained to see the features behind the flame the more it blurred the ice shattered in slowmotion steam and flame and screams of agony melding together janet was touching his shoulder her face beautiful and pale very close to his her fingers touched his forehead and came away wet you were dreaming she said he blinked looked around the room carefully the lockers the kitchenette dexter hanging suspended in his blanket like a bat sleeping with furled wings he unbuckled his web with a shaking hand pushed himself away from it in three seconds the uncertainty and fear were gone from his face wiped away like numbers from a slate nightmare he said his voice already calm he floated over to dexter the metallurgist wore a pressure suit helmet now in ieu of an oxygen mask his breathing sounded ragged and hollow in the three days since the heart attack they had watched the monitors edge from serious to moderate and back again he watched the movement of the chart lines his stomach heavy and hot again janets hand grasped his shoulder tommy are you all right i was alone he said quietly almost as if he were speaking to the machine i knew there was something wrong but there was nothing i could do all i could do was wait he turned and looked at her looked past her to dexter cocooned in silver something bad was coming janet and when it came it screamed and burned he glanced back at the readouts then at the digital clock over the microwave range and all i could do was watch and wait he tried to smile im all right just a little tense i guess three hours to orbit he turned up the wattage on his smile and it came alive at last even if gabriel glitched on us now we could still get the cable pod down the program would be hairier thats all whos going to eva with me you or marion marion ill stay with the shuttle deploying the cable pod is no big deal you know and we dont have to do anything else till its down in the sea of japan she took his hands and the gentleness there almost frightened him some proud child in his mind saying im not a basket case keep your sympathy but he didnt pull away this hasnt been good tommy she said i had hoped that this time together might be she shook her head trying to find the words well if not healing at least soothing pleasant you know the two of us doing something important together we are you know what im saying this trip is really the end for us and and i hoped that her voice tailed off i dont know i guess i wish it hadnt been quite like this he watched her his dark mongol face changing not at all as he tried to choose among the thoughts that swirled competitively in his head it was good for us for awhile janet thats more than a lot of people have he squeezed her hands fondly hell its more than i ever expected anyway you didnt really expect a second honeymoon here where would we get the privacy she laughed not humor just nerves he leaned forward and kissed her mouth gently refusing the invitation of her parted lips he pulled his hand free and stood ive got work to do he said without a trace of cruelty she nodded and started up the ladder to the command level turning to watch him working at his console she knew that she had already vanished from his world replaced by the unliving and intangible she didnt couldnt begrudge him that ability if anything it was the basis of much of her respect for him if not her love the sight of stonecypher touched off a sudden pang thomas was grieving more for the loss of that old man than for the loss of their marriage she allowed herself the luxury of hating herself for that impulse it was a small thought an unworthy one but it was real perhaps he was right it was too late to say anything they would act out the rest of their roles and take their bows still she felt old tired and the strain of the past three days hammered at the gates of her control she shouted it down not now not for another week but when this was all over she knew that she was going to find someone to curl up with and find peace no she would find a place to be by herself and she would find her own peace she glided up the ladder feeling not heavy but massive her mind and spirit swollen almost beyond tolerance the earth was flowing beneath them now fingerpaint clouds swirled in fluffy spirals on a blueonblue worldscape sunglare blazing off the deep blue patch of the mediterranean thomas talked to himself out loud keeping them posted ive got the nuclear pile damped thrust dropping turning the solar panels got them edgewise now going to batteries velocity seven point one two two kps seven one zero zero and im cutting the cesium flow thrust is zero were in orbit youre in charge good janet called from the flight deck marion make the call there was satisfaction in marions voice oyama this is anansi anansi to oyama we are in orbit at seven point one zero zero kilometers per second altitude one four seven oh kilometers well be deploying the cable pod immediately the voice that came back was dry and cultured and relayed from the sea of japan by satellite oyama flagship one we are tracking our present position is approximately two hundred miles southwest of akita anticipate splashdown in two hours ten minutes at eleven hundred sixteen hours tokyo time falling angel has kept us well abreast of your progress most eager to receive package youre aware that anansi will not be going down we were informed please convey our sympathies to dr stonecypher will do well keep the line open a smile the first warm one in days was spreading across janets face home stretch marion guiness watched an ugly smear of white a frosty fingerprint of cloud inching toward them on the great blue disk he grunted eyes narrowed a fraction anticyclonic cloudsoff portugal there janet studied it for a second looks nasty dont think it will affect our drop much but we better make sure thats programmed into the weather model thats ground controls job ill mention it though thomass head poked up through the ladder well how long do i have to suit up just as soon as i do this one button on marions keyboard was surrounded by a tiny metal cage he flipped it back and pressed anansi shuddered what was that thomas laughed i just cut us loose from the cable pod its the same key that blows away the main tank supports during a launch thats why its in that little cage you dont want to jog it with your elbow he was tapping at the keyboard as he spoke and anansi continued to shudder the cargo bay doors opened quite evenly marion held attitude jet keys down and the view through the windows swung smoothly earth then stars then the cable pod and ion drive still linked off to their right ill just bring us up close enough that we can use tethers marion said we can go out through the cargo bay the cable pod and ion drive drifted past then halted at another touch of the keys now lets get dressed janet take over i relieve you luck thomas guided himself over to the lockers he pulled his pressure suit out on its rack and plugged it in for a computer diagnostic while that was going on he gave it a careful visual inspection satisfied de camp unzipped the front and backed in there were zippers everywhere and it took a limber man to get them all closed then it hugged him like a sausage skin he pulled the fishbowl helmet over his head and clamped it down marion was still suiting up de camp waited until his partners helmet was on then switched on his microphone how you doing raise your volume a little now fine marion turned to the airlock using the magnets on his boots he cycled through the airlock into the cargo bay thomas spared a glance at the sleeping stonecypher have to keep him calm somehow once he realised that theyd let him sleep through this its going to be fine he said silently youll see he waited until the warning light turned green then followed the sound of the pump died to silence he stepped into the cargo bay it was packed with sealed and bundled packages of all sizes headed for oyama constructioneventually they would have to wait until the next trip marion was strapping himself into one of the chairshaped mobility packs and thomas was right behind him he checked the packs circuits then spared a glance up out of the bay the earth hung there a dark swollen disk filling the sky ready go in tandem silently the two men arced up and around until they cleared the wings the ion drive cable pod combination hung close alongside everything looked fine thomas ran through his mental checklist anything wrong ten limpet motors mounted in place undisturbed no obvious meteor pocks and what else could go wrong the cable pod had been inert cargo till now okay detach the mating rings separate the cable pod from the ion drive then back to the ship check the cameras and other instruments and send it on down the nightshrouded earth formed a velvetblack backdrop here and there cities glowed tiny sparks of lightning showed in the storm off portugal ready give me a moment marion said happily i never could resist a sunrise the sun flared into view a sudden white crescent glowed along the earths eastern rim a tiny brightness showed above iran floated into the daylit area and was gone moving out thomas said he jumped at the black earth his safety tether trailed back from him in loops thomas did you see anything out there i thought i caught a flare of some kind lets get the job done daydreamer where high in the atmosphere janet did you see it no thomas whistled low in irritation all right ill take a look he had almost reached the mating rings where the ion drive joined the cable pod now his backpack jets flared and he veered away behind gabriel okay where marion sounded almost petulant it was there i saw it thomas closed his eyes and counted to five right now can we get on with the the mating rings exploded searing his vision white as the world turned to fire and pain eight damage report his head snapped away reflexively not quickly enough to miss it before thomas polarizer cut in a terrifying image was burned into his retinae light arcing coiling around the cable pod like sentient lightning something that felt like a wall of water smashed into his chest the cable pod dropped below his line of sight still spitting fire then anansi off to the side seemed to explode in flame hissing static filled his helmet painfully loud after the first moment of shock he regained control of his voice marion do you copy repeating space had turned foggy around him anansis outline blurred and dimmed to dark blue by the visor whirled past his field of vision there were flamecolors in the fog around anansi red and blue and yellow dimming as they ballooned outward pretty he thought flame in vacuum hed seen rocket exhausts but never anything like this im tumbling his fingers tapped at controls on his chest and hot gasses jetted from his mobility unit he didnt need his brain for this he could have stopped a tumble in his sleep marion do you copy there was a spitting sound and a stresstautened voice rang through the static tommy this is anansi janets voice gained control even as he listened good girl bad trouble here something gave us a hell of a wallop there was a string of words obscured by hissing and anansi passed his field of vision again ive lost some external sensorsdont think cabin integrity has been compromised hed killed the tumble janet paused then spoke again tommy relaying message from marion there was a click and thomas could hear guiness breathing heavy in his ear thomas here marion about a hundred meters off anansi it looks pretty bad the fog was thinning dispersing in vacuum the firecolors gone the explosion had separated the cable pod from gabriel reentry shielding had peeled up around the tail of the cable pod and a cloud of white mist surrounded the ion drive and the solar panels the ion drives the worst the solar panels are shredded and i think the cesium tank must have been ripped open the cable pod are you all right de camp gritted his teeth im all right just shaken up and his ears popped horrified he listened for a hissing sound and heard it damn his voice went icy calm freezing in an instant i think i have a leak here his visor had cleared and he checked himself over the rip was two inches above his knee it was small and the edges were bubbling as the silicone selfseal frothed into action minorclass one maybe suit is sealing but im going to put a patch on it where are you thomas took one of the flat flexible repair patches from his side pouch the accustomed clumsiness of his gloves frightened him now with the wound in his suit bubbling air he bit into his lip and forced his fingers to obey peeling off the protective backing and smoothing the patch into place i have visual contact with you thomas were about equidistant from the cable pod but im further astern my suittosuit is out thats why it took me a second to reroute through janet i think my mobility unit took a hit shrapnel i guess im tumbling what the hell happened the hissing sound had stopped thomas scanned anansi she was spinning around a skew axis no obvious damage to the belly none to the nose she turned and thomas heart sank at what had happened to the shuttles tail the aft reaction control system pod on the left was ripped open and half melted the fuel and oxydizer tanks must have ripped and exploded that was the fireball the rcs pod on the right looked undamaged the vertical fin blackened by fire janet said im trying to stop anansis spin but i dont get anything from either of the aft rcs systems trying the forward module ah it looked like steam venting from anansis nose im killing our spin the cable pod was worse hit the fins were twisted ruined the heatshielding had peeled upward in shards what about the precious cable itself he couldnt tell fragments were still spinning in all directions and everything still looked foggy with gasses and bits of metal he finally picked out marions tiny form looking much like a man strapped into a metal chair a crippled man thomas thought he aimed himself toward marion and used the mobility unit thrusters his course took him past the cable pod and gabriel slowly drifting apart he was able to spot more damage the mating rings were still mated still part of the cable pod but splayed and melted as if they had been packed with thermite most of the limpet motors had been blown into the sky a couple still clung in skewed positions some of the silica heatshield bricks on the rear underside of the shuttle had been torn free he was running out of safety tether marions must have been severed the copilot was even now floating further and further from anansi thomas hurriedly unhooked his own line before it could snap taut and continued after him what in hell happened he remembered marions words a flare of some kind high in the atmosphere and cursed himself for his disbelief guiness was a competent trained observer and thomas made a mental note never to let personal feelings twist his judgement again marion was still tumbling thomas watched his distance closing and used mobility unit jets to slow himself a bit hang in there marion havent got a lot of choice i cant get a good look at anansi how is she janets voice cut in ive lost my rear attitude jets have to use the front primary and vernier thrusters but its slow andoh my god her voice had gone from cold to frightened and the sudden loss of clarity sent a knife point of anxiety into thomas gut he could feel beads of sweat blossoming on his face ahead within the metalvapor mist was marion turning helplessly i just got a warning from dexters life support his blood pressures dropping i think hes going into cardiogenic shock the sweat droplets itched and thomas shook his head reflexively the globules scattered spattering into his faceplate and breaking into spray a droplet hit his eye burning the suit responded to increased heat a cool breeze blew up from his chin his hearts giving out yes dammit and i cant leave the controls get marion in as soon as you can he can see to dexter while you check out the exterior damage thomas gritted his teeth and adjusted his course slightly preparing to move alongside marion the copilot was dollsized now a silverwhite figure spinning slowly against a vast darkness edged with a thick crescent of white cloud and blue water did you hear that marion god yes id like to think theres something i can do but i dont know everythings happening at once just hold on thomas snatched at marions hand as he spun past he caught the back of marions wrist then lost his grip that left thomas himself rotating he used jets to kill the rotation and got back to marion who had shed some spin again thomas caught his passing arm held on against the recoil felt marions hand close on his wrist they jerked and spun thomas used the gas jets until they were both facing back toward anansi man marion said as he righted himself am i glad to see you i hope you have your triplea paid up were a long way from the nearest tow station take a check thomas hugged marion from the back to balance them and headed back toward the crippled shuttle his eyes picked up the ruined aft section of the cable pod and he snarled they needed dexter stonecypher marion heard the hiss of returning atmosphere in the lock and his mind raced in a dozen directions at once damage how much damage and where the cable pod was a ruin it couldnt leave orbit and most of the limpet motors were gone too the ion drive have to see but with the cesium fuel tank ripped apart gabriel was surely unuseable anansi both aft rcs pods damaged and what else the vertical fin could anansi move at all we could be marooned the ready light blinked green and he swung the inner door open thoughts of material problems disappeared as he saw dexter anchored by blanket and electronic sensors the metallurgist was in pain shuddering gasping for breath and although he faced the opening door his eyes didnt focus marion doffed his helmet and pulled himself over to his patient he checked the life support readout and swore with desperate speed he flipped the intercom to on and barked up to janet marion here how long have dexters signs been running crazy check the computer im still evening out the spin she didnt say im busy damn you but he heard it in her voice he danced his fingers over the controls the diagnostic readout board cleared then began to display marion said something foul dexter groaned eyes focusing at last on marion whos there he asked weakly the copilot watched the red and green graphics as the computer fed stonecypher cardiotonic drugs mechanically seeking to stave off irreversible shock dexters voice pitiable in its weakness tore at him whos there the elder scientists thin hand stretched out grasping at air and brushed marions shoulder cynthia marion heard pain and loneliness and need he kept his face turned away watching the flickering lights and sliding graphics that measured out the remaining moments of stonecyphers life the hand on his shoulder tugged again weakly and the copilot grasped it gently and turned back stonecyphers eyes were glazed his face wracked with strain he labored for every breath sweat standing out from his forehead in jeweled beads his body shook and the droplets spun off into the air drifting as slowly as tiny soap bubbles cynthia oh god it hurts its marion doc he wiped stonecyphers forehead youre on board anansi the older mans eyes focused and just for an instant he was there really there in the shuttle a man who was weak and pale but lucid anansi what happened he grew more intense there was an explosion is the cable all right is he gasped for air groaning as if his chest were bound tight with chains yes marion lied remembering the blackened ruptured cable pod after all the cable itself might be undamaged though they wouldnt be sure until thomas finished his report everythings fine you just relax yes his eyes drifted shut even as his body shivered in pain i thought i thought that cynthia was here but of course she wouldnt be his voice was becoming slurred tell her tell her and the grandchildren one eyelid opened again and the eye looked filmy its light dimmed never saw them only pictures never went back cynthy only daughter youd think and the eye shut again stonecyphers hand had gone limp horribly so marion checked the blood pressure reading sixty over forty he murmured and felt the snarl distort his face he felt so helpless the diagnostic display read poss ventricular tacycardia and as the metallurgists body relaxed with dreadful finality marion felt his sight blur he fumbled for a tissue crying was a mistake in free fall the tear built up into a single salty globule over the eye stonecyphers body anchored by its sensors and tubes and safety strap remained upright after the display buzzed dully and flashed red after there was no more movement and no more pain falling angel this is anansi janet was steady now as steady as the ship itself the attitude jets in the nose had finally slowed the spin and earths disk no longer whirled crazily past their windows we read you anansi request preliminary status report in cold precise words janet recited the litany of torn metal and flesh that screamed to her from the dials and cathode ray displays she repeated what thomas had seen on his preliminary inspection when she was finished she ran her fingers through her hair and calmed herself feeling shakier than she cared to admit there was the sound of cloth rustling against metal and she heard marion sigh from the corner of her eye she saw the medical readout flashing red and her head dropped marion laid a slender hand on her shoulder she saw his reflection faint in the front window as he shook his head in grim negation he moved stiffly to his seat and immersed himself in the silent testimony of the readouts crew status janet said her voice rough and too low she cleared her throat and the words became crisp and professional crew status pilot de camp and copilot guiness are unharmed ion tech de camp took a class one suit breech was able to affect repair he escorted guiness to the lock and is returning to the cable pod for full inspection was he injured not enough to stop him from going back out she paused switching mental tracks from her concern for her husband metallurgist stonecypher experienced terminal heart failure apparently due to stress caused by the explosion the next voice on the line was fleming himself and he spoke with emotionless precision can you describe the nature of the explosion marion leaned forward to the microphone i saw it but im not sure i can describe it for you there was a flash high in the atmosphere a few seconds before we were hit tentative hypothesis missile attack of some sort never seen anything like that impact though can you clarify the missile never came near us he squinted even the memory taxing his ability to communicate nothing like this had ever happened it was a bright flash but tens of kilometers below us maybe there was another missile but well no dammit it wasnt enough a missile the size of the one we saw would have blown us all to gas what hurt us was an explosion between the ion drive and the cable pod it looked a little like napalm or ball lightning no he squeezed his eyes shut trying to remember clearly the explosion seemed to crawl along the joining spreading like the threads of a spiderweb and it ripped up everything in its path this was deliberate and precise and damned sophisticated no missile could have done it a mine maybe in the mating rings themselves janet watched the tension turn his face ugly and knew that she wasnt the only one battling to retain equilibrium there was nothing more for her to do up top but she had a crawling hunger to do something anything useful relieve me she asked marion nodded what now we have work to do and we wont be able to do it with dr stonecyphers body down there im going to i dont know put him in his suit i guess then take him into the bay she knew what he was about to ask and touched his hand no i can take care of this myself i need you up here be careful marion and let me know if anything changes nine the good neighbor policy fleming sat deadly silent as the computeranimated anansi went through her holographic paces the damage to shuttle and cargo pod was outlined in red the ion drive was swathed in it connors was there in the darkened room like de camp he was an ion drive technician and operator though he claimed other skills too he was a smallish beach ball of a man who kept to the low and nullgray sections of falling angel as much as possible he was watching the cable pod burn aerodynamics altered drastically the grey oval began to glow soon after it reached the upper atmosphere he watched as the foamed ceramic peeled off in blazing droplets then chunks the ruined fins had no hope of stabilizing its descent and when the drogue chute finally popped free it was in tatters within seconds a pitiful white streamer spattered with flaming ceramic and metal it impacted somewhere in the pacific the lights came up in the room and fleming spoke quietly thank you kelly join us please on my way there was a brittle note in kellys voice as if she were biting down hard on the words he swivelled in his chair fingers steepled peering over them at connors accurate only too theres no way in the world were going to get that pod down without repair and thats a chancy job the patching material is going to change either mass or configuration he thought for a moment well have to check the possibility of pushing stonecyphers foam projector out to them any ideas one big one susanoo will be in in an hour and that givesus an ion drive tug michael youll have to take michael down to bring anansi home any reason you cant push the foam factory down at the same time ill tell strickland i want a crew putting that package together quick the door shushed and kelly was there clothes thrown on roughly and hair unkempt she seemed to be moving by nervous energy alone stonecyphers death was hitting her hard fleming had considered taking her off duty giving her time to grieve but kelly was in this it was her fight too and her right to see it won or lost and she was needed he said get me a line to oyama kelly theres something coming in on their frequency now doctor she strode past him to her console switched the transmission into the room the bob cameras in the ceiling focused on fleming patches of light formed and congealed the japanese was a stranger dressed in a dark europeanstyle business suit he jerked out of his thoughtful dreaming pose when falling angels image reached him mr fleming i am izumi and i speak for oyama construction yes mr izumi we are receiving you clearly good but izumi looked grim approximately eight minutes ago the following transmission was broadcast world wide from one of the commercial satellites the point of origin seems to have been iran hold please the air fuzzed for a few seconds then a womans face appeared she was definitely middleeastern and her hair was pulled back severely the transmission seemed shaky taped under bad conditions conners muttered nations of the world her english was thick and studied we the united muslim activist front have struck a great blow for freedom today we have proven that there is nowhere on earth here she paused for dramatic effect nor in the sky where the cowardly lackies of capitalism can hide from the wrath of the people today using a surfacetoorbit missile of highly advanced capabilities we attacked and destroyed the space shuttle anansi we grieve for the loss of lives this tragedy was made necessary by the limitless greed of the capitalist nations to warn them that they will not despoil the earth and leave us a bitter husk we will fight for our lands and we will fight for our skies she raised a khakiclad arm making a tight fist long live the revolution she faded from the screen a prometheus connors asked incredulously more likely the soviet version fleming fell silent watching the projection point the air fogged again and retsudo oyama appeared he seemed grimly alert though there was a pink puffiness to his eyes what was it five in the morning down there he said i hardly need to tell you of my concern mr fleming i need to know how accurate are the claims of the umaf there has been damage to anansi but she hasnt been destroyed we lost one of the crew dr stonecypher the mind responsible for the cable retsudos forehead furrowed i am very sorry he was a great man i hope he paused trying to phrase his words delicately i hope his final work was not destroyed preliminary reports indicate that the cable pod was damaged one of the crew thomas de camp is investigating more closely now we hope to have a favorable report within the hour the younger oyamas head bobbed fractionally as to the nature of the attack yes as an industrial nation dependent upon foreign resources for our raw materials japan has suffered its share of terrorism we have had brushes with the umaf before never have they displayed the technical skill necessary to accomplish this feat fleming glanced at kelly and conners yes but we cant say that they actually accomplished it can we i see retsudo answered slowly that i must make my meaning clearer although they have used sophisticated explosive devices in the past i am suggesting that a sudden leap into the space age must be viewed with suspicion we are viewing it with suspicion yes kelly recognised flemings expression should i tell oyama about guinesss suspicions he changed the subject under the circumstances it would seem impossible to meet our deadline although i think i can guarantee safe delivery of the cable i hope that this problem will not escalate beyond negotiability as i said before mr fleming we understand terrorists there are two things to remember in dealing with them first we must never acceede to their demands second those of us who abhor their actions must beprepared to stand together against them i know that i speak for my father when i say that oyama construction will be willing to make reasonable trade for time and money lost thank you fleming said desperately wishing he could reach out and shake this mans hand he understands by god thank you so very much retsudo unless there is something else we have work to do there was nothing else and the japanese signed off his image evaporating in snow flemings mouth set in a grim line conners if there is any chance that that explosion didnt originate on earth he didnt need to finish the sentence kelly broke a chilly silence doctor if it was a bomb a mine then surely whoever set it would have left with the rest of the earthbound fleming didnt look up yes we might hope so theres no way to be sure not until we check out everyone who had access to anansi during its drydock unfortunately that could be almost anyone thomas nudged the left toggle on his mobility pack and came in for a closer look at the cable package the tail was half in black shadow half in blazing sunlight the outer shell of foamed lunar stone manmade pumice had cracked and splintered isolating the twisted fins and their attached motors thomas caught glimpses of the inner envelope in curves of blackened steel it looked unreal surrealistic sculpture thomas im moving in now contact in about ten seconds we have you thomas hows the leg the seal is fine hurts though i think theres shrapnel buried in there as long as it hurts im not worried if it starts getting numb im coming straight back in make that a promise be careful there may be another surprise out there thomas looked back at anansi all highlight and shadow as it hung some four hundred meters away booby trap he considered it might have been a missile whatever it was believe me im not playing hero he played the jets as the cable pod approached his legs took the last few pounds of recoil and he hovered a few centimeters from the pod he shone a handlight into the wound ripped right down to the inner package but for the first time in an hour a grin broke across his face ill be damned if it doesnt look secure are you sure ill be surer in a minute but i really think the cables intact thank goodness i marion broke off when he came back oh all the pleasure in his voice had been leeched out thomas im picking up something on the radar two blips rising through the atmosphere above south america ahead of us hold on im getting janet up here another pause while thomas pivoted his mobility pack found south america and searched the clouds do you have visual contact another missile we cant take another hit i dont have anything yet he drifted away from the cable pod he strained his eyes the pain in his leg becoming a thundering heartbeat i see something two dots janet was back on the line im here tommy theres two of them they seem to be matching course with us what can you see at last he could make something out two pointsof light became finned wedges not missiles even at that distance there was no mistaking that shape weve got shuttles here people marion laughed nervously the cavalry arrives janet cut in totally unamused wait a minute who in the world had time to put together a rescue mission open hailing frequencies marion lets see just what we have here thomas watched the ships approach a tickle of unease growing into a snarled ball of worms in his stomach he could hear his breathing whistle harshly in his helmet he tried to relax it was pointless to speculate until janet and marion could talk to the shuttles this is the space shuttle anansi calling unidentified shuttles please acknowledge marion sat back in his seat and watched the speaker no answer janet watched the radar image on the cathode ray display wishing that they had visual contact well there are any number of possible reasons set our receiver to search the bandsthey might be using an odd frequency he nodded complying about three kilometers now the speaker came to life with a crackle of sound the voice it carried was american anansi this is the shuttle brasilia do you copy over we copy brasilia whats your business the man on the other end laughed easily were playing good neighbor heard about your trouble and came running marion started to speak but janet raised a finger of warning and switched on her own headset this is captain de camp of anansi we appreciate the thought we can use a push all right you people are very efficient i assume that you put the mission together from scratch in say three hours it was difficult to keep the sarcasm from her voice but she thought shed managed it maybe not the american laughed less easily this time not from scratch we were preparing for test runs in just under twentyfour hours when we heard about your problem we had an opportunity to test our emergency procedures they worked it was worth it just to find out marion shook his head made a thumbs down sign janet snorted silently but said ill buy that who am i speaking to and why are there two shuttles ones enough to tote us down brasilia was silent for about fifteen seconds marion said theyre about two kilometers away now one of them is slowing to a crawl this is captain burgess speaking we were set for a double launch when the news came in the other ship is willy ley nobody aboard speaks english who sponsored the launch there was another pause the brazilian government owns both shuttles marion said it softly thats not an answer janet asked why werent we notified that you were coming we tried to reach you couldnt get an answer we assumed that your radio was damaged is that the case that is possible all right brasilia whats your plan depends on your situation can you reenter she couldnt avoid a question so simple and so urgent no we cant move both of the aft reaction control system pods are torn to hell well as soon as it can be arranged wed like to take you aboard and our cargo another pause we may be able to move your baggage into brasilias cargo bay burgess tones were soothing youve sustained damage and it would probably be healthy to come with us wasnt there a nuclear plant aboard that ion drive falling angel can send a repair crew later janet sat back from the board frowning well have to think it over dont take too long after all you cant reenter and you cant return to falling angel were just trying to help i saidwell think about it she turned the radio off she said salvage maybe burgess ever hear of him marion watched the radar blips creeping toward them the name rings a bell but i cant be sure nasa i think and renting out to brazil now you know something that stinks one of the dots was at rest near the cable pod the other drifted toward anansi the runnerup in the cable bidding was brazilian i think wed better assume that our captain burgess is in the employ of brazil techimetalelectromotores they want the cable janet popped open a squeeze bottle of water and took a swallows worth she squinted at the radar screen tommy she opened the shiptosuit band and started to speak marion touched the base of her neck caressingly and put his lips to her ear be careful theyll pick up our transmission janet combed her yellow hair with her fingers fighting lightheadedness distraction was the last thing she needed damned stupid stud she hadnt been laid in days and marion hadnt either and from the look of him now concerned alert ready to back her upthe thought had never crossed his mind perhaps it hadnt the caress could have been habit janet thought cool thoughts when she was ready she said tommy this is anansi how is everything out there pause then a hiss of radio contact just fine ive got company about a hundred meters away just sitting there i feel very protected whats the word well it looks like were out of the woods all we have to do is hitch a ride and go home please tommy that sounds pretty good im getting lonely out here well want to make a pretty thorough damage report before we leave and well have to check out procedure with falling angel could take a few hours though so wed better get on with it oh by the way his voice took on a deceptively casual tone the ship here with me is brasilia the one heading toward you is willy ley didnt the brazilian government buy that one about five years ago go to the front of your class our friends are from brazil well as long as they dont want to play piсata with anansi i guess well be all right i think ill stay here and check the cable pod awhile longer if you dont mind hows your air fine i switched bottles when i brought marion in by the way falling angel and our japanese friends both have a legitimate interest in any decisions made out here lets tie them into the communications link janet pressed her mike a little closer to her mouth smiling i like that idea you hang on out there theres an answer to this lets define the questions first call me when you have something and he clicked off janet resisted the image of thomas tiny against the hulk of the cable pod sandwiched between it and the shuttle brasilia so vulnerable marion sensed her mood and laughed aloud play piсata with anansi was that thomas saying that were all going to get a little crazy before this is over tommy listen she said forcing her mind back into an analytical set weve got two brazilian shuttles appearing impossibly fast on the radar screen willey ley had nearly drawn abreast of anansi they only need one to take us down marion said the other must be for the cable they can moor to the cable and claim salvage might even have equipment to repair the heat shielding his boyish face darkened thats assuming they knew just what kind of damage to expect the black underbelly of willy ley was pulling into their field of vision janet watched it speculatively they killed dexter one ship only one ship is doing all the talking the other one is hanging over our heads ready for action if things go wrong jane back there she jerked an impatient thumb in the direction of the cable pod and brasiliais going to be all sweetness and light until they realize how much weve figured out then tarzan swings in and takes the bananas janet laughed suddenly burgess is cute she caught marion staring and said not cute that way i meant that offer to take whats in the cargo bay down for us its all stuff for handling the cable so the tools go down to brazil while willy ley claims the cable then bte offers to buy the tools too cute marion said without a smile willy ley had halted hanging suspended above them a silent reminder of their helplessness weve got to get out of here theres no way in the world that we can let them get away with this kind of piracy we cant go anywhere no rocket motors janet pounded her fists against the console hard once only never mind if theres a way ill find it well find it ten drawing the line tommy do you read me the sound fought its way through a cloud of pain a rhythmic pulsing that swirled up thomas leg and into his chest he jumped when he heard the voice must have dozed off in panic he checked his air gauges no problem it was just too warm too quiet and with his faceplate fully polarized too dark sleep was a natural path for a body in pain to take he looked up saw willy ley blotting out the stars like a great dark scavenger its belly armored with heatshield scales im here his breath whistled in his ears my friend is here too he rotated his suit to face anansi she seemed close enough to reach out and touch a toy floating at arms length id really like to come home hows the leg it still hurts so its okay i guess the patch on his knee was secure but it was too easy to picture torn flesh under it and he winced away from the image janet sounded relieved good listen were thinking about the ride home weve been offered no janet listen she interrupted him urgently no thomas you listen we have to remember what dr anansi always said you have to know where to draw the line dr anansi what the hell was she talking about so check over the pod once more then come on back no argumentsi hope i dont have to make myself any clearer thomas thought furiously she was afraid the bandits might eavesdrop reasonable so dr anansi doctor shuttle doctor spider the shuttle was named for an archetypal spider a nasty character from african legend who had crept into heaven and been evicted draw the line it hit him suddenly and he grinned into his microphone ill be heading back in a few minutes ive only got a little moor to do out here he hoped shed caught it fine tommy well be waiting to hear from you thomas sipped from the nipple at his cheek and washed his mouth out hard before swallowing it wasnt cold but it helped him feel awake and alive his battery gauge looked okay he turned up his cooling system a little he detached his safety line and crawled back along the gently curved surface of the cable pod it was clear enough what she wanted and that wasnt going to be easy but for what there were steel handholds and foot rests placed for the benefit of those who had built the cable pod thomas was glad for that early astronauts had half killed themselves trying to work in free fall with nothing to brace themselves anansi spider doctor dexter stonecypher draw the line thomas paused gripping one of the metal hand rungs they killed dexter the thought echoed within his skull a mix of grief and incredulity and rage shockingly strong thomas wasnt used to dealing with rage he moved on willey ley was a massive shadowed wedge like an empire battleship from star wars ludicrously dangerous access to the cable was at the back of the pod between the fins heat from the explosion had remelted some of the lunar slag and thomas fears were justified the access plug a steel screwhatch set in the cannister and now showing through the ripped foam shell was warped he crawled closer splaying his feet out to find the footrests set into the shell one was partly burned away and he took a moment to wedge his toe under the remnant a twisted steel loop he gripped the wheelshaped handle and turned as powerfully as he could straining until it felt like his shoulders were coming apart he felt his fingers biting into the glove padding felt his leg wound start to burn the wheel didnt budge thomas detached the cable gripper from his belt it was a great clumsy plierlike thing with blades and pressure points of tungsten carbide designed solely for gripping or cutting stonecyphers cable the enormous gear ratios and the small motors inside it made it a massive object indeed it made a dandy hammer he braced himself and pounded the wheel a few times rim and center break up the vacuum cementing he tried the wheel again it didnt move he flipped on his radio janet theres something here that needs to be secured or vice versa but my air will be running low in about fifteen minutes i may have to leave it your choice thomas detached the cutting torch from his belt he braced himself anew for fear of being jarred loose in free fall and vacuum the torch would act as a rocket it even had a flared nozzle to direct most of the flaming gas away from the man holding it and some of it still sprayed in all directions into the hard vacuum he worked the torch in a circle around the screw holding it a fair distance from the metal he wasnt trying to cut anything yet he only wanted to heat the surface as evenly as possible to expand the metal without atmosphere there is no convection to help get rid of waste heat but there is conduction and thomas enveloped in gas that was vacuumthin but flamehot was swimming in sweat within a few minutes combined with the throbbing in his leg it became almost too much to tolerate you cant make it in time an insidious voice whispered quit before you damage something go back now try again later there might not be a later tommy did you say something just a little debate with himself dont worry im winning there was silence on the other end then tommy are you all right fine im just fine his oxygen was low the power in his batteries was dropping he had to try now another five minutes and he wouldnt have the safety margin hed need to return to the ship he clicked off the torch and reached for the wheel it was unpleasantly hot and he knew that without his gloves the flesh of his hands would have been seared to the bone again he set his feet inhaled deeply and threw his body into the effort there was an inch of give then it stuck again this time he didnt give up thomas gulped another lungful of air then hissed it out in an explosion of total commitment it moved sluggishly as if the screw didnt quite fit the grooves any more but it moved and the ion tech grinned in savage satisfaction even the pain felt good he unwound a foot and a half of steel screw before it finally came free the first two meters of cable were sheathed in yellow plastic a quarter of an inch thick but after that it seemed to disappear he cautiously grasped the plastic section and pulled it out into unfiltered sunlight it unreeled easily beyond the plastic was naked cable the precious end product of seven years of work and hope almost as thin as spider silk it was a dim hairline that barely reflected the light at all but frail as it looked thomas knew that no man alive could sunder that line with strength alone he was looking at a miracle of will and patience and the sight of it helped cool the fire chewing at his nerves the yellow plastic was wound around a hook on the underside of the screw and he undid it sliding out the thin metal bar where the plastic terminated he tied the bar to his safety line his cooling unit hissed still shedding heat hed picked up from the welding torch he triggered the backpack jets they took him up and out and the cable line tautened behind him drag slowed him almost to a halt but the cable was running free unwinding spinning out behind him like a single strand of spider silk he fired the jets again anansi wasnt far a quarter of a mile no more if the drag cost him his backpack fuel the cutting torch would still serve as a rocket thomas loved open spaces he had traded the vast plains and rugged mountains of his youth in southern alaska for a greater vastness but now crossing on invisible thread between the cable pod and his own ruined spacecraft with bandit ships ahead and behind he felt utterly vulnerable cant fight cant run has janet got something in mind or is she just thrashing around for all of his life thomas had analyzed his emotions and fragmented them and shoved them away into convenient pockets later he could take them out like moldy forgotten halfmelted candy bars and examine those old feelings after they were too dead to hurt him he knew that was what he would be doing in the asteroids safely distant from janet and a ruined marriage he would exhume the memories and perform an intellectual autopsy probing here culturing there until he knew everything about it that there was to know and could file it away forever and never never experience it but he was tired and frightened and there was too much room to feel his insignificance his knowledge and accomplishments and goals fading into dreams his reality was the vastness around him and the slow ragged sound of his own breathing the doors of the shuttle bay were wide with welcome a pressuresuited shape waved him down thomas detached the yellow leader from his safety line and moored it to a supporting rib on the inside of the bay he said the mobility units dead ill refuel it now bombs thomas said time or radio controlled if they put one in the locking ring maybe i searched marion shook his head cant find anything that shouldnt be there but theres no way to search everything you want to open every package in the cargo bay no janet spoke in their helmets marion are you ready to go for the limpet motors weve got to have them ill go right after i refuel the mobility unit whats chances of their spotting you marion grinned oh they will but theyre not likely to guess what im doing as he dreamwalked to the airlock thomas saw dexter stonecyphers twometersplus of pressure suit lashed to the side of the cargo bay partially wrapped in tarps it looked almost like a clumsily prepared mummy but for the ridged boots sticking out at the lower edge he stepped into the lock still looking back at his friends body air hissed in thomas unscrewed his helmet and ran the back of a gloved hand over his face he was sweatsticky and knew that his dark eyes were puffy the inner lock opened janet was in the lower deck scribbling on paper stretched up against the lockers thomas said hi why do we need limpet motors in a minute tommy she turned from her paperwork lets look at your leg thomas was exhausted on every level his senses could touch but still felt himself tense when janet began helping him out of his suit i can do it damnithe started to say and only then realized how his voice and body were trembling dont tommy dont push me away now please you need help dont make me pull rank on you somehow that made him smile he stumbled back out of his suit limbs feeling clumsy and swollen he hadnt noticed it before but his left leg didnt hurt as much anymore there was blood darkening the synthetic material of his overalls partially clotted now and he didnt resist as janet helped him to a web he curled his fingers around its strands and closed his eyes he heard her busy herself at the first aid cabinet felt her as she snipped away the material to expose the wound tommy you should have let marion do the inspection this should have gotten attention hours ago he felt too weak to argue and didnt her hands were cool and soothing as they manipulated his leg gently wiped away the thickened blood theres something in there all right this is going to hurt a little he flinched as the knifepoint of pain lanced into the muscle over his knee thomas heard his wifes words of encouragement as if they were whispered far away there she said and he opened his eyes she stood holding a shard of grayish shrapnel between the tips of her surgical tweezers he teased it away from her and turned it over in his fingers foamed ceramic she said part of the cable pod she dressed his wound and held his hand as he flexed the leg experimentally i think it will work he said wincing thank you their eyes met and he knew that some of the accumulated resistance was gone that a direct current of understanding passed between them his mouth grew cottony and he swallowed hard im tired janet but i can keep going now why did you want the cable and why the limpet motors ive got an idea she waved at the expanse of scribblecovered paper look it over tell me if im crazy glad that there was no gravity to test his knee thomas crossed to stare at her diagrams she had sketched a shuttle outline recognizably anansi a line ran straight up from the shuttles open cargo doors an arc of earths surface was below the line reached up to a rocklike shape with fins in the middle of the line were the words approx km off to the side were two anansishaped craft emblazoned with skull and crossbones ill be damned tides he said janet spoke from behind him in her voice was a touch of belligerence and a bit of a stammer too after all we want anansi to go down right and the cable should go up out of their reach well youre not much of an artist he said images flowing together in his mind like colors in a paintbynumbers drawing but you dont have to be youre one hell of a smart lady will it work anansi can stand a reentry right the heat shielding is almost intact maybe some of the tail would burn away but he waved it away thats your department if you think we can reenter fine get ting down is the problem we dont have any rockets barring the nose jets and even one limpet motor would do it this way except that itd take longer okay and the bandits are the original shuttles that design was proxmired in the seventies congress tried to build it cheap and it doesnt carry enough fuel to get very high if we can put the cable in a higher orbit itll be out of their reach theyd have to launch a shuttle with an auxiliary tank falling angel will have an ion tug here before they could launch i think we can beat them she said moving up close behind him she seemed a little breathless the cable can take the stress if anansi can anansi and the cable and dexters special staples and glue it all has to hold mmm enveloping the squat outline of the shuttle were wavy lines representing atmosphere above the curve of the earths surface in thomass mind stress vectors performed a wardance and he burned to get to his computer nobodys ever tried anything like this he said slowly except for some early gravitystabilized camera satellites the satellites would reel wires out in opposite directions and tidal effect held the wires oriented on a line through the earth they dont do that any more why not there are better ways to stabilize a satellite never mind we have all the information in the world on the cable the structural strength of anansi tidal stress winds his voice trailed off ill have to try to program a model of this marion and i tried it but youd better check us out ill do my own the excitement was building up inside him its brightness pushing aside the waves of uncertainty and fatigue and he knew even before he checked it with the computer that janet had found a way out marion cycled through the airlock pulling off his helmet two limpet motors no obvious damage i moored them in the bay hows it look thomas i cant tell yet what about the brazilian shuttles thomas ran a dark finger along the pencil line connecting shuttle and cannister they may not sit back and let us rescue ourselves marion floated up behind him he was puffing listen thomasits not quite as bad as that the bandits cant even see the cable we use those last limpet motors to thrust us down and backward in our orbit theyll see that but they wont know why down and back puts us in a lower orbit than the cable pod well pull ahead of the cable pod before the line goes taut when the cable starts reeling out maybe theyll figure out what were doing his smile still tinged with darkness began to glow with the promise of merry hell by that time itll be too late to grab the cannister or stop us let them try to match orbits with us we wont be in an orbit well have to stall them somehow thomas mused thoughts snaking away in a dozen directions at once we cant be sure how desperate they are sure we can janet tapped a long finger hard on one of the jolly rogers this is the first act of spaceage piracy it takes a lot of momentum to get a ball like this rolling bte must have its ass right on the line hundreds of millions at stake with that kind of motivation their contingency plans are bound to include murder theyve proved that already thomas willy ley hasnt said word one the whole time its been over our heads brasilia says that leys pilots dont speak english marion snorted thats bullshit everyone who flies speaks english its the international language in that sense i dont think they really expect us to swallow their story without chewing it they think they have us in a total bind its a psychological pressure play with a lie just thick enough to give us an honorable way out if we dont respond they go to plan twowhich might well be blowing us right out of the sky a flash of his distorted dream a dream of screaming steel that flamed from the sky all right thomas said how do we handle it janet ill handle the communications if there are any questions from jane she ruffled her blond hair ruefully brasilia ill be ready to answer them we also need to keep up some harmless chatter with falling angel and oyama harmless chatter the words seemed to choke her god i hate this i want so bad to tell those bastards exactly what i think of them and here i have to chitchat like sunday supper lets get to work then thomas moved to a computer input his fingers were twitching none of us is going to feel alive until were doing something and i dont think you have to worry about the harmless chatter they know were upset they wont expect frivolity show youre hurt hide the anger janet nodded as long as they know eventually eleven in plain view half the boxes and pressurepacked equipment in the cargo bay had to be moved restacked and lashed to the walls to redistribute the floor space although weightless the cargo had considerable mass and it was work to move it to brace properly against the velcro traction strips or support struts inertia must always be reckoned with they walked wide around the cable wnich reached straight up into the black sky from where thomas had anchored the yellow leader likewise they avoided the silent motionless cocoon of dexter stonecypher thomas found it difficult not to hear the metallurgists voice in his ears to feel the dead gaze on the nape of his neck when he moved crated cutting tools stonecypher was there urging caution the cable grippers and special gloves were boxed separately and had to be moved to the side without them the cable was nearly useless capable of slicing through the strongest casehardened metals like a razor through skin yet they were not just tools they were dexters legacy and there was a nearly reverential silence as they worked when they were finished the walls of the entire bay were lined and stacked with boxes but most of the floor space was clear marion removed a cable gripper from the already opened package and worked it a few times to lubricate the joints with his feet anchored in velcro he reached up and clamped the tool to the cable he pulled it to the floor it gave easily and sprang back the quartermile length was too flexible we need slack and we cant pull it out from here marion said with some reluctance it wont unreel wed end up with the whole cable pod nestling cosily up against us okay marion saw thomas unloading a fresh mobility pack hold it isnt that my job now youre hurt pulling cable out is the easy part youll be here doing the muscle work marion digested that we need a couple of kilometers of slack thomas youll have all that cable hanging loose around you and its damn near invisible and it cuts anything thomas had worked himself into the mobility pack theres that too gabriels out of action and i cant fly the shuttle which of us is expendable janet could pull rank here but we dont really want to ask her do we marion laughed unconvincingly i didnt know you were tactful thomas all right go thomas rose in a nearly invisible burst of thrusters marion turned back to work he had opened a crate of stonecyphers special staples when he heard marion here janet any problems nothing we cant handle did she know where thomas had gone i want you to hook a camera to the manipulator arm i want to maintain visual contact at all times he couldnt help glancing up at the hovering black wedges a picture of silent armed figures emerging from brasilias open cargo doors gliding down to anansiill do that now he hooked the auxiliary camera up and tied it into the main video display are you getting it fine she didnt ask where thomas was so far their words had given nothing away painted no image save that of a desperate shuttle crew trying to save what they could of their mission videoscreen directly to janets right and below the rectangle of the surface position indicator filled with snow as the camera activated she waited for the automatic tuning to do its best before she began to fiddle the manipulator arm its eightmeter lengths jointed skeletally rose into the open the rear third of anansi came into view the sight of the ruined rcs pods tightened her chest the left was shredded the right peppered with shrapnel holes fine machinery brutally mangled at her command the camera tilted back down toward the cargo bay marion looked up at the camera were ready here janet hows the picture prime time let me check the rotation she rolled the camera until she was looking past one of the bay doors down toward the blue mists of earth and the silent tarzan willey ley she toyed with the thought of trying to talk to them again then directed the camera back down into the bay everythings fine colors fine carry on marion began setting staples janet rotated the camera until she was looking up out of the bay outward from earth tommy was a dwarfed shapeless figure approaching a great grey monolith the cable pod at a thousand kilometers distance in full sunlight earth was big enough to spark the fear of falling thomas jets pushed him outward past one black wedgeshaped bandit and toward another theyd see everything the tail of the cable pod was in full sunlight anansis cargo bay yawned wide open theyd see but would they understand thomas came in slowly to one side of the ruined tail the cable was a thread of light glowing in raw sunlight easy to avoid as he pulled himself around the jagged shards of torn heatshielding thomas set grippers to the cable tugging gingerly at first then with increasing power after a moments hesitation it began to unwind from the spool he pulled it out a meter at a time at first the line remained almost taut then it began to form loops the staples were pencilthin in the center tungsten carbide with a core of the cable itself splaying out into two broad pads of hard steel alloy marion mounted them close together fixing them to the deck with the epoxy gun the epoxy would take thirty seconds to set he had twenty staples in place in two rows and the cable was slack now hanging m curves he began stringing the cable the special gloves fit well enough over his pressure suit gloves but he was leery of using them he kept his hands on the yellow leader stringing it under the staples then he sprayed the three lengths with more of stonecyphers special epoxy the staple box was half empty marion pursed his lips then he began laying more cable continuing the zigzag pattern he used cable grippers to hold the strands in place while he sprayed epoxy down its length he could feel the strain of exertion in his back and his suit was getting warm good warmup this finish with stretching exercises in an hour or two or three thomas had given him plenty of slack and he could think of no excuse for stopping twenty strands thirty no more sunlight now the floods in the cargo bay gave plenty of light hed lay a hundred strands or so and plant staples along the last three dont get too tired he told himself tired people make mistakes and this stuff is deadly wup thomas doesnt have any light at all thomas marion speaking ive got enough to work with take a break wait for dawn before you start again he said hoping that was cryptic enough for the bandit ships hoping janet could spin them a song and dance but lying was not one of janets skills marion thought a few good lies might have saved her marriage shed have to learn quick to save the cable enough of stonecyphers epoxy and special staples might be enough to hold stonecyphers cable they might rip up some of the floor too but anansi was a wreck already just one more reentry and then the shuttle would be junk or ionized vapor dawn touched the cable first a thread of light leading down toward earth and anansi the curves were straightening out marion must have been working hard thomas thought he set back to pulling cable his abused arm and shoulder muscles had stiffened and he groaned and kept working the cable hung in loops around him it would have to do marion thought he was getting too far aft in the cargo bay it wouldnt do to have anansi hanging nose down besides if he laid twice that much cable it would give them no more safety at all it would hold or it wouldnt he took a break no need to lie down he simply closed his eyes and let every separate muscle relax a minute passed or two or five to work marion removed the two remaining limpet motors from their clamps and plugged them in for a diagnostic janet everything seems fine marion good tommy youve probably done enough out there come on back i can use some help here thomas was puffing i can use a change coming in the men had both taken a few minutes rest and janet was glad they were working too hard now too soon she watched thomas trigger his backpack and come straight up toward the camera hauling the pair of limpets after him a quick flutter of fingertips and she had the medical readouts on screen she checked his heartbeat and respiration safe but still too high she could still hear his voice as he swore at her dammit if theres any risk involved i have to be the one to take it i am expendable you and marion are not from the missions perspective he was right of course but that didnt make it easier he seemed almost frantic with energy he spoke with too much emotion too much sponteneity and it was a little frightening or is it isnt that what you always wanted not a comfortable thought worse was her husband trying to outmacho marion it would be utterly unlike him but what in gods name would she do about it the camera followed thomas toward anansis tail limpet motors trailing behind him like fishing bobbers floating in a darkened sea the intercom hissed this shouldnt be too bad but i wish we didnt have to depend on the limpets whats on your mind tommy control we can control the forward attitude jets more precisely than we can control these she shrugged into the blind microphone they dont have enough fuel weve got the limpets lined up along the original motors they should thrust through the shuttles center of mass if theyre off a little ive still got the nose jets the shiptoship line broke in and the voice on the other end was curiously polite this is brasilia calling anansi janet turned the camera to get a good look at brasilia hovering just beyond the cable pod captain de camp here burgess what can i do for you she kept her voice as light as possible he fumbled for the thought ah we see that youve gone eva apparently affecting repairs what sharp little eyes you have you bastard yes thats exactly what were doing another pause then can we be of assistance could they see into the shuttle bay and if they could could they possibly see the zigzags of cable and guess their purpose not likely but the suspicion in burgess voice called for careful judgment i cant think of anything we cant do for ourselves what did you have in mind captain de camp if im talking out of turn so be it we can see you placing limpet motors on whats left of your rcsps now youve got to know that two limpet motors wont change your orbit by more than a hundred kilometers or so less even if you could reach atmosphere well your ship doesnt look like it can still maneuver if you accept our offer and let us take you down so you can claim shuttle cable everything in our cargo bay and whats left of the ion drive too no we have to try this but if it doesnt work well be glad to accept your offer pause we may not be able to wait forever why not be reasonable the first glint of steel beneath the glove burgess you have to understand we may have lost the cable and the ion drive she knew he would love hearing thatbut weve got to try to save what we can leave us that much dignity please she swivelled the camera searching for thomas he had reached the left rcsp and was adjusting the limpet before triggering its magnetic lock behind and above him brasilia seemed to have drifted closer she hoped it was an illusion burgess how much room do you have aboard three crew seven seats plenty of room for you we were prepared for guests but we heard about your casualty she was surprised to hear unmistakable sincerity in the mans next words dr stonecypher was a great man yes yes he was she was puzzled now she tried to keep the emotion from building but it was there in her voice its all right they expect you to be upset about dexter dont they he was easy to care about half crazy sometimes maybe but i guess you cant be a sevenfoottall genius and not be thats too much these people killed dexter there was no sound from the other end of the line but she knew that burgess was listening and that willy ley was listening too the next words were for them when youre in a tightlyknit community like falling angel eccentrism just breaks the monotony you care about those peopleits hard not to theyre likely to be the most straightforward dedicated intelligent people youll ever meet in your life you tend to make them family brothers sisters and if fleming is falling angels father then dexter stonecypher was our uncle the crazy one nobody understands and everybody loves now hes dead terrorists killed him the united muslim activist front i believe they said they killed him and someone is going to pay for that she was trembling and paused to relax her stranglehold on the control panel burgess spoke slowly i see what youre saying yes i hope so after all youre part of this too arent you silence then what do you mean space the final frontier how much of your life have you invested in it you must have dreamed the same dreams as fleming and stonecypher and me you must have watched and star trek and read the books and listened to the same people sing the same songs and watched the sky you had to there was no answer from the other side only the faint sound of breathing by god what kind of pirate is this the man feels something the current was flowing now encouraged she continued working the hook in a little deeper so when something threatens that dream when maniacs attack us to shore up their rickety ideology or even worse she wished she could see burgess face to know exactly how far she was twisting the knife or even worse for money well friend thats tearing at the heart of the dream that hurts me because i give a damn i hope you can say the same thing she leaned back from the microphone drunken with the need to vent her anger what the hell else would we be doing here burgess asked with answering anger do you know what one shuttle launch costs thomas voice broke in ive got the limpets set up janet were ready for a test firing good tommy get back into the bay and secure burgess spoke anansi im still not sure what it is you have planned you dont have to be she said bluntly were going home if we can if we cant well lock up anansi and come down with you fair enough she armed the limpets through the main computer and synchronized them with the forward attitude jets she triggered the vernier thrusters the bluewhite globe below the wings rolled forward until the cabin windows looked straight down on borneo and sumatra she hoped tommy had given her lots of slack on the cable without that the cable could slice deep into anansi she couldnt ask not by intercom she let anansi roll a few degrees further then a short burst of verniers slowed and stabilized the shuttle pointing downandbackward in its orbit down and back puts us in a lower faster orbit than the cable pod well pull ahead before the line goes taut the cable pod pulls anansi backward we slow we drop anansi pulls the cable pod forward it speeds up it rises will it work tommy says itll work above and behind her were the cable pod and wiley ley she moved the manipulator arm to peek over the damaged rcs pods and found them beautiful so far tommy said happily i think were ready for a test firing are you secure were both in the bay tied down in five she counted off the seconds and started the limpets the thrust built up behind her trivial pressure just enough to disturb her semicircular canals she kept an eye on brasilia waiting then sighed as the bandit shuttle began to inch past they had never planned a test firing to what point they didnt have fuel to spare she had expected burgess to be shouting at her by now but there wasnt a sound from brasilia perhaps he didnt want to interrupt her during a difficult maneuver or he might be just confused who was burgess why didnt he have the good grace to be smoother slicker more like the pirate he had to be anansi was yawing left the limpet motors werent quite balanced janet used verniers to steady the nose vernier fuel wouldnt last forever either her camera showed willy ley and brasilia and the cable pod dwindling aft anansi lurched as a limpet motor ran dry and janet chewed her lip and rode the verniers until the other quit too then in haste a long blast of vernier jets to bring the nose away from earth when stonecyphers cable went taut it must stand straight up from the cargo bay otherwise it would wrap around the hull and slice away pieces done done tommy marion come on back in weve got work to do she said teeth bared in satisfaction twelve loose ends the sun had set only an hour earlier but on that camouflaged section of the iranian plateau work was nearly completed electronic and mechanical equipment scaffolding transportation gear and prefabricated living quarters had been broken down and shipped or destroyed djalma costa watched the last of the halftracks sagging with gear roll groaning into the darkness most of the technicians supplied by bte had already left soon there would be little but packed sand and sunscorched brush and nothing at all to connect bte with the historic events of the past twelve hours the prometheus had risen on a billowing cloud of fire and dust forty pairs of eyes watched it go a spontaneous scream of victory urging the missile on just as reflexive was costas sexual arousal and his urgent need to retire from the launch site theyd launched late late never had he experienced anything to compare with that moment it still flashed to mind as he wove between the evacuating workers heading back to his own tent dark stains glued his shirt to his body as they had during much of the day but now the stains were beginning to stink of fear they were watching him there was death in the breeze that flowed across the sand fluttering canvas and paper sending dustimps dancing through the camp what did they think of the news report the two missile hypothesis he remembered mansurs skeletal face creasing in a thin inquisitive smile the explosives expert sat beside the camp radio sometimes looking at costa sometimes back at hoveida and the bodyguard in four languages news broadcasts spoke of the disaster in space and of a missile that must have exploded hundreds of kilometers short and in arabic his umaf coconspirators talked among themselves at last hoveida twisted in his canvas chair his massive body wringing a tortured creak from its frame it seems the terrorist leader said as calm as death that the missile did not strike the shuttle squarely i dont understand costa held himself to balanced proportions of concern surprise consternation anything else would be suicide hoveida pivoted the folding chair to watch costa more carefully there was no tension in the arabs body he was as relaxed as a coiled snake i mean that there was an explosion and the ship was crippled one crew member was killed or has died it is difficult to be sure how this happened the crew is presently evaluating the damage i i was assured that a strike by a prometheus was impossible to survive he let anger seep into expression and body motion springing from his chair ill have to answer for thisno at least im not responsible for the choice of missile i proceeded just as instructed he calmed himself and addressed them apologetically please i do realize that the fault lay with our equipment not in the work and planning your people put into the project now how badly did we damage them spacecraft are so vulnerable an injured spacecraft should be useless for anything he should want to know these things shouldnt he he faced hoveida squarely why doesnt he mention the broadcasts the cable vehicle might have started down before the prometheus arrived he thought in bitter despair so xaviers men set the bomb off early did they give one thought to me he saw nothing but questions and coldness in hoveida the arab spoke thickly i want no more words please go and supervise the withdrawal phase mansur and i have much to speak of heading back to his quarters now the withdrawal was nearly complete the background noises and sights had faded to a blur against the growing awareness of danger mansurs smile terrible as the final rictus of some dying animal played in his mind they knew theyd been used the umaf as a tool of the capitalists how far would their credibility sink if that were known indeed mightnt their own followers turn on hoveida and his angel of death if they were positive they had been lied to then all of the promised funds would mean nothing would be no protection at all for btes personnel liaison would hoveida have to be positive costa was jarred out of his reverie by a scream of rage and he threw himself backward stumbling as a jeep nearly ran him down the driver shook his fist spitting worlds in arabic as he wove his way out of camp costa sat on the ground listening to his attempts to swallow dust and fear clogged his throat making it difficult to breathe one of his technicians offered a hand up and costa refused shaking his head violently the little man dusted himself off and stood for an instant unsure of his next move then sucking the back of a skinned hand he headed toward his tent it rattled its flaps at him as he ducked in looking back over his shoulder to see if anyone had followed the camp was an anthill of activity workers scrambling to a hundred tasks but there was no sign that he had been singled put his luggage lay packed two cases on his bed one by the tiny washbasin costa opened one of the cases ran his hands over the contents afraid to turn on the light when he found the rectangular shape of the electric shaver he gasped in relief he turned it over to get at the battery pack he plugged the auxiliary extension cord in stretched it out at arms length and pushed the recharge button the light at the base of the shaver glowed red and he knew that the radio signal had been sent after ten seconds it faded and he pushed it again waited then repacked the shaver it was a shame to lose it and the rest of his luggage too but his only hope lay in moving as quickly as possible costa steadied his nerves and left the tent leaving the camp was a nightmare even under cover of darkness he was sure that every eye followed him that his every movement was a lethal betrayal he tried to blend into the shadows to become part of the night slipping away from the lights and movement bellycrawling through the dust and sand until he was far enough from the camp to stand and run and run he did northward feet slipping on the sand until he felt like a mouse on a treadmill until he found the patch of hard flat sand he had scouted three nights ago there almost a kilometer from the camp and the men he had betrayed he sat to wait for the helicopter there were insect sounds and the distant purr of motors and voices but costa screened those out peering into the sky waiting and praying where was it surely it would come minutes passed he looked at the glowing face of his watch and shivered lying close to the sand the wind blew coarse grains into his nose his eyes and mouth but he lay as silent as a lizard waiting where was it surely the helicopter had been waiting fueled pilots at the alert surely xavier had chosen only men who could be trusted with a task of such urgency surely xavier a finger of doubt traced its way up his spine whispering betrayal in his ear what if xavier knew that he was likely to lose his liaison officer what if you are expendable now costa after all your part of the job is over no he said almost deprecatingly and shut his eyes tight that kind of thinking was pure paranoia xavier wasnt that kind of man then what kind of man was he why should he care about costa now costa the only personal link between the terrorists and bte costa heard the first whimper break from his throat dying away at the distant sound of helicopter blades cut through the darkness relief rolled over him like a freezing breaker restoring the calm and sanity sending the doubt scurrying for cover he could even see the landing lights he stood and waved knowing that they were picking him up on infrared by now thank god he said with unaccustomed reverence something hit him a smashing blow across the back of the head and he fell mind too full of sudden pain for questions or even fear to reach him he fell face down unable to soften his descent nose impacting squarely with the sand it felt broken clogged with sand and what tasted like blood a rough hand clamped brutally on his shoulder and rolled him over hoveida planted a knee squarely on costas right arm put the point of his knife over the little mans solar plexus his eyes gleamed in the dim light we will find your master never fear and will send him to join you in hell costa tried to speak but as he opened his mouth something slid into his body tearing his body tearing his vitals and the breath to speak or scream was pinned within him hoveida smiled broadly pulled the knife free and wiped its blade on costas face from the corner of his eye costa saw the helicopter draw nearer heard shots with a sudden whine of the engines the copter veered away climbing into the sky no costa said or thought he said dont leave me the copter seemed to respond sinking toward the sand faster now with an ugly burr added to the whisper of its blades then it didnt seem to matter any more nothing seemed to matter except the cold spreading through his body and the fact that the stars were fading away in a few moments that didnt matter either thirteen dove of prey everybody was talking and nobody was communicating maybe that wouldnt bother a brazilian but it was driving captain eric burgess crazy worse he was doing it himself and for his life he watched his instruments and kept his mouth shut but inside he seethed the tradition of the united states space effort had always been communication is life ground base had to know everything when something went wrong they could tell you what to try next at worst they could tell the next man how you died silence violated burgess earliest training but his life had been going gradually screwy ever since the government leased his contract to brazil techimetal electromotores he was fortyeight years old a barrel of a man who fought constantly to keep his weight within regulated limits this had little to do with laziness on his part on the contrary burgess found his problem to be an expansiveness a hunger for experiences and the exotic that sometimes exceeded his ability to safely assimilate them he had abandoned a sour marriage and an unspectacular career with nasa when the brazilian air force offered him a way out retirement would have driven him crazy but being kept on a leash in sao luis wasnt much better for a port city sao luis was remarkably free from features of interest it squatted nearly on the equator his air conditioner would render the air barely thin enough to breathe but he put up with the heat and the sopping clothes and the mosquitoes because he was paid to be close to the space facility where once a month he rode the shuttle brasilia into orbit sometimes he and ricardo diaz his copilot would place satellites or ferry up a pressurized can for zerogravity industrial experiments once the can had been filled with brazilian officials it was a mess afterward half of them had been sick he found he could talk to the officers of the brazilian air force because many of them had once been pilots they shared an empathy difficult with the politicians and nearly impossible with the businessmen but in the two and a half years he had flown for brazil never had an assignment troubled him like this one fortyeight hours ago he had been placed on alert driven from his apartment in sao luis to the national aerospace facility some thirty miles north willy ley the new shuttle had flown in piggyback on a just six weeks ago it had had one shakedown run and was supposed to be ready for the regular flight schedule but there was nothing regular about the scene that greeted burgess on his return to national aerospace two shuttles were mounted atop their twin launch pads bellies nestled to external tanks and solid rocket boosters brazil techimetalelectromotores engineering consultant was with colonel olivera when burgess reported for assignment burgess had met lucio giorgi before and had not disliked the man he carried his age with an oldworld courtliness which burgess admired but that day the man seemed frozen he spoke without communicating without body language odd in a brazilian colonel olivera was heavier than burgess without the muscle to carry it well he extended a sweaty palm and motioned to one of the office chairs captain burgess he said in his grueling brazilian accent we wish to conduct a test of our emergency launch preparations fine is diaz in yet his mind was immediately immersed in brasilias checkout procedures i expect youll want us to get started immediately the mugginess of the past few days in sao luis fell away like a cloak this was more like it are we having a dual launch if were doing that id like to get together with the captain of willy ley something in the air changed the instant he said that it was as if olivera and giorgi had been waiting for him to ask that question and were ready to explain something they didnt expect him to understand olivera his small black eyes watering slightly looked back at giorgi who raised a single thin finger the older man spoke with the tone of a teacher lecturing an unfavored student brasilia and willy ley will be performing separate functions during this exercise and we feel it would be counterproductive to bring you together at this time youre wondering if i can respond spontaneously wouldnt it be easier to test that in a simulator this has got to be awfully expensive for a test we consider the expense a worthwhile investment captain there was dismissal in giorgis voice burgess didnt like it but he took it the countdown began thirtysix hours later prematurely a rescue mission a shuttle belonging to falling angel the american industrial facility in lunar orbit was in trouble burgess watched the umafs flatfaced zombie read her announcement and could barely believe what he had heard when olivera announced the rescue attempt burgess first reaction was a fierce joy the joy had faded to puzzlement at the last minute addition of a bte mission specialist to the crew the new man was supposed to be a psychologist of some kind there to report on stress reactions that was thin stuff burgess tried to swallow it it wasnt until they had actually lifted through the light cloud cover dropped the boosters at fifty kilometers and the external tank at a hundred and twenty and were falling upward to meet anansi that the doubts really solidified it had to be coincidence that two shuttles were ready to go when anansi was attacked after all what could anyone possibly gain by such an attack only madmen his instructions were to take the crew of anansi aboard and take them down to safety then why was willy ley here their mission specialist correro had spoken with ley several times in brazilian but surely any spacecraft pilot would speak english there were too many separate things to bother him the suspicion and hostility that showed through captain de camps voice the ominous silence from willy ley and perhaps more than anything else the command to take orders from correro lost in his speculations burgess jumped when ricardo diaz pushed a foillined pouch of hot coffee into his hand diaz said it looks like were going to have to wait eric burgess nodded out of the corner of his eye he watched correro he and diaz might have been brothers both were slender and strong both tall and their skin matched for tone but diaz was bright and cheerful with razoredged reflexes and an invaluable knack for secondguessing burgess needs correros eyes were the only part of his face that moved he wore his headset consistently listening to secret orders from ground control murmuring back in brazilian correro had watched with great interest as thomas de camp glided across space to the cargo pod whats in there burgess asked just what were the terrorists after correro glared at him spoke rapidly into his headset pausing to listen to the reply it is a cable he said finally extremely valuable cable dr dexter stonecypher falling angels celebrated metallurgist had been aboard hadnt he been working on some kind of supercable burgess stirred around in his mind looking for answers salvage omigod that was what the second ship was for to take charge of the cable after the crew of anansi went down but all indications said that the rescue mission had been ready for days and that meant he had to be wrong but the doubt and suspicion continued to grow and the fear theyre descending diaz said quietly i dont see how they can expect to do it they lost too much fuel i know just stupid pride i guess diaz wed better staywith them theyll sure as hell need help correro watched as the adjustment firing was made then rose and clumsily made his way downstairs diaz waited for the mans head to disappear down the stairwell then nudged burgess somethings wrong eric you smell it too the younger man shook his head vigorously i heard it he is talking about guns some of what he said was in code you know code words but i heard guns what do you make of it burgesskept his voice down and one eye on the stairwell i think that someone has decided to guarantee their profits on this rescue mission ley is supposed to take the cargo if anansi doesnt abandon it but thats crazy there was a scuffing sound on the stairs check your scope the cable package is rising what correro propelled himself up the ladder and into the cabin too quickly he nearly cannoned into the seats managing to check himself at the last second with a desperate grip on the chair back burgess concealed his contempt while correro studied the screen are you sure they may have placed one of their limping motors on the cable pod limpet burgess said flatly whatever it is youd better have ley correct for it correro barked into his microphone they had no visual contact with the pod but radar showed that it had risen above willy ley and was continuing to gain altitude at about seven meters per second the same rate burgess noted with interest that anansi was dropping at least according to the computer burgess watched the other shuttle rise past him but his computer told him that brasilias own orbit was contracting that brasilia was sinking a quick burst of attitude jets brought brasilia and anansi even again a few minutes later he had to do it again and the cable pod continued to rise burgess scowled i dont understand whats happening here correro anansis rocket pods look like shredded lettuce where are they getting the thrust are you so inferior a pilot burgess i want you to stay with anansi do you hear me or cant you americans take orders ill do my best im telling you though this is costing us fuel and them they must be using fuel too intuition spoke for burgess i wonder i dont know how theyre i dont care correro was screaming now i have my orders and you have yours they stared at each other for long seconds during which burgess decided that he liked correro less than any brazilian hed yet encountered all right youre calling the shots but ill bet your friends in willy ley arent doing much better they corrected three more times and each time ended up dropping past anansi having to waste more fuel to come even again burgess had the distinct feeling that the unseen captain de camp was laughing at him and was within a whisper of understanding why when his headphones broke into his train of thought it was colonel olivera the officers bluff voice had sharpened almost to a whine and burgess had little trouble sympathizing captain burgessour ground computers are telling us very strange things the anansi is traveling too slowly to maintain its orbit i can verify that there doesnt seem to be any way for us to stay matched with them he tuned his ears sharply now waiting for the response to his next question i tell you whatwhy dont we just forget it its pretty clear that anansi doesnt want to be rescued there was a blurred silence on the other end marred by static when olivera came back onthe line there was a new ugly sound in his voice captain burgess i want you to understand something you will either complete your mission or be arrested on landing say again arrested for what crime for refusal to follow the orders of your superiors the contract which you signed with brazil makes you an auxilliary member of our air force subject to all rules and regulations of other military personnel this isnt a military operation diaz was watching him with a kind of horrified fascination my contract was sublet to a civilian agency which is apparently attempting a civilian salvage operation do not quibble with me captain burgess there is entirely too much at stake you will follow our orders or upon landing you will be turned over to a military court and shot burgess couldnt help filling in the rest of the threat it was such absurd melodrama that he almost laughed and he almost but not quite asked and what if i dont land in brazil what if i ditch out somewhere that doesnt have an extradition treaty with brazil then he realized how close behind him corerro was come to think of it could diaz be in on this too granted that the two of them the americano and the young brazilian air force officer had made the round of bars in rio some of the better brothels too but what did that mean when you came right down to it just how big was this operation millions tens of millions at least olivera he could be sure had been well bribed bte had to be in this up to their wisdom teeth it had cost one life already and no americano pilot was going to stand in the way now that was what correro was for talk to them burgess olivera said nastily make them see that they must cooperate or we will be forced to become unpleasant there were questions things that he wanted and needed to ask but there was nobody on the line to answer and he kept them to himself talk to them his forehead was damp but he didnt wipe it didnt want to give correro the satisfaction of seeing how shaken he was what would he say he knew now what captain de camp had suspected knew why she didnt trust him hell he was an accessory to murder within a few minutes it might get worse than that all i wanted was a few more years he said into the dead microphone what was that eric diazs eyes were huge with questions burgess had questions too can i trust ricardo how much does he know diaz had his whole career ahead of him this operation could guarantee the young brazilian rank and fortune im sorry i didnt realize i was talking out loud burgess looked out of his front window brasilia was almost directly above anansis tail the crippled ship was sliding away from him even as he watched he could see directly into the cargo bay could see that the bundles and packages intended for oyama construction had been lashed up against the sides of the ship leaving a cleared floor space he clucked to himself thoughtfully it fit a pattern anansi years go in a class on cultural anthropology his teacher had discussed west african legends burgess fished through his mind and found anansi the archetypal spider who had climbed a silk line let down from heaven like the japanese susanoo and the greek haephestus and the christian lucifer anansi had worn out his welcome in heaven he had talked a dove into bringing him down again anansi was an unpleasant one at the end of the flight he had eaten the bird there was a moral there somewhere but damned if burgess could find it he reached for the microphone anansi this is captain burgess aboard brasilia do you read me there was no reply but he knew damned well that they heard him what could they gain by communicating with him anansi i know that youre just trying to live up to your legend but be a nice spider and talk to me huh still nothing how far would he have to push it before de camp knew that he knew just consider me the dove of peace come to take you safely home believe me you could do a lot worse behind him correro had stroked a slight bulge under his flight jacket an unconscious movement but a telling one is that where it is olivera would know that a regulation handgun would be no use in a pressurized vehicle a miss could kill everyone so what would it be an air gun loaded with nerve darts anansi please he let his voice become a coo of sympathy just a bit exaggerated you cant make it yourself believe me you need our help this time the dove is the predator still there was no answer correro had made a decision the flight specialist was tired of waiting all right burgess he deliberately smeared out the first syllable of the name in a long nasty sound youve had your chance the willy ley will take over from here you are to exchange positions with the ley and guard the cable pod just what are you expecting ley to do burgess wasnt totally sure he wanted to hear but part of him was fascinated horrified but fascinated by the drama unfolding around him he didnt know what to do or whom to trust hasty action could get him killed if on the other hand he kept his mouth shut and did as he was told there might be enough in this for everyone he hated himself for thinking that but it didnt stop the image of golden coins from flashing into his mind the willy ley will do what it must you will do as you are told or diaz will take control of the brasilia so there it was burgess nodded silently and laid out his new course the cable pod was eight kilometers from anansi at that point and still climbing fourteen the killing place the air in the cabin had grown muggy without the solar panels on the ion drive anansis recycling equipment was lumbering along on batteries alone the crew had killed all unnecessary power usage even if everything went exactly as they hoped it would be a tight squeak but the mugginess had more to do with tension than with any quality of cabin atmosphere marion thomas janet they sat lightly stiffly and their faces bore an intense nearly identical listening look they listened to their own bodies to minute changes in the few pounds weight of themselves against their chairs they were not watching their instruments given their present mode of transportation the computers were quite useless suddenly all three relaxed thats better marion said i thought we were hung up thomas nodded hed felt it too anansi hung from the sky like a piano being lowered from a building its nose tilted perhaps ten degrees upward moments ago thomass seat had surged upward as if the cable were dragging it was all right now or was it if the cable stopped unreeling the tidal effect would still be pulling them gently downward damn it marion demanded are we moving or not hard to tell no were moving janet said about a kilometer every forty seconds call it thirty meters per second at least weve still got the altimeter what theyd done was working what more could he ask but thomas de camp was a worrier do we have any idea what the maximum rate of release is were already way above any speed dexter could have anticipated i picture little wheels getting hot inside the cable pod with no way to cool them we can hope dexter used magnetic bearings marion said janet was watching the radar screens were certainly going to find out she laughed brasilias having her troubles every so often you see the motors flash and she eases up to us and then drifts away again wups somethings going on it looks brasilia and willy ley seem to be headed for a summit meeting both men craned to look past her the two blips were drawing together on the screen thomas allowed himself the luxury of a moment of hope gazed at the fragmented clouds still so far below them but early optimism could get them killed theyre passing each other theyre changing places tarzan is swinging down to play oh shiti think youre right janet pushed away from the screen turned her chair to face them theories what have they got on willy ley that could force us to stop marion held up a hand to tick off options with small satisfaction thomas noted that the hand was not entirely steady weapons first of all not outside the ship theyd burn off probably nothing big enough to blow us out of the sky either even mounted in the cargo bay wed have seen it by now if theyd known how much trouble we could give them i think they would have just planted a mine inside the ship somewhere maybe they have janet thomas was talking from his pessimistic place but he couldnt resist the temptation to answer his own implied question but wed better assume they didnt weve searched the cargo bay and found nothing ive been all over the outside of the shuttle and theres nothing there we have to assume that they thought they were going to do us enough damage with the first mine all right thomas tell me why do we have to assume that thomas looked at marion coldly they must know that we cant check every box in the cargo bay once they realize they cant catch usif they cant its a bluff any moron would think of mmm if were wrong were dead anyway okay its a gamble but this whole thing is a gamble marions eyes were wide and almost boyish he flicked at his hair in resignation in the absence of gravity it stayed flicked all right then the next possibility is men armed men in mobile suits now thats a more likely possibility janet gripped thomas arm what do you think tommy can they do it youve had more experience with the suits than either of us the ships cant match orbits with us were under acceleration however untraditional willy ley might plot our course and drop some men off in an intersecting path wait for us then blast like hell with mobility units pretty tricky but if theyre good they might be able to do it the inky negative thoughts roiled awhile but once again he saw dark and bright sides both id bet they arent much good if they havent figured out our play by now hey janet what kind of game is burgess playing it sounded like he was trying to lay clues i think he knows she reached for his arm and her grip was tight why he didnt just come out and say what was on his mind i dont know maybe maybe what oh hell i dont know maybe hes got qualms but then whats he doing with the pirates in the first place no forget it forgotten marion tried to think of a third category nope its guns or its men with guns the men might have recoilless rifles maybe even a light rocket launcher theyd have to be lucky to get aboard usbut not impossibly lucky wed better make plans shut the cargo bay doors we do that theyll attack from outside no if they make it as far as anansi we want to take them on our terms well need help thomas said somewhere in the back of thomas mind was the glimmer of an idea the emergency fire kits he said rising and heading toward the stairs how many co extinguishers do we have when marion joined thomas on the lower deck the ion drive tech already had the survival gear pulled out of the lockers and had selected the flare kit and fire extinguishers for special consideration he was working on the first of two fire extinguishers with a screwdriver his face tightened in concentration as he peeled the metal safety strip from around the bright red cylinder just two and lucky to get those he said theyd never be used except on the ground fire in space you just open the doors marion watched a moment then asked what can i do to help de camp flicked a glanced at him ever work with explosives only as a kid that will have to do i need the primers out of two of the flares be careful marion took the latched plastic box that held anansis emergency flares and anchored it next to thomas at the work bench inside were two flare guns and four flares nestled in styrofoam a memory ticked thomas dont we have a or something a lot of the old emergency kits had them in case you set down in hostile territory or something he peered at the back end of one of the flares and saw the shallow circular rise of the primer set deadcenter in the rear of the shell i looked maybe there was one long ago id guess nobody thought it was important enough to replace well just have to do the best we can thomas strong stubby fingers were busy unscrewing the nozzle from the fire extinguisher he looked up vacantly how much time do we have he reached out and flicked on the intercom rather than yelling up the ladder well janet do you have ley on your scope or a visual yet the flared nozzle came free and he glared at the remainder of the extinguisher safety ring valve and the thumb trigger that would send a steel needle through the metal foil sealing the cylinder ley is ahead of us and still about four kilometers up tommy good he glanced at marion who had worked the flare free of its shell if we dont blow ourselves to hell i should have our surprise ready in about twenty minutes he clicked off the intercom and went back to his work loosen a base screw carefully twist the valve free yeah marion said absently sorting through thomas magnetic tool rack until he found needle nosed pliers i did a little fooling around when i was a kid nothing really special except once once yeah marion had adjusted the swanneck lamp to peer directly over his shoulder so that the light went right down into the shell he inserted the pliers and groped carefully i was a preppyair force preppy dad sent me to military school so id be officer material anyway i made some enemies in high school he had hold of something at the bottom of the shell and twisted slowly bruiser named oscar oscar irving i wrote poetry at the time terrible stuff i did the world a great service by becoming an astronautah he held the primer up to the light it was an inch long little thicker than a lead pencil thomas smiled approval thats good and quick too get me another one and were in business he had almost finished stripping his first extinguisher right down to the foil he looked at the silvery cap and whistled softly wish i knew a better way of doing this he took an electric etcher and carefully scored the top of the cap with a crossmarking just want to weaken this a little marion was silent while thomas made his delicate operation he only realized that he had stopped breathing when the cylinder was pushed to the side and carefully moored in place thomas smiled weakly anyway what happened mmm at your school thomas lifted the next extinguisher on end and scrutinized it oh yeah well i had a locked desk and someone kept breaking into it brute force hed just yank the drawer open hard enough to break the lock hed steal the poems and post them on the bulletin board it happened twice and everybody knew who was doing it he went to work on the second shell his expression was somewhere between concentration and reverie i had access to the chem lab i precipitated some nitrogen triiodide he glanced over at thomas saw the pursed smile surface and smooth oven again ah you know of it i didnt have any trouble getting iodine crystals and ammonia i had some trouble getting hold of ether to wash it seems that two cadets had been dismissed the semester before for getting high on the stuff and the professor kept it locked safely away i had to go out and buy some simplicity is the mark of genius thomas said go on i made up about a quarterounce of the stuff and painted it all over the inside of my desk i took the bulb out of the ceiling light left the room and proceeded to tell everybody id just written the best poem of my entire life i was going to enter it in a state literary contest i knew oscar couldnt resist that i made sure i was in the rec hail that night visibly stuffing quarters in the video games you know anything to keep me out of the way triumphantly he held up his second primer all right what do we do with them just hold on for now and get me two extension cords the kind that clip into the cargo bay light sockets got it thomas had almost finished with the second extinguisher when the intercom came back on tommy willy ley is closing on us from behind theyve set up an intercept orbit well be on them in about ten minutes no way to maneuver are you ready down there thomas wiped at his forehead trying to control his breathing almost janet the second extinguisher was naked except for the foil cap and he carefully scored it five minutes aware that his movements were growing erratic and jerky thomas forced calm into his hands searched through his cabinet for the putty he took the first primer and frictiontaped it to the tip of the electric etcher then attached the taped bundle to the top of the fire extinguisher molding it tight with putty when he had done the same with the second etcher and the second fire extinguisher he looked at both of the jerryrigged devices and shuddered damnif only we had more time then shook his head and started for the suit rack taking down his helmet marion plug the etchers into the cords but dont plug the cords in the inside of thomas suit smelled of sweat and dried blood there had been no time to clean it he flexed his knee and sighed ill have to fight in this stink are you finished marion held up the plugs each fire extinguisher was now attached to a thirtyfoot length of extension cord good better suit up and finish your story the copilot grinned you could finish it yourself about nine thirty that night we hear a muffled explosion oscar comes screaming into the rec room howling bloody murder his hands and face are dead purple and so is his shirt you know nitrogen triiodine its perfectly safe when wet but when it dries itll go off if a fly lands on it and it leaves that iodine stain all over everything oscar was the purple man for a couple of days he had a wonderful time explaining to the headmaster exactly how it all happened and what he was doing in my desk i never had any more trouble after that thomas chuckled and helped marion into his suit it smelled no better than thomas youre not too bad guiness the worst part of it for poor oscar was that he didnt even get one of my better poems it went something like roses are red violets are blue orchids are purple and so are you janets voice low and urgent interrupted their laughter tommy marion listen to me ive got my camera on willy ley theyve dropped off three evas mobility suits and what look like rifles maybe light rocket launchers well intersect their path in about four minutes thomas and marion sealed each others helmets on and gripped hands hard lets do this right de camp said soberly well only have one chance janet do you read me clear tommy good then cycle us through the airlock and one more thing i want you to kill all power in the cargo bay the men who waited for anansi were known as strike leader wolf one and wolf two they were brazilian mercenaries and had sold their services in south america and africa for the past eight years fighting in fullscale wars and minor skirmishes one job had been an assassination of a bolivian priest who had caused much trouble for the mining companies speaking out against the deplorable working conditions which supposedly existed in the camps a bundle of high explosive wired to the ignition of the priests jeep had proved an effective rebuttal to his charges but there had never been anything like this strike leader knew that he should have rejected the commission out of hand his team wasnt even btes first choice and he knew it their fee would be sufficient for a comfortable retirement he would have a name again he might even publish his memoirs but none of these would have been reason enough hed thought he could back out if the training went badly there had been two weeks of briefings that resembled high school physics courses interrupted by weightlessness training in water tanks and in airplanes swooping through parabolic arcs the team had lost wolf three weightlessness sent him into screaming hysterics wolf three wasnt good enough it was too late then strike leader had accepted the challenge the lure of deep space had entered his soul via american movies with subtitles and star trek episodes and moonraker and star wars but strike leader didnt know that he knew only what he felt a fiery anticipation of war in space one day it had to come strike leader ached for the glory of being first he checked the positions of wolves one and two they flanked him twenty meters to either side and he motioned them forward to form a rough triangle he watched them floating on their way backlit by the reddish flare of a rising sun a vista of eerie beauty a strangeness hed known only via science fiction movies and television a sensation hed probably never experience again he could be losing himself in the glory about him when an enemy took his life but there were other matters to distract him he was loaded down like a donkey the bulky inflated suit the massive mobility unit his weapon the narrowbeam radio poking from his helmet like a single huge ear every motion was an effort free fall or no he forced his attention onto his oxygen level the positioning of wolves one and two the violent work to come he fingered his weapon an automatic rifle capable of firing thirty rounds of explosive ammunition per second he felt confident that it would punch through five centimeters of fused aluminosilicate glass leaving the captain and crew of anansi splattered around the command module like so many squashed insects all that preparation for a few minutes of real work it was always that way unless things went wrong he wagged himself from side to side with his mobility harness giving it a last test his suittosuit link came to life strike leader this is wolf two i have visual contact willy ley this is strike leader what is your estimation of intercept time the voice from willy ley was thin and nervous strike leader did not much like the sound a weak man on transportation could ruin the most tightlyplanned operation approximately ninety seconds strike leader he could see anansi against an arc of earths horizon a wedge shape that wouldnt have covered a postage stamp but visibly growing he and his men fell toward the enemy like a handful of flung pebbles they should have had time to practice with the mobility units strike leader anansi is still under acceleration her speed relative to you is now approximately fifteen kilometers per hour eighteen twenty anansi was almost the size of an envelope now and as he watched she seemed to balloon in his sight frighteningly fast wolf one he barked move out he turned his mobility unit jets up to full and hot gas hissed forward past him anansis approach slowed slowed wolf two scrambling to get out of the path of the hurtling juggernaut triggered his jets in the wrong direction accelerating directly into it there was a brief squeal of pain followed by the shriek of a dying radio strike leader caught a brief glimpse of a dark hunchbackshape tumbling helplessly away limbs twitching spasmodically they should have had time to practice but strike leader himself was above anansis cargo bay firing attitude jets sideways then dropping between the curved double doors even as the jets continued to slow him he felt savage satisfaction he would make anansi suffer for this loss where was wolf one no sign anywhere he gritted his teeth hissing out a long string of filthy words transmuting his fear into smoldering anger the silence the total alienness of the surroundings had to be pushed far back back into a corner so that he could operate from the killing place he had found the killing place in the african desert he had found it in the jungles of brazil and the backroads of bolivia it was a place where the gentle emotions swirled out beyond the periphery of consciousness and the harsh feelingsfear anger lustcombined to burn a hole in his mind making a concentrated furnace a whitehot place where nothing existed except total commitment once he found the killing place he was set ready for whatever came but his own breath echoed in his ears and it sounded frightened even to him he peered into the bay hampered by the mobility pack he itched to take it off but didnt dare to quite yet strike leader shone a light down into the bay its dull white circle glanced off stacks of bundles lashed to the walls these were things his employers wanted otherwise he would have fired bursts in all directions as a simple precaution the shuttles didnt carry much in the way of weaponry but he had improvised death himself often enough to know to take no chances there were entirely too many shadows too much darkness which way was the airlock if they didnt let him through he had the explosive to blow the door clean off its hinges find out what the crew would do with a lungful of vacuum in fact with his backup men gone perhaps he should do that and to hell with their chance to surrender how would human beings die in vacuum his light caught a glimmer of something on the floor a trap he stayed motionless while he studied it two rows of metal disks and a glint in the air right in front of him like a line of spiderweb where sunlight caught it a thread anchored to the floor and stretching up into the blackness beyond could this this be the cable that his employers were after he almost laughed and the sudden absurdity wiped away much of his tension and he found himself calm once again now then to business he headed for the airlock door there was weight here minute weight different from earth and different from what he had learned of free fall therefore he walked with care aware that a trained enemy might have the advantage an unfamiliar voice spoke over his suits speaker saying in english power in the back of the cargo bay two lights went on to either side of him there were silent explosions and he automatically dropped to the ground or tried to the reflexive maneuver left him hugging his knees and tumbling in midvacuum even in midtumble he tried to orient to bring his weapon to bear as the floor spun past his line of sight but his vision was clouded filled with white mist that belched from both sides at once and he fired blind damn where were they he saw a flash of light and twisted clumsily stifling a scream as something punched through the fog at him streaking past his chest at ferocious speed the second flash took strike leader full in the side before he ever saw it he was smashed back into a wall of cases dazed surprised to be alive then he heard the sucking whistle looked down at the fluttering burn hole in his suit and knew that he wasnt the urge for selfpreservation warred with a need to deal death strike leader tried to compromise he covered the hole with one arm while the assault rifle chattered in his other hand cargo crates erupted in showers of metal and plastic the cloud of carbon dioxide crystals fragmented boiling up out of the open hatch until the entire bay was frosted with thinning wisps of vapor one burst before strike leader realized he was still leaking his ears spewed air they felt like ice picks had been jabbed into them now he used both arms to block the burnhole too late his body tried to expand like a balloon irresistable pressure in belly and guts and lungs his sphincters wouldnt hold the agonized fart the explosion of foamy vomit across his faceplate but he did try to hold his breath his instructors had said that was a mistake he remembered that when he felt his lungs tearing apart he thrashed bouncing off the floor and upward he tried to sip air from his hissing recycler but it was still thinner than what was in his lungs his arms were still trying to block the burn hole to hold nearvacuum confined in his suit blind deaf nearly senseless he felt himself expanding without limit he had faced death in reality and in fearful dreams but never like this with his scream silenced and his guts still trying to empty him further the humiliation was too much to bear the first battle in space and his unarmed victims had killed him thank god nobody knew his name fifteen pendulum marion stepped out from between two stacks of cargo crates he was shaking badly right next to his hiding place strike leader had made a direct hit shattering a sack of viscous fluid it formed itself into rough globules floating through the bay like dark amber soap bubbles one floated toward his faceplate boiling sluggishly expanding he brushed it away with the tip of his flare gun hoping that it wasnt any kind of corrosive thomas are you all right at the opposite wall there was movement as one of the carefully wrapped bundles was pushed aside the little ion tech looked up at the drifting body of strike leader there was a note of savage satisfaction in thomas voice we got him i cant believe it we actually got him tommy is everything through down there what happened only one came down janet did you see what happened to the other two one rammed us probably regretted it i cant find the third any damage are either of you hurt thomas looked marion over then scanned the cargo bay the air was filled with vapor and dust and speckles of blasted metal of perhaps three hundred stacked and labeled boxes about twenty had been damaged thomas probed around in one of the boxes pulled out a handful of shattered nylon gears its pretty bad down here but it could be a lot worse im not hurt marions not hurt weve lost some cargo but it looks like the boxes absorbed the bullets maybe saved us a broached hull if thats all thats good news ley is just sitting there theyve been eating up a lot of fuel and about now they must be making some tough decisions marion laughed id like to be in on the vote what do we do now weve lost about eighty miles altitude janets voice changed lowering almost to a growl well wellwilly ley seems to be dropping out of the game at least theyre dropping off my scope good that leaves us with brasilia i wouldnt think theyre as dangerous given they were supposed to take us down to earth still hovering around the cable pod right and burning fuel every time they want to get close what have they got in mind theyve got seven hours to do something thomas said lets be careful i want to do any cleanup we can and then get back out of this suit good enough see you when youre through anansi flemings voice carried concern fear and anger across a quarter million miles of emptiness pulling janet out of a halfdoze nudging her back toward useful thought read you angel things are getting a little wiry lost track for a second i wont let it happen again cant sleep she wiped her forehead found it already dry she watched the sweeping arc on the radar screen delineate two tiny blips brasilia is way out of camera range almost off the scope willy ley is closer but doesnt seem to wantto play any more it was two and a half secondsthe lightspeed gapbefore falling angels elder statesman said i dont blame them now weve received verification that brasilia and ley were both under lease to bte i should have trusted kellys feelings sir never mind what is important is that its all out in the open now that youve broken radio silence we will communicate with oyama construction on this and that will get things moving on earth there was a dampening sorrow to his voice you know nobody would have dared try such a thing while we were part of nasa the whole world knows how helpless we are maybe i janets fingernails grated on the metal of the control display she could finish the thought for him maybe i shouldnt have bucked the system too late now were clay pigeons for anyone who wants what weve got no doctor she snapped weve done what we had to do we have to fight and we have to win or theyll roll all over us next time yes sorry fleming had taken savage shocks in the last few hours dexter stonecyphers death the crippling of anansi the bandit spacecraft all had taken their toll his voice had thinned until it seemed an old mans youve described your mode of descent and our computers back you it can be done but youll need emergency landing facilities crash nets ambulance fire trucks we can still make okinawa i see no reason to change plans fine but well set up your alternate sites i want no mistakes you people are coming back dammit im not losing any more of you janet felt her lips curling into a smile and forgot her fatigue you wont goodbye doctor hold the fort and he was gone a light blinked on the board airlock in use thomas and marion were back she heard them talking on the lower level garbled words that seemed a mixture of serious discussion and morbid humor janet was starting to realize how tired she was how long had it been since she had slept twenty hours something like that but in spite of the danger and the almost intolerable stress she felt absurdly happy that the three of them were working so well together tommy seemed more alive and spontaneous than he had in months and marion well marion seemed very good at following directions but a little weak on establishing them she smiled sourly a hell of a time to be making comparisons between exlover and soontobeex husband or is it after all i put marion aboard husband and lover and me all cozy in a tiny shuttle cabin millions of miles from any distraction theoretically what would a good shrink make of that janet watched her hands shake felt her fingers curling as if caressing a cigarette funny havent wanted tobacco in years thomas was first up the ladder and he nodded to her what do you think did we get all three of them we may never know i cant find that third bandit if hes falling free hell be a hundred miles down by now maybe he got back to willy ley anyway all we have to worry about is brasilia marion eased into his seat and janet couldnt help but appreciate the grace with which he moved free fall was paradise for the lazy but it was marions element too she checked the air temperature expecting to find that it had risen a few degrees then realized that it was just her my god am i turned on thats absurd how much more cable is there thomas hand on her arm made her start his fingers were hot ahh come on focus your mind woman weve unreeled about a hundred and ten kilometers already if nothing else goes wrong well be in the atmosphere in six hours cut the cable and fly in japan in seven hours good i think ive had about all of this i want thomas rubbed at his eyes i feel like my glands have been pumping me full of greek fire somewhere down there i must be tired unto death but its a little hard to find you know marion looked at thomas curiously the mans face was full of shallow creases that hadnt been there a day ago and a haunted look had deepened his eye sockets he could have been five years older when he moved there was a tightskinned caution about him as if he thought his shell might burst i tell you what marion said impulsively when we get to tokyo i want to buy the three of us the biggest steaks weve had in years not that freezedried muck at falling angel but three fearsome slabs of kobi beef he could taste it almost a true hallucination beerfattened dripping with sizzling juice garnished with slivered quickfried vegetables wokked thomas i dont care if they ever got enough exercise as long as theyre fresh thomas guffawed and swung at him and the three laughed together the laugh fading to quiet as they really looked at each other for the first time janet clucked sadly were quite a trio arent we here we are three intelligent creative people who can start from nothing and whip a billiondollar conglomerate and we cant even sort our own lives thomas smile winked off a bit then flashed back crooked now im better with things than people janet i dont have anyone to blame but me really he reached out to squeeze marions arm cant blame you either janet is a lot of lady id probably do pretty much what you did oh thats ridiculous marion said peevishly youd never be able to deal with a sometime woman youd want to propose just like you did the first time thomas opened his mouth and janet shushed him in protest wait a minute what is this group therapy at feet why not marion wondered six hours to go dangling like an ambitious spider psychoanalysis can be fun janet seemed to struggle for words oh what the hell tommy marion i owe you both an apology i think maybe i wanted the two of you here with me why because i hate to fail dammit and i failed with you tommy i couldnt ever compete with your machines maybe i thought if you saw me interacting with marion if you could really see that it was over feel that it was over by the dull light in the cockpit she looked haggard the brilliant gold of her hair washed out into a pale straw marion gave a low whistle i guess i could have figured something you pressured me hard hum i was supposed to be on exhibit and dexter for a referee maybe the floor surged up against thomas velcro slippers and his hand snaked out for the back of the control chair before he realised what it meant oh shit it was just getting interesting they felt it too the floor pressing up against their feet then easing marion opened his mouth and the floor surged again its sticking and releasing and sticking what the the pressure eased to a tenth gravity surged eased away marion said someones on the cable pod trying to jam the cable or cut it the floor surged again held for several seconds they waited it out it eased off slowly thomas said id guess they dont have the tools were talking brasilia the goddam treacherous dove that was going to take us down from heaven any obvious weapons any special tools for hijackers wouldnt they be aboard willy ley where we couldnt notice them cutting into the cable pod would be a tremendous job maybe a torch would cut the cable but they wont do that either because they want it so youre right theyre trying to jam it dammit no they cant get aboard the cable pod they cant match orbits janet protested dont you see the cable pod isnt in an orbit its hanging from the sky like another spider under tidal gravity if the floor surged thomas kept talking one bandit got aboard us i think they put someone aboard the cable pod now what could he use to jam the cable with that line running out at janet you said forty meters per second itd cut through steel easy something harder than steel then synthetic diamond or sapphire the faceplate from a pressure suit and it is cutting through cutting notches in the wedge cant you feel it the poor bastard has to keep pulling the wedge out and jamming it in again different ghost of a smile on thomas face not any more janet said check the altimeter weve stopped into the silence marion asked how far down are we janet a hundred and sixty kilometers below our original orbit three hundred and twenty from the cable pod thats it brasilias jammed the cable were stuck earths horizon rose into view past janets head paused then began to set the configuration was swinging in a vast arc a pendulum isolated in space weighted at each end swinging from its center well marion said slowly what next nobody answered cut the cable marion suggested hope were low enough to drop into the atmosphere give the bandit on the cable pod a hell of a shock hell rise so high that brasilia wont be able to rescue him and still get down no because thomas was shaking his head we dont have to hope he said we can do the math but i already know the answer were not low enough or slow enough janet asked tommy how much range do we have on the mobility units he barked laughter nothing like enough id never make it up beneath them earth was a hazy blue sheet with a subtly curved horizon close enough to taste janet bit her lip painfully hard then slammed her fist down on her knee no we cant be beaten now tommy isnt there something some way to get up to that pod im stale im out of ideas janet im sorry he looked miserable hollow as if he were collapsing in on himself not so fast marion said weve got some time brasilia cant do anything they probably wouldnt cut the cable even if they could they may have to wait for turnaround time on willy ley have it bring up special tools a missile maybe blow us away and collect the cable but weve got hours he was trying to project hope in his voice and his thinnish face but janet knew it was mostly bluff thomas eyes were focussed on some distant point as if something marion had said had stuck in his mind rather than just pouring through the mesh he folded his hands and set his chin on laced fingers feeling their eyes hearing their silence as they let him think presently he asked exactly what are we carrying in all those crates its all equipment for handling the cable lets get an inventory janet brought the list up from the main computer displayed it on the center screen any idea what youre looking for no cable collars epoxy her eyes scanned the list lubricant motorized cutters pulleys staples tackle thomas cut in tackle give me the specs tackle as in block and tackle janet tickled the computers memory as in fishing tackle id say the image looked like a cross between a geared fishing tackle and a cclamp no its for the construction workers they can rappel down or climb along the cable with it his gaze was reflective tommy janet realized what her husband was thinking and objected instantly you cant pull yourself along three hundred kilometers of cable that gripper isnt even motorized doesnt need to be the gear ratio is enormous look at it just like the cutters no i dont like it well have to find another way theyll see you coming not from brasilia they wont ill be too small and they wont be anywhere near the cable pod most of the time whoever theyve got on the cable wont have radar ill fall on him like a bomb marion asked why do you keep saying no me janet needs you for the landing damn it tommy she was screaming before she realized it caught herself clumsily youre not expendable not at all id swear that you keep manipulating things so that you have to take all the risks except except that thats not quite you either marion grunted aloud maybe it is janet i think that you had better tell this man that im the one with the muscles itll take maximum muscle thomas no its almost zero gee and when i get past the midpoint i can slide down hey do you think i want to play hero i know where my priorities are thats all marion stared at him i bet you do i wouldnt blame you for wanting a white hat janet if you know where your own priorities are tell this man that you love him janets mouth was numbly open as she tried to see through thomas mask to the workings within janet will you tell him your husband is about to go and commit suicide to get your approval oh cut it out thomas snapped then fell silent tommy tommy look at me he wouldnt he glared at the floor as if his life depended on it see marion started up from his chair this time i go wait just a minute marion thomas looked up maybe my motivations are mixed up but itll still take two pilots to land this bulletriddled bombblasted crippled wreck assuming its possible at all no amount of macho theatrics can change that if either of you has any real reasons why i should be here instead of up there id be glad to hear them tommy janet said softly i love you he smiled and she knew she had said the right thing but o god the timing because thomas said i guess thats as good a reason as any to go isnt it youll die you cant carry enough air the survival hut on gabriel was blown to shreds what are you going to breathe marion breathes too listen were hanging here like a piсata waiting for the brasilians to take potshots at us we have to take the initiative and unless i get a better suggestion this is it he looked at the copilot whose eyes were squeezed shut marion anything no i thought not id better get going janet got up marion take charge here i want to help tommy get suited up sure thomas was already thinking through the fastest way to find the tackleso many damaged crateswhen he heard janet lifting the ceiling grid into place behind her she shook her head and her hair fluffed out in a pale halo framing a face that was drawn but softened with concern she pushed herself down from the ladder with practiced ease guiding herself over to him her voice was almost timid have you have you replaced the recycler element youll want as much time as possible before damn she stopped herself in midsentence his suit still hung out on the rack not yet cleaned or deodorized and she ran her hands over it a dull wordless ache emptying her chest her husband checked over his equipment carefully sorting out the necessities for his last few hours of life she could almost see him checking off items on his mental filecards he had withdrawn far into that quiet lonely place where no one ever trespassed tommy she reached out to grasp his shoulder the muscle under his shirt tensed reflexively and he ignored her until she dug her fingers into his skin painfully hard look at me when he turned his eyes were a little too bright and she realized thankfully that the man within him was very much alive and that only his selfcontrol kept the sheen of tears from encapsuling his eyes i guess this is it janet he was having trouble meeting her gaze his speech was a little thick i just want you to know how much i appreciate you oh tommy cant you say it her voice was low and husky and she was very near him now her lips a breath away her arms entwining his shoulders like thick warm vines cant you he turned his face away but his body betrayed him arcing forward to press against her his mouth worked but nothing came out janet ran her fingers gently through his hair and said shhh and something inside thomas de camp broke suddenly he was holding her and their lips were melting together and their hands were ripping velcro strips apart janet gasped shocked at the intensity with which they gripped each other as if they were two seventeenyearold virgins intoxicated with first lust then her legs were around him at the hips and she had kicked off her shoes she gripped the netting with her fingers and toes forcing his back into it as they tried desperately to say all of the things that had never been said knowing that it was too little too late it was too volcanic to last more than a matter of minutes seconds really but time was an artificial construct far from her reality when janet opened her eyes and looked at her husband he laughed uncertainly and licked at a moist patch on her neck well ill have to volunteer for suicide duty more often she wanted to hit him hurt him shut him up anything to keep those last few moments from slipping away too quickly but his dark joke had worked made her laugh against her will and the mood broke there was nothing left to do but complete the work that had to be done so they cleaned the inside of the pressure suit in savage haste and plugged in an unused breathingair system and then she helped him into it and made his lastminute checks for him she kissed him a last time and sealed his helmet into place sealed him into his tiny deathchamber and watched him cycle through the airlock watched the light blink to red then she straightened her clothes and wiped her face with a premoistened disposable towelette and with a final glance at the unblinking red light she climbed back up to the control level to see through the rest of her role sixteen maneuvering the cable pod was coming into sight through brasilias windows a bright dot above and behind the shuttle catching up fast burgess watched his distance decreasing in the radar scan took a guess and fired a burst from the forward jets this is driving me nuts he said i do not expect you to moor to the pod correra spoke with what he probably thought of as commendable patience i accept that that is impossible since ground control confirms your claim only come close observe then call diaz learn his situation a good ground team might have worked out a computer program for the cable pods peculiar acceleration in weeks or months never in hours burgess was flying without computers for the first time since flight school it bothered him as much as correra did he tuned the radio ricardo captain burgess is that you who else ragged breathing i am very much alone here how long has it been two hours more i thought id done pretty well im in an elliptical orbit with an apogee that puts me right next to you every two hours i could pick you up now if i had to he said ignoring correros violent headshake whats your situation the exhaustion showed in diazs voice the cable is not moving i can barely see it but i tied a strip of cloth to it the cable was cutting grooves in the cutter blade ive been using for a wedge i have had to shift it and pound it back in over and over my arms are ready to drop off no problems with the suit in a few minutes i should change tanks that will give me another four hours of oxygen is there any reason for me to stay here now the cable pod looked like a plume of desert rock sculpted by wind and flood floating against the night in clear defiance of common sense at the base of the wide blunt fins a light glimmered in shadow diaz watching to see that the cable didnt pop his wedge correra was shaking his head again burgess simply handed him the microphone correra returned his look of contempt while he spoke into it you will remain on duty until our next pass then return he handed the mike back and burgess turned if off before he spoke i dont see the point in this weve stopped the cable anansi cant go down and cant go up were just waiting for willy ley to come back three hours ago it was impossible for them to alter their orbit now it is impossible for them to counterattack tchaa how long must we wait for willy ley burgess mulled the problem landing and safety inspection for the shuttle would be quick only about an hour maintenance loading in the new payload equipment to convert the cable pod back into a reentry vehicle maybe a replacement computer for the package preprogrammed for descent to brazil bte must have planned all this out well in advance then enormous cranes would pull willy ley erect where it would be mated to its new solid fuel boosters and external tanks that process would take a little over a hundred hours finally the entire assembly would be moved to the launch pad for final systems check and fueling and launched totalcall it a hundred fifty hours you may collect diaz on the next pass will that cost you fuel it wont maroon us we have to be very careful though diaz laughed an ugly sound we cannot even see this cable this thread my employers want yet it supports a spacecraft weighing many tons and hangs it from thin air who would believe such a thing anyone with a serious interest in the space program correro moved up to take diazs seat he looked out at the gray mass of the cable pod dwindling now pulling ahead in its pendulum swingand chuckled you think that you are the great man because you know all of these things he waved his arms at the panels and dials surrounding them and out the windows to the stars beyond he shook his head poor foolish man do you really think that these things matter no you are nothing but a driver a highlypaid educated servant the real decisions the real power will always be with the men who understand money and we will always own men like you there was a time when burgess would have smashed correro in the face instantly obliterating the shiteating grin in a welter of blood and shattered teeth but through the years the wild fierce fire had dimmed to a steady glow and he sat hearing the words echo in his head and did nothing but knot his moist hands into fists he looked at the clock three hours since willy ley left the arena two and a half sincediaz had jammed the cable were there laws covering space piracy the only spot of amusement in the whole nasty affair was the length of time it had taken ground control to figure out what anansi was doingand tell correro anansi was using the tidal effect to move without rockets burgess hoped he had been able to keep his face straight bte ground control had talked to correro for nearly ten minutes in portugese and correro hadnt understood anything finally correro had thrust the microphone at burgess and the harried man on the ground had spit thominably pronounced highly technical english at him in the desperate hope that burgess could then explain it to correrro on the thrust of a pair of limpet motors anansis crew had set the ship moving slightly lower and slower than the cable pod dropping anansi had picked up velocity and drawn ahead by the time the slack cable drew taut the tension pulled the cable pod forwardanddown the shuttle backwardandup slowing anansi had dropped accelerating the cable pod had climbed to higher orbit the two masses pulled apart unreeling more cable while still maintaining the tension that pulled backward on anansi forward on the cable pod the peculiar motion would stymie any attempt the bte shuttles might make to match orbits granted the center of mass of the system was in a classic newtonian orbit but nothing was at that point except a stretch of invisibly thin thread the pod and anansi were not in orbits at all they were hanging from the cables endpoints still pulling apart presently anansi would be low enough to cut loose and fall and burgess was saying wait wait i dont understand its like lifting yourself by your own bootstraps it canthah but if the shuttle is being pulled back how can it go faster holding the laughter inside himself while the bte man shouted that anything in a lower orbit had to move faster you idiot getting louder and less coherent until he was screaming in portugese words burgess hadnt heard even in the bordellos burgess had finally hung up then tried to explain to correro using a lightpointer and one of the screens to draw diagrams what a grand joke and the best part of it was that not correro nor olivera nor diaz nor anyone else knew for certain that burgess had held out on them eric diazs voice was blurring a bit with distance is anansi moving ill see burgess swung the radar system down and presently found anansi against a limb of the earth he watched presently he said not moving not that i can see why the line its vibrating that scrap of cloth is trembling i thought maybe my god wh there was a blast of static then a dull machine squeal ricardo burgess cut in the noise suppressors and got nothingno breathing no words correro was at the window beside him straining to see but the cable pod was not much more than a dot damn at the very least his radios gone out what happened a touch of genuine panic tautened correros slender face anansi has counterattacked somehow they must have got somebody up that line butbut how its over three hundred kilometers burgess shook his head appreciatively however he did it its a hell of an achievement the static over the line was an irritation now no longer interesting he reached out and flicked the headphone off correro seethed you must go out and kill that man have to catch him first here burgess tapped the radar readout the cable pods rising too fast anansis man must have kicked out the wedge take us back yeah buckle in fuel supply be damned he couldnt abandon diaz though he was halfsure diaz must be dead a touch of the cns motors lined brasilias nose with its now dotsized target burgess fired the main motors and watched the fuel registers while the shuttles orbit altered when radar said that the cable pod was approaching he cut the motors he would graze the cable pods path now and continue outward unless he used yet more fuel brasilia carried the big supplementary tanks used for longer missions they filled half the cargo bay but he could still be marooned like anansi but with no cable to save them lost in the sky with correro for company until willy ley could rescue him we must kill him or everything is ruined burgess tskd unsympathetically not we must go out and rescue ricardo diaz wheres your sense of priorities correros face darkened and his lips worked in silence then diaz is unimportant in comparison with the cable thats a pretty nasty way to screw your partner correro made a spitting motion he was as ignorant as he knew as little as you burgess enjoyed watching the perspiration bead on correros forehead now you must go out there and rescue diaz and kill the man who had attacked him yes no burgess scratched at his beard then held up a hand ticking off fingers first i was hired to fly not fight second the mission was a rescue mission and ill be damned if ill be a party to murder he bent another finger down and leaned closer to correro and third i dont like you never have i dont like your nasty little smile and i dont like your breathit smells like youve been eating raw snails but i can tell you what i do like what i like is the fact that there isnt a damned thing you can do about it correro leaned away from burgess as if the pilot were an angry cobra shock froze his eyes for a few seconds then his hand plunged into his flight jacket emerging with a gasdriven dart gun do not tell me that the bullet will go through you and pierce the hull of this craft that would be a lie nowyou will either do as i say or i will kill you now an unfeigned smile wound its way onto burgess mouth almost he laughed aloud and who will fly you home iill wait for willy ley to come back the words trailed away as correro was remembering how very far he was from sao luis right burgess said coldly and what will you do if our friend out there decides to attach a few ounces of explosive to our windows i wouldnt put it past them on the whole anansis crew has proven damned resourceful he stood and moved carefully over to correro whose face had bled from ruddy to ashen the man seemed about to collapse i tell you what correro he said you go out there and kill our intruder youll find a suit and mobility pack on the lower deck im sure youve had an hour or more of free fall training youll figure it out the two were close together now almost breathing each others breath and correros finger was trembling on the trigger were almost close enough now youll have to move fast burgess said and by the way correro whether you stay here or go out into the sky he pointed at the window when correros gaze followed the gesture burgess moved twisting the gun hand inward with his right hand punching correro brutally hard with his left the bte man bounced into the wall eyes crossing and burgess hit him again in the stomach then almost casually he returned to his seat and watched correro gag when the man was well enough to hear burgess finished the thought where was i oh yes no matter where you are dont ever point a gun at a man unless youre ready to use it and friend you werent ready correro tried to find something to say but the hatred and fear clogged his throat and only inarticulate sounds forced their way through finally he climbed down from the control level arid closed the grill behind him burgess examined the knuckles on his left hand they were bruised and beginning to ooze blood but by god it had been worth it seventeen thin edge the cable was running freely again thomas dc camp stood on the tail of the cable pod looking up trying to find a scrap of bright cloth against a gibbous earth he couldnt even in these few seconds of freedom the cable had carried it too far mission accomplished he wondered how long he had to live at best he would run out of air it was really as simple as that his recycler could only handle his carbon dioxide output for another hour or so hypoxia wasnt a terrible way to die if he didnt watch his gauges he might not even realize that he was dying and merely slip away into delirium and the final sleep with a minimum of discomfort but before that happened brasilia could have a nasty ace up her sleeve how many men did she carry if the brazilian offer of a ride home had been genuine then they must have had room to house the full crew of anansi four including stonecypher that put three men aboard now to bring their homeward load to seven the maximum for a shuttle unless brasilia carried a pressure can in her cargo bay that would put his calculations into the toilet an army could swarm all over him at any moment he sighed and looked up into swirled patches of white cloud and blue ocean earth was close enough big enough to serve as a noonday sky but for the blackness around the rim day overhead and night underfoot and an arc of night encroaching on the day anansi was up there somewhere invisibly remote lost in her own battles beyond the reach of his suit radio gone forever i hope you make it sweetheart his eyes picked out patterns in the clouds there a cluster of mushrooms there a mountain range seen from his fathers private plane and there was janets smile a thing of sunshine and light rain glowing at him from the sky i love you he said and blushed in the dark wishing that he had been able to bring himself to say that to her in person in time the clumsy fluttering of a suited leg caught his attention the lone bandit was less than ten yards away clamped to a climbing rung by a cable gripper around his airhose thomas had dropped squarely on him knocked him cold as a cucumber had barely stopped him from tumbling bonelessly into the starry night thomas cable grippers had him moored to the rung before he woke enough to struggle at that the bandit could give thanks that thomas had spent the last thirty kilometers or so decelerating that was tricky the tackle had held him to the cable with a loop of more cable when orbital dynamics were trying to pull him away drop him behind hed pushed a block of tungsten carbide into the loop as a friction brake the cable had etched holes in the block hed had to keep moving it as he fell otherwise he would have hit the bandit like a real bomb at first the bandit had struggled flailing arms and legs in a helpless jitterbug of panic as he tried to reach the cable grippers now if it werent for the intermittent twitch thomas would suspect the man was dead nothing to do but wait a white triangle smaller than a pinhead at first was growing at the limb of the earth anansi not bloody likely brasilia to the rescue count on at least one man armed to the teeth one or many but not two two would leave brasilia empty and falling away count on one and what were his options thomas hefted the automatic rifle empty now but still a credible bluff no sane man would risk an impact from one of the explosive shells he could play for time until until his air ran out no that was no way to think of it until anansi was safe any other options no bte bandit was likely to have more hours in space than a falling angel man the bandit would be clumsy he wouldnt have brasilias help either brasilia couldnt stay alongside the pod itself half of it was starkly outlined in sunlight the other half as deeply shadowed as the lunar night perfect for a deadly game of hide and seek he checked his oxygen again a short game brasilia turned as she neared the cargo bay yawned in his face there was no pressure can the sun glared into the cargo bay and showed him a manshape moving within in another minute thomas could see that the man carried something suspiciously like the rifle willy leys sodier had used to make a shambles of anansis cargo bay thomas pictured one of those shells impacting with his own body and a bubble of sour gas expanded painfully in his stomach he began climbing around to the dark side of the pod slipping into deep shadow brasilias soldier rose out of the cargo bay when the shuttle was fifty meters from the pod immense in his sight now the spacecraft hovered close for a few seconds then began to drop away again diminishing as swiftly as she had grown thomas fiddled with his radio caught something homed in the new man was talking under his breath the few words he could make out were curses apparently aimed at the backpack itself thomas watched from shadow as the man clumsily attempted to change course falling past the cable pod coming back too fast turning forgetting that it would take jets to slow him well well sending out the rookies were they thomas began to hope he would need to know what the newcomer wanted the cable ultimately and thomas life or the crippled conspirator the sun was moving and he dared not forget where the shadows lay he swung out to the shadowed side of a fin and climbed out along its length hidden from the captured bandit at the end of the fin he extended himself out on one arm to peer back it felt as if he were holding a tenkilo weight at arms length a slow ache brasilias warrior reached his ally where thomas had moored him just out of reach of the cable they touched helmets briefly the newcomers radio gave thomas two blurred voices speaking portugese good thomas had wondered if his prisoner was alive the newcomer checked the clamps holding the air hose to the foot rung he twisted at it then glared up at the pod it would be simple to free the man thomas reflected but only for one who could reach around at an angle impossible for the prisoner himself thomas released his grip on the foot rung and wasted a precious burst of fuel floating out into the sunlight he aimed his rifle squarely at the newcomers head and waited to be seen from the reaction a sudden thrashing jerk thomas could guess at the look on the mans face surprise then panic his enemy did a slowmotion scramble around the curve of the pod then cautiously emerged again this time weapon first and squeezed off a long burst a few rounds struck the external skin of the pod exploding with flashes of light and dust thomas was already gone back on the pods flank and climbing down toward the nose he smiled grimly to himself would his clumsy foe see through the bluff thomas liked the other side of the question better could the man afford to believe the gun was empty in silence thomas completed his climb to the bottom of the cable pod now he was anchored by two rungs the shadow of the pod had swung around it was blacker than black now blocked from sunlight and earthlight too he could hear his enemys breathing but not see him the sound though ragged breathing exertion thomas sensed it getting clearer closer not climbing though there were no soft rhythmic grunts to indicate that kind of activity even at the tenth of a gee that was effective aboard the cable pod there should have been some change in the breathing mobility pack then he bet himself that he could take a quick look a novice couldnt operate a mobility pack and aim an automatic rifle simultaneously he climbed around the shadowed back of the pod silently thanking the engineers for setting so many rungs into its rock slag surface he swung from hand to hand as if moving through falling angels jungle gym and came around into the light just in time to see his enemy approach the man was drifting slowly down the flank of the pod jets popping from time to time a chill rippled through thomas muscles he hadnt known how ominous the pressure suits could look faceless almost shapelessly inhuman more like a demon in white than thomas cared to consider for an instant he was frozen in terror feeling the bullet explode somewhere in his body hearing his own final gobbling scream of fear and pain dwindle into vacuum then he snapped out of it his enemys faceplatewas a silvery reflective oval but the man beneath was human human and fallible and mortal and if thomas had to die he was going to take one more of the bastards with him as the man dropped past him toward the nose of the pod thomas turned loose and used his mobility pack to ascend the sunlit side easy just thrust like hell brake when youre behind a fin reach out and grab a rung thomas had all the fuel he needed the bandit would keep reserve fuel to bring himself back to brasilia the captives head turned when thomas reached him his faceplate was misted with moist warm breath something wrong with his recycler the man didnt look the part of a villain he looked young and sick and semiconscious thomas wrung the pity from his mind how the hell would he know what a villain looked like last trump dexter either this works or ill be seeing you soon thomas retreated back onto the shadowed side of a horizontal fin and hugged himself close against the leading edge the earth was a shrinking crescent darkness felt good safe he turned up his radio this is thomas de camp hailing brasilia crewman i know that you intend to kill me im warning you letting hysteria creep into his voice if you proceed any further i will kill your partner there was no reply of course dont think im bluffing ive got at least two ways to rupture his suit and one to smash his faceplate still no answer thomas breathed deeply he couldnt see the injured man nor the cable running out on its spool where was anansi how long until she could cut herself free he waited his enemy should be discovering the depth of shadow thinking it a wonderful place to hide creeping upward to deal death to anansis champion im warning you thomas said heavily dont try any tricky stuff he only had to allow the hysteria to creep into his voice his fingers were on the mobility pack keys if he saw the bandit in the wrong place he would jet away at once and try to dodge behind the hull he heard puffing in his radio this time the bandit was climbing there very close climbing the hull with one hand on his gun a faceless pudgy shape barely visible in shadow he climbed past thomas and kept moving thomas said forty seconds mister im waiting to hear from you he saw the man pause heard his breath sobbing through the filters the helmeted head turned this way and that but didnt see the curved edge of thomas helmet he kept moving thomas swung beneath the fin and climbed after him he said ever see explosive decompression your friend will look like someone stuck an air hose into his guts and switched it up full was that colorful enough the manshape froze then continued its jerky onearmed climb the ion tech climbed after him gaining correro transferred the gun to his left hand he could guess what that would do to his accuracy but strained muscles were shrieking in his back left shouder left arm he continued climbing past the fins using only his right arm the mobility pack threw him off pulled him backward he slowed here was the curve of the cable pods tail and anansis man would be beyond the curve standing or crouched possibly with an elbow crooked around diazs throat looking in an unknown direction correros heartbeat thundered in his ears he surged over the curve gunandhelmet first and saw diaz still anchored to the rung where was the american correro completed his motiontoo hard so that for a moment he floatedand dropped next to diaz where was the american diaz hadnt reacted sick dead at least his airhose was intact correro had almost whooped for joy to find diaz alive now he was concerned diazs wellbeing was precious to him was diaz in shape to fly a shuttle back to brazil where was the american fled in fear correro gave a harsh bark of derision he knew itthe americans gun was empty it was a bluff now he could jam the cable and call for brasilia the rest wouldbe easyif diaz was in shape to fly brasilia that would mean the the pig burgess had no further business sucking up good air correro would take great pleasure in cutting burgess throat working the blade in until it grated at the cartilage correros mouth and nose still stung from the shuttle pilots blow and the thought of bloody vengeance helped dull the tickle of fear at the back of his neck he reached into his belt and extracted a sliver of laboratory sapphire and the hammer necessary to wedge it into the cable opening he could see the cable a thread of silver lit by the sun reaching infinitely high to earth itself it seemed he moved forward something massive slammed into his back he tried desperately to turn around and couldnt he heard have a closer look you bastard he tried to lean backward to dig his feet in his feet flailed in midair the cable was unreeling at better than a hundred kilometers an hour at that point at first correro felt no more pain than that of a paper cut the cable didnt tug at flesh or spray blood about like a bandsaw blade would have it cut far more neatly but air spewed from around him and his body felt like it was exploding and his eyes crossed as they followed the silver thread it was inside his faceplate thomas had used the empty gun as a lever shoving it under the base of the bandits mobility pack and thrusting forward and up fear and rage had put all his considerably strength behind the maneuver too hard the thread was inches from his eyes when he braked himself he stared in horror at the two halves of his gun at cut metal surfaces that gleamed like mirrors he hurled them violently into the sky only an iron act of will kept his stomach from throwing unbreathable vomit into his helmet the bandit thomas looked for him and found him overhead a dark blob rising in a fog of gasses the cable hadnt turned him loose yet it was still reeling out through his corpse its minute friction pulling him upward what now mission accomplished he muttered nothing now except die then he heard slow laconic handclapping and a dry chuckle very good whoever you are youre a very clever man thomas looked around quickly saw nothing where are you about twenty kilometers ahead of you i think would you be burgess none other looks like a mexican standoff id say brazilian standoff maybe and not for long this is no quick quiet act of piracy any more by this time its all over the news services on earth oyama construction will have pressured the japanese consulate into making a formal protest to the brazilian ambassador japanese and american industry supply nearly twothirds of brazils electronics i doubt brazil will let this thing go on youre finished burgess accessory to attempted piracy sabotage and murder there was a long silence the air in thomas helmet smelled close and sour imagination he hadnt been out that long but hed been working himself unmercifully using up air you may not believe this burgess sounded a million kilometers away where was brasilia should be ahead falling back believe what i didnt know about all of this not when i took off i thought it was a legitimate rescue mission there was a snorting laugh of regret i did figure out some of what was going on once i got up here but i was in pretty deep by then and that bastard correro never mind from your voice i figure youre still pretty young maybe you wont understand this but brazil was the only spacegoing nation that would offer me a contract i just had to keep flying burgess made a sound like a punctured balloon whistling air oh what the hell its all blown now why bother talking about it hows diaz id say hes injured hes still breathing good burgess werent you still with nasa when you went to brazil yeah but i would have been grounded in two years brazil needed someone to fly and train and offered to let me fly until i was sixty an extra five years i felt like a condemned man given a last minute reprieve can you understand that burgess was losing control of his voice and thomas found himself a believer janet was right this was a man who loved the dream as much as any of them a foolish man perhaps but not a bad one or had the thickening air and the wish to believe dulled his mind what does it matter what is there to lose i can understand that thomas checked his air gauge and found it edging into the red not much time left at all you cant go home burgess the brazilian government will make you a scapegoat cant you see the headlines renegade american pilot indicted in piracy scheme bte might even kill you to cover their tracks i doubt that feel free thomas was gulping for air now and his chest was beginning to ache relax calm give the recycler a chance to keep up ill tell you this for sure youll never fly again in the silence that followed he spotted a dim distant winged shape brasilia ahead of him approaching tail first yeah i know listen im a kilometer away and closing youre the only one who can save diaz your life for his you take him and you jump ill pick you up that easy of course he was right theyd have to jump jump and trust the pilot of the killer ship thomas pictured two corpses abandoned evidence lost in the sky but he could make it a better bet burgess maybe theres a way out you can come over to falling angel brazil will never make reparations for the damage done by her shuttles all right then well take one of her shuttles in trade my god youre serious arent you dead serious theres an ion drive on its way here michael id guess we can push you back to lunar orbit well have to examine all of the evidence in the case but if youre clean i think that falling angel enterprises will be glad to have you and one more thingthere will be a lot of orbittoorbit runs no heavy geestresses i think you can count on an extra five years over what brazil promised you maybe more if youve got a healthy heart thomas was no longer sure that he was making sense his lungs strained at the soupy air his head whirled with hypoxia there was a tremulous childlike quality to burgess voice ive got to retrofire stand by can you promise i cant promise anything thomas screamed it all i can say is that if youre clean and we can prove it well want you and if youre not clean to hell with you just just let me die in peace there was another pause but brasilia closer now was blazing at her tail accelerating to match with the cable pod burgess gave a painfully long drawnout sigh you can jump any time now but take diaz he wasnt part of this mess either whats your name fella de camp thomas de camp why the hell does it matter i dont know because youre good you really are come aboard and well wait for your ion drive ship then you can take us both to falling angel and put us on trial id rather take my chances with lunatics than those marionette judges in brazil im not sure weve still got fuel to reenter anyway come on move thomas was already disentangling diaz the man was still alive which was more than thomas would be if he didnt get fresh air soon no air or not he was going to stay alive on sheer will power if need be youve got a deal burgess yeah youre right im good eighteen the descent of anansi one of the cablereinforced staples gave way and ripped free of the cargo bay anansi dropped like a piano marion braced against what must be a fifth of a gee by now found he had sprung out to the end of his short safety tether then the cable pulled taut against the next staple and anansi surged up at him he struck the floor on hands and knees a jolting fourpoint landingand a second staple flicked silently past his helmet the next staple held getting rough he said we lost a couple of stitches are you hurt no worried he peered through the hazy light at the zigzag pattern of cable and staples that anchored anansi at the end of a nowstatic cable if we lose about ten more we might rip ourselves loose which is fine but this kind of jerking around could snap the cable somewhere in the middle and that isnt good at all weve got to cut the cable now right any luck im still looking much of the debris solid and liquid had been left kilometers back it was easier to see his way around in the bay the damage from the exploding rounds had been terrible marion had been relashing broken crates into place with spare line while he searched still frayed edges and leaking contents dappled the interior of the shuttle bay the cutters have to be there marion remembered the assault with glowing shards of plastic crating material whirling off into space gears and liquids and bundles of fiber and entire pods floating free disappearing im not so sure any more we opened one crate of cable grippers and took two out and thomas took them both with him now the crate is gone and why would there be two crates of cable grippers why not just a bigger crate oh god what a mess at least tommy is safe i never expected that yeah better than that we won no matter what happens now the cables strung out over fourteen hundred kilometers and nobodys going to bring it back to earth in that condition now i only have to find a way to cut it just stay safe we dont need to prove were heroes weve done that he chuckled aye aye capn what was there to sever stonecypher cable there was sure as hell no way to break it it would slice through any sharp implement on anansi he was sure of that what did that leave what did thomas have among his tools pliers soldering tools a torch marion made his way back to the airlock stopping every so often to move the end of his safety tether anansi was steady as a rock except when a staple ripped away the cable must be under tremendous tension it would snap no telling where if something werent done he cycled through the lock unscrewed his helmet didnt bother removing the rest there ought to be a torch this was the locker where tools were kept for minor repairs hah cutting torch he shook it and the tanks sloshed full he paused to replace his oxygen tank before going out last bottle anansis air recycler would last another ten hours maybe and then theyd be breathing the oxygen in their pressure suits until that ran out light was dim in the cargo bay an attempt to save power for the air recycling plant but by watching the staples he knew exactly where the cable was at all times he didnt want to walk into the thing he remembered thomas description of what had happened to the bte enforcer and his blood ran cold how many had died for this cable four five and what would become of anansi if dexter stonecypher had done his job too well would they hang in earths upper atmosphere forever a bizarre monument to the technical wizardry of falling angel he attached his safety line to a grip and popped the torch on a pencilthin cone of incandescent gas projecting its seveninch length from the tip janet im about to try a torch if it actually cuts through were going to take a hell of a jolt and drop fast i suggest that we close the bay doors about halfway now so it wont take as long to seal them when we make our descent aye aye marion ill leave the line open he felt the floor vibrating and great shadows closed across the moon he asked just where do we want to be when the cable parts good thinking lets see we usually get almost a full orbit after retrofire but wed be entering slower this time so were passing over asia give it another five minutes then go the stars were creeping across the black opening in the bay doors marion trying to rest found himself looking at stonecyphers pressure suit something like a fat gray distorted mushroom stood out below stonecyphers ribs what could have caused shit a bullet must have exploded there and blood and flesh had foamed out marion whispered closedcoffin ceremony dexter id launch you overboard and give you a meteors funeral but i cant youre evidence anyway we got him marion what was that he jumped just talking to a friend janet a torch ought to cause singlecrystal iron fibers to lose their stability it had better they couldnt be rescued neither from above nor below hell theyd planned it that way if all of the staples ripped loose under cable tension anansi would fall they would enter the atmosphere at less than the normal reentry speed just as well given the shuttles chewedup condition of course once the cable was parted theyd have no further choice about where they landed if they timed it right they might even reach japan but marions intuition saw staples snapping loose one after another shock waves traveling along the cable until whiplash snapped pieces away at the far end until anansi entered the atmosphere trailing hundreds of kilometers of lethal thread he imagined it falling across the city in loops around buildings and cars and children time marion thought of starting at the furthest staple then changed his mind he didnt want to be near the next metal strip to give way it could jump up and crack his faceplate he shuffled back four staples and got to work in the intense light ofthe torch the cable showed as a dark hairline he applied the flame where the cable crossed the staple like the filament of a lamp the strand began to glow first a dull red then brightening to an eyenumbing white like the core of the torchs flame the zone of white spread along the cable to make a fiveinch strand of glowing line marion waited he was beginning to notice the heat he couldnt see the waste gasses from the torch but they swirled around him eating at his suit defeating his cooling system another staple snapped free and anansi dropped under him reflexively he switched the torch off the staple he could see it embedded in one of the bay doors the cable pulled tautand he saw a glarewhite thread disappearing between the bay doors the floor hit him and bounced him back to the end of his tether and left him floating falling he screamed in a reflex that true astronauts werent supposed to have then were falling janet close the bay doors i did it her voice was ecstatic you sure as hell did aye aye closing cargo bay doors get back in here and out of that suit and into your chair well be in the atmosphere in ten minutes he felt himself being tugged gently toward the nose away from the ladder as he climbed to the command level traces of atmosphere already never in his life had he stripped out of a pressure suit faster he hadnt even stopped to put slippers on janet had slipped coolly into her pilots personna her body was relaxed but poised hands moving smoothly and confidently on the controls her face looked old and her eyes were red and puffy but the only sign of discomfiture was the puzzled tone as she spoke into the microphone cant land on okinawa why not she snarled as the answer came back marion eased into his chair buckled himself in swiftly and fitted on his headphones a cultured japanese voice was speaking in carefully measured tones american embassy has verified it the landing strip in the ryukyu islands is under lease to nasa and the american air force they will allow you to land but your craft and cargo will be confiscated and you may be arrested marion groaned so now were the bandits jesus his eyes were checking readouts anansis shielding was beginning to warm up in the thin breath of earths atmosphere janet set her mouth her golden hair framed a face frozen in controlled anger what do you advise oyama your best option seems to be tokyo international we have emergency arrangements with them they have tactical air navigation and a vhf omnidirectional radio beacon i suggest you allow us to program your guidance computer for those coordinates she pondered for a second and a half then smiled grimly tsk no choice she turned to her copilot marion assist the programming well be landing in tokyo believe it or not a quick look at the guidance screen told her that they were starting to cross the tibetan plateau still better than eight hundred miles from japan she could make it they had the altitude and landing would be easier than nasas standard abort once around mode anansi flew with a tremor and a tendency to pull to the left she checked the external temperature and nodded silently it was up to degrees and climbing the nearvacuum was growing denser the heat shielding would be glowing cherry red the nose of the ship shrouded in an envelope of flame blasttorn tiles would be faling from the tail she could feel the ruptured oms tanks in the shuddering of the craft in anansis hairline loss of stability shards of metal would be melting she would not fail marion had done his part thomas had risked everything to do his and dear dead dexter stonecypher had won a greater victory than he could have imagined not one link in the chain had failed it was her turn to produce a stubbywinged fireball anansi dropped over the tibetan plateau toward distant japan nineteen transitions josef navarres of the legal firm of navarres navarres gomez and shapiro closed a hastilyprepared manilla file folder and peered across his desk at his client it was difficult to believe that this man was the same jorge xavier he had dealt with for so many years the shoulders were no longer square his hair was stringy untended his eyes seemed weak watery and without real focus he might not have slept in days and small wonder i believe navarres said leaning back in his chair meditatively that the file states the situation clearly mr xavier you have criminal and civil action being levied against you in local federal and international courts xavier nodded like a man who didnt actually understand at all his oncehandsome face seemed drained of blood and life he heard navarros words as through a deadening fog first of course are the charges that you bribed officials of the brazilian military and used government vehicles in an act of piracy which resulted in the loss of several lives if i had succeeded xavier said dully barely recognizing his own voice they would have taken my tax money and let it go at that navarres smiled noncommitally xavier was probably right but what of it be that as it may colonel olivera has made a full confession of his complicity apparently an attempt to save himself from a firing squad if it is any comfort i doubt hell succeed pity indeed now oyama construction acting on its own and in behalf of falling angel enterprises is suing bte and its board of directors on approximately twentythree counts of piracy theft murder but you know of these xavier nodded without speaking his tongue felt thick and gluey the united states government has protested the misuse of the shuttle vehicles they sold brazil and are postponing shipments of fuel and parts until a full investigation is completed their position seems to be that a branch of their government has been attacked to wit falling angel xaviers eyes did come up at that and he grimaced navarres said this along with the loss of the shuttle brasilia will cost brazil around seventy million dollars which will be subtracted from btes assets of course your personal funds have been frozen pending the outcome of the various suits and president castellon of bte has obtained a court order barring you from trespassing on any property belonging to the company navarres opened the folder again and browsed for a moment edson da silva has already fled the country and lucio giorgi is presently in a hospital in connection with heart problems apparently he has offered to make a full confession in exchange for a promise of leniency yes xavier scratched at his face as if pursuing an invisible insect i would expect that finally your wife has filed for divorce i think you might agree that that is the least of your problems now mr xavier navarres leaned forward the light from the window behind him forming a blurry halo what do you propose to do establishing a bond for your release has taxed the resources of my firm and i would like to know how you propose to repay us i am afraid that if some arrangement cannot be made we will not be able to represent you in what will doubtless be a protracted and expensive series of legal hearings xavier opened his mouth and closed it without saying a word he fought to find some rock to stand on some island of sanity in the midst of the confusion navarres face seemed to recede from view lost in a fog of doubt where had he failed how he had been so careful so very cautious he stared blankly at his fingernails shifting them slightly watching the overhead lights gleaming off in pinpoint glitter patterns he barely heard the telephone ring hardly noticed the deaths head look that came over navarres as he spoke quietly into the receiver that was building security mr xavier they have arrested a man in the underground parking garage he was attaching an explosive device to the ignition of your car they said he had a message for you tell xavier that hoveida can wait i see xavier sank into his seat body feeling cramped and numb security has informed the police of course and you will have a police escort from now on so if you were thinking of taking a vacation somewhere he shrugged in any case theyve disconnected the bomb it was approximately one kilo of high explosive and would certainly have killed you as from the bottom of a pit xavier saw and heard his attorney speak he pulled himself upright and folded his hands neatly in his lap a wry smile tugged his mouth as he faced navarres a pity be said blandly viewed from the side the shuttleandiondrive assembly might have been some huge magical misshapen moth the ion drive craft would have been its torso its rectangular solar panels would serve as wings and the shuttle brasilia as its swollen lower abdomen soft deep violet beams would be spreading out from the creatures ionmotor eyes if ones perception were impossibly fine there were also delicate antennae reaching seven hundred kilometers to either side the creature of space would be flying backward in a slow spiral outward from earth so thomas de camp saw it in his imagination he was in the bubbleigloo aboard michael falling angels ion drive tug and he was alone and at peace problems remained but they would be trivial next to what he had lived through burgess had proved enthusiastically cooperative diaz at least tractable thomas hadnt even considered not sleeping hed slept like a brick aboard brasilia and wakened alive and eaten and tended his wounds and slept again for three days michael had swept inward from the moon on its column of flensed cesium atoms the ion drive tug had matched orbits with brasilia thirty hours after anansi made her gaudy landing at tokyo x tim connors was an exuberantly cheerful man short and round and as soft as guiness was hard michaels cramped igloo had nearly driven him nuts he seemed joyfully mad when he entered brasilia just because of the chance to stretch his legs the bizarre circumstances became masked with a kind of forced cameraderie in that spirit they had gone to work connors and thomas and burgess fitted gabriels flat nose against brasilias belly in forty minutes time they had cut the cable free of its pod with one flash of a heavyduty laser what was that doing mounted on gabriels hull fleming insisted i can guess what he had in mind connors said laser cannon for the next wave of bandits they had cruised inward pushing brasilia to the approximate center of mass of the cable thomas two cable grippers had served to lock onto the cable they had backed into position very carefully and welded the handles of the grippers to either side of michaels tail total expenditure ten hours and all of the ingenuity thomas could muster now the cable stretched out to either side held in a nearly straight line by tidal effects while gabriel towed it toward lunar orbit the configuration was extremely stable with the earthtide holding the cable nearly rigid for a time they had even left gabriel untended and the party atmosphere persisted even diaz caught it in a gravity field diaz would have been flat on his back forbidden to move a muscle in free fall with velcro slippers for anchors he could move but he moved as if his guts were venetian glass if thomas came too near he would flinch then cry out at what the tensing muscles had done to him but tim connors would have none of that he presently had thomas and diaz next to each other in the kitchen taking turns as they told the tale of that epic flight the time came when thomas needed solitude he offered to spell connors in the igloo aboard michael and connors had accepted in haste a dull buzzing sound dragged him back from a bottomless well of peace and he swatted at the air feebly before coming to his senses he checked over the control readouts finding everything in order and stretched as well as he could his arms easily brushed both sides of the bubble he flicked on the radio yawning de camp here is that you connors the same how was your nap cramped but i bet you know about that already ive promised my body ill give it a full workout as soon as we get to falling angel six days i hope your body trusts you that long dont smirk five hours from now you and i start trading shifts in the bubble i think youve gotten your kinks out by now maybe listen youve got a line from earth tokyo to be exact i told them you were too busy to be disturbed sadist a flush of excitement washed through him drowning out the fatigue and discomfort if its a lady patch her through aye ayeand de camp if she goes sour on you our deal still holds right agreed now put her through dammit it seemed to take an eternity for the whistles and clicks to resolve into recognizable words he spoke before it had finished darling i didnt know you cared lover boy marion chuckled careful this is an open line how are things on the dirt did you like your reception in tokyo thomas we were heroes listen they were still taxiing s and private planes out of the way when we touched down ill tell you janet handled that bird like a brain surgeon cutting on her only child they had to rope the crowds back and even that didnt work the reporters were all over us snapping pictures burning themselves on the heat tiles any casualties only anansi maybe some museum will take her the motor section looks chewed and halfdigested one of the motors fell off on the way down and we never felt it the air brake flaps on the vertical fin didnt open either i thought wed roll forever then we didnt have the refrigeration truck to squirt freon in so the reentry heat leaked in and burned out all the electronics aside from that he trailed off and an unspoken word passed over the miles dexter marion cleared his throat anyway oyama had to fight like hell to keep the japanese government from turning me over to the american embassy my covers blown of course i cant very well claim i wasnt aboard anansi when my picture is spread across every newspaper on earth janet and i have been debriefed examined interviewed shot full of nerve tonic and stuck on slabs to sleep it off dont i remember something about an inheritance has that been screwed up no opinion i cant make myself care life and the national enquirer and half a dozen japanese vidzines are bidding to pay serious money for the story of the first space hijacking were talking to playboy films and mgm hey do you think a bright handsome young stud could make it in california if his ego could fit under the golden gate sure marion i love talking to you but why dont you get yourself off the line and put my wife on before i put an eskimo curse on you oops sorry justhey thomas it was good working with you you too take care and all of that now put her on listen our agent wants to represent you too full story rights put her on there was a short scuffle what sounded like janet fighting for the microphone and she came on line tommy here janet everythings fine how are your earthlegs all right a little wobbly and lonesome she lowered her voice a fraction as if whispering could give them privacy as if the line werent as open as the blackness between them thomas twisted in his bubble and looked back at earths glowing blue disk filling a quarter of his sky tommy i he heard something suspiciously like a sniffle but before he could say anything she had it straightened out im supposed to convey the congratulations and appreciation of oyama construction and retsudo oyama particularly arent they mad about the cable surprisingly no theyll have it in a month and meanwhile theyll be chewing away at bte in court if i read it right what retsudo isnt sayingitll end with oyama in control of bte wont that be nice well then all is well i just wish well dexter he shook himself out of it i dont think hed want us to mourn him just yet not while theres still trouble to work out trouble oh well tommy i guess thered be trouble if there were any loose ends but youll be off to the belt now wont you thomas smiled well he said slowly itll be awhile yet well have to come back for gabriel and then rebuild it and then tim connors and i made a little deal hell be taking gabriel to the belt seems he wants to go asteroid hopping more than i do i could use a little vacation maybe see alaska again if i can work it out with the government tommy ive never been to alaska you wouldnt like it too cold and dull nothing to do really except find someone you love and hold them tight for body warmth and try to make up for lost time tommy are the nights really six months long you know better than that it isnt close enough to the north pole i can find you a couple of seventytwohour evenings though we could make it seem like six months ill be back in about three weeks and then we can talk about it tommy can you say it just this once i need to hear it say what he reached out and squiggled the radio switch were picking up some interference hereid better sign off now please just this once sorry gotta go now the frammistat is acting up the what the framigasinat tommy are you crazy what did you say i said that i love you and i always have silence on the other end of the line i love you and youre the most wonderful thing in my life and you will never have to fight to get me to say it again she was crying now you mean that dont you i tell you what hang on for three weeks then find out for yourself how much i mean it ill hang on goodbye tommy he mouthed i love you silently at the microphone then broke the connection staring out at an uninteresting view of the blacktiled underside of brasilia he said this is going to be a slow three weeks
