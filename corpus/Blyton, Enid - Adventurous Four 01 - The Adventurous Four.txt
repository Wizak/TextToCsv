enid blyton the adventurous four chapter the beginning of the adventures three children ran down a rocky path to the seashore tom went first a small wiry boy of twelve his red hair gleaming in the sun he looked round at the two girls following and his green eyes twinkled want any help you two mary and jill laughed in scorn dont be so silly tom said mary were as good as you any day when were running over the rocks the girls were twins and very like each other with their heads of thick golden hair tied in plaits and their deep blue eyes they often laughed at their brother tom and said he should have been called carrots or ginger or marmalade because of his red hair they were all on holiday staying in a little fishingvillage on the northeast coast of scotland their father was in the air force and their mother was with them knitting hard all day long in the garden of the little white house where they were staying the three of them had run wild and were all burnt as brown as monkeys usually they wore nothing but bathing costumes and rubber shoes and spent as much of their time in the sea as out of it at first their mother had been afraid of the big waves that crashed on the shore for she had thought the three children would surely be thrown on to the sand and hurt if they tried to bathe in such a rough sea but they had soon learnt to swim right through the heart of the big breaking waves and reach the calmer water beyond the shore they had one great friendandy the fisherboy he was a big strong lad of fourteen who had just left school and was helping his father with his fishing andy was darkhaired and blueeyed and was burnt dark brown by the sun he knew everything about the sea boats and fishing he could mimic any seabird and could call the wild gulls to him by crying to them andys marvellous said mary and jill a dozen times a dayand tom agreed each day the children went to talk to their friend and towatch him bring in the catch of fish clean it and pack it to be sent away andy was tall and brown he was dressed in old blue trousers and a darkblue jersey he liked the three children very much and often took them out in his little boat he had taught them all to swim like fishes to row strongly and to climb the rocky cliff like cats it would really have turned their mothers hair quite white if she had seen the things that the three children sometimes tried to do andy sat on the side of his little boat and grinned at the three children running down the rocky path his white teeth gleamed in his brown face and his eyes shone as blue as the sea he was mending a net let me help you andy said mary and she took up the torn net her fingers were nimble and she worked with andy whilst the others lay on their backs on the hot sand andy did you ask your father what we wanted you to do said tom aye i did said andy he says yesif i work hard all the week andy how lovely said jill in excitement i never thought hed let you do you mean to say your father will really lend you his sailingship to take us for a trip to little island asked mary hardly believing her ears i never thought hed say yes i was rather surprised too said andy but he knows i can handle the boat just as well as he can well take plenty of food with us and well sail out to little island on friday we can spend two days and a night there my father saysand ill show you where some queer birds nestand the cove with yellow stonesand the cliff where about a million birds sit and call oh wont it be gorgeous said tom sitting up and hugging his knees all by ourselves no grownups a little island far away over there to the eastand no one on it but ourselves too good to be true in great excitement the children made their plans lets take plenty of food said tom who was always hungry i dont know why but when im out on the sea i feel i could eat all the time so do i said mary its awful ive never felt so hungry in my life as i have since we came here well well get heaps of food said tom and ill bring my fieldglasses so that we can see the birds well and youll bring warm clothes and rugs with you said andy oh andy we shant need those surely said jill this september is just about the hottest ive ever known it will break soon said andy and if it happens to turn cold whilst were in the boat youll not like it all right said tom well bring anything so long as we can go i saywhat about the gramophone music sounds lovely on the water andy was fond of music so he nodded the boat was quite a big one and even had a little cabin to sit in with a tiny table and stool a bench and bunk nobody could stand in it but that didnt matter the three children had often crowded into it together whilst andy sailed the ship around the bay they had always longed to visit the island that andy had told them aboutan island of birds a queer rocky place with a strange cove where most of the stones were yellow but it was so far from the coast that it had not been possible to visit it in a day and now they had permission to go off in the sailingboat belonging to andys father and spend the night on the island it would be the greatest adventure of their lives on thursday the three children tired themselves out taking food rugs and other things down to the boat andy stared in astonishment at the amount of food are you wanting to feed an army he asked six tins of soupsix tins of fruittins of tonguechocolatenestles milkbiscuitscocoasugarand whatevers this ohthats tinned sausages said tom going rather red old mrs macpherson at the village shop said they were awfully goodso i brought some think of cooking sausages in a tin on the little island andy toms mad on sausages said jill hed like them for breakfast dinner and tea lookwill these rugs be enough andy yes said andy looking at the odd collection of old rugs that jill had managed to get together now mind you all wear warm clothes tooskirts and jerseys you girlsand shorts and jersey for you tom you havent got trousers have you no said tom sadly i dont suppose your father would lend me a pair would he andy hes only got the one pair and his sunday ones said andy and ive only got the ones im wearing now are you going to bring the gramophone we can put it safely in the cabin if you like tom went back to get it and soon brought it down to the boat with a packet of records he also brought a tin of toffee and a camera id like to take some pictures of the birds he said weve got a birdclub at our school and i guess i could take back some photographs that would beat everyone elses golly i arent we going to have a fine time what time do we start andy asked jill looking with pride at the sturdy little fishingboat that was going to take them on their adventure its brown sail was now furledbut tomorrow it would fly in the breeze and drive the boat over the bluegreen sea for miles be down here at halfpast six said andy i reckon well be at the island by about three in the afternoon then the three children could hardly sleep that night mary and jill kept calling out to tom and at last their mother came up to them very angry now if i hear one more shout i shall forbid you to go tomorrow she said you will have to be up at six oclockand its nearly halfpast ten now go to sleep the children were so afraid that their mother really would forbid them to go that they said not a word more they turned on their sides and fell asleep at six oclock all three were dressing hurriedly it was a magnificent day the eastern sky was glowing red at dawn and was now pink and gold the sun was already warm on their faces as they looked out of the little cottage window their mother was awake the children kissed her goodbye and ran down the rocky path to the beach andy was already therebut to the childrens surprise he looked rather grave im thinking we shouldnt go he said as soon as he saw the children andy whatever do you mean they cried maybe you didnt see the sky this morning said andy it was as red as the geranium in our window it was a right queer skyand im thinking a storm will blow up today or tomorrow oh dont be such a spoilsport andy said tom climbing into the boat what does a storm matter well be on the island before it comesand if one comes tomorrow we can wait another day on the island weve plenty of food if my father hadnt gone out in my uncles ship to fish i think hed be stopping us from going said andy doubtfully but maybe the storm will blow off to the east get in then im glad to see youve got your jerseys on if the wind blows up well be cold tonight ive got my bathingsuit on underneath said jill so have the others come on andypush off im simply longing to go andy pushed off the boat grated over the stones and then rode into the waves andy jumped in lightly he and tom took the oars they did not mean to put up the sail till they came out of the bay into the full sea it was a marvellous morning the sea was full of sparkles and twinklesit was blue and purple at a distance clear green by the boat mary let her hand drag in the cool water she was very happy jill was happy too she lay on her back in the boat looking up at the cornflowerblue sky feeling the boat bobbing up and down on the waves tom was happy too he loved to pull at the oars he enjoyed thinking of his breakfast and planned what he would have only andy was not happy he felt in his bones that he should not have taken the children out that morning he felt sure this was not going to be the wonderful day they had planned he wished his father had been there to advise him and he anxiously watched the sky for clouds but there was not one to be seen now were really off on our adventure said jill really off but she didnt know what an extraordinary adventure it was going to be chapter lost in the storm as soon as the boat was clear of the bay andy put up the sail it was a pretty brown one like the sails of all the other fishingboats of the village it billowed out in the breeze and the boat sped along the boys shipped the oars ill steer said tom and he took the tiller the sail flapped and spray flew up from under the bows of the boat it was lovely we go northeast said andy can you steer by the sun tom of course said tom who had learnt to tell tie time almost to the halfhour by looking to see exactly where the sun was im going right arent i andy and i make it about halfpast seven by the sun its twentypast seven said jill looking at her watch she whispered something to mary who giggled what are you giggling at asked tom tell you in a minute said jill the boat flew on over the green water and the spray whipped off the sea and fell cool and silvery on the children golly said tom in half a minute i am hungry what time are we going to have breakfast the twins burst into squeals of laughter thats what we whispered about just now said jill i said to mary i guess the next thing tom says will be that hes hungry and what about breakfast and sure enough you did tom laughed well i guess you feel the same he said go on down into the little cabin and see what you can get for our breakfast andy and i are busy the girls went into the tiny cabin which was crammed full of then food and other belongings what shall we have for breakfast said jill what about pineapple chunksand these hardboiled eggs mrs andrews did for us yesterday eveningand some nestles milkand chocolate it was a most peculiar breakfast but the four children thought it was lovely they had three loaves of bread with them and some butter and they dabbed the butter on to chunks of bread took the eggs in thenhand and bit first at the egg and then at the bread jill put a paper of salt down on the deck for them to dip the eggs into fathead said tom as the wind promptly blew away paper salt and all as if the sea isnt salt enough already without adding more salt to it is there any more there was some in a tin and as this didnt blow away the children had plenty there was fresh water in a barrel and every orie dipped in a cup and had a drink that was a fine breakfast said tom i could do with it all over again im going to take off my jersey and skirt said jill tin simply cooking so am i said mary the boys felt hot too for the sun was now pouring down fiercely tom took off his jersey but andy didnt remove his he always kept eis on whatever the weather was this is simply gorgeous said jill lying on a rug on the deck feeling the spray splash on her hot face and arms every now and again how i do love to feel the boat bobbing up and down up and down all the time can i have a turn at the tiller soon tom everybody can said tom its a grand feeling to sit here and guide the flying boat how the wind is getting up the sail is billowing out like the wings of a bird the sailingboat simply flew over the water we shall be at little island before three oclock if we go on like this said andy im so hot in the sun said jill she was sheltered where she lay and felt hardly any wind i wish i could be dragged behind the boat on a rope in the cool water the morning slid on the sun rose higher and higher and at noon it was so hot that every one put on sunhats the wind was still strong and whipped the tops from the waves as the boat flew along its past noon said tom what about a spot of lunch chanted every one knowing exactly what tom was going to say im more thirsty than hungry said jill what are you looking worried about andy queer colour the sky is getting over yonder said andy nodding his head to the west they all looked its sort of coppery said tom theres a storm blowing up said andy sniffing the air like a dog i can smell it andy always said he could smell a storm and he was always right the children looked anxiously towards the west shall we get to the island before it comes asked jill a storm is all very well to read about in a bookbut i dont really want to be in one out on the open sea well do our best said andy the little boat cant go faster than shes going now as it is the sail is almost splitting with the wind the sea turned a strange colour a kind of bluebrown its caused by the reflection of that funny sky said jill half nervous i say its queer being out here on the sea miles away from land with the sea and the sky doing odd things like this then an even stranger thing happened the wind which had been blowing very strongly indeed dropped completely one moment it was blowing the childrens hair straight back as they faced the westthe next there was not a breath of air the sea fell calm and oily the little fishingboat stopped running in front of the wind and rode silently over the waves as if she were at anchor i say thats funny said tom not a bit of breeze now andy well never get to the island if we dont get some wind shall we row no said andy his face rather pale under its dark brown no tom youll get plenty of wind in a minutemore than we want we must take in some of the sail the ship will heel right over if we let her have all this sail when next the wind gets up theres going to be a gale i can hear it coming there was a queer humming noise in the air that seemed to come from nowhere at all then an enormous purple cloud blew up from the west and completely covered the sun the world went dark and great spots of rain fell its coming now said andy help me with the sail tom take the tiller jill keep her heading the way weve been going pull tom pull they pulled at the big brown sailbut before they had done what they wanted to the storm broke a great crash of thunder came from the black cloud and a flash of lightning split the sky in half and then the gale came tom and the girls had never never imagined there could be such a wind they could not hear themselves speak unless they shouted andy yelled to the girls get down into the cabin quick and shut the door and stay there oh lets be here cried jill but andy looked so stern and commanding that they did not dare to disobey they almost fell into the cabin and shut the door outside the wind seemed to get a voicea voice that howled and wailed and lashed the sea into enormous waves that sent the little boat halfover every time tins and everything else began to fall about the girls picked them up and put them where they could not fall there was a crash as the packet of records fell down blow cried jill theyll all be broken so they wereall but one it was very sad the girls carefully put the one whole record into a safe place and wondered what the boys would say when they knew but it couldnt be helped up above on the deck the two boys struggled with the wind and the sea tom had had no time to get into his jersey so all he had on was a bathingsuit and shorts he shivered as wave after wave splashed on him and the wind whipped by the deck was wet and slippery the darkgreen waves raced by and the boat climbed up one steep wave after another and slid down the other side only to climb up another enormous wave again up and down up and down she went whilst andy struggled with the sail what are you trying to do yelled tom who was at the tiller take in all the sail shouted back andy we cant go on like this well be over but he didnt need to botherfor suddenly the sail ripped itself off the mast flapped wildly for a second and then sped away into the sky it was gone only a little rag was left wriggling madly in the wind the boat slowed down at once for it no longer had the sail to take it along but even the little rag of sail that was left was enough to take it at a good speed over the waves andy said nothing he took the tiller with tom and together the boys faced the storm thunder rolled around and crashed in the skies lightning flickered and lighted up the vast heaving waste of greyblack sea stinging rain fell every now and again and the boys bent their heads to it and shut their eyes the wind lashed them and the spray whipped them if this was an adventure there was a great deal too much of it do you think were all right andy shouted tom are we near the island i reckon weve passed it yelled back andy at the rate weve been going wed have been there by now goodness knows where we are tom stared at andy in silence passed the island a storm behind them no sail whatever were they going to do chapter shipwreck for a long time the boat went on and on its little rag of sail still flapping tom thought that the sail itself must have reached the great dark cloud that still covered the sky the wind was so strong i should think this winds almost a hurricane isnt it yelled tom pretty near shouted andy but its blowing itself out now sure enough it was every now and again there was a lull when the wind dropped to a stiff breeze then it would blow again furiously the thunder was no longer overhead but far off to the east the lightning shimmered now and again but did not light up the sea with the fierce brilliance it had two or three hours back then just as suddenly as it had come the storm flew off it was most astonishing a sheet of bright blue sky appeared in the west and swiftly grew bigger as the great cloud flew to the east the wdrld grew light again the rain stopped the wind died down to a breeze and the boat no longer seemed to climb up and down steep hills the cabin door opened and two green faces looked out sadly weve been awfully seasick down here said jill it was dreadful what a frightful storm said mary are we nearly at the island weve passed it andy says said tom gloomily we dont know where we are goodness look the sails gone said mary shocked what are we to do for a sail theres an old one down in the cabin said andy fetch it will youand ill see if i can do something with it the sun shone down again it was gloriously hot poor tom who had been chilled to the bone loved it he stripped off his wet bathingsuit and put on his jersey ah that was better andy did not seem to feel either cold or wet he took the old sail and had a good look at it he thought he could rig it with toms help they must have a sail of some sort to get anywhere ive heard my father say there are some desolate rocky islands up away to the north of little island said andy his wet jersey steaming in the hot sunshine well make for those maybe there might be someone thereor we could signal a ship for help i dont reckon were going to get home any too easily now at last the old sail was flying in the breeze andy headed due north it was about five oclock now and all the children were very hungry jill and mary had forgotten their seasickness and went below to get some food soon they were all eating heartily and felt much better they drank all the water before andy knew there was none left we shouldnt have done that he said if we dont strike these islands im thinking of well have no water tomorrow leave those apples mary we might be glad of the juice in the morning mary had been about to bite into a juicy apple but she hastily put it down in silence she and jill packed the apples away carefully in the cabin both the girls felt worried whatever would their mother be thinking when that terrible storm blew up they wished they were safely back at home the boat sailed on to the north the sun slipped low into the west and the boats shadow lay purple on the sea it was a beautiful evening look gulls said andy at last maybe we are nearing land cant see any though wed better anchor for the night i should think and then the children got a great shock there was no anchor andy stared in horror how could he possibly have forgotten that his father had warned him to take the old anchor because he was lending andy uncle his own how could he have forgotten now they couldnt anchor their ship now they would have to ride on the sea until they came to landand in the night they might strike a rock andy stared over the restless sea in dismay wellthere was nothing for it but to hope for the best one of them must be at the helm all night long tt would be a moonlight night if only the sky was not clouded perhaps they would be lucky and sight land jill and mary were tired out andy ordered them to go below and rest youd better go too tom he said youll have to come up and take your turn on deck tonight and youd better get a nap whilst you can but i dont want to said tom i shall be able to keep awake all right go below tom said andyjn the kind of voice that had to be obeyed tom weittlnto the little cabin with the girls they left the door open for it was warm the girls lay on the bunk and tom curled up on the pile of rugs on the floor in two minutes he was asleep he did not know how tired he was the wind rain and sea had taken all his strength out of him for a time andy stayed alone on deck the sun had gone down in a blaze of gold the skyhad turned pink and the sea had turned pink too now it was evening and the first stars were winking in the darkening sky the little boat drove on and on andy hoped desperately that land would soon come in sight he remembered so clearly what his father had said right past the little island far to the north lay other islands desolate now but once owned by a few farmers who tried to get a hard living from the rocky soil if only they could get help there night fell darkly on the waters the moon sailed into the sky but clouds kept hiding her light first the sea was gleaming silver then ft was black then it was silver again andy wished he could see something besides the sea but there was nothing the boy stayed on deck until midnight he felt the night wind and wrapped a rug round his shoulders though he did not feel really cold after a while he whistled to tom tom awoke coming he said sleepily and went up on deck he shivered and andy threw the rug round liim keep her heading straight he said give me a call if you see anything it was queer up on deck all alone the old sail flapped and creaked a little the water went plashlashlash against the sides of the boat the moon sailed in and out of the clouds as if she were a silver boat in the sky then came a thick mass of clouds and the moon disappeared altogether tom couldnt see anything at all he strained his eyes to try and pierce through the darkness but except for the gleaming white top of a near by wave now and then he could see nothing but he could hear something quite suddenly it sounded like crashing waves tom longed for the moon to come outand as he wished for it it came sliding out from a cloud for a second before it disappeared again and in that tiny space of time tom saw something that gave him a shock the sea was breaking over big rocks just ahead andy andy yelled tom wrenching the tiller round rocks ahead andy came tumbling up the steps wide awake at once he heard the sound of breaking waves and knew at once there were rocks ahead he took the tiller and then there came a grating noise and a long groan from the ship she was on the recks she had run straight on to themand there she lay groaning half over slanting so much that the girls in the little cabin were thrown out of the bunk hold on tom shouted andy clutching at tom who seemed about to slide overboard hold on shes settling the ship did settle she seemed to be wedged between two rocks that were holding her tightly all on the slant waves splashed over one side of her deck for a few minutes the children hardly dared to breatheand then andy spoke shes fast he said she may have a hole in her bottom but she wont sink while shes held like this we must wait till dawn so they waited clinging uncomfortably to the slanting sides of the ship dawn was not far off it silvered the eastern sky as they waited the light grew stronger and then a gold edge appeared on the horizon the sun was about to rise and in the golden light of the early sun they saw something not far off that made them shout for joy land ho they yelled and would have danced in delight if only the deck had not been so slanting and land ho there certainly was a sandy shore stretched to a rocky cliff stunted trees grew further inland touched with gold by the rising sun it was an island of some sort desolate rocky and lonelybut it was at least land somewhere where they could light a fire and boil water to make themselves warm somewhere where other people might be to give them a helping hand well have to swim for it said andy its not very far once were clear of these rocks well be all right in fact now that the tide has gone down a bit we could almost walk over the rocks to the shallow water that runs up the shore andy held out his hand to mary tom helped jill halfwading halfswimming they made their way over and between the reef of rocks and paddled to shore the sun had warmth in it now and warmed their cold bodies how glad they all were that they had taken andys advice and had put on warm clothes well said andy when they had reached the shore well climb up these cliffs and see if we can spot anyones house they climbed the rocky cliffs when they got to the top they looked around a small stunted wood grew a little way off on a hillside low bushes crouched here and there as if to hide from the strong wind that blew always across the island grass crept over the rocky earth and a few daisies flowered but there was no sign of any house or of any human being andy made up his mind quickly if weve got to be stranded here for a time we must get out of our ship everything thats in her he said thank goodness weve got a certain amount of food and some rugs the tide is at its lowest nowwhen it is high it will completely cover the deck of our boatso we must wade back to her and take off everything of value in her come on tom you girls can stand halfway to the boat in that shallow water and well cany things to you over the rocks then you can take them back to the shore it will be better than us all scrambling about on the rocks and dropping everything and so they began to empty the ship of all it held food rugs gramophone camera fieldglasses stool table tools crockery kettle matches little stove everything it took a long timebut before they had finished the tide had risen and the decks were awash the cabin was full of water i we cant do anything more said andy lets go and have a restand something to eat im simply starving chapter on the unknown island it was a rather solemn set of children who sat down on the shore to eat breakfast they had been brave during the stormbut now they all felt very tired and rather scared it was strange to think they might have to stay for quite a long time on the unknown island until they were rescuedand supposing they were right off the route of the ships and steamers that used those seas andy took charge he was the oldest and wisest and the others looked up to him he was old for his fourteen years he stared out at their wrecked ship and wrinkled his forehead well were in a nice fix he said but well forget it for a minute and enjoy our breakfast wed better finish up all the bread for it will soon be stale well eat all the food that might go badthere vthat open jar of potted meat tom that we began last nightand the rest of the butterand those buns that mrs andrews gave us and what about something hot to drink i dont feel really cold but it would do us good to get something hot inside us looki brought the matches with me wrapped in this oilskin so that they wouldnt get wet we cant get the stove going till we get the tin of oil out of the locker in the boatwe forgot thatso wed better make a fire on the beach tom and jill collected sticks and soon there was a fine fire going andy went off up the cliff to see if he could find a stream to fill the kettle which they had taken from the boat he had to go a good way before he found a spring running down the little hill in the distance he filled the kettle and went back to the cove goodthe fires going well he said i found a spring so we neednt worry about water wheres the tin of cocoaand we must finish up that nestles milk we opened or it will go bad the kettle soon boiled and the children made thick cocoa they added the tinned milk to it and drank with enjoyment the cocoa was good the twins who were cold felt warmed up at once their clothes were still wet and although the sun now shone down hotly they felt chffly tom yawned he was not used to keeping awake half the night the girls were tired out too for they had been very seasick in the storm andy had laid out the rugs in the sun he felt them they were almost dry wed better get off our wet things and hang them on the bushes to dry he said well roll ourselves in these rugs and lie down in that sheltered corner over there by the cliff in the sun and sleep off our bad night so in three or four minutes all that could be seen of the children were four tightlyrolled bundles lying peacefully asleep in the sunshine well out of the wind in a cosy corner of the beach their damp clothes were spread out on bushes to dry and were already steaming in the sun andy awoke first he knew at once where he was and remembered all that had happened he sat up to look at their ship the tide was going down again now and the ship looked queer slanting sideways caught fast between the two big rocks andy wondered what his father would say when he knew what had happened it was a serious thing to lose a fishingboat the sun was high in the sky andy threw off his rug and went to feel his clothes on the bush they were perfectly dry he put them on and then went to the big pile of things they had taken from the ship he looked among them and found a fishingline he hunted about for a sandworm baited his hook and clambered out on the rocks where deep water swirled around him he lowered his line into the water in ten minutes he had caught his first fish and was baiting the line again tom awoke next he sat up on the sand astonished to hear the sea so close then he remembered all that had happened and leapt to his feet he awoke the girls and they put on their warm clothes they saw andy and waved to him andys getting our dinner said jill i suppose youre feeling as hungry as usual tom i could eat a whale said tom and he really felt as if he could it was fun cooking the fish over a fire it smelt delicious there was no bread left so the children had to eat the fish by itself but they were so hungry that they didnt mind at all its about two oclock in the afternoon said andy looking at the sun now the first thing to do is to find a good place to sleep forthe night then wed better explore the island if weve time the food weve got with us wont last a great while but at any rate we can always get fishand i expect well find some berries we can eat too look said tom suddenly pointing to the pile of things not far off theres a gull there will he peck our tins openor eat our cocoa andy clapped his hands and the gull flew off crying loudly we certainly mustnt leave any food out said andy the gulls would have it at once looktheres two or three fishes left we can have for our supper wed better make a hole in the sand and bury them under some heavy stones till we want them the gulls would soon make a meal of them if we left them uncovered they buried the fish andy stood up and looked all round the cliff i wonder if theres a cave or anything we could sleep in at night he said but there didnt seem to be any cave at all though the children hunted carefully all along the cliff how will anyone know we are here asked jill we shall have to put up some sort of a sign shant we to show any passing ship dr steamer that we are here yes said andy ive been thinking about that ill take down the ships sail and well tie it to a tree on the top of the cliff that will be a fine signal good idea said tom it will flap in the wind and be seen for miles well find a sleepingplace for the night before we do that said andy it looks like rain again nowsee that low cloud over there we dont want to be soaked in our sleep come on they left the sandy cove and climbed up the steep cliff it was hard going but they got to the top at last and once more looked across the island they could not see right across it because the hill in the middle stopped their viewso they did not know how big or small it was all they knew was that at present they could not see any sign of anyone else there or of any house or other building how id love to see a cow or two said jill whatever for said mary in surprise i didnt know you liked cows so much jill i dont said jill but cows would mean a farmer sillyand a farmer means a farmhouseand a farmhouse means lots of people and help of course the others laughed well lets hope we see one or two cows for you jill said tom which way shall we go andy well make our way to the huv said andy theres bracken there and heather and maybe we can find a hillcave to snuggle in bracken and heather make a fine bed and weve got the rugs for covers they ran to the hill it had a little wood of windblown pines and birches but there was no cave in the hillside they could shelter in it was covered with thickgrowing bracken and heather with a few stunted gorsebushesbut there was no place that would really give them a safe shelter to sleep well wellhave to rig up a tent of some sort said andy at last im not going to be soaked through tonight ive had enough of that to last me for quite a while a tent andy said tom wherever would we get a tent from buy it from a shop i suppose im going to get the old sail off the boat said andy we can use it for a signal by day and a tent by night its big enough to cover us all quite well andy you have got good ideas said jill i should never have thought of that well shall we go back then and help you no said andy you stay here with tom and help him to build a kind of tenthouse that we can just drape the sail over youll want some stout brunches stuck well into the ground ill go and get the sail andy went off down to the shore again and clambered and waded out to the boat he was soon taking down the old sail the others hunted for good branches the ones lying on the ground were too brittle and old they found theyll make good firewood said tom wellhave to break a few growing branches off the trees it was difficult to do this but they managed it at last then they drove the stout sticks into the heathery ground and made a kind of circle with them big enough to hold them all they had just finished when andy came back bent double over the heavy sail he threw it dewn and panted i thought id never get it up the cliff he said i say youve made a fine set of walls the sail will go over them nicely eight willing hands helped toarrange the big brown sail over the circle of sticks stuck firmly into the ground the weight of the sail kept it down and when the children bad finished they had made a kind of round brown tent with no doorway but as the children could get in anywhere under the tent simply by lifting up the sail it didnt matter having no doorway well gather a nice pile of heather and put it inside the tent to lie on said tom and with our rugs too we shall be as cosy and wafm as toast in fact we may be much too hot well if we are well just lift up one side of the tentand let the breeze blow in said jill oh i do feel excited i really feel as if weve got a sort of little home now weve made this tent there isnt time to explore the island now said andy looking in surprise at the sinking sun weve taken ages over the tent well go all over the island tomorrow that will be fun said mary i do wonder what well find chapter making the best of things the children were all hungry again andy thought it would be better to bring everything up from the shore and put it near their tent we may have to make our tent a sort of home he said we dont want to have to keep climbing up and down that rocky cliff every time we want a cup or a kettle besides we are quite near the spring here and we can easily get water whenever we want to so for the next hour or so the children fetched all their belongings some of them were very difficult to get up the cliff the gramophone was almost impossible till andy thought of the idea of tying a rope round it and hauling it gently up by that golly all the records are broken said tom in dismay as he picked up the cracked records yesthey fell and broke when that dreadful storm was on said jill leave them behind theyre no use theres just one thats not brokennow where is it they found it at last and looked at it what a pity this is a silly recordit would be the only one thats left unbroken said mary on one side its a girl singing a iind of lullaby without even any musicand on the other its nursery rhymes the silliest one weve got oh wellbring it along said tom and wheres my camera it doesnt look as if ill find any good pictures to takebut i may as well have it by the time they had got everything to the tent they were really very tired they cooked the rest of the fish and opened a tin of peaches they ate an apple each broke a bar of chocolate into four pieces and then drank some hot cocoa it was a good meal and they enjoyed it the sun was now almost gone and the first star was shining brightly well weve had an adventurous day said jill yawning i slept all the morningbut i feel awfully sleepy again already well turn in early said andy im tired too we cant clean our teeth said jill who was always very particular about nails and teeth and things like that i wish i had a toothbrush well heres a brush for you said tom with a grin handing jill the brush that was used to sweep bits of fish off the deck brush your teeth with this jill took it and at once brushed toms hair with it tom was disgusted dont you cuckoo he said i shall smell of fish all night long come on said andy we want more heather for our beds tom stamp out the fire we dont want to set the hill alight and the heather is very dry tom stamped out the fire the girls filled the tent with more heather andy took the largest rug and spread it all over the springy pile you girls can sleep on this side of the tent and tom and i will take the other he said there are plenty of rugs luckily nobody undressed for one thing they had no nightclothes and for another they didnt even think of it life seemed quite different on an unknown island nobody even thought of going to washthough toms hair smelt so much of old fish that andy threatened to pour a kettle of water over it ill wash my head under the spring tomorrow morning said tom sleepily i really cant go now im simply dropping asleep whilst i talk they rolled themselves up in their rugs and lay flat on the heathery bed it was beautifully soft and springy and very comfortable once they had pressed down several sharp bits that stuck into them tom was asleep at once the girls lay awake for a minute or two jill felt very hot for the tent was airless and the four of them made quite a crowd in it the roof was not more than arms length above their heads andy said jill in a low voice im so hot could we get some air in do you think yes said andy he raised one side of the sail and let the breeze in it was lovely for now the girls could see out the moonlight lay on the hillside and everything was clear till the clouds sailed across the moon mary fell asleep as she watched bracken outside waving in the wind then jill fell asleep only andy lay awake leaning on his elbow looking out down the hillside and listening to the sound of the waves in the distance under the cliff he was old enough to feel that this adventure might not turn out at all well he wondered what would be the best thing to do for them all we must certainly hang out a signal every day he thought it might be seen by some passing ship we must find a better place to live iirtoo for if the weather should break up this tent wont be any use and i wonder if its possible to get the ship off the rocks and patch her up if we could do that maybe we might have a shot at sailing home as he lay worrying about all these things his eyes closed he was soon dreaming that he had got the boat off the rocks but it changed into a large steamer that seemed to have hands and was fishing busily in a pool there was such a strong smell of fish that andy opened his sleepy eyes againonly to find that toms fishysmelling head was just under his nose andy turned over grinning what a silly sort of dream he thoughtand then in half a second he was dreaming again all the children slept soundly that night and even when the clouds piled up over the moon and a sharp downpour of rain came they didnt wake the raindrops pattered over the tent but did not soak through to the sleeping children some came through the side where andy had raised the sail to let in the air but the children felt nothing they awoke when the sun was fairly highabout eight oclock in the morning andy as usual awoke first and rolled out of the tent quietly but he had waked tom and when the boy yawned loudly the girls awoke too it was a fine sunny morning with clouds scudding across the sky like big pieces of cottonwool the first thing of course was breakfastbut it had to be caught so andy and tom went fishing on the rocks and the girls managed to catch about twenty large prawns in a pool on the sandy shore they cooked their catch and ate hungrily i do feel dirty said jill i shall go and wash at the spring coming mary yes said mary and i vote we all have a bathe today that will clean us up a bit too they all felt cleaner after a rinse and splash in the spring tom and andy made the fixing of the signal their next job they found a good treeat least it was a good one for their purpose for it had been struck by lightning at one time and now stood straight and bare ob the top of the cliff it took the two boys about an hour to climb the tree and fix the sailsignal it flapped out well in the breeze and andy was sure it could be seen from a great distance they climbed down again and went back to the girls what about exploring the island now asked tom i feel just like a good walk well the island may be too small for a good walk said andy well just see ready you girls they were all ready for their walk first they climbed the bill and stood on the top looking to see what they could spy from the top of the hill they could see all around their islandand certainly it was not very bigonly about a mile and a half long and about a mile wide they could see the blue water all around it but not far off were other islands they lay in the sea blue and misty in the distance but as far as the children could see there were no houses or buildings of any kind on them they seemed as desolate and lonely as their own island the cries of seabirds came as they stood on the hill and big white gulls swooped around thembut except for that sound and the faroff splash of waves there was no other sound to be heard no shoutno hoot of a hornno drone of an aeroplane they might be lost in the very middle of the ocean for all they could see or hear i dont believe a single soul lives here on these islands said andy his face rather grave come onlets go down to this side of the hill we may as well find out all there is to know as they went down the hill and came to the level ground again tom stopped in astonishment look he said potato plants the children lookedand sure enough growing completely wild around them were plants that looked exactly like potatoes andy pulled one upand there clinging to the roots were a dozen or more small white potatoes thats queer said andy staring round at some time or other there must have been people living hereand they grew potatoes some have seeded themselves and grown wild but the thing isif people lived herewhere did they live they must have lived somewhere how queer said tom looking all round as if he expected houses to spring from the ground and then jill gave a shout i believe i can see the chimney of a house look where the ground dips down suddenly over there the others looked they saw that the ground did suddenly dip down into a kind of hollow well protected from the windjust the place where people might build a house they tore over the rocky ground to the dip expecting they hardly knew what and what a surprise they got when at last they reached the hollow and looked down into it chapter a queer little home the four children stood at the top of the steep dip the hollow ran right down to the seaand in it was a cluster of small buildings but what strange buildings the roofs were off the chimneys were gone all but the one they had seen the walls were fallen in and everything looked forlorn and deserted nothing but ruins said tom in astonishment whatever happened to make the houses and shed fall to pieces like that i think i know said andy a year or two ago there came a great storm to these partsso great that the people of our village fled inshore for miles because the sea battered our houses and flooded our street the storm must have been even worse on these unprotected islands hereand i should think the sea came into this hollow and battered the farm to bits look at that chimneystack thereall black and brokenthat was struck by lightning i should think the four children gazed down at the poor hollow house and outbuildings a little farm had once been therea poor farm maybe trying to grow a few potatoes in the rocky ground to keep a few goats or cows and to take from the sea enough fish to live on now the folk had all gone unable to battle with the great seastorms that swept over their farm and destroyed their living this explains the potatoes said jill that stretch of struggling potato plants must once have been a field lets jo down into the hollow and have a look round said andy so down into the dip they scrambled and wandered round the ruined buildings nothing had been leftall the furniture had been taken away and even the gates and doors removed seashore weeds grew up from the floors of the farmhouse a boy must have lived here said andy picking up a broken wooden train from a patch of weeds and heres a broken cup said jill bending over what had once been a rubbishheap they wandered about and at last came to a lirfle wooden shack where perhaps a cow or two had been kept in the winter for some reason it had escaped being beaten in by the waves and still stood upright its one window broken and its floor covered with a creeping weed andy looked at it carefully this wouldnt be a bad place to make into a little house for ourselves he said i was thinking wed have to try and build one somehowbut this will do if we patch it up a bit the tent wont be any use at all if the weather breaks upand also its going to be a great nuisance to keep taking it down from the signal tree each night for our tent and putting it back again in the mornings oh yes said tom in delight lets make this our house that would be fun then we could leave the sail flapping for our signal all the time they all went into the shack it was not very largemore like a big bicycle shed though the roof was higher a wooden partition divided it into two well take that down said andy it would be better to have one fairly big room than two tiny ones well wed better start work at once hadnt we said tom eagerly we shall have to bring all our things hereand make it a bit homelike and all those weeds will have to be cleared yesand wellspread the floor with clean sand said jill listenyou boys clear up the weeds for usand mary and i will go to that old potato field and find the biggest potatoes we can and cook them in their jackets for lunch good idea said tom feeling hungry at once come on andylets start and clean up the place nowwe cant do much till thats done the two boys set to work they pulled up the creeping weed by handfuls and piled it outside they got tofts of stiff heather and using them as brushes swept the cobwebs from the walls and rough ceiling tom broke the remaining glass of the window gathered the broken bits carefully together and tucked them into the bottom of the old rubbishheap so that no one could be cut by a splinter andy made a rough fireplace just outside the shack with stones from the hearth of the ruined farmhouse we cant have the fire inside because this shack has no chimney he said and wed be choked with the smoke anyway ive made ibe fireplace out of the wind and we ought to be able to cook all right on it mary you can bake the potatoes there once the stones get hot tom get some sticks and start a fire mary and jill peeped inside the shack it looked clean and tidy now though very bare the two girls had pulled plenty of good potatoes from the old weedy field and had washed them in the spring water they would be fine baked in their jacketsthough it was a pity there w no batter left and so salt tom fetched some clean sand from the shore he had found a very old bucket which had a hole in the bottom he put a flat stone over the hole and then the sand did not trickle out he carried six pails full of sand to the shack and scattered it over the earth floor it looked very neat and clean well have to get heaps of heather and bracken in for beds again said jill just as we did for our tent wont it be a nice little house we must bring the little table here and the stooland all the cups and things it will make it seem like home the children had quite forgotten how serious their adventure was it was such fun to work like this and get ready a little house mary even began to wonder if there was anything she could use as a curtain for the window their lunch was potatoes and chocolate with plenty of cold spring water tom could have eaten three times as much but he had to be content with five large potatoes and a whole bar of chocolate well have fish for tonight promised andy the water round about this island is just thick with fish well always have plenty to eat so long as we dont get tired of fish well hunt for shellfish too after their dinner the children separated the girls were to go to the nearest patches of heather and bracken and bring in armfuls for beds the boys were to make journeys to and from the tent and bring in all their belongings when the tides down tonight ill get the tin of oil out of the locker of the boat said andy that wont have been spoilt by the seawater because its got a tightfitting lid we can cook over the stove then as well as over a fire if we want to the children were very busy that afternoon mary and jill got enough heather and bracken to make two teds one at each side of the shack they piled the tough bracken on the floor first and then the softer heather on top then they spread each bed with a rug and put another rug neatly folded up to be used as a blanket at night the beds can be couches to sit on in the daytime said mary quite pleased with the look of them wellhave to add more heather day by day i expect jill because we shall flatten the beds very much with our weight but we can easily see to that the boys brought in the crockerycups saucers and platesthick common ones used by the fishermen who sailed in andys fathers boat with him they were just right for the shackbut where were they to be put we really cant keep them on the floor said mary theyll get broken i wish we had a shelf to put things on it would give us much more room if only we could get these odd things out of theway andy disappeared for a few minutes when he came back he carried a wooden board he grinned at the surprised children i remembered seeing an old shelf in what must have been the kitchen of the farmhouse he said so i went in and wrenched h down from the wall tom where did you put the tools and the box of nails down there by our bed said tom andy picked up a hammer and the box of nails where do you want the shelf he asked the girls over there at the back of the shack just about shoulderhigh said mary what a lovely shelf that will make andyit will take everything so it did once andy had nailed it up the girls arranged the crockery there the kettle one or two pans the fieldglasses camera and other things the gramophone would not go on the shelf so they put it into a corner by this time the shack really looked fine there were the two neat beds at the sidesthe table in the middle with the stoolthe neatlysanded floorthe shelf at the back with its array of goods the children felt really pleased with it andy filled the oilstove you could boil us some potatoes tonight for a change he said to mary youve got a little saucepan havent you yes said mary ill boil them and mash them for youbut theyll taste a bit odd without butter or salt and well open another tin of fruit the boys went off to catch fish the girls busied themselves with fetching more potatoes more water and setting the oilstove going they felt very busy and rather important they had a most delicious supper and enjoyed every bit of it they didnt even mind going without salt in the potatoes they ate their supper sitting outside the open doorway of the shack looking out to the evening sea the gulls called high in the air and the splash of the little whiteedged waves came to them every now and again now well turn in said andy with a yawn it will be fun to sleep in our little house for the first time come on girlsleave the washingup till the morning we are all tired out chapter a strange discovery the next day the children went to make sure that their sailsignal was still safely tied to the signaltree at the top of the cliff it was it flapped there steadily a signal to any passing ship that there were people on the island who needed help suppose no help comes said tom shall we have to stay here all winter yesunless you like to try and swim dozens of miles back home said andy the children looked at one another stay there for the winter it was all very well having an adventure on an island for three or four daysbut to stay there all the winter in the bitter cold and raging storms was not a pleasant thought dont look so gloomy said andy we may be rescued any day i cant think that no ship ever passes these islands after all there were people living here not so long agoand they must have had supplies from time to timeso the ships must come by here sometimes and maybe there are people living on one of the other islands i think perhaps at a very low tide we could cross to the next island by that line of rocks over thereand explore that we may find dozens of people all we know every one cheered up of course there seemed to or six islands near to their own people would surely be living on one or other of them especially on the bigger ones their own island was so small that it was a wonder anyone had ever bothered to build a house there and tried to get a living on the rocky soil they went to see if their boat was still held fast between the two rocks yesthere it was all on one side the tide washing right over its decks perhaps an extra strong tide might lift it off the rocks said andy if only it wouldand we could mend it id try to sail back home again well theres nothing left in the boat that could be taken away now said tom i really think weve got everything movableropes nets even the oars it was quite true the boys had brought back with the oil everything in the locker ropes might never come in usefulbut still andy thought they might as well take them the children thoroughly explored the tittle island again but found nothing interesting at all they could see that the farmpeople had used the level stretch of land on the more southerly side of the island for their fields in one place jill found some runner beans growing over a tangle of brambles and she called out in excitement beans welleat them for dinner the others came to look i expect these seeded themselves too said andy maybe there was a beanfield just here wellwere not doing too badly with potatoes and beans and fish there was nothing to do that afternoon except bathe and fish the little shack was finishedthere was nothing more to add to it they could do nothing with their wrecked boat it was of no use going for a ramble for the island was so small so tom suggested a bathe first and fishing afterwards it was warm in the sunshiny sea they swam through the big waves and splashed about lazily then they came out of the sea and lay in the sun to dry after that the boys sat on the rocks to fish and the girls went to hunt for prawns shrimps and shellfish the tide was very low that evening the wind had completely dropped and the sea was almost calmas nearly calm as it ever could be on that rough rocky coast the children stood on a rocky ledge looking to the north where the other islands lay blue with a summery mist they really look as if they are just floating on the water said jill dreamily they do look lovely i wish we could visit them well it would be quite easy if we chose low tide said andy pointing to the line of rocks that were now uncovered and which seemed to lead in a crooked line to the next island id like fine to go across those rocks tomorrow morning when the tide is low again we could take food for the dayand see what war on the next islandand climb back across the rocks at low tide tomorrow night oh do lets cried the twins and tom did a little wardance on the rocky ledge in excitement who knew what they might find on the next island that night jill cooked some potatoes in their skins and let them go cold to take with them next day well cook the sausages that are in the tin let them go cold and take those too said m we can catcb some fish tomorrow night for our evening meal when we come home the next morning they ran to see if the tide had uncovered the rocks again yesthere they stretched grey and green some quite bare some covered with seaweed very deep rockpools lay between the sea itself lay pale blue and sparkling beyond the line of rocks come on said andy wed better go now before the tide turns they leapt down from the ledge and ran to the sandy shore they jumped up on to the rocks and then began to make their way carefully over them some were so slippery that once or twice the children nearly fell into the deep pools these pools looked exciting quite big fish swam in them and andy said big edible crabs would be sure to be there but weve no time for fishing about here he said we shall be caught by the tide if we dont make haste sure enough the tide was on the turnbut before it could reach the jagged line of rocks over which the children were climbing they had come to the end of them and had waded through a pool to the sandy shore of the next island now were on island number two said tom capering about golly i am hungry so was every one well if we eat all our food now we shall have to wait ages for our next meal unless we can findsomething on this island said andy but he was hungry tooso they ate their cold sausages and potatoes and sucked a toffee each then they set off to explore the second island they turned to climb the cliff sand had a big surprise i look caves said tom pointing to big black openings in the cliff look at that caves of all lands and sizes and shapes lets have a look at them they made their way to the first caveand just outside it andy stopped and stared at something in the sand whats up asked tom that said andy and he pointed to a cigaretteend that lay rolling a little in the breeze a cigaretteend said tom looking all round as if he were looking for the one who had smoked it well somebody has been here all rightand not very long ago either but theres not a single house on this island ruined or whole perhaps the people live in these caves said jill looking halftimidly at the first one well go in and see said andy he pulled a roll of oilskin from his pocket and out of it took a halfcandle and a box of matches andy never ran any risk of his matches getting wetand now the children were glad that he was so careful for no one really wanted to go into the caves without a light of some sort andy lighted the candle and thea leading the way he stepped into the first cave the others followed him the floor was thick with silvery sand and the walls of the cave were high and smooth it ran back a long way and then narrowed into an archway through this the children went into another cave the tiny light of the candle shining on rocky grey walls and high rough roof the floor of the cave then began to go upwards and became rocky instead of sandy the cave narrowed into a passage whose roof was at times so low that they bomped their heads against it and then they came to the round cave which was the name they at once gave the last strange cave it was almost perfectly round and as the floor slanted down towards the middle it felt like being inside a hollow ball but it wasnt the roundness of the cave that startled the four childrenit was what it held piled high everywhere were boxes sacks and big tin chests with strange words on them some piles reached to the roof of the cave others reached halfway golly look at that said tom in the greatest astonishment whatevers in all those boxes and thingsand why are they here the little flame of the candle flickered on the strange array in the cave andy set the candle gently down on a flat piece of rock and pulled the neck of a thick brown sack undone it was lined with coarse blue paper inside he undid thatand then gave a low cry of surprise sugar stranger and stranger i was expecting treasure or somethingand its sugar i wonder whats in the other sacks and boxes some the children could not force open but others were already opened as if some one had taken from them some of the contents the boxes were full of tinsthere were tins of soup meat vegetables fruit sardineseverything one could think of there was a chest of flour a chest of tea tins of salt even tins of butter and lard wellsealed and airtight andyi really dont understand this said jill in a puzzled voice how did all these come here and who do you suppose they belong to as far as we know there isnt a single person on the island i dont know any more than you do jill said andy its like a dream but anyway we shant need to starve whilst theres all this food stored here but may we take it if it belongs to anyone else said mary frightened we can pay the person it belongs to said andy my father and your mother will gladly pay to keep us from starving if we have to spend the winter here well come on thenlets take all we want said tom feeling so hungry that he couldnt wait a minute longer wellkeep a careful account of everything we take and pay the bill and a little more when we find out who owns this very curious larder youre right tom said andy in a puzzled voice it is a verycuriouslarder chapter odder and odder the children each chose what they thought they would like to take away sugar they wanted and salt the tinned butter would be splendid and any tins of meat and fruit jill thought she might be able to make some rolls of bread with the flour or at any rate some scones they took tins of powdered milk too and each child carried quite a heavy load down the narrow passages that led from the round cave to the shorecave when they reached the open air tom took a deep breath and set down his load my goodness it was stuffy up there he said what puzzles me is why it wasnt more stuffy than it was said andy air must get into that round cave through some hole we didnt see pick up your things tom the tide is coming in we cant stay on this beach the sea will reach the cave before long its all right for about ten minutes said tom pulling a fat little notebook from his pocket i just want to jot down a list of all the things weve taken in case we eat them up and then forget what we had toms always so honest said jill well ill tell you the things tom and you can write them down three tins of pineapple one big bag of sugar three tins of tongue four tins of not so fast not so fast said tom busy writing he wrote everything down shut his notebook with a snap and pushed it back into his pocket then he picked up bis load and followed andy up the steep rocky path until the tide went out that night the children were prisoners on the second island for there was no way to get back to their own island except by the line of roeks this was now completely covered by the tide and great showers of spray were sent high into the air as the water crashed against the rocks over which they had clambered early that day anyone got a tinopener asked tom his mouth watering at the sight of the labels on the tins andy had in andys pockets there was almost anything that anyone could possibly want from tintacks to toffee youd better open a tin i suppose said andy with a grin ive watched you sticking your finger into the sugar packet a dozen times alreadyand therell be none left to take to our island if you do it much more open a tin of tongue and perhaps you wont feel so hungry for sugar they all feasted on the tongue which was really most delicious they felt very thirsty afterwards and as they bad not found any spring or stream on the second island they could not think what to do well why dont we open a tin of pineapple said tom at last the chunks will be lovely and juicy and we can all have a drink of the juice in the tin too so a tin of pineapple was opened both tins were carefully buried by the children for even although the island seemed quite lonely and deserted they could not bear to make it ugly by leaving empty tins about the gulls swooped round them all the time they ate screaming loudly andy imitated them and they grew even more excited at last landing on the ground behind the children and waiting there almost within touch these gulls know that where there are people there may be food said andy but how do they know thatthese islands seem quite bare and empty and how how how did all that food come to be in the round cave said jill could it have been there for years do you supposeand have been forgotten no said andy it hasnt been there very long the sugar was still softand sugar goes hard if it is stored for long that cigaretteend we found toothat had been smoked not less than a week or two ago or the wind would have blown it into bits andy dont you think it would be a good thing to stay on this island and live here instead of going back to our own island asked mary we should be near to a good foodsupply then no i dont said andy at once you forget we have left a signal on our islandand if any ship sees it and calls for us we might be on this island unable to be rescued because the tide was high and we couldnt get back but couldnt we tie the signal up somewhere on this island said tom no said andy no ship could get to us here this island is almost surrounded by a reef of the worst rocks ive ever seen look at them right out there the children looked andy was right a jagged line of rocks ran some way out from the coast between the rocks and the coast the sea lay trapped in a kind of big lagoon or lake calm and smooth tom frowned and looked puzzled well if no ship can get in to rescue us if we stay on this island he said how in the wofld did one get in to land all that food in the cave andy stared at tom and looked as puzzted as tom did yesthats odd he said wellmaybe there is a way through at high tide but we cant risk it we must live on the first island and when we want food we must come here and get itand maybe we shall run into the folk who so strangely made a larder in trie round cave mary stood up and tried to see what the next island was like it looked much bigger than the first two there was no line of rocks stretching to it but only an unbroken spread of blue water to get to the third island they would have to swim or use a boat do you think wed better leave a note in the cave to say that we are on the first island and would like to be rescued said tom the people may come back at any timeand we could go away in their boat andy shook his head i think we wont leave a noteor anything else to show weve been here he said theres something a bit mysterious about all this and if theres a secret going on wed better keep out of it till we know what it is oh andy whatever do you mean cried mary i dont know what i mean said andy its just a feeling i have thats all maybe im wrongbut one of us will come over here every day at low tide and just see if theres somebody about before we let them know were here well andywhat about all our footmarks round the cave said tom the tide will wash all those away said andy look over the cliffedge tomyoull see the tide has gone right into the cave now theres nothing that will show weve been there except that some of the food is missing said mary youve forgotten that andy no i havent said andy theres so much in that cave that i dont thinkanyone will miss the little weve taken i dont expect its checked at all nobody would think that any strangers would ever visit that cave the children wandered over the island and looked for bilberries which were fruiting there in great numbers it was a way of quenching their thirst to pick the small juicy bilberries the island was quite deserted it did not look as if anyone had ever lived there at all the tide went down and the line of rocks began to show the children clambered down to the shore to go tack to their own island they had tied to their backs the food they had taken and andy told everyone to be very careful we dont want to lose our food in a deep pool he said so dont rush along too fast tom you are always in such a hurry the rocks were wet and slippery but the children were very careful indeed once an extra large wave came and splashed right over jill and she gave a squeal oh has it wet the food yessoaked it called tom but never mindits all in tins jill they got back to their little hut at last and allof mem were delighted to see it it really seemed like coming home they sat down on their beds tired out but tom was not going to bed without his supper he wanted hot soup more tongue and a tin of peaches so the stove had to be lighted and tom was sent to fill the kettle all the children enjoyed the meal although they were so sleepy they could hardly bother to clear up afterwards the first stars were in the sky as they flung themselves on their beds its awfullv early to go to bed murmured jill sleepily buff cant keep awake another minute and she fell asleep at once so did mary tom blew out the stove and lay down too andy sat up for a while looking out towards the second island and wondering about a lot of things then he too lay down and fell asleepbut not for long a strange and curious noise awoke him it came into his dreams startled him and roused him so that he sat up puzzled and alarmed tom wake up said andy listen to this noise what is it tom awoke and listened if s a motorbicycle he said half asleep dont be a fathead said andy a motorbicycle on this island youre dreaming come on wake upi tell you theres a jolly queer noise the noise itself hummed away into silence the gulls screamed but soon became quiet andy sat and listened a little longer and then as no more noise came lay down on his springy bed again odder and odder said andy to himself we seem to have come to some most mysterious islandsand im going to find out whats happeningor my name isnt andy chapter the mysterious visitors the next day the children talked about the queer noise that andy had heard i tell you it sounded exactly like a motorbicycle tom said firmly and nothing would make him admit that it wasnt if i didnt know there couldnt possibly be any landingground on these rocky islands i might have thought the noise was made by an aeroplane said andy thoughtfully but thats silly why would an aeroplane come here and where would it land it might be a motorboat perhaps said jill suddenly the others stared at her for some reason nobody had thought of motorboats till then yesi believe it was said andy it had that hrobbing sound that a motor makes now whats a motorboat doing here but anywayit means that we can be rescued of course said tom welllets go and find the motorboat what a surprise theyll get when they suddenly see us i theyll wonder wherever weve come from tom dont be in so great a hurry said andy pulling the impatient boy down into the heather i think theres something funny going on hereand before we show ourselves wed better find out if we shall be welcome oh said tom surprised the girls looked rather alarmed what do you meansomething funny said jill i dont know as i said yesterday said andy but what we will do is to see where that motorboat is it wont have seen our signal because it came in the nightand we know its not anywhere this side of the island or we would have seen it this morning i vote we go to that rocky ledge where we get the best view of the second island and see if by any chance a boat has been able to get through the reef of rocks and sail into the quiet lagoon inside the four children made their way to the high rocky ledge andy made them lie down flat and wriggle like red indians as they reached it better not let ourselves be seen if anyone is down there he whispered so as flat as snakes they wormed their way to the rocky ledgeand when they got there they had the biggest surprise of their lives in the quiet water that lay outside the second island was a large and powerful seaplane yesa great seaplane whose wings spread widely over the blue water no small motorboat purred there it was the seaplanes engine that andy had heard so mysteriously in the middle of the night whew look at that whispered andy his face going as red as a beetroot with excitement i never thought of a seaplane what a very extraordinary thing lets get up and shout and wave begged jill im sure they will love to rescue us havent you seen the sign on the wings asked tom in a curiously angry voice the girls looked the sign of the crooked cross was painted on each wingthe sign of the enemy the foe of half the world golly said mary and she drew a deep breath enemiesi using these islands do they belong to them of course not said andy but they are desolate and out of the usual ships courseand theyve been noted by the enemy and hes using them as a kind of base for somethingseaplanes perhaps wellwhat are we going to do asked tom we shall have to think said andy one thing is certain we wont show ourselves tfll weve found out a fittfe more we dont want to be taken prisoner thats what that food was for thenthe people who come here said jill i suppose the seaplanes come over here for food and petrol ifs a good idea how i wish we could get away and tell my father about ithed know what to do i guess hed clean up this place whatever its used for i sayhadnt we better take down our signal whilst that seaplane is here asked jill if it happens to see it the enemy will know there are people on this island and what about the fishingboat that might be seen too i dont think so said andy its well hidden between those rocks but the signal had certainly better come down we wont put it up any more come on tomwell take it down now well come with you said the girls but andy shook his head no he said from now oh somebody must keep a watch on that seaplane we must find out all we can we will be back with you as soon as possiblebut you must stay here and watch so the two girls were left behind whflst the boys ran across the island to take down their flapping signal i dont know where in the world we should hide if we were discovered and hunted for said andy rolling up the sail there isnt a single place here to hide away innot a cave or anything tom felt rather uncomfortable he didnt want to be hunted for on that bare island i wish we could see how many men there are in that seaplane he said and what they are doing and everything where are your fieldglasses asked andy suddenly they would be just the thing to use we could see everything as dearly as could be then and my camera too said tom jumping for joy what about my camera we could take some photographs of the seaplanethen everyone would have to believe us when we get backif ever we do get back thats a fine idea said andy really pleased golly if we could take some pictures of that seaplane with thfr crooked cross showing up clearly there wouldnt be the least doubt of our story when we got home tom lets go and get your glasses and your camera straight away they dumped the sail into a bush and ran to the shack they took toms fieldglasses and picked up the camera to see if it needed a new film nothere was a new one inside better not use up all the film on the seaplane said andy there might be other interesting and extraordinary things to photographyou never know oh ive got three or four films said tom i brought plenty with me thinking i was going to get some good bird pictures you know come onlets go back to the girls and see what they have to report the girls were very glad indeed to see the boys they had a lot to tell andy tom as soon as you had gone the men in the seaplane put out a funny little round sort of boat said jill in excitement and they paddled to shore in it and went to our cave what a good thing the sea had washed away all our footprints it was indeed said andy tom give me the fieldglasses i want to have a look through them andy stared through the powerful glasses they were so strong that they seemed to bring the seaplane near enough to touch the boy saw the great crooked crosses boldly painted on the wings he saw the little rubber boat left bobbing in the surf whilst the men visited the caveeither to take something to it or to bring something away andy did not know which there seems to be someone in the seaplane said andy and lookthere are some men coming from the cave andy could see them very clearly through his fieldglassesand the others could see them too though not so well of course to them the men looked like faraway dolls theyve gone to get food from the cave said andy in excitement and i guess theres a store of petrol somewhere else for them to get when they want to foodand petroljust what i thought using these islands saves enemy planes from having to go hundreds of miles to their own countrys stores my wordwe have stumbled on to something queer the men entered their rubber boat and rowed back to the seaplane twice more they went to the cave and back then they climbed up into the plane and disappeared im getting most awfully hungry said tom at last cant we go and get something to eat ill stay here and keep watch and you and the girls can go and get your dinner said andy dont light a fire whatever you dothe enemy will see the smoke use the stove if you want to cook anything bring me something to eat and drink later right said tom and he and the girls wriggled off the high ledge they stood upright as soon as they were out of sight of the seaplane and tore to their shack they ate a hurried meal and did not cook anything at all they made up a dinnerpacket for andy and set off to take it to him but halfway there they heard a noise rrrrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrrr they stopped at once and listened its the seaplane going off cried tomand then the sound came again more loudly than ever rrrrrrr lookits there cried jill drop flat to the ground or wellbe seen jill had seen the seaplane just rising into the air over the cliff the three children dropped flat to the ground and lay there perfectly still the seaplane roared over their island rose higher and higher and at last was nothing but a speck in the sky what a narrow escape said tom sitting up and wiping his forehead golly my heart did go bump i ive spilt the water i was carrying for andy ill have to get some more it was a shock to see that enormous plane coming said jill oh dearif we have many more shocks my hair will turn grey chapter and now for the third island the children were very glad that the seaplane had gone its a jolly good thing our signal was taken down before it flew over the island said andy eating the food that the others had brought to him i couldnt warn you it started up its engine all of a sudden taxied over the smooth water there and then rose into the air andy do you think theres anything to be seen over on the other islands asked tom there may be said andy i think we ought to try and find out that third island looks a peculiar shape to mevery long indeed but very narrow on the other side of it might be a fine natural harbour for seaplanes there may be heaps there well weve only heard one so far said tom it doesnt seem as if theyre very busy if there are lots over there noyoure right tom said andy well what about going to see what we can find i dont quite know how well get to the third islandhave to swim i think i dont believe the girls could swim so far though i dont think i could said jill remembering the long stretch of sea between the second and third islands you boys would have to go without us mary and i will stay behind and be as patient as we can shall we go tomorrow asked tom eagerly we could cross to the second island at low tide in the morning and swim across to the third island we could carry a little food with us wrapped up in your oilskin yeswelldo mat said andy a great feeling of excitement came over the childrena feeling as if some big unknown secret was going to be theirs jill shivered a littleit was almost too exciting theres one thing im worried about said andy just suppose we are discovered by any chancewe must find some hidingplace well there simply isnt any on this island said tom so we must hope we wont be discovered nothing more happened that day no seaplane came to the calm harbour in the waters of the second island no sound but the seagulls came through the air it was a lovely day and the children enjoyed themselves bathing and sunning their brown bodies thanks to the store of food they had discovered on the second island they had plenty to eat andy caught some nice little fish and jill fried them in tine tinned butter they were delicious now that they had tinned mulepowder they could make a milkmixture and use it with their tea or cocoa and could also sweeten their drinks with the sugar they had brought we are really very well off now said tom who as usual was thoroughly enjoying his meal welltake another exciting lot of tins away from the round cave next timei saw some baked beans in tomato sauce i should like those the children took turns at keeping watch on the second island from the rocky ledge but nothing was to be seen at all they went to bed early because the boys would have rather a hard and long day the next day we shall have to clamber over that line of rocks first said andy and then we must cross the island and swim to the third one we shall have to be back on the second island in time to clamber over the rocks at the next low tide you girls mustnt worry about us we shall be back all right i do wish we were going too said jill dont you think mary and i could climb over the rocks to the second island and wait for you there it would be more fun for us to play about there than on this bare island there are lots of bilberries there we could pickthey are lovely and sweet now all right said andy but just keep a watch for any seaplane arriving lie down fiat under a bush or something if you hear one you mustnt be seen all right said mary you can trust us to do that so the next morning the four children once again climbed over the line of skppery rocks at low tide the boys had on only their bathingsuits andy had tied his oilskin packet safely to his shoulders and in it was plenty of food for the day the girls could get what they wanted from the cave all four went across the second island over the heather and bracken to where they could see the third island it lay in the sea before them like a long blue and brown snake beyond they could see one or two more islands do you really think you can swan so far tom asked mary doubtfully as she looked at the wide spread of water between the second island and the third of course said tom who wasnt going to give up this adventure for anything all the same the distance was further than he had ever swum before wellgoodbye for the present said andy to the girls well get down to the shore here wade out as far as we can and then swim have you got tom fieldglasses jill goodyou can watch us through them all the way to the third island the boys went down to the shore waded into the water and then when they were out of their depth began to swim andy was by far the stronger swimmerbut he kept close to tom just in case the younger boy got into difficulties on and on they swam using the breaststroke because andy said it was the least tiring when tom began to pant a little halfway across andy spoke to him lets do a spot of floating tom that will rest us a little its a long way the two boys lay on their backs in the water it was a little rough and choppy but quite warm they floated like logs of wood spread out flat on the water it was a fine rest for tom then once more they swam onbut it began to seem as if tom would not reach the shore of the third island his arms felt so tired his legs seemed to have no push in them he gasped and panted and andy began to feel alarmed tread water a bit he called to tom do you think youll be able to swim the rest of the way i dont know said poor tom dreadfully ashamed of himself but he could not seem to make his arms work properly he was really tired out andy was not in the least tired he was as strong as a horse and he trod water beside tom wondering what to do try again tom he said its no use going back we are more than halfway across tom looked at the cliff of the third island it seemed a long long way away still he tried again striking out bravely with his tired arms but after about six strokes he could not swim any more he turned on his back and floated again andy was really alarmed tom you cant do any more he said id have to help you ill swim on my baek and you must lie on your front and put your hands on my shoulders i can drag you along in the water that way but it will be rather slow thanks andy said tom very angry with his poor swimming but quite unable to do anything else he took hold of andys shoulders and andy lying on his back with his head towards the third island began to strike out valiantly with his brown legs it was very slow indeed and now andy began to get tired taking two people wasnt nearly so easy as only one and he began to gasp now wftat were they to do if they both got into difficulties it would be a very serious matter it wasnt long before neither tom nor andy had any strength leftand goodness knows what would have happened if andy striking out desperately with his legs had not fdt something hard beneath him it was a rock he felt about with his feet and at last discovered a rock below the water they had come to a kind of rocky reef rather like the one they had climbed over from their own island to the second onebut this line of rocks was not uncovered by the tide tom tom put your feet down and feel where the rocks are gasped andy we can stand thereand maybe feel our way along a bit till we come to tne sandy bottom tom soon found foothold on the rocks under the vwater he felt better at once he and andy held hands isarf together made their way very cautiously over tins i sunken rocks bruising their poor feet but getting gradually nearer to the shore and at last they felt the rocks stop and there was sand beneath their feet good golly i didnt enjoy that very much said tom sorry i was so feeble andy its all right said andy you did your best were all right now but in his own mind andy didnt think they were at all all right how in the world was he going to get tom over that stretch of water back to the second island gain he would never never do it andy was very worried indeed but he didnt show it he grinned at tom his blue eyes shining in his wet brown face were here at last he said and maybe we shall get a few surprises they lay on the sandy shore in the sun for a while drying themselves tom felt very much better alter a meal out of the oilskin packet he almost felt as if he could swim back home again it was wonderful what food did to tom i feel a new man now he said leaping to his feet come on andy old chap lets go up to the clifftop and go across to the other side of this island to see if we can spy anything andy got up too the two boys climbed up the rough cliff and sat on the top to get back their breath the island seemed to be about the same as the other twocovered with heather bracken and grass and with white gulls soaring over it they crossed the narrow width of the island and at last came to the cliff on the other side wriggle along on the ground now just in case theres anyone about said andy so both boys wriggled along on their fronts and came at last to a lace where they could see down to the water far below and what they saw there filled them with such astonishment and alarm that for at least five minutes neither boy could say a word chapter the secret of the islands the sight that the two boys looked down upon was hardly to be believed there was a very fine natural harbour of extremely deep water on the northeastern ide of the third islandand lying in this water were at least seven or eight submarines submarines a submarine base in those deserted islands no wonder so many of our ships had been sent to the bottom in the waters around these islands its a real nest of submarines whispered andy at last enemy submarines i i cant believe it my word tom weve stumbled on an amazing secret the boys lay looking down on the water some of the submarines lay like great grey crocodiles humped out of the water one or two were moving out of the harbour their periscopes showing it was a curiously silent place considering that so many of these underwater ships were there there was no noise of shoutingno noise of machineryjust a dull throbbing every now and again they get fuel and food here whispered andy they are the small submarinesthis harbour can easily take a dozen or more its a perfect place for submarines do you see how they havent built any jetties or piersnot a thing that anyone could see if one of our own planes came over all they would have to do then would be to sink under the waterand then there would be nothing to see they store everything in the cavesgolly its amazing for a very long time the two boys lay watching the strange sight below two submarines slipped silently out of the harbour entrancea way between two reefs of high rocks a third submarine came in and lay peacefully with the others the men coming out on the deck and looking around at first tom had been so full of surprise and alarm go swept with excitement that he could think of nothing but the sight of the queer vessels then another thought came into his head and he turned to andy andy he said weve got to get home and tell what weve seen i know said andy im thinking that too tom and weve got to get the girls off these islands we are all in danger if the enemy knew we were spying on them like this i dont know what would happen to us i dont care how much danger were in said tom and he didnt all i know is that weve got to go and tell our people at home about this submarine base its got to be cleared away andy its serious andy nodded both boys seemed to become men at that moment they looked gravely into each others eyes and what they saw there pleased them both each boy knew that the other would do his best and even more than his best do you think we shall be believed if we go home with a story like this said tom grownups have some funny ideas sometimes they might think we had made it all upor been mistaken well get your camera and take a few photographs said andy nobody can disbelieve photographs and another thing we must do is to try to do something with our boat we must get it off the rocks somehow and try to patch it up its our only way of getting back home they watched the harbour for a little while longer and then wriggled along the top of the cliff till they came to some bushes they went down by these and ran along till they came to the end of the harbour beyond lay a cove and in it drawn up to the sand were a number of small boats no one seemed to be about the sight of the little boats excited andy if only he could get hold of one then he and tom could row round the third island and get back to the second one safely andy knew perfectly well that tom could not swim backand he did not mean to leave the boy alone on this submarine island tom he said see those boats well what about waiting tffl nighttimeand then stealing down to the cove and taking a boat we could easily row it back to the second island it would save us having to swimand we might even fill it with food and water and try our luck at going home i could fix up the sail somehow good idea andy said tom his face glowing with excitement but i say wont the girls be awfully worried if we dont swim back before low tide tonight well go to the cliff on the other side of this island and wave to them said andy theyve got the fieldglasses and will see us quite clearly well point and wave and nod and try to show them that our plans are altered but that were all light good said tom lets go now i feel so awfully excited that i really must do something the boys went to the other side of the island after a while the girls appeared and waved to them jill put the glasses to her eyes the boys seem frightfully pleased and excited about something she said they are waving and pointing and nodding like anything they seem to want us to understand something well itcan only be that they have found something exciting and are going to do something about it said mary taking the glasses from jill and looking through them yestoms like a mad thing well we shall know when they come back tonight i only hope tom will be able to swim back all right i was really afraid hed drown this morning the boys disappeared after a time they sat down in a little sunny hollow and finished the rest of the food andy found a stream of water and the boys drank from it then they sat talking quietly waiting for the night to come at last it came the moon was behind the clouds and gave only a pate light now and again the boys slipped quietly to the top of the cliff that overlooked the small cove next to the harbour they had already planned the easiest way down andy went first he climbed like a cat tom followed him trying not to send any stones clattering down the cliff they came to the shore it was sandy and their feet made no noise the boys stayed in the shadow of the cliffs for a few minutes listening they could hear no noise at all except the small sound of little waves breaking on the sand the boats were not far off upturned in a row no one was guarding them indeed why should anyone no one had ever set foot on the islands since the farmfolk had gonesave for the crews of enemy seaplanes and submarines the boys crept over the silvery sand take the boat on the left whispered andy its just our size they came to the boatand then they heard voices they seemed to come from the far side of the cliff and sounded clearly in the night the boys could not hear any wordsbut the soundwas enough to make them lie down sat beside the boat they had chosen tom was trembling suppose they were found out just as they were taking the boat it would be too bad the boys listened until the sound of voices died away and then they cautiously lifted their heads when the moon gets into that very thick cloud wellturn the boat over and run her into the water whispered andy you take this side and ill take the other be ready right whispered back tom so when the moon slipped behind the dark clouds the boys rose silently to their feet they turned over the boat with hardly a sound though it was awkward and heavy then they pulled it over the sand to the water tom got in and took the oars andy pushed the boat right out and leapt in himself the moon was still hidden silently the boys rowed away from the shore hoping that the moon would remain behind the cloud until they had pulled out of sight no shout was heard no running feet they were undiscovered so far they rowed fast when the moon came out again they were far from the little cove look i pull round a bit more said andy were passing round the end of the island weve done well to get here so quickly soon they were right round the narrow end of the third island they rowed into the broad stretch of water between the second and third islands then across to the shore below the cliff where they had left the girls jill and mary were watching there they had been very worried when night had come and brought with it no boys they couldnt imagine what had happened they were in a great state of alarm and fright and tben jill looking through the glasses when the moon had swum out into a clear piece of sky had seen a little boat coming into the stretch of water between the two islands she clutched marys arm look a boat is it the enemy the girls looked and looked their hearts w beating loudly they could not see who was in the boat it landed on the beachand then the call of a sea gull floated up the cliff andy cried jill nearly falling down the cliff its andy id know his sea gull call anywhere the boys climbed up the cliff and came to the rocky ledge the girls fell on them and hugged them like bears they were so relieved to see them the boat where did you get the boat cried jill what did you see what did you find cried mary well tell you all about it said andy and the four of them sat close together on the cold windy ledge quite forgetful of the chilly breeze talking and listening eagerly the girls could hardly believe the boys story it seemed quite impossible and now that weve got a boat well fill it full of food and water and see if we can get home said andy its the only thing we can doand we must do it but andy said jill just suppose the enemy see their boat is missingwont they take alarm and search the islands yesthey certainly will said andy and so we must start tomorrow we will have a good sleep tonighttake plenty of food from the caveand see if we can make for home if only we can get away before the enemy finds that boat is missing said tom oh do you suppose we shall chapter a daring adventure the children did not have a very good night after all for they were far too excited to sleep they had all rowed jn the stolen boat to their own island and had landed there tied up the boat and gone to their shack they slept rather late the next morning for not one of them had gone to sleep before midnightand they were awakened by the throbbing noise that they had heard two nights before the seaplane again said andy waking up at once and leaping to his feet he ran to the open doorway of the hut and was just in time to see the plane soar overhead then it went round in great circles ready to land on the smooth water outside the second island that means we cant get away today said tom at once we simply must get food into the boatand we cant if that plane is there nowe cant said andy but i tell yoo what we might do tom we might row to the third island tie our boat up in a hidden place creep to the top of that cliff and try to take a few photographs of the submarine bay we meant to take some photos you know yeswe could do that said tom wellhave to be pretty careful though we will be said andy jill what is there for breakfast there were tinned sausages and baked beans and tomato sauce jill proudly produced some little rolls of bread she had made too they all ate in silence thinking over everything that had happened that seaplane may not stay long said andy it didnt last time i expect k has come to add to the storesor maybe take away from them it will be busy that side of the islandso we will row round the after side where we wont be seen go across to the third one and tie up there you girls must stay here oh you always have the exciting things to do sighed mary cant we really come with you i dont see why we cant well if you promise to do exactly what youre told you can come said andy after a minutes thought he didnt really like the idea of leaving the girls all alone again perhaps it would be better if they came the girls were thrilled they cleared away the breakfastthings and washed up they prepared a meal to take with them it was a very good thing they had discovered that store cavethey now had plenty of food of all kinds they did hope the seaplane wouldnt take everything away they all got into the boat the boys rowed off and were careful to keep to the side opposite the cave when they came to the second island they rowed quickly over the space of water separating that island from the third one and came to the farthest tip of ft here there was a tiny beach with steep overhanging cliffsso overhanging that it almost seemed as if a big piece was about to fall off just the place said andy pulling into the tiny beach jump out girls take the food with yougive a hand with the boat tom well run it up the beach and put it right under that dangerous piece of cliff it will be well hidden there they put the boat there and looked at it the end of it jutted out and could be seen jill ranto a seaweedcovered rock and pulled off handfuls of the weed lets make the boat into a rock she said with a laugh cover it with seaweed jolly good idea said andy i didnt know girls could have such good ideas you wait and see what fine ideas we have said mary they an pulled at the seaweed and soon the boat was nicely draped and looked so exactly like a seaweedcovered rock that no one could possibly guess it wasnt even as they passed quite near it thats good said andy now well make our way very carefully across this end of the island till we come to the little cove where we took our boat from well just peep over the cttff and see if theres anyone there looking as though they have missed the boat then well crawl to the top of the next cliff that overlooks the submarine bay and tom shall take a few pictures everything went well keeping close to tall bushes of gone and bramble the four children crept over the tip of the island and soon came to the cliff below which was the boatcove cautiously andy parted some bramble sprays and peeped down to the beach below there were the rest of the little boats still upturned nobody was about at all as far as andy could see the stolen boat had not been missed good andy let the rest of the children look down to the beach tom was pleased as long as our boat isnt missed we are all right he said i should think the enemy feel they are so safe here that it just doesnt enter their heads that a boat might be taken i dont believe theyll ever miss it i hope youre right said andy but it doesnt do to think the enemy is careless or stupid we must think they are smart and clever and try to be the same ourselves now lets wriggle along to the next bit of cliffand you girls can see the submarines that will be a sight for you going very slowly and cautiously indeed the four of them made their way under bushes and bracken to the top of the next cliff they all lay on their tummies and peeped between the tall bracken the girls drew a long breath of surprise golly said jill onetwothree fourfivesixsevenhowever many submarines are there and all of them marked with the crooked cross an enemy submarine base so near our own land said mary and nobody knows it wheres your camera tom whispered andy tom had it round his shoulder carefully he took it out of its waterproof case and set it for taking distant pictures its got the seaplane on the first two negatives said the boy in a low tone ill fill up the rest of the film with photos of the submarines the pictures can easily be made larger when we get home then nobody can disbelieve us or say we made it all up click went the camera qne picture taken said tom i got in those two big submarines together just over there click click click click tom was as careful as he could be to take good photographs soon the whole film was used ill wait till i get back to the hut and then in wind off the film in a dark comer said the boy thats a spot of good work done he put the camera back into its case and strapped it op the four children lay and looked at the nest of submarines in the water below another came slipping in as they watched two slipped out gone to sink some more of our ships i suppose said andy angrily if only i could stop them but we will clean up the whole lot once we get the news back home i guess well have a battleship or two sent out here where will it be safe to have something to eat asked tom i do feel hungry i wish i had a shilling for every time ive heard tom say that said jill with a giggle well i only say what the rest of you are thinking said tom i bet youre all hungry they were andy found a little bracken dell not far from the top of the cliff here the bracken was taller than the children and once they had settled themselves down below the tall fronds nobody could possibly see them either from above or passing by they ate a good meal and enjoyed it they lay on fceir backs and looked between the fronds at the blue sky it was marvellous that the weather was still so good it would have been miserable if it had rained all the time now wed better get back said andy oh why asked jill lazily i was almost asleep ill tell you why said andy supposing that stolen boat is missedwell the first place searched would be this island and wed be found nothe best thing tor us to do is to get back now wait till the seaplane has left and then go straight to the storecave and fill our boat with food then well start off tonight all right well come along now then said jill getting up they took one last peep at the submarine bay and another at the boatcove then they made their way very cautiously back to the tiny beach where they had hidden their boat it was still there beautifully draped with seaweed nobody had discovered it the children dragged it down to the waves and jumped into it andy pushed it out they took turns at rowing they were halfway round the second island on the coast opposite to the one where the storecave was when a dreadful thing happened the seaplane chose that minute to leave the water by the second island and to rise into the air ready to fly off the children had no time to rush their boat into shore and hide they were out on the sea clearly to be seen crouch down flat in the boat so that the pilot may perhaps think theres nobody in it ordered andy they shipped the oars quickly and crouched down the seaplane rose up high and the children hardly dared to breathe they did so hope it would fly off without noticing them but it suddenly altered its course and began to circle round coming down lower it flew down low enough to examine the boat and then rising high flew over the third island and then flew down to the submarine bay andy sat up his face rather pale under its brown thats done it he said they saw us now theyll count their boatsfind theres one missingand come to look for us chapter tom disappears the children looked at one another in the greatest dismay to think the seaplane should have flown over just at that very moment it was too bad well we cant sit here looking at one another said andy in a brave voice weve got to do something quickly but what i cant seem to think nobody could think what to do andy longed desperately for some grownup who could take command and tell him what would be the best thing to do but there was no grownup this was something he had to decide himselfand he must decide well because the two girls were in his care we had better row straight round to the storecave and fill the boat with food whilst we can he said at last then well start out straightaway and hope that the seaplane wont spot us out on the sea its the only thing to do it was a long row round to the cave but they got there at last quite tired out there was nobody about they beached the boat and jumped out it was not long before they were in the round cave carrying out stacks of tins and boxes to the boat golly weve got enough food to last for weeks said tom we may need it said andy goodness knows how far it is back home ive not much idea of the right direction either but i shall do my best tom staggered out to the boat with heaps of things andy looked at the pile of food at the end of the boat and nodded bis head thats enough he said we dont want to make the boat too heavy to row get in they all got in they rowed out beyond the reef of rocks where they had found a way in and then towards their own island andy wanted to get the rugs for he was sure they would be bitterly cold at night you girls jump out and go and fetch all the warm things you can find said andy and bring a cup or two and a knife ive got a tinopener the girls sped off to the shack in the hollowand whilst they were gone the boys heard the sound they dreaded to hearthe noise of seaplane engines booming over the water there it comes again said andy angrily always at the wrong moment lie down flat tom i hope the girls will have the sense to do the same the seaplane zoomed down low over the island as if it were hunting for someone then it droned over the sea and flew round in great circles andy lifted his head and watched it you know what its doing he said its flying round hunting the sea for our boatjust as a hawk flies over fields hunting for mice its a good thing we didnt set out straightaway i think now wed better wait for the night to comeand then set out in the darkness we should be seen as easily as anything if we try to go now they waited till the drone of the planes engines was far away it was hunting the waters everywhere for the stolen boat andy stood up and yelled to the girls who were lying flat under a bush its gone for the moment help us to take out these goods and hide them if the boat is discovered here and taken away and we are made prisoners on this island we shall at least be sure of stores if we are able to start out tonight we can easily pat back the food said tom they all worked hard and buried the tins and boxes under some loose sand at the top of the beach they pulled the boat farther up the beach and then sat down to rest hot and tired and then poor tom gave a squeal of dismay the others jumped and looked at him in fright whatevers the matter asked andy my camera said tom his face a picture of horror my camerawith all those pictures i took i left it in the storecave left it in the storecave said everyone whatever for well i was afraid id bump it against the rocks carrying it up and down those passages said tom so i took it off for a minute meaning to put it on when we went and i forgot you fathead said jill dont call me that said poor tom looking almost ready to cry well fathead is too good a name said mary thinhead would be better you cant possibly have gohmy brains if you do a thing like that so you must be a thinhead with no brains at all tom went very red he blinked his eyes and swallowed a lump that hadsuddenly come into his throat he knew how valuable the pictures were that he had taken how could he have come to forget his camera like that cheer up tom said andy i know what you feel like i felt just like that when i found id forgotten to bring the anchor in the ship its awful tom was grateful to andy for not scolding him but all the same he felt really dreadful they had gone to such a lot of trouble to get those photographsand now all because of his carelessness they had been left behind i vote we have something to eat said andy thinking that would cheer tom up but it didnt for once in a way tom had no appetite at all he couldnt eat a thing he sat nearby looking gloomily at the others the seaplane did not come back the children sat and waited for the evening to come when they might start jill yawned i must do something for the next two or three hours she said or i shall fall asleep i think ill take the kettle and keep filling it with water at the spring and bring it back to the boat theres a big waterbarrel there and we could fill it with water good idea said andy you and mary do that i think ill just wander up to the bush where we put the sail and see if its still there i dont think ive time to rig up some kind of a mast in this little boat so the sail wont be any good but it might be useful to cover us with if it should happen to pour with rain the girls went off andy nodded to tom who was still looking gloomy and went across the island to the bush where he had put the sail tom was left alone they dont want me with them thought the boy quite wrongly they think im awful i think im awful too oh dearif only i could get my camera he thought of the reef of rocks that led to the second island it wasnt a bit of use trying to climb over them because the tide was getting high now but then he thought of the boat it really wasnt a great distance to row to the cave from the beach where he was how pleased the others would be if he got back his camera the boy did not stop to think he dragged the boat down the beach by himself though he nearly pulled his arms out doing it he pushed it into the water and jumped in he took the oars and began to row quickly round to the second island he would land on the shore then run quickly to the cave and get his camera then ill be back here with it almost before the others know im gone he thought nobody would have known what tom had done if andy had not happened to look round as he went over the little island to find the old sail tohis enormous astonishment he saw their boat being rowed away he could not see that the one in it was tom and for a moment he stood still wondering what had happened was it another boat not their own he ran quickly to find out he soon saw that it was their own boat he saw where tom had dragged it down the beach he could just see the boat rounding the corner of a cliff now that was tom all right said andy to himself the girls came back at that moment and shouted to andy whats the matter why do you look like that wheres the boat toms gone off with it said andy angrily tom whatever do you mean andy asked jill in the greatest surprise i suppose he felt upset about leaving his camera behind and hes gone to get it by himself said andy he really is a fathead he may be seen and caught im quite sure someone will be hunting for us soon really i could shake tom till his teeth rattled the girls stared at andy in dismay they did not at all like the idea of their brother going off alone in the boat wellthey would just have to wait patiently till tom came back it should not really take him a very long time the sun was sinking now he should be back by the time it was gone then they could all start out again and try to make for home jill set the kettle of water down on the beach she felt tired mary sat down beside her and looked out over the water for tom to come back andy walked up and down impatiently he could understand that tom longed to get back his camera and put himself right with the others so that they no longer thought him careless and sfflybut he did wish he hadnt gone off in their precious boat the three children waited and waited the sun sank lower it disappeared over the skyline and the first stars glimmered in the darkening sky and still tom was not back the girls could no longer see anything on the sea which was now dark they could only sit and listen for the plash of oars tom ought to be back by now said andy anxiously hes had plenty of time to get a dozen cameras i whatever is he doing nobody knew they sat there on the chilly beach anxious and worried if only only tom would come back nobody would scold him nobody would grumble at him they just wanted him to come i should think hes been caught said andy at last there cant be any other reason why hes not back now were in a pretty fix no tomand no boat chapter a prisoner in the cave what had happened to tom a great many things he had rowed safely to the beach where the caves lay hidden in the cliff behind he had dragged the boat up the sand and had gone into the first cave he stumbled through the rocky archway and into the queer round cave which was so full of food he had no torch so he had to feel around in the dark for his camera it took him a long time to find it where did i put it wondered the boy anxiously oh if only i had a match but he hadnt he felt over tins and boxesand at last his handfell on the boxlike shape of his camera safe in its waterproof covering good tom thought now ill just rush down to the boat and row back i really must be quick or the others will be worried but tom had a dreadful shock as he was about to make his way out of the round cave back to the beach he heard voices the boy stood perfectly still his heart beating fast whose voices were these they came nearer men were on the beach outside men had found his boat was it the enemy alas for poor tomit was the enemy tom had not heard the boom of the seaplane coming down on the water he had not seen a rubber boat putting off hurriedly to the cave but now he could hear the voices of the men they had seen the boat on the beach and had come to examine it they soon saw that it was the stolen boat which had now been missed and was being searched for the men knew at once where the owner of the boat wasin the eavel and they were going to search for him there tom darted back into the round cave and hid behind a big pile of boxes he felt quite certain he would be foundand as he crouched there trembling and excited he made up his mind very very firmly that he would not say how many others had come to the islands with him he would make the men think that he was the only onethen nlaybe the other three would not be hunted for ive been a perfect silly to run into danger like this thought poor tom but at any rate i can save the others from being hunted for perhaps the men came into the round cave they had powerful torches which they flashed aroundand almost at once they saw toms feet sticking out from behind a box they dragged him out and stood him up they seemed most astonished to find only a boy they had expected a man they talked quickly among themselves in a language that tom could not understand then one man who could talk english spoke to tom how did you get to this island i set off in a sailingboat and a storm blew up and wrecked me said tom you can see my boat off the coast of the next island if you look is there anyone else with you on this island asked the man speak the truth tom could reply quite truthfully that there was no one else with him on the island thank goodness the others were on the first island there isnt anyone else here with me he answered search the cave and see the men did search the cave again but found nobody of course they did not seem satisfied however tom could see that they felt sure there were others to find how did you find this cave asked the man who spoke english by accident said tom and i suppose you also found our boat by accident and saw the submarines by accident said the man in a very nasty voice are you sure there is no one else here with you quite sure said tom wouldnt you see them in the cave if there were we shall not take your word for it said the man with a horrid laugh we shall search this island and both those next to itand if we find anyone else you will be very very sorry for yourself you wont find anyone said tom hoping to goodness that they wouldnt and wishing he could warn andy and the girls somehow are you going to keep me prisoner we certainly are said the man and as you seem so fond of ibis cave well let you stay here youve food to eatand you wont be able to do any spying round if youre here in this cave we shall put a man on guard at the entranceso if you try to get out or anyone else tries to get in youll be caught our man will be well hidden behind a rock at the entranceand if any friends of yours try to rescue you they will get a shock tom listened his heart sinking into his shoes what an idiot he had been he was to be a prisonerand it the others tried to find him they would be made prisoners too for they would never guess a sentry was hidden behind the rocks watching for them tom sat down on a box he would not cry he would not show the men how frightened and worried he was his face was brave and boldbut inside he felt as if he was crying buckets of tears if only only he could get word to andy there was nothing he could donothing he could only sit there in the cave surrounded by marvellous food that he felt too worried even to look at and think abodt the others poor tom it was a dreadful punishment for being careless enough to forget his camera and foolish enough to try and fetch it the men left a lamp in the cave for tom it was getting late and the boy was tiredbut he could not sleep he heard the men go out and he knew a sentry had been placed by the rocks he could not hope to escape but he could try so very quietly he made his way through the rocky archway down to the shorecave below but his feet set the stones moving here and there and a voice came out of the darkness he could not understand what was said to him but the voice was so stern that the boy fled back to the round cave at once it wasnt a bit of good trying to escape he sat down again and wondered about the others what were they thinking and doing would they guess he had gone to fetch his camera and come to look for him when the tide uncovered the rocks next day if so they would certainly be caught andy and the girls sat up until they could keep awake no longer they went back to the shack curled up on their beds and slept restlessly worrying about tom and the lost boat in the morning andy went out cautiously wondering if the enemy had already landed a boat on their island to hunt for them but he could see nothing strange he sat talking to the girls as they prepared breakfast tom is certainly caught he said theres no doubt about that im afraid well i know enough of tom to know that he wont say we are here too he wont give us away but they will certainly come and hunt for anyone else who might be here we have to do two thingshide ourselves so that we cant possibly be foundand then think of some way of rescuing tom oh dear it seems quite impossible said jill feeling very worried mary began to cry dont cry mary said andy putting his arm round her we have to be brave now we are british children and so we have plenty of courage and heaps of ideas we must all think hard and see what we can do to trick the enemy but andy how can we hide on this bare island said mary drying her eyes and blinking away her tears they will beat all through the bracken and heather there are no good trees to hide in not a single cave really there isnt anywhere at all youre right mary said andy its going to be very difficult but we must think of something you see if only we can hide and not be found we can somehow think of a way to rescue tombut if we are found we cant help tom and wont be able to escape and tell our secret yesits very very important said jill thoughtfully lets think of ways of hiding the bracken is no use at all is ft not a bit of use said andy i did think we might perhaps wade out to the ship and hide down in the cabinbut i know they would look there could we hide in the shack asked mary pile the heather over ourselves or something no said andy the shacks no use we should be discovered there at once and theres no place in any of the other old ruined buildings i wish we knew of a cave or something like that its a good thing weve got plenty of food hidden in the sand said jill if we can manage to hide ourselves away we need not starve weve only got to go and dig up that store of food yesthats very lucky said andy i say listen thats the sound of a motorboat isnt it andy crept out to see keeping well under cover yesthere was a motorboat coming round the corner of the islanda motorboat with five men in it theyre coming whispered andy theyre in a motorboat quickwhere shall we hide wed better rush over to the opposite side of the island said jim her face pale the first place theyll hunt is this side where they landxjuick mary the three children slipped out of the shack and made their way up the rocky path they were just out of sight when the motorboat landed on the beach they would be able to reach the other side of the island unseenbut what could they do there the shore there was nothing but rocks and sandthey would be found in two minutes chapter the island is searched andy and the girls did not take long to reach the opposite shore of the island they slid down the steep cliff there and reached the beach it was sandy but at one side was a mass of seaweedcovered rocks it was impossible to hide behind them for a moments search would at once discover them they looked at one another in despair any good wading out to sea and keeping under water asked jill no said andy wed have to keep popping our heads up to breathe and wed be seen at once jill stared at the rocks nearby and then she gave such a squeal that andy and mary jumped in fright sh said andy angrily youll be heard whatevers the matter ive thought of how to hide said jill breathlessly its the same idea i had for hiding that boat cant we cover ourselves with sand and then drape ourselves with seaweed to look like rocks we could go and lie down beside those rocks and if we were well covered with weeds wed look exactly like them golly that is an idea said andy at once quick ill cover you girls with sand at once come over here the three ran to the rocks the tide was out and the sand was hard but damp andy made the girls lie down together and then he piled sand high over them leaving a space over their noses for breathing he only had his hands to do this so it was hard work then he dragged great handfuls of seaweed from the rocks and threw it over the sandy mound when he had finished the girls looked exactly like the seaweedcovered rocks nearby it was really marvellous andy covered with loose seaweed the untidy places he had made in the sand then he began to make a hole for himself and to cover himself too he draped himself with piles of seaweed and then poked up his head to look at the girls he really didnt know which of the rocks they were he simply couldnt tell he looked and lookedbut not until one of the rocks moved a little did he see that it was the girls i jill mary he called in a low voice as soon as you hear me screaming like a gull you must lie absolutely still you look marvellous i didnt know which rock you were till one of you moved andy im afraid one of the men might tread on me said mary in a frightened voice well let him said andy i dont advise you to call out and ask him not to walk on you there was a little giggle from the nearby rock although the girls were frightened they could still see a joke they all lay quietly for a time and then andy heard voices coming near he cried like a seagull and the girls then lay so still that not even the tiniest bit of seaweed above them moved at all the men slid down to the sandy shore calling to one another in loud voices andy could not understand anything they said all the childrens hearts beat loudly and jill wondered if hers could possibly be heard it seemed to her to be thumping as loudly as a hammer the men stood on the beach and looked round one shouted something to the others and began to walk over to the rocks andy felt most alarmed i do hope we look like real rocks he thought and i hope jiobody treads on uswe should be found at once if that happenedto say nothing of being hurt the man came nearer he stood near andy and took out a packet of cigarettes andy heard him strike a match and knew that he had lighted a cigarette the man threw the empty cigarette packet on to the sand and puffed at his cigarette a young gull seeing the man throw the packet away thought that it might be a piece of bread it flew down to see crying eeoo eeoo eeoo very loudly the other gulls heard it and soared round in circles wondering if there was any food to find the young gull landed on the sand and stood looking at the packet hardly daring to go nearer to peck it for it was too close to the man the other gulls flew downand two stood on andy and one stood on the girls the children looked so exactly like rocks that the gulls really thought they were one gull thought the rock felt unusually soft and warm and he bent down his head and pecked at it he pecked andys knee and the boy nearly gave a yell the men joined the one who was smoking a cigarette they did not even bother to walk over the rocks one man said that it was plain there could be nobody hiding there for the gulls would not stand about as they were doing if there was anyone hiding they would know it and be suspicious for some time the men stood talking and smoking then they turned to go up the cliff again one walked so near andy that the boy could feel the thud of his footfall close by up the cliff climbed the men and disappeared over the top andy cautiously lifted his head after a while and looked around there was no one to be seen the boy felt that it would be safer if they all stayed where they were for some time longerbut he felt cold and damp and he was afraid that the girls would catch a dreadful chill mary jill he called in a low voice i flunk the men are gone but we must still be careful slowly and carefully take off the weed and shake yourselves free of the sand be ready to lie still at once if i say so but there was no need to say sothe men did not come back to the beach the three children shook off the damp sand threw the seaweed over the places where they had been lying and ran quickly to the shelter of the cliff where no one could see them if they looked over the gulls flew off in the greatest surprise and alarm they could not understand rocks turning into children so suddenly the young gull made up its mind that it would never land on a rock againjust suppose it changed into a person golly said andy as they stood shivering under the cliff that was a narrow escape one man very nearly trod on my hand under the sand what have you done to your knee andy asked jill pointing to where andys knee was bleeding a gull pecked me there said andy mopping his knee its nothing much i say wasnt it funny when the gulls thought we were rocks and came and stood on us they were a great help one gull stood nearly on my face said jill i didnt like it very much i do feel cold said mary shivering and shaking it was horrid to be covered with damp sand for so long she sneezed andy looked at her anxiously it would never do for any of them to be ill just now he made up his mind quickly the men may be off the island now he said ill go and see if they are wellall tear across to the hut light the stove inside and dry ourselves wellmake some hot cocoa and get really warm the girls thought that was a splendid idea andy set off up the cliff stay here till you hear my seagull cry he said then come as quickly as you can he came to the top of the cliff then keeping to the thick bracken he made his way to the other side of the island looking out for any signs of the men he went right across the island and came to the hollow where the old buildings wereand he saw the motorboat putting off from the shore the men had given up the hunt and were going back to the third island they had already searched the second one and had found nobody but tom andy tore back to the girls he screeched like a gull the girls at once climbed the cliff and ran across the island feeling a little wanner as they ran andy was in the shack and the stove was lighted it gave out a welcome heat take off your damp things and wrap yourself in the rugs said andy who was already walking about in a rug himself and looked like a red indian im making some cocoa in ten minutes time all the children felt warm and lively the stove dried their things and the hot cocoa wanned them well nobody sneezed again and andy began to hope that their long stay under the damp sand wouldnt give anyone a chill after all andy what are you going to do now asked jill sipping her cocoa weve got plenty of food luckily because we buried it all in the sand at the top of the beach out therebut we cant get away because our boats gone and weve lost tom have we got to stay here for the rest of our lives dont be silly jill said andy lets tackle one thing at a time for goodness sake weve done the most important thing so farhidden ourselves so well that we werent foundand now welldo the next most important thingwellrescue tom after that well think how to escapebut one thing at a time please and no worrying about whats going to happen if we get worried wellget frightened and nobody is any use when theyre frightened weve all got plenty of courage and well use it jill and mary cheered up at andys brave words i would like to rescue poor tom said jill he will be so lonely and upset where do you suppose he is in the cave where he left his camera i expect said andy pouring himself out another cup of cocoa and im pretty certain therell be a guard somewhere at the entrance for if there were not tom would soon escapeso we wont run into troublewell see if there isnt tome other way of rescuing tom but how can there be asked jill i dont know yet said andy but i do know thiswe thought it was impossible to bide safely on this bare little islandyet we did it and so though it sounds impossible to rescue tom there maybe a way if we think hard enough so nowlets all think hard chapter an exciting discovery nobody could think how to rescue tom after all if there was someone guarding the caveentrance how could andy possibly get in without being seen the boy gave it up after a time and for a change he set the gramophone going there was only one record that was not broken and that was the one with the lullaby on one side and the nursery rhymes on the other the girls listened rather bored for they had heard that record scores of times since they had come to the island turn it off andy said jill if i hear that voice crooning that lullaby any more i shall go to sleep andy switched off the gramophone and went to the doorway of the shack he was not afraid of the men coming back again for he was sure they thought there was no one on this island at any rate a thought came into andys bead he went back to the girls i think it would be a good thing if i crossed to the second island tonight when its dark he said i might be able to get into touch with tom somehow and hear what has happened even if i cant rescue him oh andywe shall be left all alone said mary in dismay we dont mind that if andy can help tom said jill well stay here in the hut andy and try to sleep whilst you go but do be careful wont you ill be careful said andy i dont want to be made a prisoner toobut you neednt be afraid of that no enemy can catch me so that night when he had only the starlight to guide him for the moon was not up andy crossed the line of rocks to the second island he went very cautiously for he did not want a single sound to come to the ears of anyone on the cavebeach he waded through the shallow water to the sand at the nearer end of the beach he stood there listeningand not very far off close against the cliff where the caveentrance was he heard a cough oho said andy to himself thanks for that cough dear sentry i now know exactly where you are you are behind the big rock at the cave opening well i shall not go near you the boy stood quite still for a while listening the sentry most obligingly cleared his throat and coughed again very loudly andy grinned he made his way carefully round the end of the cliff and then began to climb up feeling his way cautiously the cliff there was not very steep and andy was soon at the top he had not made a single sound he found a little hollow where heather and gorse grew thickly he crept under an overhanging piece ot bush piled the heather beneath him and slept peacefully he knew he could do nothing till morning came and he could see where he was the sun rose and andy awoke he was stiff and he stretched himself and yawned he was hungry but there was nothing for him to eat but bilberries he wriggled carefully to the edge of the cliff and looked over almost below him was the sentry he had heard last night behind a rock at the caveentrance as andy looked down he saw a boat coming to the shore and a man stepped off and walked up the beach to change places with the sentry they stood talking for a while and then the first sentry went to the boat yawning and the new one settled down to his task of waiting and watching andy sat and thought he wriggled back to a place where he imagined he must be exactly over the round cave he wondered if tom could hear him if he drummed on the ground with his feet after all the boy could not be very far below for the round cave was fairly high up in the cliff and then a most extraordinary thing happenedso startling that andys heart jumped almost out of his body a groan came from somewhere under his legs andy was lying on the heather and when the groan came he shot his legs up beneath him and stared at the place where the groan had come from as if he simply couldnt believe his eyes or ears a smaller groan sounded more like a long yawn andy stared at the heather and wondered if his ears could be right heather couldnt yawn or groan then what was it very cautiously and gently the boy turned himself about and began to feel in the heather he pulled it to one side and to his enormous astonishment he found a hole below the roots of the heathera hole that must lead down to the round cave for andy reckoned that he must be exactly over that cave andy felt so excited that he began to tremble no wonder that cave didnt smell as musty and stuffy as we expected it to he thought there is an airhole leading right down to it gollyl i wonder if theres any chance of rescuing tom this way he pulled up the heather and examined the hole the earth was dry and sandy andy scraped away hard and found that it was quite easy to make it bigger just suppose he could make it big enough to get downor for tom to get up i knew thered be a way if we didnt give up hope thought the excited boy i just knew it he crawled to the top of the cliff and looked over it the sentry was there still and he was busy eating his breakfast he was all right for some time andy crawled back to the hole he scraped about a little more and then lay down with his face in the hole it seemed to go down and down into the darkness andy spoke in a low voice tom are you there and was tom there yes he was he had been in the round cave alone and lonely ever since he had been caught it had seemed ages to him the boy had worried dreadfully about the others he had eaten a little of the food around him but he had no appetite now he was miserable and frightened though he would not show this to any of the sentries who occasionally came up the rocky passageway to see if he was all right the man who could speak english had come to see him the evening before we have searched the first island and this one he had told tom we have found your shackand we have found your friends too toms heart sank when he heard this the man was really telling an untruth hoping to trap tom into saying something that would show him there were others to be found but tom said nothing i tell you we have found your friends said the man they fought hard but they have been captured tom stared at the man in surprise he knew quite well that the girls would not fight men what did mis man mean could he be telling an untruth then tom suddenly knew that the man was hoping to trap him into saying something about the others this mail did not know that the others were only two girls and a boy he did not even know for certain that there were any others well two can play at a game of pretend like that thought the boy so he put on a face of great surprise and said golly are there others on these islands then i wish id known i could have asked them for help the man looked surprised so perhaps this boy had no friends then could it be that he was really alone the man did not know what to think he said no more but turned and went out of the cave tom couldnt help feeling pleased the man had thought he might trap himbut he felt sure he had tricked the man it was very lonely in the round cave tom slept heavily all the night through but found the day very very dull he sat on a box and groaned deeply then he yawned loudly he was bored he was lonely he sat there doing nothing and then he heard a very peculiar noise above his heada kind of scraping noise tom wondered what it could be perhaps its a rabbit or something he thought but noit couldnt be the roof of the cave is of rock the scraping noise went onand then something happened that made tom leap up in fright a strange hollow voice came into the cave from somewhere it ran all round the cave and tom could just make out the words the funny deep voice said tom are you there it was really andys voice of course coming down the hole to the caveand the hote had made it sound deep and strange not a bit like andys tom trembled and said nothing he couldnt understand this queer voice suddenly coming into the cave so andy spoke again tom its andy speaking are you there the voice rumbled round the cavebut this time tom was not so scared could it really be andy somehow managing to speak to him hesnswered as loudly as he dared im here in the round cave toms voice came up to andy all muddled and jumbled for tom was not near the opening of the hole andy could not make out what he said but he knew it was tom speaking good he thought toms in there all right ill speak to him again and see if i can find out whats happened to him so once more andys voice came rumbling down into the cave tom im speaking down a hole that must somehow lead into your cave see if you can find it and speak up it i cant hear you properly but whatever you do dont let anyone hear you speaking to me tom felt excited good old andy he got upland began to hunt around for the hole that led upwards to andy he must find it he simply must chapter a marvellous escape tom picked up the lamp and hunted around the cave as he was doing this he heard the steps of the sentry coming up the rocky passage to the round cave at once tom sat down and began to sing loudly the lullaby that was on the unbroken gramophone record hush hush hush you mustnt say a word its time for hushaby my little sleepy bird these were the words of the rather silly lullaby song on the record but they did very well indeed for a warning to andy not to say anything for a moment the sentry heard the boy singing peeped in at him said something that tom didnt in the least understand and went out again he seemed surprised that the boy should sing tom went on singing the lullaby for a long time till he felt quite sure the sentry was not coming back then he stopped singing and hurriedly began to hunt for the hole again it didnt seem to be anywhere i the roof of the cave was not very high and by standing on boxes and tins tom could examine nearly every inch of it but he could not find a hole that led upwards andys voice came booming down again tom have you found the hole the voice was so near toms ear that the boy nearly fell off the box he was standing on he held up the lamp to the place where the voice came from it was at the point where roof and wall met at the back the roof was of rockbut the wall just there was only of sand tom put his hand up and felt a cold draught blowing down the hole andy ive found the hole he said putting his head to it i saytell me whats happened in low voices the two boys told one another all that had happened tom was very excited when he heard how the others had pretended to be seaweedcovered rocks i wondered how yon would hide he said i couldnt trunk what you would do oh andy im glad youre safe well tom the next thing to do is to rescue you said andy im wondering if we can use this hole whats it like at your end rather small said tom i couldnt get up ft unless i could make it larger whats it like at your end i can easily make it as large as i like by scraping at it said andy can you make your end large too do you think tom scraped at it with his hands he could easily scrape the wall away but not the roof i might perhaps be able to he said but id want something to do it withive nothing but my hands ive nothing but my hands either said andy and they are bleeding already from scraping at the soil listen tomi shall go back to the girls soon when the rocks are uncovered but i cant wait till night i musf go now whilst the tide is low so i want you to call to the sentry and pretend that you want his help in undoing a tin of food or something see then whilst he is in the cave with you ill creep over the rocks safely without being seen and get back all right said tom what will you do then ill collect something for us to work at the soil with said andy and ill bring it back tonight then maybe we can make the hole large enough for you to crawl up i dont think its more than about six feet long now wait to hear my seagull call tomthen yell for the sentry and ill make a dash for the rocks as soon as i see him go into the cave everything worked well when tom heard andys seagull cry he shouted for the sentry and the man went into the cave to see what was the matter he found that tom had got a large tin of tongue and seemed to have lost the tinopener the sentry hadnt one either and he spent a very long time trying to open the tin with his pocketknife he ended in cutting his thumb very badly and tom produced a handkerchief and spent a long time binding up the mans thumb glad to keep him in the cave so long andy had plenty of time to escape back over the rocks he knew them well now and leapt from rock to rock easily he was back in the shack in no time it seemed the girls were thrilled to see him and he had to sit and tell them all he had done at least four or five times when they heard about the hole leading down to the round cave the girls were tremendously excited so you see finished andy i plan to get tom out that way tonightand i must take back with me something to dig and scrape with heres an old bit of wood with some jolly big nails in it all sticking out said jill would that do yesthats fine said andy is there a bit for tom they found an old bit that would do and then andy said such a funny thing ill take the gramophone too and the one record the girls stared at him the gramophone said jill at last whatever for are you mad it does sound rather mad i know said andy but i want it for something ill tell you afterwards it wont sound quite so mad then andy had a very good meal for he was awfully hungry then he settled down to sleep for as he said he would not have much of a night that night the next night after midnight the boy went over the rocks again carrying the pieces of rough wood with nails in and the gramophone slung carefully over his shoulder he reached the shore safely and made his way cautiously up the cliff and very soon tom half asleep heard the queer hollow voice rumbling round his cave once more tom are you asteep tom climbed on the chest and put his head to the hole hallo andy he said im not asleep ive been waiting and waiting for you theres a bit of wood with nails in coming down the hole said andy scrape at your end with it and try your best to make the hole larger ive got one too ill scrape my end look out that you dont get your eyes full of bits falling down the two boys set to work both of them scraped and dug for all they were worth the soil was very dry and sandy and was easy to move heaps of it fell down to toms end and he had to dodge it every now and again at last andys hole was quite big enough to get into he called softly to tom how are you getting on my end is big enough for you to get out ive got a rope i can let down to you if you are ready im nearly ready answered tom scraping hard just a minute or two more and then at last his end was large enough to climb into the boy put another chest on the top of the one he was standing on and knelt upon it his head and shoulders were right in the holehe stood up and almost disappeared in the long narrow funnel wait a minute tom said andy ive got something i want to let down on the rope its the gramophone the what asked tom in astonishment thinking he couldnt have heard aright the gramophone said andy im afraid tom you may make rather a noise climbing down the cliff and the sentry might think you had escapedbut if i set the gramophone going singing that silly lullaby you sang yesterday he will think its you still in the caveand he wont come and see what the matter is so im going to let it down and you must set it right and tie a bit of string to it so that i can pull the switch and set the record going when i think its best to golly said tom you think of everything the gramophone came bumping down the hole on the end of the rope tom put it carefully behind a big chest and set the needle ready on the outside edge of the record he tied a long piece of string to the startingswitch and then tied the other end to the rope that andy had let down with the gramophone pull it up andy he said but carefully please because the strings on the rope and we dont want to break the needle by jerking the string too hard andy drew up the rope untied the string on the end of it and tied it to a heavy stone for safety then he called to tom thats done come along up now tom dont brush against the gramophone string more than you can help heres the rope tie it round your waist and ill help you up the hole by pullingand i say dont forget your camera tom stood up on the highest chest and began to scramble up the hole there were plenty of rough ledges each side where he could put his feet andy hauled strongly on the rope and toms head suddenly appeared through the hole by andys feet good said andy climb out tom climbed out he sniffed the fresh breeze with delight for it had been rather stuffy down in the cave andy undid the rope from round toms waist now you must get down the cliff as best you can without noise he said wait for me at the edge of the rocks wont you ill give you a hand over those because i know them better than you do now tom went to the cliff and began to climb down halfway down he slipped and kicked out quickly to prevent himselffrom falling a whole shower of stones fell down the cliff the sentry halfdozing shouted at once andy knew it was time to pull the string that was tied to the gramophone he jerked it the switch slid to one side and the record began to go round on its disc the needle ran over the record and the lullaby began to sound in the cave hush hush hush the sentry heard it and thought it was tom singing he felt satisfied that his prisoner was still in the cave as the song went on and settled himself down again in a comfortable position it must have been a rabbit that sent stones down the cliff he thought andy slipped down the cliff after tom glad that the sentry had heard the lullaby and had thought it must be tom tom was waiting for him by the line of rocks didnt i make a row he whispered but i couldnt help it its all right i set the record going and the sentry thinks you are busy in the cave singing yourself to sleep said andy with a low chuckle come onweve no time to lose chapter heaveho heaveho over the line of rocks the boys slipped and climbed tom following andy closely for andy now knew the best way very well indeed big waves wetted them but they did not care all they wanted was to get back to the girls safely the sentry wont look in at me tonight im sure said tom as they at last reached the sandy shore of the beach and the one that comes in the morning may not go into the cave to see me at allhe is a surly fellow wellthat gives us a little time to think what to do next said andy though im blessed if i know what will be best to do they made their way to the shack which was in darkness for andy had forbidden the girls to show a light of any sort in case the enemy saw it mary and jill were lying together on their heather bed in the darkness fast asleep mary heard the boys come in and she sat upright in bed at once is that you andy yesand tom tool said andy jill awoke then and the four of them sat on one bed hugging one another for joy now they were all together again it was lovely i was an awful idiot to try and get my camera back said tom i never thought of being caught now our boat is gone and its going to be difficult to know what to do theres only one thing to do said andy and flat is to get our fishingboat off the rocks early tomorrow morning somehowand refloat her ive noticed she seems to have moved a bit and it may be that the tides have loosened her perhaps the two rocks that held her are not holding her quite so fast now anyway its our only chance yeswell try and do that said jill toms escape is sure to be discovered sometime tomorrow and this time such a search will be made mat i know well all be found well lets sleep for an hour or two till dawn said andy we cant do anything at the moment so they all lay down on their beds and slept until andy awakened them two hours later now dawn was in the sky and soon the sun would rise the children slipped across the island and came to the beach where they had first landed after their wreck they looked at their poor fishingboat still jammed between the rocks certainly it had moved a littleit was not leaning so much to one side they stood and looked at it the tide was not very high yet and it was possible to reach the boat without too much difficulty it was not long before all the children had reached their boat and were clambering up the wet and slippery deck seaweed lay across it now thrown there by the waves the boat looked old and miserablenot at all like the smart jittle ship in which they had started out so gaily the boys went down into the little cabin it had water lying at the bottom andy ripped up the planks and examined the boat underneath the floor of the cabin then he came out and let himself down the side of the ship disappearing under the water to feel the bottom of the boat the girls and tom watched him anxiously we must mend the boat somehow said tom its our only chance when andy joined them on the slanting deck he looked very cheerful do you know theres not much wrong he said i do believe i could patch her up fairly quickly the waves have shifted her a bit so that i can get at the damaged partthe part where she struck the rocks and damaged a few planks oh good andy cried the girls and tom slapped the fisherboy on the shoulder for joy how marvellous that they could perhaps make the ship seaworthy again what luck that the waves had shifted her enough to make it possible to examine the damaged part tom had no idea at all how andy meant to patch op the ship but he meant to help with all his might to make up for losing the stolen boat tom and andy went back over the rocks to fetch a rope andy felt sure that if they all tugged at the boat at high tide they could get her off the rocks and float her to the beach where it wouldtiot be difficult to patch her up you see tom shes not jammed very tightly now said andy and i reckon if we wait tin the tide is at its very highest and big waves are trying to lift the boat up we could pull her right off the rocks then well get her into shore somehow and see what we can do if only we can do it all before the enemy come again said tom i wonder if theyve discovered that ive gone dont lets think about that said andy the boys found all the rope they had and wound it firmly round their waists they went back to the shore the girls were still on the ship but the tide was rising high and they would soon have to leave as the sea covered the boat at high tide the children fastened strong double strands of rope to the front of the ship then holding firmly to the rope they clambered over the rocks back to the sandy beach wet through the tide came up higher and higher and the children had to stand up to their waists in the water for the rope would not reach right to the shore look theres an enormous wave coming shouted andy pull on the rope all of you as soon as the wave strikes the ship heaveho they all pulledand every child felt the ship give a little as the wave fined her and the rope pulled her now heres another one yelled andy heaveho they all heaved at the rope with all their might again they felt the ship move a little the two big waves ran up the shore and wetted the children to their chins hang on to the rope girls cried andy if we get many waves kke that you may be swept off your feet but as long as youve got hold of the rope youll be all right the waves were smaller after thatand then the wind began to blow stiffly again and the waves grew bigger an enormous one reared its green jiead far out to sea theres a monster coming shouted tom lookat it it will sweep us off our feet but well pull at the boat first yelled andy who was tremendously excited he really felt that they could get the boat off the rocks nowheaveho heaveho the wave struck the boat and the rope dragged at her at the same moment she shivered and groaned as she tried to escape from the rocks that held her she slipped a few feet forward the giant wave struck the children next and all of them went down under it even andy they floundered in the foaming waves and jill swallowed about a pint of salt water mary was very angry because tom put his foot into her neck but tom didnt mean to the wave struck him so hard that he was flung right off his feet and had to strike out to get himself upright again none of them let go the rope they all held on for dear life as andy had ordered so it was not long before they were standing up again gasping and spluttering salt iti their mouths and noses but all of them determined to heave again as soon as the next big wave came look how the boat has moved yelled andy in the greatest delight shes almost off the rocks golly isnt this exciting the boat had moved a good deal andy was sure that they could pull her in now he waited patiently for the next big wave to comeand my goodness it was a monster the tide was at its height now and the wind blew very strongly a green wave put up its head and the children gave a yell look at that one it will knock us all over again said mary afraid but she didnt let go the rope whether she was knocked over or not she meant to do her bit the wave grew bigger and higher as it came nearer to the rocks on which the boat lay it began to curl over a littleand then it struck the rocks and the boat too heaveho yelled andy in a voice as enormous as the wave and they all heaved my goodness what a heave that was the great wave blotted the boat from their sight and came raging towards them jill gave a shout of fear hold on shouted andy halfafraid himself the wave swept them all off their feetand alas swept them all from the rope too except andy who held on with all his might the other three children were taken like corks rolled over and over and flung roughly on the sand at the edge of the sea then the great wave ran back down the beach gurgling and foaming jill sat up crying mary lay still quite stunned for the moment tom sat up furiously angry with the wave it had bumped and battered him most spitefully he thought as for andy he was under water still clinging to the ropebut as soon as he struggled to his feet he gave a gurgling shout and tried to clear his throat of the salt water there the ship look shes off and floating they all lookedand there was the little fishingboat safely off the rocks bobbing about on the sea that swirled high over the other rocks come in and help me quick before any other big waves ceme yelled andy we can get her into shore now quick tom the three battered children dripping wet ran bravely into the sea again they caught hold of the rope and pulled hard heaveho heavebo heaveho chanted andy as they all pulled hard and the boat came bobbing in to the shore the children dragged the rope up the beach and the boat followed scraping its bottom at last on the sand weve got her shouted andy doing a kind of wardance on his tired legs weve got her now well just see what we can do chapter a shock for the children the four children were so excited at getting their boat off the rocks that at first they could do nothing but laugh and chatter and clap their hands they were all lited out with their long struggle in the sea but so joappy that they forgot all about their aching arms and legs salty mouths and dripping clothes the boat lay on her side in the shallow water andy examined her carefully he was sure that if he could nail planks inside just where she had been stovein by the rocks he could patch her up well enough for her to sail home she will let water in but you two girls can bail her out all the time said andy ill patch her up enough to get her sailing safely golly i never thought we could do this the children had been so busy that no one not even tom had thought of any breakfast but andy suddenly felt very hungry and sent the girls off to fetch breakfast of some sort and bring a jug of hot cocoa too he said we are all wet through and it would be nice to have something to warm us tom fetched the tools from the shack and the box of nails and screws and bolts andy meant to be very busy indeed somehow or other that boat had to be finished before toms escape was known after a burned breakfast they all set to work under andys orders andy stripped some of the wood from the roof of the cabin to use in the patching of the ship the girls took out the old nails from the strips tom waited on andy and handed him everything he wanted the sound of the hammer echoed over the island do you think the enemy will hear asked jill anxiously cant help it if they do said andy we cant hammer without noise pass me the biggest nails youve got tom they all worked steadily for the whole of the morning and at last andy heaved a sigh of relief welli think thats patched up she wont last long without being bailed out because i cant patch her really properlybut the girls can easily bail out whilst you and i sail the boat tom is she ready asked the girls eagerly as ready as i can make her said andy now you girls must go and get all the rugs and tom and i will get the food from where we buried it under the sand at the top of our own beach by the shack well pile in everything we can push her out into the water arid sail off golly i never thought wed be able to do thisl the four of them set off to fetch everything they felt cheerful and excited it might take them ages to get homebut at last they were going to leave these strange unknown islands safely and take their secret with them the girls gathered up the rugs the boys tied the tins and boxes together and staggered over the island with their heavy load back to the boat again it was difficult climbing down the cliff so heavilyladen but they managed it safely the girls threw down the rugs on the deck and the boys packed the food into the cabin now they could go wait a bitwell take the old sail with us said andy i could rig it again and it would help us he set off to get the sailand then he suddenly stopped and looked down pn the beach there by his foot lay something that greatly astonished him what is it andy called tom seeing andyspuzzled face look at this said andy picking up a dry clean match that had already been struck what about it its only a match said tom its a match that hasnt very long been struck said andy and it is lying on sand that has been covered and uncovered by the tide since weve been working on the boat this morning wellhas any of us struck a match and thrown it down nowe havent then who has oh andysurely you are mistaken said jill looking ready to cry nobody else has been here we should have seen them im wondering if anyone has been here whilst we were fetching the rugs and the food said andy looking all round i dont like itand oh gollylook at that set of footprints in the sand over there they are not our footprints the four children gazed at the set of large footprints whoever made them had been wearing nailed bootsand the children all wore rubber shoes the girls were frightened yessomeone had been on the beach whilst they had left it to get rugs and food but who and where was he welllets get the boat launched and hope to get away before were stopped said andy come onwell do without the sail they ran to the boat and took hold of the rope to drag it down to the seabut even as they took hold of it a loud voice shouted to them from round the corner of the cliff stop halt the children stopped hauling the boat and stared round they saw the enemyfour of them one of them was the man who spoke english and it was he who was shouting the children stared in fright at the four men who came quickly over the beach they spoke to one another in a foreign language then the first man spoke again so there are four of youand all children this is the boy who escaped ah you thought you were very clever didnt you i did rather said tom boldly he felt frightenedbut he wasnt going to show it nohe was and these men shouldnt think they could sc you took your boat off the rocks and thought you would escape safely didnt you said the man mockingly well you made a mistake we shall now take the boat awayand you shall remain prisoners on this island for as long as we want you to take out the food and the blankets again you will need those if you live here for months the children sulkily took out all the food and rugs they had so cheerfully put into the boat tom was glad to see that neither jill nor mary cried good that would show the enemy how brave british children could be now we are going said the man who spoke english he gave a rapid order to the other men who ran off round the cliff and then reappeared in a small boat bobbing on the waves it was plain that they had landed round the cliff watched the children and then come to catch them andy and the others had to watch the men drag their ship down to the sea and launch it they had tied their little rowingboat behind it and now waving mockingly to the children they made their way over the water round the cliff and out of sight rowing andys boat along swiftly the children watched them go anger and despair in their hearts all their work for nothing how they had battled with the sea that morninghow they had slaved to get that boat right and now they had all been discovered their boat had been taken and they were real prisoners andy shook his fist at the disappearing ship with the small boat bobbing behind it you think you can beat a scots boy but you cant he cried ill beat you yet you and your submarines wearily the children gathered up the old rugs and all the food and made their way up the cliff across the island and back to their shack they packed the food on the floor in a corner and threw the rugs on the beds then they sat on the beds and looked at one another not till then did the girls begin to cry but cry they did letting the tears run down their cheeks without trying to wipe them off they were so tired and so disappointed tears came into toms eyes too when he saw the two miserable girls but he blinked them back after one look at andys lean brown face andys blue eyes were like stones and his mouth was stern and straight andy was not thinking of crying or grumbling andy was angry and fierce and he sat in silence looking straight before him thinking hard andywhat are you thinking about asked tom at last you look so stern youre not angry with us are you no said andy we all did our bestand weve got to do our best again i tell you tom weve got to leave this island somehow weve got to get away and tell our secret no matter what happens to any of us we must try to get home and tell all we have seen as long as the enemy remain hidden in these islands able to come here whenever they need food or fuel then just so long will our ships be sunk round about these seas oh andyits all very well to say things like thatbut how con we get away now our boats gone said jill wiping her eyes ill think of a way said andy somehow ill think of a way im going out by myself now to puzzle a way out of this fix dont come with me i want to be alone the boy slipped out of the shack he climbed the cliff and sat in the heather by himself his blue eyes fixed on the skyline how could he get home how could he tell his secret for two hours he sat there puzzling and worried so still that the gulls circled round his head and wondered if he were asleep and then andy straightened himself and got up he went down to the others his eyes shining and his head up ive thought of a way he said proudly ive thought of a way at last chapter andy makes a plan tom mary and jill looked at andy excited do you really know a way of escape even now that our ship has been taken asked jill you are clever andy well its no use us trying to take one of the enemys boats again or to get our own ship back said andy and its no use putting up a signal to passing ships for two reasonsone is that i am perfectly certain no ship ever passes near these islands or they would have discovered the secret of the submarines before thisand the second reason is that i am jolly sure the enemy wouldnt let us have a signal up anyhow go on said tom feeling sure andy had got a very good idea coming well my idea iswed better make a raft said andy we cant get a boat or make onebut we could make a rough kind of raft and get a mast of some sort to rig a sail on weve plenty of food to take with usand you and i tom could set off alone on it to try and jnake for home i darent take the girlsthey would be so cold on an open raft and they would be safer here not take us cried jill indignantly of course youll take us we wont be left behindwill we mary listen jillyoure only ten years old and not very big said andy patiently if we take you it will make tilings much more difficult for tom and for me if we get home safely we can have you rescued at onceif we dont get home you will at least be safe on the island the girls cried bitterly at this they thought it was very unfair they couldnhknow that andy didnt feel at all certain of ever getting home and was very much afraid of the girls being washed overboard when big waves came he and tom were strongand besides they were boysbut the girls would never be able to stand tossing about on a raft for days and days andy was quite firm about it and the girls dried their eyes and listened to his plans tom wondered what the raft was to be made of we shall have to pull our wooden hut to pieces and use the planks said andy luckily weve got plenty of nails to use but what shall we live in if we pull down the shack asked jill in dismay ive thought of that said andy you see if we start pulling down the shack the enemy are bound to notice it and will guess what we are doing welli thought we could make it look as if our hut had fallen down on us and i could ask the enemy to give us a tent to live iivinstead then we could live in that and quietly make our raft from the fallendown shack that really is a good idea said tom we get the two things we wantsomewhere else to liveand wood to make a raftand the enemy actually help us without knowing it yes said andy grinning round at the other three wed better wait a day or two though because the enemy are bound to watch us a bit at first to see if weve any other ideas of escape we wont do anything suspicious at all for the next few days all right said the others and they began to fee excited again they still felt terribly disappointed when they thought of how their precious boat had been taken from thembut never mind perhaps their raft would be luckier so for the next few days the children just played about bathing fishing paddling and the enemy who sent a man over every day at noon saw nothing to make him think that the children had any plans at all i think theres going to be a storm said andy on the third evening that would be a good reason for our shack to fall down i think as soon as that man has come and gone today well turn the shack into a ruin the man came looked round the island and went as soon as he had gone the children set about the hut andy removed nails and took out planks he hammered part of the roof away and made a big hole he made one side of the hut so weak that it fell in on top of the girls bed doesnt it look a ruin now said jill with a giggle wed better spread the sail over that side of the hut andy or the rain will come in tonight yes well do that said andy so when they had done all they could to make the hut look as if it was falling to pieces they draped the sail over the open side for protection and then grinned at one another and tomorrow we will act a nice little play for the enemy said andy with a chuckle we will pretend that in the stormwhich we can now hear rumbling round our hut was blown inand we will bandage up jills head as if the hut fell on top of herand bandage my leg too and well beg for a tent most humbly i hope i shant giggle said mary if you do youll deserve a good slapping began andy fiercelybut mary spoke hastily once more i didnt mean it andy i shant giggle i shall be frightened really though i wont show it all right said andy calming down golly what a loud clap of thunder the storm began properly then it was not a very bad one but the children were glad of the protection of the big sail over the open side of the hut the wind blew fiercely and andy and tom had to weight the sail down to prevent it from being blown away the thunder rumbled and crashed and the lightning flickered round the islands in an hours time however the storm was gone and the wind died down again in the morning the children took the sail and hid it safely for andy did not want the enemy to know he had an old sail they made the shack look as if the wind had almost blown it down and jill broke a plate and threw the pieces about as if the storm had caused the accident now ill tie up jills head in my big handkerchief said andy taking out a rather dirty hanky and ill use a rag to tie my leg up with well pretend we got hurt in the night when the man came to look at the children and go over the island as usual he was surprised to find jill bandaged up and andy limping andy hailed him hie our shack has fallen down come and see the man went to look he could not speak english but he understood at once that the shack had fallen down on the children during the storm jill sat on the ground pretending to cry holding her head in her hand mary was trying to comfort her we want a tent to sleep in said andy the man did not understand tom took out his notebook and drew a tent in it then the man understood he nodded his head said something that sounded like yah yah to the children and set off in his boat dont cry too much jill or the man will want to see your wound said andy i was awfully afraid he would take off the bandage and have a look to see how much your head was hurt gracious said jill in alarm i didnt think of that i hope he comes back with a tent said tom youd better go up the cliff jill and sit on the top so that if the man comes back he wont ask to see your head jill and mary went off tom and andy waited for the man to return he came back in about three hoursand he brought a tent the boys were pleased the man looked round for the girls he touched his head and looked at andy he was trying to say he wanted to see the girl with the bandaged head andy nodded and pointed to the top of the cliff shes ail right now he said the man saw the girls sitting up on the cliff and seemed satisfied he put the tent down on the beach showed andy the ropes and pegs with it and went off again in his boat good said andy well put this tent up in a sheltered place in the next cove we dont want tke man visiting this hollow too often or he may notice that the shack is gradually disappearing they put up the tent in the next cove just around the cliff in as sheltered a place as possible at the end of the beach where heather grew thickly and big cushions of thrift were soft and plentiful they maae themselves beds of heather and bracken and piled the rugs there the man came again next day and andy showed him where they had put the tent andy limped about with the rag still on his leg which made the others want to smilebut the man did not once guess that it was all pretence as soon as he had gone andy walked and ran just as usual the weather was not so good now the sun was not so warm and clouds sailed over the sky bringing showers of rain at times the children often had to sit in the tent and they longed to begin making the raft i dont want to start it till im sure the man has forgotten about the tumbledown shack said andy yesterday he brought his boat in to this beach instead of the next one and hardly looked over the island at all if he comes to this cove today we can begin the raft this afternoon the man came at noon as usual this time he dtougnt a large supply of food and tried to make the children understand that he would not be back for a few days he pointed to three fingers and shook his head i think he means he wont be back for three days said andy his heart jumping for joy he nodded to the man who instead of looking over the island as he usually did got straight back into his boat and rowed off well if that isnt a bit of tack said andy joyfully as soon as he had gone im sure he wont be back for some daysand hes brought us a marvellous supply of food that will just do beautifully for the raft i we can safely begin building it this afternoon chapter the building of the raft the four children tackled the shack that afternoon and tore out as many planks as they could pile them up in different sizes ordered andy come and help with this long plank tomits too heavy for me to pull out alone by the end of that day the children had sixteen planks of different sizes piled up andy was pleased if we can get as many as that tomorrow well be able to make a really fine raft he said tom you are saving ail those long screws and nails arent you we shall need them soon yestheyre all safe said tom showing andy a tin into which he had put all the screws and nails he had taken oat of the planks do you think wed better hide these planks in case the man does come tomorrow although we feel sure he wont asked jill wellperhaps we had better said andy who was feeling tired and not at all eager to carry heavy planks about so he and tom took the planks one by one and tad mem in thick heather then they went to have a good meal which the girls had been getting ready ive never been so hungry in my life said tom youve said that about a thousand times since weve been on this island said jill wellsee if you can eat that plateful tom took the plate it was full of cold tongue baked potatoes and tinned asparagus tips which the man had brought yesterday there were also sliced pears tinned milk to eat with them and hot cocoa the pears and tinned milk were so delicious that tom wanted a second helping good gracious at the rate you eat youll want about a thousand tins on the raft said mary opening another tin of pears andy i hope you wont forget to take a tinopener when you go it would be so awful to be hungry and have heaps of tinned food round youand not be able to eat any of it because you had forgotten an opener andy grinned i shant forget that he said golly i am tired they were all tired and they fell asleep in the tent almost as soon as they lay down on their heathery beds they awoke late the next day and andy could not make up his mind whether to get on with the raft or not im pretty sure that fellow meant he wouldnt come for a few days andy said but if he did happen to come and found us at work on a raft it would be too disappointing for anything well one of us could go up to the rocky ledge and keep watch all the time couldnt we said jill eagerly we could easily see anyone coming then and give warning in time to let you and tom hide everything yesof course said andy thats a good idea take it in turns of about two hours each you go first jill and mary next so jill went up to the rocky ledge and sat there she could see the cavebeach of the next island and had a good view of any boat that might come over the water no boat was tobe seenbut all that day the islands were very noisy indeed seaplanes flew over many times their engines roaring loudly three came down in the calm water opposite the cavebeach jill watched them carefully stores were taken to the cave as she could plainly see the seaplanes roared away after a timebut all that day others flew over the islands and the children wondered to see so many well theres one thing thats lucky said andy with a grin those seaplanes make such a noise that no one could possibly hear the sound of any hammering todayso i vote we get on with it and make as much noise as we like now theres a chance so the sound of hammering was heard on the childrens island that day as andy and tom nailed twelve big planks crosswise to twelve others below then on top of the two crosswise rows andy nailed yet another row of shorter planks to make the raft really solid and heavy the boys added a kind of rim to the raft to prevent things rolling off too easily andy was clever at carpentry and he knew all the best tricks of making each plank hold the other fast it was a very solidlooking affair that began to take shape by the time that night came andy had found a strong post that would do for a mast but he did not mean to put this up till the raft was almost ready to launch we cant very well hide a raft with a mast he said it is easier to hide a flat raft with no mast if that man pays us a visit too soon how can we hide it though asked tom looking at the heavy raft we really cant toss it lightly into the heather as we could do with planks andy grinned well hide it in a very easy place he said well simply rig up the tent above it and pile heather on the raft which will then make the floor i dont think anyone is likely to think that our tent hides a raft in three days the raft was quite complete and was very sound and solid andy had decided to take all the food in the big wooden box in which the man had brought the tins and jars on his last visit we can nail the box to the floor of the raft said andy and our food will stay there quite safely i if we put it loose on the deck of the raft everything would get thrown off in a rough sea even though weve put a kind of rail to the edge of the raft there came a warning cry from jill not long after that she had seen a boat coming round the cliff on the far side of the cavebeach hastily the boys put up the tent over the raft and mary strewed the heather and bracken over the deck she could not hide the box of food in the middle of the raft however never mind about that said andy put a rug over it and it will look like a seat or something there were two men this time and one of them was the one who spoke english the boat drew up in the cove where the raft was and one man got out it was not the man who had seen the fallendown shack but the one who spoke english andy went down to meet him please sir wont you give us a boat to go home in asked andy knowing perfectly well that the man would say no no said the man at once you will stay here for as long as we wish but soon the winter will come and a tent will be no good to you is mere any building here that can be mended no said andy who did not wish the man to examine the buildings and perhaps ask where the tumbledown shack was this had almost disappeared by now for the children had taken all the planks for their raft let me see your tent said the man andys heart sank it would be too bad if the raft was found just as it was finished he took the man to the tent in silence the man looked inside he saw the box in the middle covered with a rug whats that he asked its the box of food the man brought us the other day said andy and he pulled off the rug the man saw at once that it way only a box of food and he nodded he did not go insidelhe tent luckily or his nailed boot might have gone through the heathery covering and struck against the wooden raft below then he would certainly have pulled aside the heather and seen the childrens secret jill and mary watched very pale and scared tom sat nearby and whistled the man still stood looking into the tent and all the children felt very anxious indeedand then a great seaplane roared over the island making a terrific noise look look yelled tom jumping up isnt it a big one the man looked up at toms yell and followed the seaplane with his eyes i must go he said and he went down the beach to the boat i will send men to put you up a rough hut for the winter be sensible children and you will be looked afterbut if not you will bevery sorry for yourselves the children were very thankful indeed when they saw the boat go off over the water they heaved deep sighs of relief and looked at one another thank goodness that seaplane came when it did and tom let out that yell said jill it just took the mans attention away i really thought he was going to go inside the tent and look at everything well i think were safe to make our escape soon now said andy i dont expect any men will be sent for a while well drag the raft down to the shore early tomorrow morning and ill set up the mast and rig the sail as best i can then tom and i will start off the girls said nothing they did not like being left alone on the islandand yet they knew that andy was right somehow he must get home and tell the people there the secrets they had discovered the raft would not really take fourand the girls were not strong enough to stand days and nights of tossing about on the sea well andy its very important that you should get back and tell the secret of these islands said jill at last so for the sake of our country mary and i will stay behind here without any fuss and do the best we can whilst you and tom set off for home but do rescue us as soon as possible of course we shall said andy glad to see that the girls were going to be brave and not malce any fuss you are good sports you two girlsi really do feel proud of you bothdont you tom very proud said tom and the girls went red with pleasure well wish you luck tomorrow said jill oh how i hope youll soon get back home andy mary and i will watch every day till you come back they all went to bed early that night for tomorrow was to be an important day they did not sleep very well for they were too excited and in the morning early they took down their tent dragged off the heather that covered the raft and tied ropes to it to pull it down to the beach now were off on another adventure said andy dragging the raft heaveho heaveho down to the sea we go chapter away on the sea the raft was dragged right down to the sea in the middle of it andy fixed the post that was to be the mast he rigged up the old sail very cleverly the box of food was firm below the mastthey had enough to last them for some days they took a big tin of water with them too but expected to use the juice of the tins of fruit to quench their thirst after they had drunk all the water andy had made two rough paddles to help the boat along and to guide it the girls handed the boys the two warmest rugs to wrap themselves in at night though andy said they wouldnt be any usethey would get wet with the very first wave that splashed over the raft but to please the girls he took the rugs andy you can dry them in the sun in the daytime said jill and you might be glad of them mary and i have got plenty here the raft was ready to float off at last the boys gave the girls a hug and said goodbye now dont worry said andy jumping on to the raft you wont hear for days and days because weve got to get back home and then tell our tale and then ships have got to find their way here so youll have to wait a long time what shall we say if the enemy want to know where you are asked jill anxiously just say we have disappeared said andy and if you like to do another bit of pretending and make a fusswell doit all right said jill anyway you may be quite sure we shant tell them youve gone off on a raft nowe dont want their seaplanes hunting the sea for us said andy letting the sail unfurl nowgoodbye jill goodbye mary see you soon goodbye andy goodbye tom cried the girls trying to smile cheerfully though they felt very miserable and lonely to see the boys setting off together good luck tom pushed out the raft and jumped up on it he took a paddle and guided it andy let the sail billow out the wind caught it and the little raft leapt along over the waves like a live thing f i say it can get along cant it cried jill jumping up and down in excitement look how it bobs over the waves the boys waved wildly to the girls little waves splashed over the deck of the raft and wetted the boys legs if they ran into a stormy sea they would soon be wet throughbut at the moment they cared nothing for what might happen they were very excited and very anxious to guide their little raft on the right course the sail flapped and billowed finely andy had rigged it most cleverly and the wind shot the little craft along swiftly its going nearly as fast as the ship said tom in delight noit isnt really said andyshaking his head no raft could ever equal a boat for speedits so clumsy and heavy but i must say our raft isnt bad look outtheres a fat wave coming the raft sailed into the waveslap it drenched tom and he laughed and shook himself like a dog the sun was out and the boys clothes soon dried the boys looked back at the shore of their island which now seemed far away they could just make out the two girls who had now climbed to the top of the cliff and were standing there watching the raft out of sight i hope jill and mary will be all right said tom poor kidsit was awful having to leave them alone yes said andy but it was the only thing to be done weve happened on very big things tomand so weve got to be big enough and brave enough to meet them wellim not afraid said tom stoutly and as for you andy i really dont believe anything in the world would frighten you oh yes it would said andy but id not show i was frightened look tomyou can see all the islands now the boys stood on the raft holding on to the mast and looked back on the cluster of islands they lay in the sea together and looked very small now that the boys were so far off they could no longer see the girls and soon even the islands too woukl disappearthen the boys would be quite alone on the wide sea do you really know which way to go andy said tom more or less said andy i can guide the raft by the sun in the daytime and by the stars at night its a good thing for us that the wind is just in the right direction i hope it lasts its easy enough nowbut if the wind changes things will be very difficult now the boys could no longer see any land at all they were alone on the wide green sea below them jhe water was very very deep the sea was not rough but a little choppy and the raft bobbed like a cork over the waves every now and again a wave hopped over the side and wetted the deck of the raft the boys got used to this and didnt even move when a wave reared its head to run across the raft tom dragged his hand in the cool water he liked the movement of the raft running over the sea the sun shone steadily down and the boys became very hot tom took off his jersey and hung it safely over the top of the mast out of reach of the waves golly im cooking he said luckily the boys had got hats with them and these shaded the sun from their heads or they might have felt sick the sun blazed down and at last the boys let themselves drop into the sea holding on to the edge of the raft all the time this cooled them a little and they scrambled back wet and panting it would be an awful thing if one of us let go the raft said tom its going at such a pace that it would soon leave us behind in the sea and wed never be found again well for goodness sake hang on tightly then next time we cool ourselves said andy what about something to eat they opened a tin of salmon and a tin of pears and had a good meal though tom longed for some bread with the salmon it was odd sitting there eating on the bobbing raft all by themselves in the midst of a wide heaving sea the day seemed endlessbut at last the sun slid down the sky and the sea turned from green to purple in the twilight its not so warm now said tom taking his jersey down from the mast tom see if you can have a nap for a while said andy i dont think we ought both to sleep at once the wind might change or a storm might blow upyou sleep now and ill have a nap later tom wrapped himself in a rug and tried to go to sleep andy slipped a rope round his waist and tied him to the box in the middle you might roll off the raft in the middle of the night he said with a grin i shouldnt like to look round and find you gone tom tom lay on his back and looked up at the night sky it was a clear night with no moon and the stars shone brightly andy pointed out the north star to tom that tells me we are still going in the right direction said andy at this rate we should sight the coast were heading for in about three or four days ohas long as that said tom in great disappointment i thought wed only by a day or two going at this pace this is a raft not a sailingsmack said andy now go to sleep ill wake you if i need you for anything tom slept he dreamt he was on a swing going up and down up and down in the air it was very pleasant then he dreamt he was being scolded by lill for something and she suddenly threw a pail of cold water right over him he woke with a jump and sat up did that wave wake you said andy with a grin i thought it would it popped its head up saw you asleep and jumped right on you tom laughed and lay down again he thought about andywhat a good sort he wasalways doing what he felt was best and wisestnever grumblingalways willing to do the hardest job it was a good thing tom and the girls had had andy to help them andy awoke tom near dawn and told him to sit up and keep watch the winds still right he said watch it tom you can see the north star cant you im so sleepy i cant keep awake much longer andy tied himself up safely lay down and was asleep as his head touched the rug that made a pillow for him tom sat and watched the dawn coming it was a wonderful sight first the sky turned to silver and the sea turned to silver too soon a pink flush came into the eastern sky and then it changed to a blaze of gold the sea sparkled and glinted with gold too tom wished he could wake andy up and make him see the magnificent sight there was nothing but sea and sky all glowing with colour bat andy was tired and tom sat and watched it by himself half afraid of the strange beauty aroundjiim after a while tom felt very hungry he burrowed in the box of food to see what there was he felt like a meal of tongue or ham he picked out a tin of tongue and opened it it smelt delicious andy woke up after a while and shared the meat with tom they opened some pineapple and had that too the juice was very pleasant they poured water into the tin and make a kind of pineapple drink to have later on in the day andy sniffed the wind and looked at the sky theres a change coming he said i do hope we shant be blown out of our way we were getting on so well the sea was rougher waves slopped over the deck almost every minute now only by sitting up on the box of food could the boys keep dry from the waist up once or twice the raft heeled over and tom had to clutch the mast to keep from overbalancing blow said tom what does the sea want to get so rough for its a good thing were both good sailors or wed be very ill andy looked anxiously at the sky im afraid the wind is changing he said we shall be blown right out of our way if it does the sea is getting very rough tom i think wed both better tie ourselves firmly to the mast it wont do for either of us to be thrown off the raftand a big wave could easily dash one of us overboard so they tied themselves to the mast and then watched the scurrying clouds wondering if they would suddenly slow downand fly the other way chapter a wonderful surprise alas for tom and andy the wind did change and blew strongly the other way andy took down the sail hurriedly we dont want to be blown back to our island he said we must just bob along without a sail now and hope for the best when the wind changes again well put up the sail once more i wonder if the enemy has found out that weve escaped said tom they might send a seaplane out after us if they found out weve gone theyd know we were on a raft well the girls wouldnt give us away thats certain said andy but the enemy might easily guess wed make a raft if they searched the island for us and missed usand they could send out a seaplane or two to hunt the seas for us were a good way from the island nowbut a seaplane could easily find us i hope one doesnt said tom isnt this wind hateful andy it just wont stop its wasting all our time the wind blew cold the sun was behind the clouds big waves slapped around the raft and seemed really spiteful almost as if they want to snatch us off said tom tightening the rope that tied him safely to the mast he shivered there was no shelter at all on the open raft and no way of getting warm or dry now that the sun was not to be seen do a few arm exercises tom said andy that will get you a bit warmer the boys swung their arms and slapped themselves the waves raced along and the raft raced along toobut not in the right direction tom was sure and then towards afternoon the wind dropped again and the sun shone out what a relief that was the boys sunned themselves gladly and were soon warm andy rigged the sail again well get the wind we want this evening he said well be ready for it sure enough as the sun slid down the western sky the wind got up againand this time it was wowing from the right quarter andy was delighted the sail flapped and the little raft raced along nobly i think the winds set in properly now said andy pleased if only it holds for another couple of days we may be homeor at any rate see a ship we can hail the wind became stiffer as the evening drew on the sun was just about to slip over the skyline when andy sat up straight and looked alarmed can you hear a noise he asked tom plenty said tom the wind and the waves and the sail nonot that sort of noise said andy a noise likea seaplane toms heart almost stopped beating surely their escape hadnt been discovered after all he sat and listened yestheres a seaplane about somewhere said andy blow if its really hunting for us it will be sure to find us just as weve got away so nicely tooand the wind helping us again and all tom went pale and looked up at the sky anxiously both boys could now hear the hum of the engines quite clearly and then the seaplane appeared flying fairly low and quite slowly it was plain that it was hunting the seas for something can we do anything andy said tom we had better jump into the water hold on to the raft and hope maybe the seaplane will think theres noone on it said andy only our heads will show beside the raftthey might not notice them come on quick the boys slid into the water over the side of the raff they hung there with their hands only their heads showing they waited anxiously the great seaplane came zooming overhead very close to the water it had seen the raft and was coming to examine it more closely how the boys hoped that when the raft was seen to be empty the seaplane would fly off the plane flew over the raft it circled round and came back again flying once more over the raft it circled round again and the boys hoped it would now fly off but once more it flew over the raftand then to the boys great dismay it skimmed over the water and landed there not very far off its no good tom were discovered said andy we may as well climb back on to the raft looktheyre letting down a boat the boys climbed back on to the raft angry and disappointed and then tom gave such a tremendous yell that andy nearly fell overboard with fright andy andy look at the sign on the seaplane its british its british andy lookedand sure enough there was the wellknown mark that all british machines wear and then such a change came over the boys instead of sitting there sullen and angry they went completely mad they stood up and danced on that rocking raft i they yelled they waved they stamped and as you can imagine tom lost his balance and fell right into the water andy pulled him in gasping and spluttering oh andy its a british seaplanenot the enemy golly suppose it had flown off and not come down to examine the raft and then tom went mad again and shouted for joy the boat from the seaplane came nearer it had two men in it and they hailed the boys ahoy there where are you from ahoy there yelled back andy ahoy there he was too excited to shout anything else the boat came alongside the raft and the men pulled the two boys into it why its only a couple of boys said one man we reckoned you might be men from a sunk ship or aeroplane how did you get here its a long tale to tell said andy i think id better tell it to the chief if you dont mind all right the commanders in the plane said the first man they rowed off to the seaplane and left the little raft bobbing about on the sea alone tom was quite sorry to see it go he had got fond of it hewas sorry to think of the wasted food too the boat reached the enormous seaplane the boys were pushed up into it and a gravefaced man turned to receive them and then andy got a second shock for tom once more let out a yell that really scared him daddy oh daddy its you the gravefaced man stared at tom as if he couldnt believe his eyes then he took the boy into his arms and gave him such a bearlike hug that tom felt as it his bones would break tom weve been hunting for you ever since we heard you had gone off in that boat and hadnt come back he said where are the girlsquick tell me f theyre safe said tom we left them on the island theyre quite safe oh daddyisnt this too good to be true i daddy this is andy hes been such a brick weld never have escaped if it hadnt been for him what do you meanescaped said toms father in surprise escaped from what weve got a big secret to tell you said tom weve found out something queer you tell him andy well sir said andy we got thrown off up the coast of some desolate islands where nobody lives now the enemy are using them for their submarines and seaplanes there are caves stored with foodand there must be stores of fuel somewhere too what shouted toms father he called his men near and they all listened to andys tale the boy told it well and we were just escaping on the raft we had made when we saw you finished andy we slipped over the side of the raft to hidebut you must have seen us we didnt said toms father but we were puzzled about the empty raft and came down to examine it little did we think you and andy were there this seaplane and two others have been scouring the seas about here looking for the sailingship you went off in we were afraid you might be drifting about in it halfstarving your poor mother has been dreadfully upset oh dear i was afraid she would be said tom but never mind were all safe daddyat least i hope the girls are safe they will be very soon said the boys father in a grim voice we shall rescue themand clean up those submarines and seaplanes in no time how clever of the enemy to have a base just under our nosesbut it wont last long now youve done a marvellous thing tom and andy i hope my father wont be very angry with me for losing his boat said andy though we might perhaps be able to get it back from the enemy now your father wont be angry with you for anything once he sees you are safe and hears the tale you have just told me said toms father settle down nowwere going up back to the island to rescue the girls asked toin eagerly his father shook his head no he said they must wait im afraid till i get this news through ill wireless home that weve got you safe and have got great newsbut thats all this is too important to be told to anyone but the chief himself with a great noise of engines the seaplane skimmed over the water and then rose gracefully in the air she shot away southwards and the boys looked out over the sea which was now far below well what luck to be rescued like this said andy and oh tomwhat a shock the enemy are going to get chapter what happened to the girls the two girls felt very lost and lonely when the boys went off on the raft they climbed the cliff quickly so that they might watch the boys till they were out of sight they waved until the raft was a tiny speck on the sea then they lost sight of it it was gone i do hope tom and andy reach home all right said jill as they made their way down the cliff to the shore again it would be awful if they got lost on the sea dont say things like that said mary lets think of something cheerful lets have something to eat but neither of them really wanted anything they kept thinking of the two brave boys on their little raft i do hope nobody combs to the island today said mary i dont feel as if i shall be able to act very well nobody did come that day the girls were left quite alone they bathed in the sea and dried themselves in the sun then they bathed all over again there really wasnt much else to do they missed the two boys very much and when night came they even felt a little frightened cheer up said jill seeing marys long face we shall be all right cuddled up in the tent together the enemy dont know the boys are gonethats the main thing i should think the boys are pretty safe by nowthere has been a good wind blowing all day and they must have gone a long way already the girls lighted their little stove and put it just at the tentopening when night came they liked to see the small light it gave they boiled a kettle of water on it and sat inside the tent drinking hot cocoa whilst the stars came out in the sky as they were about to curl up and go to sleep they heard the sound of a seaplane droning overhead it came over the island twice and then went away and then about an hour later the girls heard the noise of the motorboat it grounded on the sand of the cove and the girls heard mens voices good gracious said jill sitting up in alarm what are they coming here at this time of night for they will soon see the boys arent here quick mary get up well slip out of the tent and go into the bracken maybe we can pretend weve been roaming over the island and theyll think the boys are somewhere about too the girls left the tent and ran into the heather and bracken in the middle of the small island the men left their boat on the beach and two of them came up to the tent they lifted the flap of the tent and flashed a torch inside there was no one there of course one of the men called out loudly now you children where are you here answered jill she nudged mary you shout too she whispered then ill shout again and theyll think we are all here were here yelled mary valiantly though her heart was beating hard in the bracken shouted jill come along down here commanded the man he was the one who could speak english we shall have to go said jill now dont you give the boys away mary pretend they are about somewhere the girls made their way to the men who flashed a light on them where are the boys demanded the man havent you seen them asked jill they must be about somewhere maybe they are in the tent have you looked yes said the man now look herewhat do you mean by lighting this stove out here are you trying to signal to anyone good gracious of course not said jill we only made some hot cocoa thats all lookthere are our dirty cups she wished she had not said this when the man looked for the cupsfor he saw at once that there were only two he looked at jill suspiciously why did the boys not have the cocoa he asked they werent here when we made it said jill why dont you go and look for them the man turned out the stove and the light flickered and went out now dont you dare to show a light at nights he said if i think you are signalling to anyone you will be very sorry who could we signal to asked jill we dont even know where we are the man took no notice of her he stood and shouted into the night boys come here at once there was no answer of coursethere couldnt be for the boys were miles away on the sea tomorrow i will come to tell those boys that when i call they must answer said the man in an angry voice i am going nowbut tomorrow i come again you will tell the boys they must be here by the tent jill and mary said nothing they could not tell the boysand they wondered what would happen when the men found that they were not on the island the men went off in their boat again what a pity we lighted that stove said jill i suppose that seaplane saw it and reported itand they thought we were signalling to someone how clever they must think us i only wish we could signal to someone neither of the girls could imagine what the men would do when they came to find the boys the next day and saw that they were gone they cuddled up together and tried to go to sleep they awoke early and got themselves some breakfast then they sat waiting for the men there was nothing else to doit was of no use trying to hide they must just pretend that they did not know where the boys were the motorboat did not arrive until midday then two men came up to the tent and the one who could speak english looked at the two girls what about those boys he said why are they not here i dont know said jill trying to speak bravely where are they asked the man angrily i dont know said jill again quite truthfully you dont know you dont know said the man in disgust it is time you did know are they on this island why dont you look and see said jill i am sure you will not believe what i sayso you had better look the men glared at the plucky little girl and then went to hunt over the island they found no one of course and returned looking worried they spoke to one another in a language that the girls could not understand then they went to the ruined buildings and looked around carefully it did not take them long to see that the boys had pulled the old shack to pieces so said the first man the boys tried to make a boat jill and mary shook their heads they were really feeling very much alarmed it is a raft they made then asked the man what you will not tell me you naughty little girls then i shall order out my seaplanes and they will find those bad boys and bring them back again and you will all be made prisoners on another island till we take you far away to our country where you will stay for a long time the girls began to crynot because they were afraid for themselves but because they did not want the seaplanes to hunt for andy and tom the men spoke quickly to one another it was plain that they wanted to get back to the third island and tell their chief what had happened we shall come back for you tomorrow said the first man and maybe by that time we shall have caught the two bad boys they will be punished you may be sure they left in their motorboat leaving two miserable girls behind them oh i do hope they wont catch poor andy and tom wept mary its too bad now they will hunt all over the sea till they find them and theyll catch us tomorrow too and take us all away well they just wont take me away said jill drying her eyes fiercely i shall give them a good old hunt for me i shall go to the second island and make them hunt all over the first one and not find mel that will give them a shock i shall hide in the foodcave so will i said mary dabbing her eyes fiercely too well wait till the tide goes down and then well clamber over the rocks so when the tide was low that day the two girls clambered hurriedly over the line of rocks that led from one island to the next and came to the sandy beach not far off was the entrance to the cave that led up to the round cave nobody has seen us said mary as they ran up to the cave well hide here and make the enemy think weve escaped from the island too perhaps they will be so busy looking for us that they will forget about the boys i dont think theyll forget andy and tom said jill making her way up the passage to the round cave i am sure that seaplanes are out looking for them already i have heard three or four leaving the third island look marythis chest is almost empty lets take out the tins and things that are left and get inside we can shut the lid down on us if we hear anyone coming the girls got the chest ready and then amused themselves by trying to find the funnel opening that led from the cave to the surface of the cliff above but they could not find it i wonder if its night yet said mary for it was impossible to tell in the dark cave the girls had andys torch for no daylight came into the cave at all they crept to the shorecave to see yesit was twilight outside night would soon fall i vote we make a nice soft bed in the sandy floor said jill we can cover ourselves with those empty sacks and in the morning well peep out and see if we can see anything so they made sandy beds and threw the sacks over themselves ihey fell fast asleep and did not wake till morning and then when they went to peep out of the shorecave they had a great surprise coming gracefully down to the smooth water was an enormous seaplane droning like a great bumblebee its coming to get us squealed mary in fright and the two girls scuttled back into the round cave chapter return to the islands if only the girls had stopped to look carefully at that seaplane they would have noticed that it bore the signs of their own country it was the very same seaplane that had rescued tom and andy it had flown to headquarters had made its report and had handed toms camera in as soon as the pictures had been developed and the seaplane and submarine photographs had come out clearly there was great excitement tom and andy had been questioned closely they told their story clearly and well and the men who listened to them were amazed at the adventures the four children had been through well you have stumbled on an astonishing secret said one man who had been listening we are proud of you now we shall be able to spring a real surprise on our enemy and clean up all the submarines and seaplanes that have been worrying our shipping for some time we did not know they had a base so near us no wonder they have been able to do such damage please sir what about my sisters asked tom anxiously will you get them away before you do anything the men laughed heartily of course said one that will be our first job you dont really suppose we should forget those two plucky little girls do you oh nowe shall send your fathers seaplane to rescue memand after thatoho a big surprise will come to those islands the boys grinned may we see the surprise sir asked andy no said the man it will be a bit too noisy he turned to toms father and gave him a few quick orders come along said the boys father you and andy must come with me to the islands so that you may tell me quickly where the girls are we have to get them off before we attack me enemyand id like to do it as quickly as possible before anyone knows weve discovered their secret the boys were thrilled to go off in that wonderful seaplane againto the islands and to rescue the two girls under the very noses of the enemy what fun they all went aboard the great seaplane they rowed out to it in a little boat and climbed up the ladder over the side and into the plane a few quick orders and the great engines were started up rrrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrrrrrr the seaplane skimmed over the water for a little while and then rose from the surface as gracefully as a gull it soared up and round and then flew in a straight line towards the faroff islands the boys were trembling with excitement and joy they had had many adventures but this last one the rescue of the girls was the finest of the lot they looked out over the sea watching for the first sign of the islands they now knew so well as soon as we sight the islands we are going cautiously said toms father we dont want to warn the enemy if we can help it you say there is a good landingplace off the shore of the second island andy well you must guide us there when the islands come in sight and well land on the water then you and tom and a couple of men can get to the first island and take off the girls then off well go again and give the signal for the warships to go andsurprise the enemy warships cried the boys i say what a shock for the enemy its a shock they deserve said toms father grimly we are sending three warships and some aeroplanes to deal with the submarines and seaplanes so you see we want to get the girls off as quickly as possible oh golly wouldnt i like to join the fight groaned andy oh couldnt i sir no said toms father but he smiled at the eager boy and clapped him on the shoulder youre a good lad andy he said and im glad that my three children had your help in their amazing adventures andy went red with pleasure he thought toms father was a fine man dressed in his grand uniform he wondered what his own father would say when he heard all their adventuresand in his secret mind he felt a little uncomfortable because his father would have to hear the news that his fishingboat had been lost the boys kept a watch for the islandsand as soon as they caught sight of them lying flat in the sea they both shouted loudly there they are the islands the islands which is uk one the girls are on asked toms father eagerly tom showed him the first one he said and the next one is where the foodcave is and the third one is where the submarines are i dont know anything about the others further off we didnt explore those well we shall said the boys father in a grim tone now tom we are almost on the coast ot the second island is that the smooth bit of water we can land on just down there yes cried both boys as they saw the flat stretch of water that lay between the reef of rocks and the cavebeach the seaplane circled round and flew down gracefully she skimmed the water a little like a swallow and then came to rest bobbing up and down as she lay there the tide is a bit too deep over the rocks that lead to the first island said tom in disappointment we cant climb over them to rescue the girls yet well take a boat then said his father are those the caves you hid in tom yesthat one just there is the one that leads to the foodcave said tom like to see it daddy you might find something of importance there perhaps yeswe might as well have a look said the boys father so a boat shot off from the seaplane carrying the two boys toms father and two men they landed on the beach and went towards the cave the girls were hiding inside the chest when they heard footsteps coming up the passageway that led from the shorecave to the round cave they lay there trembling wondering when they were going to be discovered tom led his father into the cave look he said do you see all these boxes and chests daddy they are absolutely full of food of all sorts i can tell you it came in handy when we were so hungry at first i kept a list of the things we took thinking that we would pay for them when we discovered the owner but tom stopped a queer noise was coming from a big chest near by he stared in surprise whats that jnoise said toms father at once i dont know said tom listen it was the girls inside the chest of course they had heard toms voice and they were quite mad with joy and excitementbut they couldnt lift up the lid of the chest which they had carefully shut down over themselves it had got so tightly fastened that they could not push it up and the two girls were shouting and banging on the lid to make themselves heard theres something in that chest said tom in a trembling voice is it the enemy playing a trick well soon see said his father in a fierce voice he rapped out an order to the two men with him and they went over to the chest they ripped off the lidand every one stood ready to fight the enemy but it was two small excited and most untidy little girls who rose up from the chest shouting loudly tom andy its us we hid here because we thought you were the enemy their father picked them out of the chest and hugged them they were as surprised as he was they simply couldnt believe their eyes daddy its you however did you get here oh tom andy youve come to rescue us just in time oh what a good thing you came to the cave why are you here asked the boys jill and mary told their tale their words tumbling over one another when their father heard that the enemy guessed that the boys had left on a raft he hustled them all out of the cave very quickly well get back to our plane he said we shall get into a spot of trouble if the enemy see us here if they really think the boys have gone to tell their secret they will be watching for usthough not expecting us quite so soon come along they all rowed off to the seaplane the girls were thrilled to get inside it and even mpre excited when it rose into the air and left the sea far below goodbye little islands said jill watching them get smaller and smaller as the plane left them behind weve had lots of adventures on youbut im very glad to leave you all the same the boys were looking down as the plane flew swiftly along suddenly tom gave a shout warships look steaming below us at top speed are they going to the islands they are said his father there will be quite a lot of noise round about your islands very soon and lookhere are aeroplanes too to help the warships a flight of aeroplanes flew near the seaplane the children felt tremendously excited what a pity they had left before the fun began and now home we go to your mother said the childrens father and to andys father both will be so very glad to have you back again but what will my father say about his lost fishingboat wondered poor andy whatever will he say chapter the end of the adventures the seaplane flew over the water and at last came to the shores of the little fishingvillage where andy lived and the other three children had been staying it glided down to the water and rested there its great wings spread out beside it the little beach was soon crowded with peoplefishermen and their wives children visitorsall shouting and cheering the news had gone round that the fout missing children had been found a boat set off to fetch the children from the plane it was rowed by andys father how andy shouted to see him dad were back again the bearded man in the boat smiled and waved he had been terribly worried about andy and the childrenbut now his heart was glad they were safe the children tumbled into the boat all talking at once andys father patted his boy on the shoulder and smiled at him out of eyes as blue as andys neither of them said very much but their hands pressed one another joyfully toms father came with them he had two days leaveand was going to spend it with his wife and children the people on the beach cheered and shouted the little boat grounded and was pulled up the shore by willing hands every one wanted to shake hands and say how glad they were to see the children back and then the children saw ttieir mother they rushed to her and hugged her like bears shouting and laughing now now give m a look in said their father smiling and the whole family went up the beach together andy went off with his father he had no mother so he thought twice as much of his father what a talking and chattering there was that evening the childrens mother made them all strip off their dirty clothes and have a good bath before they did anything i dont know you when you look so dreadfully dirty she said put on clean clothes for goodness sake soon they were all clean and dressed in other clothes it felt nice to be tidy and fresh again they hung round their mother and tried to tell her all their adventures at once andy was marvellous said tom we could never have done what we did if it hadnt been for him the girls were pretty brave tooi was proud of them and old tom didnt do so badlyexcept that he left his precious camera behind and got us all into a fix said jill he was as brave as could be well im proud of you all said their mother hugging them but oh i was so awf uhy worried when you didnt come back j sent a message to your father and he came in his seaplane and hunted for you for days he wouldnt give up huntingand its a good thing he didnt for he found you just in time i you and andy would never never have got home on that little raft you know tom wouldnt we said tom surprised i thought we really might i dont think andy thought there was much hope said the childrens father but he knew it was your only chanceand he knew besides that it was his duty to tell someone the great secret you had discovered it means a lot to our country to tnow the secret of those desolate little islands there was a dull booming sound as the childrens father finished speaking tom looked at his father is that guns he asked yes it will be the end of those hateful submarines said his father gravely there will be no more of our ships sunk without warning by that nest of submarines i and i rather think that our aeroplanes will drive off any seaplanes round about those islandsthose that are not destroyed will fly to their own country in fear they are no match for our pilots the children were silent as they listened to the guns booming far away again they were all imagining the islands echoing tothe terrific sound of gunfire mary began to cry her father put his arm round her yes mary he said it is something to cry about to think that we have to fight so much evil and wickedness it is righr against wrong and we have to be strong and courageous when we fight such a powerful and evil enemy as ours but dry your eyesyou are on the right side and that is something to be proud of andy came tearing up to tfie cottage i say he yelled do you hear the guns i guess they are waking up the islands what a shock for the enemy andy was your father angry about his fishingboat being lost asked tom who knew how much andy was dreading what his father might say about that he hasnt said a word about it said andy not a word

father unexpectedly i rather think there is a surprise coming for you tomorrow oh what cried all the children and andy stared at toms father in surprise wait and see was the answer so they had to waitand the next day the surprise ai rived andy saw it first he was on the beach mending nets and the other children were helping him andy happened to look upand he saw a fishingboat rounding the corner of the cliff hallo said andy whose boat is that i havent seen it before my word what a smart one look at its red sail the children stood up and watched the little fishingboat drawing in to shore it was a real beauty fresh with new paint and with its red sail billowing out in the breeze it came in to the beach and a man jumped out he saw the children and hailed them hie give a hand here they ran to help whose boat is ibis asked tom ive got to find the owner said the man its for the boy whose name has been given to the boat the children looked at the name on the boat there painted

andy its yours said the boatman i understand that its a little reward from the government of our country for good services wasnt it you who discovered the secret of those islands and lost your own boat in doing so golly said andy and could say no more he stood and stared at the lovely boat in delight and pride it was the finest in the bay it was beautiful all over never never could andy ever have saved enough money to buy a boat like this the other three children were full of joy they had been so sorry for andy when his boat had been lost for they knew that he and his father got their living from fishing and now andy had a much better boatthey couldnt keep back their joy they danced and shouted and clapped andy on the back till the boy almost fell over you must share the boat with

the tide this evening and do a wee bit of fishing together and you must write to the king and his government to thank them for their bonny present its most generous of them andy was not a good writer so tom wrote the letter for him and posted it and then andy his father and the three children all got into the fishingboat that evening to go the first trip together the red sail billowed out against the sky as the evening breeze filled it like a seabird the little boat bobbed gracefully on the waterand then raced away on the tide the andy was away on her first trip now dont get lost on any more adventures shouted the childrens father who had come down to the beach to watch just go fishing nowand bring me back something for breakfast i dont want submarines and seaplanes this time every one laughed the sail flapped happily and the boat sped on like a live thing towards the fishinggrounds she feels a good boat bonny and brave said andys father the andy is like her master then cried tom
