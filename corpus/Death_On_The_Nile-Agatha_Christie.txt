bar a bit different from sir george thats true he had no luck especially with the horses what did she pay for his house about sixty thousand and shes going to spend that much on changes to the place no where did she get all that money from from an american grandfather leopold hartz mr burnaby informed him he left millions to his daughter who married melhuish ridgeway like a hollywood film isnt it they watched the girl leave the post office and drive off money and good looks complained the man at the bar it doesnt seem fair darling i think this place is going to be quite wonderful the hon joanna southwood was sitting in linnet ridgeways bedroom at wode hall its perfect isnt it agreed linnet her face was enthusiastic and alive joannas long clever face and strange eye makeup couldnt compete with linnets natural beauty joanna picked up a beautiful string of pearls i suppose these are real arent they linnet of course most people cant afford real pearls my dear these are amazing what are they worth about fifty thousand arent you afraid of having them stolen no i always wear them and anyway theyre insured let me wear them until dinner time will you darling it would be so exciting linnet laughed of course if youd like to joanna put on the pearls and said i really envy you linnet youve got everything money beauty perfect health youve even got brains whens your twentyfirst birthday next june ill have a big brilliant party in london and then are you going to marry charles windlesham the newspapers are so excited about the possibility his big old house could use your attention just think you could rule both wode hall and charltonbury and he is in love with you i dont really want to marry anyone yet linnet replied a telephone call from jacqueline de bellefort linnets oldest friend interrupted their pleasant conversation jackie linnet shouted i havent heard from you for ages darling i apologize but now i want to see you urgently her friend said can i come down yes please id love to show you wode hall right if my old car isnt in a bad mood ill see you in time for afternoon tea goodbye darling jackie and i were at school together in paris linnet told joanna her father ran off and left the family without a penny darling joanna said if my friends lose their money i stop seeing them immediately they always want to borrow from me so if i lost all my money tomorrow asked linnet darling youd never see me again nobody wants poor unsuccessful friends joanna youre terrible and youre wrong about jacqueline shes very proud and has never asked me for money lets wait and see i suspect she wants something joanna warned her she did sound excited admitted linnet she always does at that moment one of linnets servants entered the room she apologized quietly and left with a dress from linnets cupboard has marie been crying asked joanna poor marie she was planning to marry a man who has a job in egypt she didnt know much about him so i made some enquiries he has a wife already and three children you must make a lot of enemies linnet youre so wonderfully efficient and so good at doing the right thing linnet laughed i havent got an enemy in the world at four oclock jacqueline de bellefort found her friend linnet and lord windlesham in the grand sittingroom at wode hall the gentleman watched the girls greet each other affectionately a pretty child he thought not beautiful but definitely attractive with her dark curly hair and her enormous eyes he politely greeted the girl and then left the two friends alone jacqueline asked excitedly lord windlesham the man the newspapers always say youre going to marry are you im not ready to decide now lets talk about you where have you been why havent you written ive been at work you see i have to have a job but darling why didnt you linnet began ask you for help well thats what im here for not to borrow money but i have a great big important request go on encouraged linnet tell me about it if youre going to marry windlesham perhaps youll understand im engaged to a man called simon doyle hes simple and boyish and charming and completely loveable hes got no money but hes from a good family hes been in a terribly boring office job and now hes lost that linnet i shall die if i cant marry him dont be silly jackie no im not exaggerating we cant live without each other listen i want you to give the job of land agent at wode hall to simon its perfcet for him and if hes no good you can sack him my special linnet my dear friend say youll hire him linnet laughed jackie you really are mad bring this young man to wode hall and well talk about it darling linnet ill bring him tomorrow youll love him in london that evening as jacqueline de bellefort and her young man simon doyle celebrated at chez ma tante the owner of that restaurant welcomed an important guest to most observers this small strangelooking man with a big moustache looked nothing like an important customer but monsieur blondin quickly found a very good table for his special friend monsieur poirot monsieur blondin greeted the new arrival it is wonderful to see you hercule poirot the famous belgian detective smiled remembering a case in which a dead body a waiter monsieur blondin and a very attractive lady had all played a part monsieur blondin lowered his voice are you working on something serious now poirot shook his head i have unfortunately retired it is true however that man invented work to avoid having to think but there is travel this winter i shall visit egypt the climate they say is good egypt an excellent destination monsieur poirot watched the dancers and smiled when he noticed one particular couple a tall handsome man with broad shoulders and a thin darkhaired girl their happiness in the place the time and in each other was obvious the music stopped and the couple returned to a table near monsieur poirot the girl was brighteyed laughing but there was something else in her eyes she cares too much that little one poirot said to himself it is not safe no it is not safe and then a word caught his attention egypt he listened more carefully dont worry simon the girl said linnet wont disappoint us the job sounds perfect and i will work hard for you well wait for three months the girl said happily then everything that is mine will be yours the young man said and egypt for our honeymoon never mind the cost ive always wanted to go there the nile and the pyramids well see it together jackie wont it be wonderful yes the girl replied and her voice was suddenly sharp almost with fear but will it be as wonderful for you as for me dont be silly jackie lets dance une qui aime et un qui se laisse aimer monsieur poirot thought yes i wonder too what will you do if hes awful asked joanna linnet shook her head oh i can trust jacquelines taste ah but love changes people joanna said quietly linnet looked impatient and changed the subject i must talk to the architect about those plans im having some horrible little houses near my new swimming pool pulled down are the people who live in them happy to go most of them are delighted one or two of them are being rather stupid about it theyll have much better living conditions the queen has spoken smiled joanna im not like that objected linnet no but others are powerless the combined effect of money and charm if you cant buy it with cash you buy it with a smile result linnet ridgeway the girl who has everything their conversation stopped as lord windlesham joined them joanna greeted him and then left the sittingroom she had seen the purposeful look in windleshams eye have you made a decision linnet he asked coming straight to the point i think you know wed be very happy together im not sure charles linnet apologized im enjoying myself i do think wode hall is looking nice dont you its beautiful and you like charltonbury dont you of course it needs modernizing but youre so clever at that sort of thing he paused but ill wait for your answer later linnet examined her feelings charltonbury was beautiful old and quite famous but it wasnt hers there she would be lord windleshams wife not the queen and wasnt there another reason for her hesitation she remembered jackies voice saying i shall die if i cant marry him she knew that she didnt feel that way about charles windlesham perhaps she could never feel like that about anyone the sound of a car came through the open window linnet shook herself impatiently and went to greet jackie and her young man linnet jackie ran to her this is simon linnet saw a tall wideshouldered young man with very dark blue eyes curly brown hair and a simple boyish smile she stretched out her hand the hand that took hers was firm and warm she liked the open admiration in his eyes and a warm sweet feeling swept over her come in she said as she finally dropped simons hand let me welcome my new land agent properly and as she turned to lead the way she thought im very very happy i like jackies young man i like him enormously and then sadly luckyjackie on the spanish island of majorca tim allerton leant back in his chair and yawned he looked at the attractive whitehaired woman of fifty who sat beside him do you really like majorca mother he asked well his mother said after some consideration its cheap and cold tim was a tall thin young man with dark hair and sad eyes he described himself as a writer but his friends understood that he did not encourage questions about his work what are you thinking of tim i was thinking of egypt real warmth darling golden sands the nile you mustnt worry about the cost i heard this morning that ive made a very satisfactory amount from an investment this morning said mrs allerton but your only letter this morning was from joanna she stopped and bit her lip the friendship between her son and his cousin always annoyed her they both liked discussing others and had many of the same friends mrs allerton didnt like to admit that she felt slightly jealous of the girl but its more than that she thought i dont like her shes insincere and cant be serious about anything quite right mother he said coolly it was yesterday that i heard about the investment heres joannas letter its full of news windleshams gone to canada upset by linnet ridgeways refusal shes definitely going to marry her land agent he has no money of course though hes from a good family and he was actually engaged to one of linnets best friends young people today dont know how to behave said mrs allerton and is joanna enjoying life she says shes thinking of opening a little shop in mayfair she always talks about having no money but she travels and her clothes must cost her a lot ah said tim but she probably doesnt pay for them well unpaid bills lead to ruin in the end think about poor sir george wode hes suffered terribly since he lost wode hall he thinks linnet ridgeway has spoilt the place and robbed his family of their history but mother he shouldnt live in the past and neither should we well go to egypt next month no arguments mrs allerton smiled affectionately and then said guiltily im afraid i promised mrs leech that youd go with her to the police station she wants to report the robbery of her ring but she doesnt understand any spanish ill go but the silly old woman was wearing the ring when she went swimming that day im sure she lost it in the sea in a new york apartment old miss van schuyler addressed her poor relations im going to europe and then to egypt the old woman explained miss bowers will come with me as usual but i want cornelia to come as my social assistant how wonderful cried cornelia robson a large girl with big doglike eyes ive always dreamed of a trip to europe my dear cousin her mother added rising to leave im really very grateful to you i think cornelia suffers from not being a social success here in new york i havent been able to take her to the right places since ned died as the robsons were leaving they met a tall efficientlooking woman on the stairs well miss bowers so youre going to egypt what a lovely trip mrs robson hesitated and waited until her daughter had gone on ahead of her i do hope there wont be any trouble she whispered with concern oh no mrs robson i always watch very carefully in another part of new york city mr andrew pennington was opening his personal mail suddenly his face changed and he called for his partner what is it pennington sterndale rockford looked not unlike his partner tall and thin with greying hair and a clever face linnets married pennington checked the date today to someone called simon doyle ive never heard of him have you no what shall we do rockford asked got a plan the normandie sails for europe today pennington said slowly he looked at the letter again linnets going to egypt for her honeymoon a chance meeting there we have to stay one step ahead of her british lawyers linnets clever said rockford you go shes always liked you her uncle andrew and the situation is very serious in the london offices of carmichael grant and carmichael william carmichael called his nephew into his office have a quick look at this letter he said to young jim fanthorp its just arrived by airmail from egypt it seems wrong to be writing business letters on a day like this we have been to so many interesting places already and the day after tomorrow we are going up the nile by steamboat when we went to buy our tickets who do you think we saw my american trustee andrew pennington i think you met him when he was in london two years ago i had no idea he was in egypt and he had no idea that i was nor that i was married my letter telling him must have just missed him he is actually going up the nile on the same trip that we are isnt that amazing you must go to egypt carmichael interrupted his nephews reading theres no time to lose but why me use your brains boy linnet ridgeway has never met you nor has pennington if you go by air you may get there in time mrs otterbourne addressed her daughter in her usual theatrical manner as she tied a brightly coloured scarf around her head im tired of jerusalem she complained and im not treated with the proper respect in this hotel my presence here attracts other visitors rosalie are you listening to me rosalie was silent she was looking at a photograph in the newspaper below which was printed mrs simon doyle previously the wellknown society beauty miss linnet ridgeway and her husband mr and mrs doyle are on their honeymoon in egypt that nasty little manager mrs otterbourne continued says he needs our room but im prepared to fight for my rights i suppose we could go on to egypt said rosalie without much interest it doesnt make any difference its certainly not a matter of life or death agreed her mother but mrs otterbourne was quite wrong because a matter of life or death was exactly what it was chapter two whos who on the nile thats hercule poirot the detective said mrs allerton she and her son were sitting in the sun outside the cataract hotel in assuan tim sat up more quickly than he usually did that funny little man in the white suit whats he doing here his mother laughed darling you sound quite excited but i dont think hes looking for criminals hes probably on holiday well hes found the bestlooking girl in the place tim noted its a pity that she looks so badtempered the subject of these remarks was rosalie otterbourne she certainly seemed to be in a bad mood but hercule poirot was chatting to her cheerfully i am finding this place very interesting he was saying the black rocks and the sun and the little boats on the river i think assuans rather dull rosalie said the hotels half empty and everyones about a hundred years old she stopped as she saw the smile in poirots eyes i i wasnt thinking of you im sorry that sounded rude please do not apologize said poirot it is natural that you should wish for people of your own age but there is one young man at least the one who sits with his mother all the time i like her but i think he looks awful so arrogant and i am i arrogant oh i dont think so and anyway i suppose you have a reason to be arrogant unfortunately crime doesnt interest me at all poirot said seriously i am delighted to learn that you have no guilty secret to hide rosalie looked questioningly at poirot but the detective did not seem to notice and continued we will both make the trip to wadi haifa and the second cataract and madame your mother was not at lunch today i hope that she is able to join us egypt doesnt suit her rosalie said quickly but we will be on the trip they continued their walk to the rivers edge one of the nile steamboats was just arriving and poirot and rosalie looked at the passengers with interest tim allerton joined them look he shouted excitedly thats linnet ridgeway there with the tall man he must be the new husband doyle said rosalie simon doyle it was in the newspapers shes got an enormous amount of money hasnt she yes tim agreed shes probably the richest girl in england linnet ridgeway now linnet doyle stepped off the boat with the confidence of a famous actress who expects people to admire her then she made a light remark to her husband and when he answered the sound of his voice seemed to interest hercule poirot his eyes lit up the couple passed close to him and he heard simon doyle say we can stay a week or two if you like darling he was looking at her with a deeply loving almost respectful attitude poirots eyes considered him thoughtfully tim watched the couple too lucky devil most girls with millions have something wrong with them shes perfect they look truly happy commented rosalie it isnt fair she added quietly she and poirot continued their walk so it is not fair mademoiselle asked the detective gently rosalies face turned red it seems a little too much for one person she said money good looks a beautiful figure and and love but perhaps he married her for her money didnt you see the way he looked at her i also saw dark circles below her eyes i saw a hand that held her bag so tightly that it was white something is not right and i know something else the detective continued i have heard the voice of monsieur doyle before but rosalie was not listening id like to tear her beautiful clothes off her back and destroy her lovely arrogant face im just jealous ive never hated anyone so much at first sight wonderful you will feel better after saying all that rosalie looked at him doubtfully then they both laughed and made their way slowly back to the hotel poirot found a seat in the garden and was looking around him when he recognized the girl from chez ma tante the expression on her face now was very different she was paler thinner and there were lines that told of great unhappiness a face and a voice the new husband mr simon doyle had been at chez ma tante with this young woman suddenly linnet doyle and her husband came down the path linnets voice was happy and confident the girl from chez ma tante stepped into the path the other two stopped hello linnet said jacqueline de bellefort our paths keep crossing hello simon how are you linnet had moved back with a little cry anger completely changed simon doyles goodlooking face he looked ready to hit the girl but then he noticed poirot hello jacqueline he said coldly what a surprise a surprise she asked then she walked away poirot left in the opposite direction he heard linnet doyle say simon what can we do oh what can we do after dinner that night most of the guests at the cataract hotel were sitting at little tables on the terrace simon and linnet doyle and a tall seriouslooking greyhaired american hesitated in the doorway tim allerton rose from his chair and greeted them you dont remember me im sure he said pleasantly to linnet but im joanna southwoods cousin of course i remember you youre tim allerton this is my husband her voice shook slightly pride shyness and this is my american trustee mr andrew pennington the three new arrivals joined tim and his mother at a table the next time the doors opened linnet looked up nervously but relaxed as a small man came out and walked across the terrace youre not the only celebrity here my dear that funny little man is hercule poirot explained mrs allerton of course said linnet thoughtfully ive heard of him monsieur poirot called mrs otterbourne in her loud bossy voice from the other side of the terrace sit down with us he obeyed there are quite a lot of celebrities here now arent there society beauties wellknown detectives famous novelists poirot felt rather than saw rosalies unhappiness you are working on a novel at present madame he asked politely im being terribly lazy mrs otterbourne said my readers are getting very impatient ill soon start writing again i speak the truth sex ah monsieur poirot why is everyone so afraid of sex you have read my books ah madame i do not read many novels my work mrs otterbourne interrupted you must have a copy оf under the fig tree you will find it interesting its honest and real ill fetch the book for you offered rosalie quickly no dear i can go said mrs otterbourne angrily please mother talk to monsieur poirot i know where it is a glass of wine madame offered poirot when rosalie had left no no i rarely touch alcohol then may i order a lemonade for you madame rosalie returned a book in her hand poirot was surprised by the lack of clothes worn by the lady on the cover but he accepted it politely while noticing the girls embarrassment suddenly the doors opened again and the thin darkhaired girl from chez ma tante walked quietly to an empty table and chose her seat carefully then she stared directly at linnet doyle linnet whispered something to mr pennington and changed her seat poirot noticed everything and wondered about the situation five minutes later the other girl moved to the opposite side of the terrace her eyes never left the face of simon doyles wife soon linnet doyle and her husband left the terrace jacqueline de bellefort smiled and lit a cigarette monsieur poirot poirot stood up quickly he had remained out on the terrace after everyone else had left he looked into the eyes of linnet doyle who looked more lovely than ever at your service madame he said politely monsieur poirot i am in urgent need of someone to help me and i think that you are probably the right person thank you madame but i am on holiday and when i am on holiday i do not take cases perhaps i can change that linnet said confidently before i met my husband he was engaged to a close friend of mine miss de bellefort my husband ended the engagement they were not suited to each other miss de bellefort i am sorry to say was very unhappy about it she threatened us but didnt harm us instead she has begun to follow us wherever we go ah rather an unusual er revenge commented poirot unusual and annoying were on our honeymoon and she has been there at every stop venice brindisi mena house and now here its nonsensical i am surprised she hasnt got more pride there are times madame when other emotions are stronger yes possibly but what can she hope to gain by all this it is not always a matter of gain madame linnet looked slightly embarrassed but said quickly you are right but this behaviour has got to be stopped if this young lady has not threatened or insulted you in public and if she has not physically harmed you i do not see what you can do the air is free to all this is impossible there must be some way of stopping her you could move somewhere else said poirot calmly why should we run away are we she stopped exactly madame are you what why does mademoiselle de belleforts presence offend you so much i will tell you a little story a month or two ago i was dining in a restaurant in london at the table next to me were a man and a girl they were it seemed very much in love and confident of the future i could see the womans face and the strength of her love was clear they were engaged i learnt and were discussing their honeymoon they planned to go to egypt he paused and now they are here in egypt but the man is on his honeymoon with another woman yes i had already told you the facts said linnet coldly poirot continued the facts yes but that night in london the girl also mentioned a friend who she could depend on i think that friend was you madame she trusted you these things happen monsieur poirot linnet said angrily i know that jackie was deeply in love with simon but he didnt feel the same way he was very fond of her but even before he met me he was beginning to feel that he had made a mistake and an engagement can be broken your argument is logical said poirot but it does not explain one thing your attitude your very close friend has been deeply hurt but instead of feeling pity or annoyance at her behaviour you are extremely angry there can be only one reason for your reaction that you feel a sense of guilt linnet jumped to her feet how dare you talk to me like that really monsieur poirot but i do dare madame i suggest that you felt strongly attracted to simon doyle at once then there was a moment when you had a choice you hesitated but you chose to use your charm to take simon from your friend although you knew what he meant to her there was a silence then linnet said in a cold voice this has nothing to do with my problem now i disagree with you madame i am explaining why your friends unexpected appearances upset you so much you know in your heart that she has right on her side i am guessing that you have had a happy life that you have been kind and generous in your attitude to others i have tried to be said linnet quietly and that is why you are so upset that you have intentionally caused someone pain i am sorry if i have been rude but psychology is the most important fact in a case linnet said slowly perhaps youre right but what can be done about it now i cant change the past you must accept that you are responsible for your friends problems you must have courage and do nothing couldnt you talk to jackie try to reason with her what is your husbands attitude to this situation hes angry said linnet extremely angry poirot considered this well i will talk to this young woman as a private individual but i do not believe that i shall achieve anything tell me how did she threaten you she threatened to kill us both hercule poirot found jacqueline de bellefort sitting on the rocks below the terrace mademoiselle he began may i talk to you i have just come from madame doyle but i am not working for her oh then why have you come i saw you and monsieur doyle once at chez ma tante poirot explained since then many things have happened you cannot change the past turn to the future and stop this suffering i am sure that would suit dear linnet jacqueline said angrily but there are times when i almost enjoy all of this and that mademoiselle is the worst of all poirot said gently go home you have your whole life in front of you monsieur poirot i love simon and he loves me and i loved linnet and trusted her she was my best friend but she has always been able to buy everything she wanted did monsieur doyle allow himself to be bought no its more complicated than that she gave up lord windlesham and his title and his big house and chose simon he felt confused but also special linnets beauty and charm blinded him and he couldnt see me any more he fell in love with her because she made him she looked away yes he hates me now but hed better be careful she pulled a small pearlhandled pistol from her handbag a nice little thing one bullet would kill a man or a woman and i know how to use it i was going to shoot them but then i decided to follow them and steal their happiness she laughed loudly poirot took her arm stop this he said do not open your heart to evil it will make its home there and destroy you jacqueline hesitated but then said you couldnt stop me if i decided to kill her what have i got to live for but mademoiselle murder is an unforgivable offence then you should respect my present method of revenge as long as it works i wont use that gun but sometimes i want to hurt her to put my little pistol against her head and shoot her oh she stared into the shadows someone was standing there poirot looked round quickly the place seemed completely empty i think we are alone mademoiselle you do understand that i cant do what you ask poirot shook his head but you can there is always a moment you could be different from your friend linnet and make the right choice if that moment passes there is no second chance no second chance jacqueline looked thoughtful then raised her head good night monsieur poirot the next morning simon doyle joined hercule poirot as the detective was walking into the town good morning monsieur poirot may i walk with you certainly monsieur doyle i shall be delighted simon hesitated and then said suddenly this problem that linnet told you about its a crime that she should be treated this way people can say that i behaved badly but i wont allow them to blame her did you have you talked to jackie miss de bellefort yes but she wouldnt listen cant she see that shes making a fool of herself demanded simon she has only a sense of injury shall we say poirot replied yes and i would understand if she never wished to see me again i admit i was completely to blame but respectable girls dont follow people round what can she hope to gain from it perhaps revenge crazy id understand better if she tried to shoot me said simon shes hotblooded and shes got an uncontrollable temper she could do anything for revenge if she were really angry but this spying it is cleverer yes it is intelligent and there is nothing then of the old feeling left asked poirot carefully monsieur poirot how can i explain it after i met linnet jackie didnt exist she thinks that i married linnet for her money but i wouldnt marry any woman for money i know this sounds arrogant but jackie was too fond of me une qui aime et un qui se laisse aimer remarked poirot simon ignored this comment jackie wanted to own me body and soul and a man doesnt want that kind of possessive attitude then i met linnet his voice was full of boyish wonder it was amazing everyone treats her like a queen and she chose me im nobody why cant jackie accept it like a man poirots upper lip curled in a faint smile well monsieur doyle she is not a man no but she should understand the situation if you no longer care for a girl its madness to marry her and now that i can see what jackies really like i feel ive had rather a lucky escape have you any idea what else she would do poirot asked thoughtfully she carries a pistol in her handbag simon looked surprised i dont believe shell use it she threatened earlier but the situation has gone past that this spying on us and following us everywhere has really hurt linnet but ive made a plan ive announced openly that were going to stay here for ten days but tomorrow the steamboat karnak starts from shellal to wadi haifa ill book our tickets for that trip under false names tomorrow morning linnet and i will leave the hotel saying that were going to philae for the day but instead well go to shellal and join the karnak there linnets maid will bring our luggage jackie will expect us back at the hotel in the evening but when we dont return it will be too late for her to find us and if miss de bellefort waits here until you return we may not return we could go to khartoum and then perhaps by air to kenya she cant follow us all round the world your plan may work said poirot but you are of course running away from the problem and remember mademoiselle de bellefort has brains then he added i too shall be on the karnak i bought my ticket in london i like to plan every detail simon laughed is that how a skilful murderer behaves you must tell us about some of your cases when were on the karnak i know that mrs allerton would like to hear about your work mrs allerton that is the charming whitehaired woman who has such a loving son yes shell be on the karnak too but she doesnt know about my plan i believe that its better not to trust anybody very wise a principle i also follow and the third member of your party the tall greyhaired man thats pennington linnets american trustee we met him by chance in cairo ah vraiment a question with your permission madame your wife is over twentyone years old no not yet but she didnt need anyones permission to marry me it was a great surprise to pennington he left new york on the carmanic two days before her letter about our wedding reached his office the carmanic poirot said thoughtfully what a coincidence to meet mr pennington in cairo yes and his plans included this nile trip so weve been travelling together on our honeymoon but at least in his presence we have to talk about other things and not jackie your wife has not told mr pennington about this problem no its our problem and anyway when we started on this nile trip we thought wed seen the end of it no said poirot i am sure you have not yet seen the end of it youre not very encouraging are you monsieur poirot simon doyles attitude worried poirot this man is like a child he thought he takes nothing seriously except playing games but his wife and jacqueline de bellefort take this business seriously the detective said you will allow me to ask a personal question was it your idea to come to egypt for your honeymoon simon seemed upset again no but linnet absolutely insisted on it and so and so he stopped naturally said poirot he understood that if linnet doyle decided on anything it had to happen he thought to himself i have heard from jacqueline de bellefort linnet doyle and her husband whose story of this affair is nearest the truth at eleven the next morning jacqueline de bellefort sat on the terrace and watched simon and linnet doyle depart in a small sailboat at the same time and without jacqueline seeing it a car departed with the doyles luggage and linnets maid hercule poirot decided to spend the time before lunch on the island of elephantine opposite the hotel and joined two men stepping into one of the hotel boats the younger man was a tall darkhaired young man with a thin angry face his clothes were extremely dirty and unsuitable for the climate the other traveller a heavy middleaged man with a foreign accent began a conversation with poirot as the boat headed for elephantine the younger man turned his back on them and instead admired the skill of the egyptian boatman who was piloting the boat on the little island the friendly stranger introduced himself to monsieur poirot as signor guido richetti a historian poirot accepted his card politely and formally presented signor richetti with one of his own cards then the two men now speaking in french stepped into the elephantine museum together the younger man from the boat walked around with little interest afterwards poirot noticed mrs allerton sitting alone beside the river and joined her he removed his hat politely good morning mr poirot mrs allerton said are you joining us on the trip to the second cataract yes i am im so glad im very excited to meet you but i saw you talking to simon doyle earlier what do you think of him his marriage to linnet ridgeway was a great surprise you know madame doyle well madame no but a cousin of mine joanna southwood is one of her best friends and one of tims she looked displeased you do not like your cousin madame not much said mrs allerton and then changed the subject how very few young people there are out here that pretty girl with the awful mother is almost the only young creature in the place she interests me that child but i feel sorry for her you can suffer so much when youre young and sensitive yes agreed poirot she is not happy poor little one ive tried to talk to her but shes not interested however i hope to have another opportunity on this nile trip im very friendly really people interest me enormously she paused then said tim tells me that the darkhaired girl miss de bellefort is the girl who was engaged to simon doyle its rather uncomfortable for them meeting like this you know it may sound foolish but she almost frightens me a great force of emotion is always frightening poirot said do people interest you too monsieur poirot or are you only interested in possible criminals that description would not leave many people outside it even me perhaps asked mrs allerton with surprise mothers madame are particularly dangerous when their children are in trouble she said seriously yes i think youre quite right then she smiled again and said im trying to imagine motives for crime suitable for everyone in the hotel simon doyle for example poirot said smiling a very simple crime nothing complicated he would go directly towards his goal and therefore he would be easy to catch yes he would not be clever and linnet she would act like a queen and simply give her orders and the dangerous girl jacqueline de bellefort could she commit a murder poirot paused and then said doubtfully yes i think she could im not sure she puzzles me that little one mr pennington couldnt commit a murder theres no red blood in him said mrs allerton enjoying the game and poor mrs otterbourne in her funny clothes there is always pride as a motive for murder asked mrs allerton doubtfully motives for murder are not always grand madame what are the most usual motives monsieur poirot most frequent money then there is revenge and love and fear and pure hate and even generosity monsieur poirot oh yes madame political murders are often in this group somebody is considered harmful to a society and is removed the murderers forget that life and death are the affair of god soon they joined the others in the boat to return to the hotel poirot spoke politely to the young man in the dirty clothes there are very wonderful things to see in egypt are there not they make me sick the young man replied in a surprisingly educated voice think of the poor workers who struggled to build all these important buildings and died doing it youd prefer to have no pyramids no parthenon no castles or cathedrals asked mrs allerton human beings matter more than stones and the future is more important than the past signor richetti whose special interest was ancient ruins argued with the young man about art and politics until the boat landed after lunch the passengers for the second cataract including monsieur poirot the allertons the young man and the italian but not jacqueline de bellefort caught the train from cairo to shellal the otterbournes would join the group there poirot found that he was sitting with an older lady who had a very lined face a stiff white collar diamonds around her neck and an arrogant expression on her face after a quick look at poirot she retired behind her american magazine now and then she raised her eyes and shouted an order at the shy young woman sitting opposite her cornelia collect the coats when we arrive look for my case under no circumstances let anyone else handle it the train journey was very short and soon the passengers were on the kartiak with the otterbournes most of the passengers had cabins on the same deck at the front of this deck there was a public lounge with windows on all sides where the passengers could sit and watch the river after checking his cabin poirot joined rosalie otterbourne on the deck so now we journey into nubia you are pleased mademoiselle the girl took a deep breath yes i feel that were really getting away from things at last away from people theres something about this country that makes me feel evil it reminds me that everythings so unfair look at some peoples mothers and look at mine the only god is sex she stopped i shouldnt say such things i suppose why not say them to me say them and then let them go she smiled at poirot what an extraordinary man you are then her faced changed again well here are mr and mrs doyle i had no idea they were coming on this trip simon and linnet doyle looked relaxed and brilliantly happy and held hands as the karnak began its sevenday journey to the second cataract and back from behind them came a light laugh linnet turned her head in shock jacqueline de bellefort was standing there she seemed amused hello linnet i didnt expect to find you here i thought you said you were staying in assuan for another ten days linnet and simon moved to the other side of the boat simon looked wild with anger their pleasure had gone without turning his head poirot heard bits of their conversation i turn backi impossible lin weve got to go on with it now in the early evening poirot stood alone in the public lounge suddenly linnet doyle stood by his side she looked nervous and worried like a confused child monsieur poirot im afraid im afraid of everything the dark water the wild rocks ive never felt like this except for simon im surrounded by enemies but what is all this madame perhaps its nerves i just feel unsafe trapped whats going to happen how did she know we were coming on this boat she has brains you know answered poirot with your money why did you not hire a private boat we didnt expect this trouble and simon is sensitive about money he wanted a honeymoon that he could pay for ive got to educate him gradually about the finer things in life then her mood changed i must change my clothes im sorry monsieur poirot im afraid ive been talking a lot of foolish nonsense in the diningroom mrs allerton said to her son i asked little hercule poirot to sit at our table mother you didnt tim sounded annoyed hell be with us day and night mrs allerton looked upset tim was usually so good tempered men were difficult to understand im sorry my dear i thought it would amuse you you love detective stories as they sat down hercule poirot crossed the room to their table you really allow me madame to join you please sit down monsieur poirot mrs allerton said smiling she noticed his quick look at tim who still seemed angry so talked cheerfully to produce a more pleasant atmosphere heres the passenger list lets try and match names to people we know miss de bellefort and the otterbournes and of course mr and mrs doyle i think dr bessner must be the fat german with the moustache and mr fanthorp must be the very quiet young man quite a nice face cautious and intelligent yes agreed poirot i wonder what he is doing here i think mr ferguson must be the young man who hates the rich and mr pennington is the american who mrs doyle calls uncle andrew i can imagine him in an office on wall street extremely rich i think next monsieur hercule poirot whose talents are being wasted on this trip cant you find a crime for monsieur poirot tim but her wellintended conversation only seemed to annoy her son more and she quickly continued we know mr richetti from elephantine island then miss van schuyler the very ugly old american lady who thinks she is better than everybody who are the two women with her finally tim decided to join his mothers game miss bowers the thin one with glasses is her secretary and nurse the other one is miss robson a poor relation who seems to be enjoying herself although miss van schuyler treats her like a slave i heard them talking in the lounge before dinner on his way to his cabin later that night hercule poirot saw jacqueline de bellefort standing alone on the deck the look of pain on her face stopped him she looked sad now not frightening in any way good night mademoiselle good night monsieur poirot she hesitated then said you were surprised to find me here on this trip more sorry than surprised you have chosen mademoiselle the dangerous path i doubt now if you could turn back if you chose to that is true but one must follow ones star wherever it leads be careful mademoiselle that it is not a false star back in his cabin poirot was falling asleep when he heard simon doyles voice repeating the same words he had used when the steamboat left shellal weve got to go on with it now yes thought hercule poirot we have to go on with it now he was not happy after a stop at ezzebua the next day the karnak continued its journey towards wadi haifa the scenery was less frightening and the mood of the passengers was more cheerful linnet seemed almost lighthearted as she sat in the public lounge with her husband and mr pennington i know its your honeymoon linnet said pennington but there are just one or two things of course uncle andrew linnet at once became sinesslike my marriage has made a difference of course yes i will need your signature on several documents pennington looked round quickly the only other people in the lounge were mr ferguson drinking beer at a small table hercule poirot who was sitting near him and miss van schuyler who was sitting in a corner reading a book on egypt pennington left and returned with a large pile of papers have i got to sign all these linnet asked i know its not a good time but id like to get your affairs in proper order he sorted through the papers and simon yawned the door to the lounge opened and mr fanthorp came in he looked round and then walked over to the windows and stood near poirot looking out at the pale blue water pennington put a document in front of linnet who examined it carefully you sign just there he said as he pointed to the space for her signature its not very important you neednt read it simon yawned again my dear girl if you read everything well be here until lunchtime and longer i always read everything carefully said linnet father taught me to do that there could be a careless mistake pennington gave a rather cold laugh ive never read a legal document in my life said simon laughing i sign where they tell me to sign suddenly to everyones surprise the silent mr fanthorp spoke to linnet excuse me but i must say that i respect your businesslike attitude its admirable to read a document before you sign it then rather red in the face he turned again to study the banks of the nile er thank you linnet said trying not to laugh andrew pennington looked seriously annoyed and gathered up the documents perhaps some other time would be better he said coldly we mustnt miss enjoying the scenery as they left cornelia robson hurried in miss bowers followed her calmly where have you been miss van schuyler said crossly cornelia i expect a little attention from you miss bowers give me my medicine and find me a chair outside on the deck cornelia bring my sewing after the three women left mr ferguson remarked to the almost empty room id like to kill that woman poirot who had noted everything that had happened in the room asked with interest she is a type you dislike definitely shes never worked she just uses people there are a lot of people on this boat that the world would be better without really yes that girl in here just now signing documents shes one of the richest women in england and has never done a days work who told you that she was so rich asked poirot a man who works with his hands and is proud of it me i work with my brain and am proud of it said poirot they ought to be shot all of them what a fondness you have for violence youve got to destroy before you can build up it is certainly much easier noisier and more exciting what do you do for a living the young man asked nothing at all i expect you probably call yourself a middleman i am not a middleman i am a top man hercule poirot said rather arrogantly what are you i am a detective said hercule poirot proudly no are you here to protect that rich girl does she think she needs a stupid detective with her i have no connection with the doyles said poirot coldly i am on holiday and you are you not on holiday too im studying conditions ferguson said mysteriously very interesting poirot said to himself he left the public lounge and walked along the righthand deck as he reached the back of the steamboat he almost walked into a woman with an excitable dark face she was neatly dressed in a maids uniform and was talking to a big wellbuilt man perhaps one of the karnaks engineers a look of alarm and guilt appeared on both their faces when they saw poirot then as he continued his walk back along the lefthand side of the boat a door opened and mrs otterbourne nearly fell into his arms dear mr poirot so very sorry she apologized the boat moves so much never really happy on the water poirot gently took her arm i will send your daughter to you madame return to your cabin the water is too rough you might be swept off the deck mrs otterbourne hesitated and then went back into her cabin poirot found rosalie sitting between mrs allerton and tim she was chatting and laughing quite happily but her face changed when monsieur poirot said your mother wants you mademoiselle as rosalie hurried to her mothers cabin mrs allerton said i think shes a very complicated girl very unhappy well i suppose weve all got our private troubles tim replied that evening poirot noticed mrs allerton talking to miss van schuyler as he passed their chairs mrs allerton closed one eye and opened it again she was saying of course at calfries castle the dear prince cornelia was listening happily to dr bessner as the german told her everything he had read in his guidebook about ancient egypt poirot also heard tim allerton say its a horrible world rosalie otterbourne answered its unfair some people have everything poirot was glad that he was no longer young chapter three tragedy strikes the karnak next stop was at abu simbel it was a beautiful warm day and everybody wanted to see the ancient temple simon doyle had a quiet word with poirot im so glad we came on this trip linnets faced this business at last and weve agreed that we arent going to let jackie upset us any more were going to enjoy our honeymoon that ought to show her yes said poirot thoughtfully linnet came along the deck smiling and looking beautiful as usual she greeted poirot coolly and then took her husband away poirot realized that his critical attitude had made him unpopular linnet expected to be admired for everything she was or did soon the official guide led the group from the karnak towards abu simbel poirot walked beside andrew pennington madame doyle was telling me that you came over on the carmanic did you meet some friends of mine who were on that ship the rushington smiths asked poirot i dont remember the name the boat was full and the weather was bad so a lot of passengers rarely appeared but now the pleasant coincidence of running into madame doyle and her husband you had no idea they were married no mrs doyle had written but i didnt receive the letter until after our unexpected meeting in cairo explained pennington you have known her for many years i understand since she was a small child her father and i were great friends a very fine man melhuish ridgeway and a very successful one his daughter will receive a very large fortune when her father dies i understand ah pardon that is a private matter andrew pennington seemed slightly amused oh most people know that linnet is a very wealthy woman will the recent fall in the stock market affect her fortune pennington hesitated but finally said yes of course to some degree the financial situation for everyone is difficult these days inside the temple signor richetti examined the painted walls and dr bessner read aloud to cornelia from his guidebook she listened with great attention until miss van schuyler called for her poirot realized that someone was always either instructing the poor girl or giving her orders simon said suddenly linnet lets get out of here i dont like these old figures theres something frightening about them linnet laughed but they walked into the sunlight then they sat against the side of the hill how lovely the sun is thought linnet how warm how safe how lovely to be me me me linnet simon also looked content what a fool hed been to be worried that first night there was nothing to worry about everything was all right after all one could trust jackie suddenly there was a shout people were running towards him waving their arms simon jumped to his feet and dragged linnet with him not a minute too soon an enormous rock crashed down past them if linnet had remained where she was she would have been killed whitefaced linnet and simon held each other hercule poirot and tim allerton ran up to them ma foil madame that was close they saw nothing when they looked up at the hill but poirot remembered seeing some people walking along the path at the top when they had first stepped on shore shell pay for this simon said violently then he looked quickly at tim allerton and was silent was it an accident wondered tim aloud or did some fool push it linnet was very pale and found it difficult to speak i think she said slowly some fool must have pushed it as they walked back to the kaniak simon stopped suddenly in surprise jacqueline de bellefort was just coming off the boat good god simon whispered it was an accident after all i thought i thought good morning jacqueline said and walked towards the temple poirot looked back at the beach he could see miss van schuyler and miss bowers and there was mrs allerton with mrs otterbourne he could not see the others the next day most of the passengers from the karnak decided to visit the second cataract hercule poirot and mrs allerton walked slowly up the hill together mrs allerton had learned to like the little man very much although tim was always trying to keep her away from him she found herself suddenly telling him about her dislike of joanna southwood tim was chatting to rosalie otterbourne about his bad luck in life poor health but not bad enough to be interesting very little money nothing much to do rosalie interrupted but you have your mother she looks lovely so calm but amusing too tim was surprised and pleased mother shes wonderful isnt she its nice of you to see it he was embarrassed that he couldnt say anything nice about her mother miss van schuyler had stayed on the boat she was too old for the climb up to the second cataract she complained about cornelia to miss bowers she rushed away without a word to me and i saw her talking to that very unpleasant young man ferguson miss bowers looked at the group as they walked down the hill miss robson is with dr bessner now miss van schuyler was pleased with this arrangement she had learned that dr bessner was a wellknown fashionable doctor in europe she decided to be polite to him in case she needed his professional services before the journey was over when the group returned to the karnak linnet cried a telegram for me how nice she seized it from the board and opened it i dont understand potatoes beans onions what does it mean simon suddenly an angry voice said excuse me that telegram is for me and signor richetti took it rudely from her hand i am so sorry signor richetti you see my name was ridgeway before i married so she smiled at signor richetti but he did not excuse her mistake just because she was pretty names should be read carefully he said coldly linnet turned away these italians are so rude she said angrily to simon the two of them went on shore alone poirot watching from the deck turned to see jacqueline de bellefort beside him instead of looking amused or evil she looked ill as if a fire was burning inside her they dont care any more i cant hurt them you were right i ought not to have come but i cant go back i will not allow them to be happy together id rather kill him she turned suddenly and hurried away poirot staring after her felt a hand on his shoulder it was an old friend colonel race a man who travelled round the world solving important cases for the british government he and poirot had met a year previously at a dinner party in london that had ended with the death of their host your friend seems a bit upset monsieur poirot colonel race what are you doing here im on the return journey to shellal with you im interested in one of the karnaks passengers but unfortunately i dont know which one explained colonel race rather mysteriously theres been a lot of political trouble out here violence murders our spies have told us that the cleverest of the leaders the brains is on this boat but we dont have his name or description have you got any ideas an idea but nothing more than that poirot said thoughtfully race knew that poirot never spoke unless he was sure poirot rubbed his nose and said unhappily there is something else happening on this boat that is causing me much concern tell me about it race said with interest think about this said poirot a has wronged в в desires revenge and threatens a both women are on this boat dont worry said race people especially women who talk about what they are going to do dont usually do it anything else yesterday a had a very close escape from death the kind of death that might conveniently be called an accident arranged by b no that is the point в did not do it it was not possible then it was an accident coincidences do happen i suppose so agreed poirot but i do not like such accidents is a a particularly unpleasant person asked race absolutely not a is a charming rich and beautiful young lady and if i am right and i am constantly in the habit of being right then there is a matter for serious concern and now you tell me there is a man on the karnak who kills he doesnt usually kill charming young ladies today i advised a madame doyle to take another route and not to return on this boat said poirot but she and her husband would not agree i pray to heaven that we may arrive at shellal without disaster but i hercule poirot i am afraid on the following evening the karnak stopped at abu simbel giving the passengers the opportunity for a second visit to the temple theres so much to see cornelia robson said excitedly to mr ferguson i wish dr bessner was here hed explain it all to me how can you like that boring old fool and that old woman she treats you like a dog youre as good as they are but im not protested cornelia cousin marie is very cultured and cultured that word makes me sick ferguson paused dont you realize as an american that everyone is born free and equal of course people arent equal said cornelia calmly im not beautiful and rich like mrs doyle mrs doyle shouted ferguson shes the sort of woman who ought to be shot as an example there was an uncomfortable silence but before they returned to the karnak ferguson said youre the nicest person on the boat remember that feeling unusually pleased cornelia hurried into the public lounge to find miss van schuyler the old lady looked at her watch youve been a long time she said crossly and what have you done with my velvet shawl i had it in here after dinner it was on that chair i cant see it anywhere cousin marie said cornelia after a quick search miss van schuyler left the room in a bad temper with cornelia and miss bowers following behind most of the other passengers had also gone to bed early the poyles remained in the lounge playing cards with pennington and colonel race at a table in a corner fanthorp was reading a book the only other passenger in the lounge was hercule poirot who could not stop yawning he too decided on an early night as he walked sleepily towards his cabin poirot met jacqueline hurrying along the deck you look sleepy monsieur poirot mais oui i can hardly keep my eyes open said poirot it has been a very hot day no wind at all yes jacqueline said thoughtfully its been the sort of day when things break when one cant go on she seemed tense and nervous but she relaxed when she said good night her eyes met his just for a moment poirot remembered that look the next day had there been a cry for help he continued to his cabin after dealing with miss van schuylers many needs cornelia decided that she was not sleepy and returned to the public lounge she looked up from her sewing when the door opened and jacqueline de bellefort came in jacqueline pressed the bell for a waiter then sat down with cornelia a lovely night jacqueline commented a real honeymoon night isnt it her eyes rested on linnet doyle when the waiter arrived jacqueline ordered a large drink simon looked up from his cards with a faint line of worry on his forehead when her drink came jacqueline picked it up and said well heres to crime she finished it quickly and ordered another again simon looked across the room at her he seemed to lose his concentration in the card game and soon linnet and colonel race stood up to leave coming simon asked linnet not yet i think ill have a drink first pennington finished his drink and left cornelia began to gather up her sewing please dont go to bed miss robson said jacqueline dont leave me we girls must support each other cornelia sat down again jacquelines second drink arrived and she began to sing quietly he was her man and he did her wrong mr fanthorp turned a page of his book simon doyle picked up a magazine really i think ill go to bed said cornelia its very late i forbid you to go jacqueline replied tell me about yourself cornelia was confused obviously jacqueline was drinking too much but there was something else jacqueline was talking to her was looking at her but it seemed that the words she said were meant for someone else but cornelia did as requested and began telling jacqueline every detail of her life again she sensed that jacqueline was listening to something else or perhaps for something else then jacqueline turned her head and spoke to simon doyle ring the bell simon i want another drink its late and youve had enough to drink jackie jacqueline laughed simons afraid im going to tell you the story of my life she said to cornelia he treated me rather badly didnt you simon cornelia was deeply embarrassed but also pleasantly excited what an angry look simon doyle had on his face youre drunk he said youre making a fool of yourself cornelia began to stand up i really must its so late no stay and listen hes embarrassed he wants me to behave well dont you simon but im going to talk a lot jim fanthorp carefully shut his book yawned looked at his watch and left the room a very british performance jacqueline stared at simon i told you she said that id kill you before id let you go to another woman you dont think i meant that youre wrong ive only been waiting youre mine do you hear simon remained silent jacqueline reached into in her handbag and then leant forward with something shiny in her hand ill shoot you like a dog like the dirty dog you are simon jumped to his feet but at the same moment jacqueline fired the gun simon fell twisted across a chair cornelia screamed and rushed to the door jim fanthorp was outside on the deck mr fanthorp cornelia cried oh shes shot him simon doyle still lay across the chair jacqueline stood staring at the blood on his trouser leg where he was holding a handkerchief to the wound i didnt mean oh my god i didnt really mean the pistol dropped from her nervous fingers to the floor she kicked it away and it slid under one of the sofas simon whispered fanthorp theres someone coming say its all right an accident something fanthorp spoke quickly to the waiter who was hurrying through the door all right everythings all right just a bit of kin the nubian left again jacqueline began crying uncontrollably oh god i want to die oh what have i done what have i done simons face was twisted with pain take her to her cabin fanthorp miss robson get that hospital nurse of yours to look after her dont leave her alone then bring old bessner here and please dont let any news of this get to my wife fanthorp and cornelia soon had jacqueline back in her cabin but she would not calm down ill kill myself oh simon simon fanthorp said to cornelia find miss bowers ill stay with her simon could bleed to deathjacqueline cried i must help him let me go fanthorp held her by her shoulders quietly quietly you must stay here hell be all right very soon cornelia returned with miss bowers who immediately took charge of the situation some minutes later fanthorp managed to wake the heavily sleeping dr bessner and the two men hurried back to the lounge simon greyfaced had his head against an open window breathing in the cool night air the handkerchief now lay in a pool of blood on the floor the doctor examined simons leg and said yes it is bad the bone is broken and he has lost a lot of blood mr fanthorp you and i must carry him to my cabin he cannot walk there dr bessner took care of simons bullet wound and then gave him something to help him sleep what should we do about your wife he asked simon said weakly she neednt know until morning and i you mustnt blame jackie i treated her badly she didnt know what she was doing someone ought to stay with her she might hurt herself its all right mr doyle said fanthorp miss bowers is going to stay with her all night simon relaxed then opened his eyes again fanthorp he called the pistol ought not to leave it lying about fanthorp understood quite right ill go and get it now three minutes later he was back at bessners cabin he spoke quietly to the doctor i cant find that pistol i saw the girl drop it and kick it under a sofa but it isnt there now they stared at each other puzzled and rather alarmed the next morning hercule poirot was shaving when colonel race hurried into his cabin your feeling was correct its happened race began linnet doyles dead shot through the head last night poirot was silent for a minute two memories came back to him very clearly first a girl in a garden in assuan saying there are moments when i want to hurt her to put my pistol against her head and shoot her and the same voice saying more recently yes its been the sort of day when things break when one cant go on why had he not answered her cry for help he had been blind deaf stupid with his need for sleep the two men went to linnets cabin where they found dr bessner examining the body what can you tell us doctor about this business asked race the gun was held against her head the bullet entered just above the ear the skin is burned and black around the bullet hole the murderer shot her as she lay sleeping non poirot cried out this description did not fit with his picture of jacqueline de bellefort she would not act in this way then poirot looked up and saw a big shaky letter j written in a brownishred colour on the white wall next to linnets bed he lifted the dead girls right hand and found the same brownishred colour on one of her fingers what do you think of that asked race it is very simple is it not madame doyle is dying she wishes to name her killer and so she writes with her finger using her own blood the first letter of her murderers name it has often been done in crime novels it makes me think that our murderer is oldfashioned what does j stand for asked race poirot answered immediately j is for jacqueline de bellefort a young lady who has a pistol and who told me less than a week ago that she would like to shoot madame doyle bessner said we will have to remove the bullet to be certain about the gun what about the time of death asked race she has been dead certainly for six hours and probably not longer than eight so she was murdered between midnight and two oclock in the morning where is her husband asked race at the moment he is sleeping in my cabin said dr bessner i see from your surprise that you have not been told that mr doyle was shot last night in the public lounge shot by whom by the young lady jacqueline de bellefort the bone in his leg is badly broken he needs hospital treatment the captain has given us an office race said our first job is to get all the facts chapter four everyone is a suspect in the office colonel race and poirot began their enquiry first they listened to dr bessners thorough report of the previous night race said it seems clear enough the girl got excited helped by a drink or two and finally shot simon doyle then she went along to linnet doyles cabin and shot her too no i do not think that was possible bessner interrupted first she was never alone after she shot mr doyle and second why would she write the first letter of her own name on the wall it would not be her style agreed poirot but perhaps someone else wanted to direct our attention to her who discovered the crime mrs doyles maid louise bourget she went to call mrs doyle as usual found her dead came out of the cabin and fainted the captain was called and then he came to me reported race doyles got to be told you say hes asleep still yes in my cabin bessner said i gave him a strong sleeping drug last night thank you doctor said race i dont think we need to keep you longer well begin to question the other passengers as they waited for fanthorp and miss robson witnesses to what had happened to simon doyle race said this is bad have you any ideas about this murder my ideas are not in good order poirot replied we know you see that this girl wanted to kill linnet doyle but would she do it in this way asked race could she she would have the brains for this murder and the motive but i doubt if physically she could face committing the act i see agreed race and remember bessner also said it was physically impossible i hope that is true poirot said and paused i shall be glad if it is because i am sympathetic to that little one the door opened fanthorp and cornelia robson entered race began i said good night to mrs doyle at her cabin door at eleven twenty who remained in the public lounge after she left fanthorp answered doyle was there and miss de bellefort myself and miss robson thats right agreed cornelia mr pennington went to bed a few minutes after mrs doyle so what was everyone doing after pennington left mr fanthorp was reading a book id got some sewing miss de bellefort was she was drinking quite heavily mr fanthorp helped her and she was talking to me but i think most of her comments were meant for mr doyle said cornelia he was getting angry but he kept quiet i think he hoped she would calm down but she didnt and she wouldnt let me leave the lounge i was getting very uncomfortable with the situation then mr fanthorp left it was a little embarrassing so i left quietly said fanthorp then she pulled out a pistol continued cornelia and mr doyle jumped up to try and take it from her and it shot him in the leg and then she began to cry and i was frightened to death and ran out after mr fanthorp mr doyle wanted to keep everything quiet so we took jacqueline to her cabin and mr fanthorp stayed with her while i got miss bowers what time was this race asked cornelia hesitated but fanthorp said it was about twenty minutes past twelve i know it was actually half past twelve when i finally got to my cabin now let me be quite sure on one or two points said poirot after madame doyle left the lounge did any of the four of you leave it fanthorp answered immediately no im positive neither doyle miss de bellefort miss robson nor myself left the lounge so mademoiselle de bellefort did not leave the lounge and shoot madame doyle before twenty past twelve mademoiselle robson when you went to fetch mademoiselle bowers was jacqueline de bellefort alone in her cabin at any time no mr fanthorp stayed with her she has a perfect alibi but monsieur doyle you say was very anxious that she should not be left alone was he afraid do vou think that she was considering another foolish act thats my opinion said fanthorp he was afraid she might even try to kill herself she kept saying she would be better dead cornelia said shyly mr doyle said it was all his fault that hed treated her badly he spoke quite nicely about her poirot looked thoughtful now what happened to that pistol tell me exactly what happened miss de bellefort let the gun fall then she kicked it away and it went under a sofa fanthorp continued explaining how he had gone back to search for it but had not been able to find it so we arrive at this point when mademoiselle de bellefort left the lounge the pistol was under the sofa after that she had no opportunity to return to the lounge for it what time was it monsieur fanthorp when you went back to look for it just before half past twelve about five minutes after dr bessner and i carried doyle out of the lounge in those few minutes someone not mademoiselle de bellefort took that pistol from under the sofa it seems very probable that the person who removed it was the murderer of madame doyle and also that this person had heard or seen mademoiselle de bellefort shoot doyle i dont see how you can know that objected fanthorp you have told us that the pistol was hidden under the sofa therefore it is hardly possible that it was discovered by accident it was taken by someone who knew it was there explained poirot fanthorp shook his head i saw nobody when i went out on the deck just before miss de bellefort shot doyle but you were outside on the right side of the boat from that position one cannot see someone on the opposite side looking through the glass door of the public lounge did anyone except the waiter hear the shot poirot asked no the windows and doors were closed because miss van schuyler felt cold earlier in the evening answered fanthorp race added no one seems to have heard the other shot the shot that killed mrs doyle for the moment let us concentrate on the first shooting poirot said we must speak to mademoiselle bowers but first before we finish here may we have a little information about the two of you fanthorp and miss robson gave their full names addresses and professions then poirot asked fanthorp and your reasons for visiting this country er pleasure a holiday fanthorp answered after a pause very well monsieur fanthorp a final question did you hear anything at all after you went to your cabin fanthorp thought for a moment i went to bed very quickly i think i heard something as i was falling asleep a splash nothing else did the splash seem close what time was it i was half asleep but i think it was about one oclock i dont know how close it was thank you poirot turned to cornelia now mademoiselle robson what did you do after helping dr bessner with monsieur doyles leg i went to my cabin the one next to miss de bellefort the boats against the bank on my side so i didnt hear any splashes poirot thanked fanthorp and cornelia and they left according to three witnesses jacqueline de bellefort did not pick up the pistol after she kicked it under the sofa said race miss bowers was next in the office after the usual questions poirot asked how is mademoiselle van schuylers health theres nothing seriously wrong with her replied miss bowers shes just old she likes plenty of attention and can pay for it please tell us about mademoiselle de bellefort last night miss robson came for me and told me what had happened miss de bellefort had drunk a large amount of alcohol she was excited and upset i gave her a drug to calm her and i sat with her did either of you leave her cabin at any time no i was in the cabin with her until early this morning i am absolutely sure that she didnt leave after the nurse went out the two men looked at each other jacqueline de bellefort was definitely not the murderer so who had shot linnet doyle someone took the pistol thinking that jacqueline de bellefort would be accused of the murder said race but that person the real murderer did not know that miss bowers would be with miss de bellefort all night add this to the fact that someone again not miss de bellefort had already attempted to kill linnet doyle at the temple who was that person poirot said doyle the allertons mademoiselle van schuyler and mademoiselle bowers were within my sight at the temple they did not push the rock but there are others to consider their discussion was interrupted by the entrance of jacqueline de bellefort race left her alone with poirot i didnt do it she said in the voice of a frightened child oh please believe me its awful poirot gently touched her shoulder do not be upset we know that you did not kill madame doyle it is proved mon enfant but who didjacqueline asked tearfully that said poirot is the question we are asking ourselves you cannot help us my child jacqueline shook her head i dont know she said i cant think of anyone who wanted her dead except me she looked down nervously twisting her fingers and suddenly cried out deaths horrible horrible i hate the thought of it poirot said yes it is not pleasant is it to think that someone is at this moment celebrating his or her success please stopjacqueline shouted then in a quiet voice i wanted her dead and she is dead and she died just like i said yes mademoiselle she was shot through the head then i was right that night at the cataract hotel there was someone listening ah i wondered if you would remember that evening it is too much of a coincidence that madame doyle was killed in just the way you described jacquelines voice shook that man that night who was he poirot was silent for a minute or two then said you are sure it was a man mademoiselle jacqueline looked at him in surprise and said slowly i thought it was a man but it was really just a a figure a shadow the door opened and dr bessner appeared will you come and speak with mr doyle please monsieur poirot he would like to see you jacqueline jumped up she caught bessner by the arm is he all right hes not going to die she cried who said anything about dying we will get him to hospital for proper treatment the girls face relaxed and she sat down again while poirot hurried off to bessners cabin to speak to doyle poirot stood in the doorway and examined doyles face which showed pain shock but also childlike confusion simon whispered please come in i simply cant believe that linnet is dead but jackie didnt do it she wouldnt murder someone in cold blood poirot said gently mademoiselle de bellefort did not shoot your wife but who else wanted to kill her simon shook his head apart from jackie theres nobody of course theres windlesham she refused him and married me but hes in canada now and theres old sir george wode who was unhappy about selling his house and seeing linnet make all those changes but hes in london monsieur doyle poirot said seriously i had a conversation with madame your wife on the first day on the karnak she said she felt afraid unsafe she felt that everyone around her was an enemy we were both upset at finding jackie on the boat that is understandable but it does not quite explain madame doyles feelings continued poirot well there was a name on the passenger list that upset her she said it was someone whose father had done business with her father and had lost everything linnet said its awful when people hate you without even knowing you you are quite sure that she did not mention this mans name i didnt really pay much attention simon doyle said bessner said dryly i can have a guess i heard that young man ferguson criticize mrs doyle once or twice we must not form theories until we talk to everyone advised poirot we ought to interview the maid first can we do that here monsieur doyles presence might be helpful yes thats a good idea said simon had she been with your wife long just a couple of months thats all only a couple of months and had madame any valuable jewellery there were her pearls said simon she once told me they were worth about fifty thousand pounds my god do you think those pearls robbery is a possible but unlikely motive let us see the maid louise bourget was the attractive darkhaired woman who poirot had noticed one day but now she looked sad and frightened when did you last see madame doyle alive last night monsieur i helped her to undress and then i went to my cabin on the deck below some time after eleven did you see or hear anything unusual last night asked poirot my cabin is on the other side of the boat on the deck below naturally if i had been unable to sleep and if i had climbed the stairs then perhaps i would have seen this killer enter or leave madames cabin but what can i say my good girl simon said roughly ill look after you nobodys accusing you of anything and you know of no one on this boat who would want to hurt madame doyle asked poirot the maids answer surprised everyone yes that i do know there was mademoiselle de bellefort of course but there was also someone else who disliked madame good lord simon cried whats all this louise went on excitedly yes yes yes it is as i say madames former maid marie was engaged to marry one of the engineers on this boat but madame doyle discovered that this man fleetwood already had a wife in egypt marie ended the engagement but fleetwood was very angry when he found out that madame was on this boat he told me that she had ruined his life and he would like to kill her poirot turned to simon had you any idea of this none and i doubt if linnet even knew that the man was on the boat she had probably forgotten all about the affair poirot turned sharply to the maid did you say anything about fleetwood to madame doyle no monsieur of course not and do you know anything about madames pearls her pearls louises eyes opened wide she was wearing them last night she put them on the table beside her bed as always and did you see them this morning asked the detective mon dieu i did not even look you did not look said poirot but i i have eyes which notice and there were no pearls on the bedside table this morning after searching linnet doyles cabin and failing to find her pearls poirot and colonel race returned to their office what do we know now asked race aha i see you have had an idea my friend poirot answered yes i was thinking about the sound that fanthorp mentioned its possible that after the murder the killer threw the pistol into the water it was not in mrs doyles cabin ah the logical place for the pistol is in mademoiselle de belleforts cabin but perhaps it has not yet been put there yes i see said race thoughtfully but now there are the missing pearls and the man fleetwood it seems obvious that the pearls have been stolen but it was an odd moment to choose for a robbery was it not and why would a thief kill a sleeping woman it is unsatisfactory you know i have a little idea about those pearls but no it is impossible because if my idea was right the pearls would be in madame doyles cabin tell me what did you think of the maid i wondered said race slowly if she knew more than she said ah you too had that impression i would not trust her do you think she had something to do with the murder the theft of the pearls is more probable maids have been known to be members of gangs that steal jewellery but that explanation does not quite satisfy me my other idea ought to be right but poirot stopped what about the man fleetwood asked race he may give us our solution said poirot he had a motive for revenge and it is possible that he heard the scene between mademoiselle de bellefort and monsieur doyle and removed the pistol from the public lounge without anyone noticing but that solution seems too simple too easy any other possibilities asked race plenty my friend there is for example the american trustee pennington did he accidentally meet linnet and simon doyle and accidentally have a number of papers for linnet to sign did he hope that she would sign them without reading them had he used her money for his own business i know that is the way in all detective novels but it happens my friend it happens i dont doubt it said race but madame doyle wanted to read each paper before signing and then her husband made an important remark what was that he says i sign where they tell me to sign pennington saw the importance of that if the wife died the new husband would have her fortune and he would sign anything man cher colonel i saw the thought pass through penningtons head but youve no proof said race dryly i have not might young ferguson be the one whose father was ruined by old ridgeway or theres the man im looking for hes a killer but its unlikely that he knew mrs doyle their discussion was interrupted by a knock on the door and fleetwood a big angrylooking man entered the room you wanted to see me he asked rather rudely we did said race you probably know that a murder was committed on this boat last night and i believe you had reason to feel anger against the woman who was killed a look of alarm appeared in fleetwoods eyes who told you that he shouted that lying french girl you were going to marry the girl marie but miss ridgeway discovered you were a married man already what business was it of hers my wife returned to egypt i hadnt seen her for more than six years marie wouldnt know about her if that grand lady hadnt involved herself in our business i was angry but im not a murderer i was asleep in my cabin all night and the man i share it with was too after fleetwood left race and poirot agreed that he was probably telling the truth but they would check his alibi i too slept all night remarked poirot very deeply i heard nothing at all lets hope we have more luck with the people on the right side of the boat race said as mrs allerton arrived looking quite upset its too horrible she said that lovely creature dead monsieur poirot im glad you are on board if you please a few questions you went to bed when tim and i went to our cabins early i went to bed just after half past ten i fell asleep immediately and did you hear anything during the night mrs allerton concentrated yes i think i heard a splash and someone running i had the idea that someone had fallen in but it was like a dream and then i woke up and listened and everything was quite quiet had you actually met madame doyle before asked poirot no tim had met her and id heard a lot about her through our cousin joanna southwood one more question madame if you will pardon me for asking mrs allerton smiled faintly of course did you or your family ever suffer any financial loss as a result of the business affairs of madame doyles father melhuish ridgeway mrs allerton looked very surprised oh no we dont have much but we still have the money my husband left for us tim allerton too had gone to bed early and had heard somebody running along the deck and a splash a splash was it perhaps a shot asked poirot perhaps it was a shot or a cork from a bottle there were loud voices and i thought someone was having a party but then everything went quiet and i fell asleep again miss van schuyler who entered the room with an almost poisonous expression of displeasure was next to be interviewed linnet doyles cabin lay between simon doyles and hers i do not wish to be involved in any way in this very unpleasant affair she said poirot said politely of course mademoiselle we wish to free you from unpleasantness as quickly as possible just a few questions first you went to bed last night at what time ten oclock is my usual time last night i went later because cornelia robson very rudely kept me waiting tres bie now what did you hear after you were in bed i was awakened by mrs doyles rather loud maid who said bonne nuit madame then i went to sleep again until i heard someone in mrs doyles cabin next door then someone outside on the deck and then a splash you have no idea what time this was i can tell you the time exactly i looked at my little clock and it was ten minutes past one and i know who was responsible for the splash because i got up and looked out colonel race sat up you know certainly i saw miss otterbourne leaning over the side of the boat she had just dropped something into the water i saw her face very clearly and what did her face look like mademoiselle she was very upset too emotional to see me then she walked away and i returned to bed there was a knock at the door and the captain entered he carried something in his hand weve got it colonel he said with excitement race took the package and slowly unwrapped several layers of wet velvet cloth out of it fell a cheap handkerchief with a faint pink stain on it inside was a small pearlhandled pistol i was right race said to poirot it was thrown into the water is it the pistol you saw at the cataract hotel that night poirot examined the gun carefully then he said quietly yes here are the initials jb race opened the pistol and said two bullets fired there seems no doubt that this is the murder weapon and what about my shawl demanded miss van schuyler i was asking everyone if they had seen it last night this is yours asked race picking up the wet cloth the murderer wrapped it round the pistol to soften the noise of the shot you can see the burn marks from the bullet shocking said miss van schuyler crossly miss van schuyler how well did you know mrs doyle i had never met her before her family had money but they were nobodies not our type of people when the old woman left the two men looked at each other can we believe her story asked race it does not make sense poirot cried someone shot linnet doyle and wrote the letter j on the wall we would expect that person to leave the pistol in madame doyles cabin for someone to find therefore why was the pistol thrown into the water why my friend why the series of events is impossible something is wrong shall we talk to rosalie otterbourne next race suggested when she arrived the girl looked unwilling but not nervous you know that we are making enquiries about mrs doyles death will you tell me what you did last night race asked mother and i went to bed early before eleven we heard voices outside dr bessners cabin but nothing else did you leave your cabin at all last night no definitely not miss van schuyler says that she saw you throwing something into the water at ten minutes past one its a complete lie did she see anything else no but she heard someone moving about in madame doyles cabin rosalie otterbourne now looked extremely pale do you still insist that you threw nothing into the water mademoiselle asked poirot there might be an innocent reason you see mademoiselle something was thrown into the water last night something that was not innocent race held out the shawl and showed the girl its contents kwas that what she was killed with rosalie asked nervously and you think i killed linnet doyle i dont even know her that old woman is probably half blind anyway it wasnt me she saw can i go now after she had left poirot shook his head neither of those two women was being totally honest kwell lets continue the questioning mrs otterbourne is next the novelist agreed with her daughters statement about her bedtime but she could not say whether rosalie had left their cabin or not mrs otterbourne excited by the crime itself expressed her belief that the motive was about sex and jealousy poirot explained that neither jacqueline de bellefort nor simon doyle could be the murderer but this did not stop the novelists romantic imagination of course how silly of me it was miss bowers she was probably jealous of the happy couple they had something she could never dream of having shes just the type unattractive respectable with no experience of real emotions thank you mrs otterbourne said race as he led her quickly to the door your suggestions have been very helpful ah signor richetti please come in the italian was very upset by the whole business what a terrible thing a woman so young and so beautiful he had gone to bed very early had read for some time and had turned his light out before eleven he thought he had heard a splash a few hours later but he was not sure about the time race and poirot moved on to mr ferguson who answered their questions with his usual rudeness what time did you go to bed last night asked race at about midnight but i dont have to tell you anything did you hear a shot or something like a cork yes i think i did but there were people running around a lot of noise on the deck above so im not sure what it was did you hear a splash i think i heard a splash but with all the noise i cant be sure but im sorry that i missed the opportunity to join in the good work mrs doyle did nothing for the world after ferguson left poirot asked you dont think he is the man you are looking for i dont think so i quite like him but one job at a time lets talk to pennington andrew pennington walked into the room wearing a black tie gentlemen he said sadly this business has really shocked me little linnet race said mr pennington did you hear anything last night i heard some noise outside dr bessners cabin at about midnight hes next door at number forty but it didnt mean anything to me at the time after that i went to sleep and didnt hear anything else of course you know thered been an affair between simon doyle and that girl jacqueline de bellefort in the past cherchez lafemme thats always a good rule but you see it is quite impossible that jacqueline de bellefort shot madame doyle said poirot explaining that the nurse had been with her all night and so monsieur we must still find the murderer and we hope you will be able to help us you knew more about her than her new husband did you would perhaps know if she had any enemies pennington passed his tongue over rather drylooking lips and said nervously i have no idea she was brought up in england and i know very little of her life there but there was someone on the boat who wanted to remove madame doyle you remember that she had a fortunate escape when the rock almost hit her but you were not there perhaps asked poirot no i was inside the temple at the time i heard about it afterwards of course possibly an accident dont you think pennington wiped his face with an expensive handkerchief race went on mr doyle says that someone on the boat had a complaint against her family a former friend of her fathers ive no idea about that said pennington looking surprised im very sorry that i cant help you after pennington had left race lit a cigarette and said mr pennington was not at all comfortable and poirot added he was nervous enough to tell a rather stupid lie he was not in the temple of abu simbel when the rock fell i can swear to that i had just come from there but for now we will treat him gently we understand each other very well my friend said race i think the next problem to solve is mrs doyles pearls you have a plan yes at the end of lunch i will make an announcement that the pearls have been stolen i will ask everyone to stay in the diningroom while we search the boat we do not want to give the thief an opportunity to get rid of the pearls good we now know a lot about our murder suspects but i ask myself one question why was the pistol thrown into the water thats your only question asked race at the moment yes that must be our starting point tell me about the pistol you know more about guns than i do would miss van schuylers velvet shawl silence the sound of a shot no it wouldnt said race even without the shawl that pistol would make very little noise that is what i expected and this stained handkerchief definitely a mans and very inexpensive perhaps for a man like fleetwood or ferguson suggested race ah yes but quite a jeunefille colour is it not said poirot but it is odd cette pauvre madame doyle lying there so peacefully with the little hole in her head you remember how she looked race looked at him curiously i think youre trying to tell me something but i have no idea what it is chapter five the truth is discovered poirot soon received a call to simon doyles bedside monsieur poirot would you mind asking jackie to come here to see me shes only a child and i treated her badly and poirot found the girl in the public lounge she looked surprised by simons request and followed poirot like a puzzled child in dr bessners cabin she stared at simon unable to speak jackie simon began i wanted to say simon jacqueline interrupted you know i didnt kill linnet i i was mad last night can you forgive me your leg you might never walk again jackie stop worrying and dont exaggerate the doctors will take care of me when we get to assuan ill be as good as new jacqueline rushed forward and knelt by simons bed burying her face and crying softly simon seemed embarrassed as he left bessners cabin poirot heard jackie whisper how could i be such a devil oh simon im so awfully sorry then outside on the deck he heard a line of another conversation ungrateful daughter after all ive done for you poirot knocked at the door of the otterbournes cabin rosalie appeared looking very pale with dark circles under her eyes may i have the pleasure of a few minutes conversation mademoiselle they walked along the deck well she asked crossly mademoiselle as a friend i am very worried about you the weight of your secrets will harm you i dont know what youre talking about mademoiselle i know that your mother drinks and i am guessing that she found a way to hide her bottles of alcohol from you but you discovered them last night you waited until she was asleep and then threw the bottles into the nile i am right am i not yes rosalie whispered sadly ive tried so hard to protect her her books dont sell any more people are tired of all that cheap sex stuff it hurt her terribly and so she began to drink then she began to dislike me because i tried to stop her paiwre petite said poirot dont feel sorry for me its easier if youre not but im so tired and youre so kind and im afraid ive been so rude to you la politesse it is not necessary between friends but i have two more questions at what time did you throw the bottles into the river and did you see mademoiselle van schuyler i think it was after one oclock but i saw nobody monsieur poirot thought about rosalies answers as he walked slowly towards the diningroom for lunch tim allerton was already at the table with his mother why did we come on this awful trip he complained i dont know agreed mrs allerton sadly that beautiful girl such a waste and the other one so terribly unhappy jacqueline perhaps she will learn not to fire pistols at people now were all involved in a murder case complained tim the police will be waiting to question us at shellal or assuan were all suspects and ferguson told me that linnets pearls are missing her pearls i suppose that was the motive for the murder why mother youre mixing up two quite different things poirot joined the allertons apologizing for being late he sat down and ordered a bottle of wine we have fixed habits mrs allerton noted you always drink wine tim drinks beer and i drink water but we were talking about linnets pearls ferguson told tim that they have been stolen tim worries that it will mean more unpleasantness for all of us poirot turned to tim and said ah you have had previous experience perhaps you have been in a house where there has been a robbery never said tim oh yes darling you were at the portarlingtons when that awful womans diamonds were stolen reminded his mother mother you always get things wrong i was there when they discovered that the diamonds she was wearing were false the real ones had probably been stolen months before some people even thought she had sold them herself did joanna suggest that she knew them quite well she wasnt there that weekend mother tim said quietly poirot politely changed the subject and talked about sending some gifts back to england can i depend on the post between here and england have you had any experience of it tim gets books sometimes and has no trouble with them ah no books are different commented poirot after coffee had been served colonel race stood up explained that mrs doyles pearls were missing and asked everyone to stay in the diningroom while the boat was searched race and poirot waited on the deck they expected someone to come out but were surprised a few minutes later when miss bowers came to the door of the diningroom and asked to speak to them they went to the office very calmly the nurse said i want to return these she took out a string of pearls and laid them on the table this is most extraordinary race said as he picked up the pearls will you kindly explain miss bowers of course i hesitated because i had to think of the family but i could not be found with the pearls in my possession did you take the pearls from mrs doyles cabin me oh no miss van schuyler did she cant help it and she never admits that shes taken anything she usually takes jewellery and pearls are her favourite its my job to watch her she always hides the things she takes in her underwear drawer so i check the drawer every morning and return things to their owners i found these this morning but when i tried to return them to mrs doyles cabin there was a guard and it was impossible she looked worried thank you for coming to us so quickly said poirot but please one more question miss van schuyler has problems you say is it possible for her to commit murder miss bowers answer came immediately oh no nothing of that kind the old lady wouldnt hurt a fly poirot had a final question is miss van schuyler at all deaf do you think for example that she could hear someone moving about in the cabin next to hers in mrs doyles cabin as a matter of fact she is quite deaf monsieur poirot i dont think she could hear anything at all when miss bowers had returned to the diningroom race said miss van schuyler must be a suspect now did she murder mrs doyle to get the pearls i doubt it but i think she did see rosalie otterbourne but i dont think she heard anything in linnet doyles cabin i think she was just watching for her chance to go in and take the pearls but if mrs doyle was shot at about ten minutes past one when the boat was very quiet i am amazed that no one heard the shot of course her husbands cabin was empty and miss van schuyler is deaf that leaves only the cabin next to her on the other side of the boat in other words pennington i am promising myself the pleasure of asking him a few more questions said poirot but first the pearls poirot examined the pearls carefully he held them up to the light he even bit one of them then he threw them on the table another complication my friend he said these pearls are not real they are only a clever copy are you positive asked race picking them up yes i am certain i was admiring madame doyles pearls the first evening on the boat they were beautiful and very real could miss bowers and miss van schuyler be clever jewel thieves pretending to be part of a rich american family it is difficult to say but it would take careful planning and skill to copy madame doyles pearls it could not be done in a hurry the person who made the copy had a good opportunity of studying the original so now weve got to find the real pearls poirot and race searched the cabins carefully even their own most cabins contained what they had expected but there were a few surprises mr fergusons outer clothing was torn and dirty but his underwear and handkerchiefs were of very good quality tim allertons cabin contained several pieces of religious art including a big wooden rosary the two men searched both simons and linnets cabins very carefully for clues to the theft but also to the murder in linnets room poirot noticed two little bottles of fingernail polish one labelled rose had only a drop or two of dark red liquid at the bottom the other labelled cardinal was nearly full poirot opened both bottles and the smell of pear drops filled the room there is something a little curious here said poirot i must ask the maid i wonder where she is said race in dr bessners cabin they found simon doyle looking feverish and much worse than earlier he was surprised that they wanted to search bessners cabin but poirot explained anyone could come into this room and hide something when you are asleep the next cabin was penningtons where they found a case full of legal and business documents these seem to be all right commented poirot yes agreed race but perhaps he destroyed any papers that connected him to murder or theft poirot lifted a heavy pistol from a drawer looked at it and put it back it seems that many people still travel with guns but linnet doyle wasnt shot with something that size race paused and then added i have an idea about the murder weapon perhaps the murderer left it in linnets cabin and then someone else took it away and threw it into the river yes but who was that second person the only other person who we know went into the cabin was mademoiselle van schuyler would she remove the pistol for what reason to protect jacqueline de bellefort it does not seem likely perhaps she was worried when she saw her shawl and threw it and its contents into the river suggested race it is not a satisfactory solution said poirot as they left linnets cabin i must have a few more words with simon doyle monsieur poirot im glad you have returned simon said im perfectly sure that linnets pearls were all right yesterday she loved them she would recognise a copy that is probably true but the copy was very good tell me did madame doyle ever lend the pearls to a friend i hadnt known linnet very long but she was generous with her things perhaps she let friends wear them sometimes she never for example lent them to jacqueline de bellefort simon turned red and tried to sit up but fell back on the bed jackie is not a thief i swear she isnt i see my suggestion has excited your anger poirot remembered a girls voice by the nile in assuan saying i love simon and he loves me perhaps her words were closer to the truth than anything else that poirot had heard that night race came to the door and reported that the passengers in the diningroom had been searched nothing unusual had been found the italian gentleman complained about the search something about his honour and hes also carrying a gun a big automatic richetti has a hot temper said simon he was upset and rude to linnet at wadi haifa because of a mistake over a telegram and miss rosalie otterbourne had a little pistol in her handbag a very small one with a pearl handle race reported so many guns on this boat and louise bourget shes disappeared said race and shes one person who had time to copy the pearls lets have a look at her cabin poirot and race went to the deck below and found louise bourgets cabin in quite a mess they looked through everything carefully and then races attention was attracted by a shoe that he could see half under the bed he whistled softly questce quil у a asked poirot miss bourget hasnt disappeared shes here under the bed a knife wound to the heart death was immediate probably about an hour ago but lets find bessner poirot bent down and picked up the right hand he removed the corner of a hundredpound note and showed it to race blackmail said race she knew who the murderer was we have been fools cried poirot she did hear something in the night came up and saw the murderer leaving madame doyles cabin she saw her chance to make a lot of money but what happened here the murderer gave her the money and watched her as she counted it then he struck took the money and escaped not noticing that one of the notes was torn we may get him that way suggested race doubtfully no said poirot i think this murderer has courage and intelligence he will notice the note and throw it away after examining the body dr bessner showed poirot and race one of his own medical knives this is the type of knife that killed mademoiselle bourget it is long and thin and very sharp and none of your knives are missing doctor asked race of course not do you believe that i with my important patients and my fame would murder a worthless maid race and poirot left quietly and monsieur poirot turned to the left he heard laughter coming from rosalie otterbournes cabin and saw her and jacqueline de bellefort chatting together you are talking about scandal mesdemoiselles no of course not said rosalie we were comparing lipsticks but jacqueline had noticed poirots serious expression and asked has something happened what has happened now you are correct there has been another death watching them carefully poirot saw alarm and fear in rosalies eyes then as the detective had expected the girl reacted nervously when he described the murder he led her out to the deck why do you not tell me all the truth mademoiselle what do you mean i told you everything this morning you did not tell me that you carry a little pistol in your handbag and you did not tell me all that you saw last night i havent got a pistol here look in my handbag poirot opened rosalies bag no it is not there you were wrong and youre wrong about the other thing no i do not think so i think you saw a man come out of linnet doyles cabin last night you watched him walk along the deck and enter one of the two end cabins am i right mademoiselle rosalie hesitated then her lips opened i saw nobody jacqueline saw miss bowers come out of dr bessners cabin and rushed over to speak to her how is simon she demanded is he going to die he should be in hospital said the nurse hes had too much excitement today and his temperature has risen again poirot saw jacquelines face and guided her into her cabin she sat on her bed with tears running down her cheeks hell die and i killed him and i love him so too much whispered poirot to himself remembering his thoughts in monsieur blondins restaurant many months ago the girls eyes brightened simon will go to hospital and theyll give him the proper treatment and everything will be all right you speak like a child and they lived happily ever after no monsieur nothing like that simon is just sorry for me now because he knows how sorry i am that i hurt him so badly pity is a generous reaction poirot said sympathetically colonel race met poirot on the deck poirot ive got an idea theres something about the italians telegram yes the telegram is important poirot said thoughtfully you have an idea too it is more than an idea i am sure it is clear so clear but there are difficulties but first let us examine the matter of the telegram we must talk to monsieur doyle one more time dr bessner was not happy to see race and poirot again but he left and simon asked what is it race said tell us again about signor richetti and the telegram when we came back from the second cataract linnet saw a telegram on the board the writing was not clear and she thought it was for ridgeway so she opened it signor richetti saw her and pulled it out of her hand very rudely and do you know what was in the telegram yes linnet read some of it aloud it said simon paused there was a lot of noise outside the cabin where are monsieur poirot and colonel race a woman shouted i must speak to them immediately i have important information bessner had not closed the door mrs otterbourne pushed the curtain to one side and entered the room like a tropical storm she was shaky on her legs her face was red and she could not completely control her words but in a clear theatrical voice she announced mr doyle i know who killed your wife the three men stared at her i saw the person who killed louise bourget so i know who also killed mrs doyle simon feverish shouted loudly please mrs otterbourne start at the beginning you know who killed louise bourget mrs otterbourne looked proudly at her audience enjoying the idea that she would be famous for solving the mystery i was on my way to the diningroom when i remembered that i had arranged to er meet someone i left my daughter and went along the lower deck the curtain across the door moved again but no one noticed then a grey metal object appeared between the curtain and the door the girl louise bourget looked out of her cabin but seemed disappointed to see me and closed her door again i continued to my meeting bought er what i had ordered and turned round as i walked along the deck i saw someone knock on miss bourgets door and go inside race said and that person was bang mrs otterbourne fell to the floor with a crash from just behind her ear the blood poured from a neat round hole poirot made a catlike jump for the door and saw a big heavy gun on the floor racing towards the front of the boat he met tim allerton who was hurrying round the corner what was that cried tim breathlessly did you meet anyone on your way here asked poirot meet anyone no they found a crowd gathered at the door of bessners cabin rosalie jacqueline cornelia ferguson fanthorp and mrs allerton i think weve seen this gun recently said race he knocked on the door of penningtons cabin but there was no answer race went in and checked the top drawer the gun was gone he and poirot found pennington on the deck below he was in a small sittingroom writing letters he lifted his face anything new he asked didnt you hear a shot well now you mention it i believe i heard a kind of bang but i didnt imagine whos been shot mrs otterbourne with your gun gentlemen ive been here for the last twenty minutes anyway how could i go to the deck above shoot this poor woman and come down here again with no one seeing me how do you explain the fact that your gun was used well im afraid that one evening in the public lounge i mentioned that i always carry a gun with me when i travel but why would anyone want to shoot mrs otterbourne she said that she had seen someone go into louise bourgets cabin before she could name the person she was shot dead pennington wiped his face with a very fine handkerchief poirot said i need to discuss a few more points with you sir will you come to my cabin in half an hours time i would be delighted he stood up and left the room he didnt look very delighted race said poirot went on deck and found a group of passengers discussing recent events monsieur poirot began cornelia how did the person who shot mrs otterbourne get away without us seeing him ah said poirot we know he didnt go to the left or to the right but there was one more possibility everyone looked confused and then jacqueline said of course he couldnt go up but he could go down poirot smiled you have brains mademoiselle the murderer could avoid the inside passage by jumping to the deck below amazing i suppose hed have to be wonderfully quick said cornelia three deaths its like living in a bad dream ferguson heard her and spoke to her angrily its the future that matters not the past those three women were not important linnet doyle and her money a french maid looking after her needs a novelist with tired old ideas i think its a good thing that theyre dead youre wrong cornelia shouted at him those three women were loved by someone and linnet doyle when anything so beautiful is dead its a loss to the whole world youre unbelievable ferguson said he turned to poirot do you know sir that cornelias father was almost ruined by melhuish ridgeway but does she hate his daughter when she meets her no she admires her beauty she forgives everything i didnt forgive her immediately said cornelia softly daddy was very unhappy when he died but didnt you just say that we should be concerned with the future not the past all that was in the past wasnt it you have understood me said ferguson cornelia robson youre the nicest woman ive ever met will you marry me youre crazy i am perfectly serious and monsieur poirot is my witness for you i will even accept the conditions of a marriage contract never you laugh at all sorts of serious things education art culture and death i could never trust you cornelia said red faced rushing off to her cabin i think she really means it said ferguson then he looked at poirot whats the matter you seem deep in thought monsieur ferguson you are a very rude young man yes but what do you think of that girl shes got spirit hasnt she perhaps i can get to her through her old cousin he left to find miss van schuyler poirot followed he sat in the public lounge at a distance from ferguson and miss van schuyler but he could hear their conversation clearly miss van schuyler i want to marry your cousin this suggestion is beyond consideration young man the old lady said you are obviously not good enough for her you have no social position now go away ive got two arms two legs good health and a reasonable brain thats more important than a social position ferguson smiled and walked calmly out of the lounge poirot spoke to the old woman hes a bit strange most of the family are you recognised him i suppose calls himself ferguson and wont use his title because of his political ideas his title asked miss van schuyler sharply yes thats young lord dawlish very wealthy graduated from oxford university rather extreme ideas now though poirot could almost see the thoughts going through miss van schuylers brain before she left the lounge poirots own thoughts became serious again mais oui he said at last it all fits colonel race found him sitting alone my dear friend poirot said please bring young fanthorp here when fanthorp was sitting in front of him poirot began his questions monsieur i have an impression of you because i understand a little about english gentlemen i know that there are things which are done and things which are not done jim fanthorp smiled i believe that one thing which is not done is to listen to other peoples private conversations but the other day i observed as you listened to a conversation between the doyles and mr pennington you interrupted them and gave madame doyle some advice about signing legal documents that is not what a gentleman would do also you work for a small law firm near wode hall and i doubt that you can afford this trip so what is the reason for your presence on this boat remember that there have been three murders fanthorp seemed unable to speak if i add that the weapon used to kill madame otterbourne was a gun owned by andrew pennington will you understand that it is your duty to tell us all you can fanthorp thought for a moment and then spoke my uncle mrs doyles english lawyer suspected that mrs doyles american trustee mr pennington had been using her money for his own profit in plain language said race your uncle suspected that pennington had stolen it yes in a letter mrs doyle told us that she had met pennington by accident while on her honeymoon i was sent to watch them because neither mrs doyle nor mr pennington knew me on the occasion you mentioned i had to behave badly but i was satisfied with the result another question said poirot who would it be easier to cheat madame doyle or her husband mr doyle said fanthorp with a smile he would trust his advisers and sign anything they gave him i agree said poirot he looked at race theres a motive and i think we may get the proof from pennington himself thank you for your help mr fanthorp two minutes later andrew pennington appeared mr pennington we know that you had known linnet since she was a small child and that you and her father were close friends so close in fact that on his death you were appointed as trustee to the enormous fortune he left her yes pennington answered cautiously my partner and i linnet would take control of her fortune worth millions on her twentyfirst birthday or when she married pennington said angrily this is none of your business and i dont understand the relationship between this and linnets murder poirot leaned forward his eyes green and catlike in considering motives financial matters are always important i was wondering if mademoiselle ridgeways marriage caused alarm in your office perhaps her financial affairs were not in perfect order and you hurried to cairo to meet her accidentally thats crazy i didnt even know that linnet was married until i met her in cairo i was totally surprised her letter reached new york after i had departed on the carmanic it is strange said poirot that the only recent labels on your luggage of a voyage across the atlantic are from the normandie which i remember sailed two days after the carmanic weve good reason for believing that you received mrs doyles letter before you left new york said race pennington sat down youre too clever for me gentlemen but i had my reasons for lying to you i think linnets english lawyers were stealing money from her i came over to check but why did you lie about the letter from mrs doyle well i didnt want to turn their honeymoon into a business trip so i made the meeting accidental and i didnt know anything about this doyle perhaps he was part of the theft poirot leaned forwards monsieur we believe that linnet ridgeways unexpected marriage put you in a difficult financial position you hurried to cairo to get her signature on some important documents but you failed then at abu simbel you pushed a large rock down towards her but you missed your object then you had another unexpected opportunity on the return journey if madame doyle were murdered everyone would suspect mademoiselle de bellefort and we know that your gun killed mrs otterbourne who was prepared to tell us the name of the person she believed had killed both women are you crazy i wouldnt gain anything from linnets death her money goes to her husband hes the one with a motive race said coldly doyle was shot that night he couldnt even stand up without help he couldnt leave the lounge and kill someone as you say doyle would receive his wifes fortune but he knows nothing about her financial affairs he would trust her old advisors i think you would gain from such circumstances are you ready to tell us the truth penningtons hands were shaking but before he left the room he said you dont understand the stock market went mad but with a little luck everything will be ok by the end of june i am innocent gentlemen i did not push that rock at abu simbel on purpose it was an accident and i did not shoot linnet alone again race said to poirot we got more from pennington than i expected we can connect him to the rock and to a motive for mrs doyles murder but theres no proof no proof yet said poirot rather mysteriously but there is my conversation with mademoiselle de bellefort in the garden at assuan tim allertons and louise bourgets answers to our questions two bottles of nail polish my bottle of wine the shawl the handkerchief with the pink stain the deaths of louise and mrs otterbourne the gun left at the scene of the last murder one thing is clear pennington didnt do it what pennington is clever and he had the motive he even tried to murder her but he is not bold enough this crime was dangerous and needed courage and speed and imagination race looked at him with the respect one able man gives to another so youve solved it i think so but there are one or two things that i must find out well need to speak to tim allerton again tim allerton came quickly when he was sent for at our first meeting mr allerton poirot said seriously you mentioned mademoiselle joanna southwood after studying several cases a friend of mine a detective at scotland yard has recently connected her with certain jewellery thefts mademoiselle southwood visits her wealthy friends borrows a piece of jewellery has it copied and returns the original after some time when she is far away her partner visits the same person exchanges the copy for the real piece and leaves with the other jewellery no one notices for some time and so the two thieves are unlikely to be connected to the crime i believe you are joanna southwoods partner the missing ring in majorca a house party when another piece of jewellery disappeared your dislike of your mothers friendship with me and then the copy of madame doyles pearls is returned to us we had to wonder where the real pearls were didnt we tim allerton went very pale you have no proof that im a thief poirot answered slowly i have a good idea that the pearls are hidden in your rosary i am guessing that mademoiselle southwood had them copied some time ago she knew about the doyles honeymoon and sent the copy to you inside a book there was long pause then tim said quietly you win its been a good game but i know its finished now do you realise that you were seen last night when you went into madame doyles cabin to steal the pearls listen im a thief not a murderer who saw me rosalie otterbourne saw you leave linnet doyles cabin just after one in the morning so it was she who told you tim said rather sadly poirot said gently excuse me she did not tell me i am hercule poirot i do not need to be told rosalie otterbourne lied she said i saw nobody she wanted to protect you tim said a different note in his voice shes an extraordinary girl shes been through some difficult times with her mother but now you know about the pearls what are you going to do poirot asked race to bring rosalie otterbourne to their meeting when she arrived looking anxious poirot said i know that monsieur allerton is not the murderer and if you continue to say you saw nobody last night there is no case against him poirot turned to tim allerton monsieur allerton the copy of madame doyles pearls is in a little box on the table by the door perhaps you would like to examine them tim got up he understood what poirot was saying thanks he said you wont have to give me another chance he picked up the little box as he and rosalie left the room when he was outside he opened it took out the false pearls and threw them into the nile there he said theyre gone when i return the box to poirot the real string of pearls will be inside ive been a terrible fool but why did you do it how did i start tim said i was bored and lazy and i enjoyed the risk i suppose youd never steal would you no i dont think so but i think i understand youre so lovely why didnt you say youd seen me last night i thought they might suspect you and i knew you werent a murderer she put out a shy hand and touched his arm rosalie would you you know what i mean or will you always hate me for being a thief she smiled ive done things im ashamed of too but this joanna is she special to you i dont care about joanna shes a most unattractive woman back in the public lounge race was becoming impatient with his friend do you know who committed the three murders on this boat or dont you we know it wasnt pennington or young allerton or i suppose fleetwood please tell me who it was but at that moment cornelia and dr bessner came in the girl had just heard about her cousins habit of stealing things and wanted to be sure that it would remain a secret it would destroy the family if people knew she said dr bessner says that theres a wonderful treatment for this condition dont worry said race with a humourless smile were very good at keeping secrets dr bessner said poirot how is your patient he is doing well but still this miss de bellefort worries about him all day why one minute she shoots him the next she is worried whether he will live or die he turned to cornelia if you loved a man you would not shoot him no you are sensible race interrupted this interesting and affectionate scene since doyle is all right can i interview him again he was telling us about a telegram ho ho ho that was very funny doyle told me it was a telegram all about vegetables potatoes beans onions my god race said its richetti those words were used in the south african war potatoes mean machine guns beans mean bombs richetti is a very dangerous man hes killed more than once and hell kill again is he our man richetti is your man poirot said but he did not kill linnet doyle i have half of the proof i need to point to her murderer but i must wait for the other half but arent you going to tell us cried cornelia mais oui he said i like an audience i like to say see how clever hercule poirot is well said race gently how clever is hercule poirot at first i was very stupid i could not understand why jacqueline de belleforts pistol had been taken away from the scene of the crime finally i understood the murderer took it away because he had to take it away because he had not finished with it poirot leaned towards race you and i my friend decided that linnet doyles murderer had seen a chance and had acted without much planning knowing that everyone would blame jacqueline de bellefort for the murder after what had happened between her and simon doyle but if that idea is wrong the whole case changes every detail of the crime even putting a strong sleeping drug in my wine was very carefully planned and accurately timed long before the karnak began its journey up the nile my first clue was when the pistol wrapped in miss van schuylers shawl was pulled from the nile if the murderer wanted to point the finger at mademoiselle de bellefort he had to leave the pistol in madame doyles cabin poirot turned towards dr bessner you dr bessner told us that the skin around the bullet hole on linnet doyles head was burned and black but this would not have happened if the pistol had been wrapped in a shawl but a bullet from the pistol had been fired through the shawl jacqueline certainly did not use the shawl when she fired the pistol at simon it appeared therefore that a third shot had been fired one we knew nothing about that was difficult to explain then in linnet doyles cabin i found two nail polish bottles but when i smelled the contents i found that one contained nail polish and the other contained red ink it suggested a connection with the handkerchief with the pink stain which had been wrapped round the pistol red ink washes out quickly but always leaves a pale pink stain and the picture became even clearer when louise bourget was murdered this morning i asked her if she had seen anything the previous night her answer was unusually long and complicated what did that tell us that she had climbed the stairs suggested race no it told me that she was sending a message to someone in the room i knew that the message was not for me or you race so it had to be for dr bessner or for simon doyle mademoiselle bourget could easily speak to you dr bessner in private but this was the only time she could speak to monsieur doyle she wanted him to understand her message and to tell her not to worry and he did but mr doyle wasnt in mrs doyles cabin it was impossible for him to leave the lounge with the wound to his leg said dr bessner impossible i know but he did it was the only logical meaning to louise bourgets words then i remembered that there had been five minutes when simon was alone in the lounge before dr bessner arrived during that time what do we know about simon doyles injury two people see mademoiselle de bellefort fire her pistol they also see simon doyle fall across a chair and put a handkerchief against his leg the handkerchief turns red then mr doyle insists that mademoiselle robson takes mademoiselle de bellefort to her cabin and he asks fanthorp to find dr bessner when he is alone simon acts quickly he picks up the pistol from under the sofa takes off his shoes runs to his wifes cabin shoots her in the head leaves the bottle with red ink beside her bottle of nail polish runs back to the lounge picks up mademoiselle van schuylers shawl which he has hidden in his chair wraps it around the pistol and shoots himself in the leg he falls into the chair near a window and throws the pistol wrapped in the handkerchief and the shawl into the nile impossible said race not impossible remember that tim allerton heard a pop followed by a splash and he heard the sound of a man running past his door it was simon doyle running past his cabin race objected its impossible doyle couldnt think that quickly he hasnt got the brains for it but he has the body for quick actions someone else did the thinking for him it was a very cleverly planned piece of work it could not be by chance that simon doyle had a bottle of red ink in his pocket it was not chance that jacqueline de belleforts foot kicked the pistol under the sofa where it would be forgotten until later jacqueline certainly the two halves of the murder the shot fired by jacqueline gave simon his alibi simons insistence that she should not be left alone gave jacqueline hers her brains his speed and timing if you realise that they are still lovers it is all clear simon goes away with his rich wife kills her gets her money and after a certain amount of time marries his true love everything was part of their plan jacqueline following the new couple simons pretended anger and he was too affectionate towards his wife in public not like an ordinary englishman and when jacqueline told me that someone was in the shadows listening to our conversation there was no one then one night on this boat i heard simons voice outside my cabin he was saying weve got to go on with it now it was doyle but he was speaking to jacqueline not to linnet the final scene was perfectly planned and timed there was a sleeping drug in my wine there were honest witnesses to see jacqueline shoot simon then when the doctor arrived he really had been shot but then the plan goes wrong louise bourget has been unable to sleep she comes up the stairs and sees simon doyle enter his wifes cabin and come out again she understands what has happened when she sees the dead madame doyle the next morning she asks for money she knows everything so she cannot live but it would be impossible for simon doyle to kill her cornelia objected yes but simon asked to see jacqueline and wanted to speak to her alone he told her about this new danger so jacqueline killed louise bourget with one of dr bessners knives before lunch and returned the knife before dr bessner noticed then when madame otterbourne tried to tell us that she had seen jacqueline on the lower deck simon shouted at her he was warning jacqueline she remembered penningtons talk about a pistol ran to his room found the gun and shot madame otterbourne she was very quick and her cabin was only two doors from dr bessners so she did not go to the left or the right or up or down she simply dropped the gun and ran into her own cabin appearing when everyone rushed out to see what had happened there was a silence and then race asked what happened to the first bullet fired at doyle by the girl i think it went into the table and doyle removed it when he was alone and threw it out of the window he had of course an extra bullet so that it would appear that only two shots had been fired cornelia said they thought of everything its horrible poirot was silent his eyes seemed to be saying you are wrong they did not take into consideration hercule poirot much later that evening hercule poirot knocked on the door of jacqueline de belleforts cabin he asked the guard to wait outside well jacqueline said you were too clever for us you took simon by surprise and he told you everything she paused im not a safe person now killing people is so terribly easy you begin to feel that its only you that matters you told me not to open my heart to evil that was the moment to stop it was still possible simon and i loved each other and for you love was enough but not for him yes simon wanted money so desperately for horses boats sport hes like a child he wants things so much but he didnt try to get money by marrying a rich wife we met and we wanted a future together he tried to be a successful businessman but he failed then i thought i could get him a job at my dear friends new house but linnet ignored our friendship and tried to steal simon from me thats why im not sorry about her even now simon didnt even like her he thought she was goodlooking but terribly bossy one day he said if i had any luck id marry her and shed die in about a year and leave me the money then i found him reading about poisons he had decided to kill her but i knew he couldnt make it work so i had to help him we planned the details giving each other an alibi and it worked yes said poirot but louise bourget couldnt sleep that night i cant believe that i did that but simon and i were safe except for that blackmailing girl i gave her all the money we could find and while she counted it i did it it was horribly horribly easy but even then we werent safe mrs otterbourne had seen me but that time i had to act extremely quickly it was almost exciting she stopped talking for a moment dont worry about me monsieur poirot if we had won id have been very happy and enjoyed things without regrets poirot got up jacqueline rose too she said with a sudden smile do you remember when i said i must follow my star you warned me that it might be a false star he went out to the deck with her laughter ringing in his ears it was early dawn when they came into shellal poirot whispered to himself quel pays sauvage race stood beside him richetti will be taken to shore first then the medical people will come for doyle he deserves to be hanged but i feel a bit sorry for the girl poirot shook his head people say love excuses everything but it is dangerous to love as she loved simon doyle it is what i said when i saw her first she cares too much that little оnе as cornelia robson joined them on the deck miss van schuyler moved slowly towards them shouting cornelia why arent you helping me i want to go directly home cornelia took a deep breath im not going home cousin im going to get married so youre being sensible at last said the old lady yes but im not going to marry ferguson im going to marry dr bessner hes kind and knows a lot ive always been interested in sick people and their problems and i shall have a wonderful life with him the boat landed and after richetti had been marched off simon doyle was carried along the deck jacqueline de bellefort followed behind with a guard at her side hello simon she said simons face brightened for a moment i lost my head and admitted everything jackie sorry its all right simon a fools game and we lost thats all she bent down to tie her shoe and when she stood up again she had something in her hand there was a sharp pop simon doyle shook once and then lay still jacqueline stood for a minute pistol in hand and gave poirot a quick smile then she turned the little gun against her heart and fired she fell to the floor beside simon doyle where did she get that pistol shouted race poirot felt a hand on his arm you knew mrs allerton said i realised that she had a pair of pistols when one was found in rosalie otterbournes handbag jacqueline put it there when we announced our search later she went to rosalies cabin for a chat and got it back mrs allerton said you wanted her to take that way out yes admitted poirot but she would not take it alone and so simon doyle has died an easier death than he deserved love can be a very frightening thing that is why most great love stories are tragedies said poirot mrs allerton looked at her son and rosalie otterbourne who were standing together in the sunlight but thank god there is happiness in the world when the karnak reached shore the whole world heard about the death of the famous beautiful and wealthy linnet doyle sir george wode read about it in his london club sterndale rockford in his new york office and joanna southwood in switzerland and in the pub in maltonunderwode mr burnaby said rather accurately well it doesnt seem to have done her much good poor girl but soon they stopped talking about her and discussed horseracing because as mr ferguson was saying at that minute in egypt it is not the past that matters but the future the end
