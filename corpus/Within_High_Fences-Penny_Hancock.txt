 chapter one night work there was nothing different about that night it was the same as every other night i thought but that night my life started to change i didnt know it then but i know it now it was a january evening and it was cold and dark i was leaving to go to work and i was wearing my uniform tom my boyfriend was watching a dvd bye tom i said he didnt answer tom you know i dont like you working at night he said he said this every night he kissed me but the kiss felt cold i walked out of the front door we lived in a comfortable new house in greenwich south east london i thought i knew who i was i thought i knew what i wanted i had tom my man he was older than me tall with blond hair and blue eyes he liked buying me things clothes shoes jewellery expensive things for my eighteenth birthday he gave me a gold watch we met when i was at school i wanted to be a writer then tom laughed at me he told me writers were intelligent youre not intelligent he said youre beautiful but youre not intelligent and i believed him i moved in with him when i finished school i didnt think about the rest of my life i thought i was in love tom was all i wanted that night i started the car and drove through the dark it was very cold as i drove i thought about tom i put my hand up to my face i could feel his cold kiss on my cheek tom said the night was his time with me he said i didnt need to work it wasnt a great job but i liked the money and i liked shopping now i could buy the things i wanted for the first time in my life i was earning some money for the first time in my life i didnt need tom for everything chapter two within high fences i arrived at work i showed my identity card to the guards and drove through the gates i stopped my car got out and walked to the next gates i showed my identity card again to some more guards then they opened the gates and let me in i was now at work i worked in a centre for asylum seekers people who want to live in great britain because of bad problems in their countries when i first started working as a guard i didnt know much about asylum seekers now i was beginning to understand more about the people i was guarding sometimes asylum seekers come to this country because there is terrible fighting in their countries and they are afraid asylum seekers come here because they hope they will have a better life in britain when they arrive asylum seekers wait to know who can stay and who must go home to their countries sometimes the asylum seekers wait in the centre for days sometimes for weeks and sometimes for months we were all locked in together at the end of every nights work i could go home but the asylum seekers had to stay in the centre when you have a lot of people together in one place you have to have rules rules tell people what they can and cant do i didnt always agree with the rules but i had to make sure everybody followed them it was my job i went to the dining room dinner was finished but there was nowhere else to go most of the asylum seekers spent their time here but there was nothing to do the tables and chairs and walls were grey i walked around the dining room and looked at all the faces some of them were very sad some were just tired and afraid i wanted to make them feel better i tried to smile but when they saw my uniform they looked away to them my uniform said i am not your friend people were waiting for a cup of tea or coffee and a biscuit bill one of the other guards was watching them i saw a woman at a table she had a little boy with her they both looked really sad really tired do you want some tea or coffee i asked the woman she didnt understand i began to speak again but there was a shout the woman and the child looked up they looked really afraid bill was shouting at a tall man put it back he shouted i saw you you were stealing the tall man had black hair and dark eyes he looked down at bill steal he said yes said bill you took something that wasnt yours the tall man looked at the two biscuits in his hand but this is a biscuit said the man angrily it isnt something expensive you can only have one biscuit its the rules you took two said bill but this biscuit isnt for me said the tall man its for that boy he looked at the little boy with the woman the boy was afraid to take a biscuit he was afraid of the rules there are so many rules here yes said bill and you have to follow the rules the tall man wasnt afraid of bills words he turned and walked away he gave the two biscuits to the boy and smiled it was a beautiful smile the boy was too tired to smile back he ate the biscuits quickly one two he was very hungry the man smiled at the boy again and i smiled at the man the tall man looked at me for a moment and stopped smiling then he turned his back to me i wanted to tell him i was a friend but my uniform said something different it said i am not a friend it said i agree with all these rules the tall man saw my uniform and he understood what it said but that night my heart was saying something very different to my uniform chapter three talking to george i finished work at eight oclock the next morning and drove to the supermarket i wanted some fruit i always wanted to eat good things after working in the asylum centre at work everything was grey but outside there was so much colour at work i thought the only beautiful thing was the tall mans face i bought some fruit and drove home sometimes when i got home from work tom was still angry with me but today he wasnt there he was at work i was happy to have the house to myself i looked at all my things i looked at the clothes and the shoes in the bedroom the big expensive television in the living room my beautiful watch what did all these things say about me nancy richardson the asylum seekers didnt have many things did i need all these things i didnt know any more i put my favourite music on the cd player i could see the tall mans face looking at me he wasnt smiling perhaps he didnt like me i thought this made me sad i didnt know why i didnt know anything about him but i wanted him to like me i was at work standing near the biscuits and coffee when i saw the tall man again he came past and my heart jumped he put his hand into the box of biscuits look he said three biscuits what are you going to do his face was hard there are rules here i said we all have to follow them so what are you going to do he said again nothing i said not all guards shout at people you know he looked at me that little boy he said hamid he saw people kill his father and his brother they tried to kill him too i couldnt speak he left the country with his mother and they travelled for two weeks to get here when i gave the boy the biscuits i wanted him to feel better but how could he feel better with just biscuits most of the time i didnt think too much about why people left their countries but this man was making me think and i found it hard hamid and his mother will get help here i said lawyers will hear their story and help them i hope so he said i couldnt stop looking at his face it was a face that showed so many feelings all at once it was angry sad and kind all at the same time i wanted to know more about this man and you i said quietly why are you here he didnt speak for a minute he just looked at me carefully then he said why are you here yourself i looked away i was afraid of how i was feeling im just doing my job i said i looked back at him my names nancy whats yours im george he said and when he smiled that beautiful smile my heart jumped again and do you agree with all the rules here he asked no i replied not all of them then why are you doing this job i didnt know what to say i did it because i liked having some money i wanted to be a writer i replied but i left school early you can do anything if you really want to said george maybe i said we talked some more george was making me think about things writing was something i always loved perhaps i could write tom was the only person who said i couldnt i was changing and there was nothing tom or i could do about it chapter four the dinner party it was friday night i wasnt working tom and i were going for dinner at my best friend harriets house harriet and i were old friends from school we saw each other every week harriet lived with her boyfriend steve they were getting married in april in scotland i put on a red dress and my favourite shoes you look beautiful said tom he tried to kiss me but i moved away come here he said and he pulled me hard stop it tom i said why dont you want to kiss me he asked i didnt reply i felt angry when tom was like this we didnt talk again as we walked to harriet and steves house hello come in said harriet opening the door i went into the kitchen with harriet she was cooking harriet is a very good cook after we left school she studied to be a cook and i moved in with tom in those days i thought i was the lucky one i had a man who earned good money and i didnt have to work now i wasnt sure now i was learning that work can be important harriet knew me better than anyone she looked at me whats wrong nancy she asked you look different what is it i looked at her dont say im stupid i said its about someone at work at the centre yes a guard she asked no i said one of the asylum seekers yes i really like him like how harriet asked i think about him all the time but nancy youre with tom you and tom love each other what more do you want i dont want more things i said the first time i saw this man i i needed him to like me whats his name she asked george and why did he come to this country i dont know i told her i asked him but he didnt say then what do you know about him i looked at my best friend harriet i said i know that hes kind i know he wants to help people sometimes you dont need to know a lot about someone i know i like him thats all harriet looked at me i didnt say anything else i didnt want to talk about george any more i didnt think harriet really understood so is everything ready for the wedding i asked nancy said harriet just remember you love tom you live with tom you have a beautiful home and a good life dont lose it of course harriet was right i had a beautiful home i had tom but i didnt tell harriet that tom was often angry with me hows the job steve asked me over dinner its i started why dont they close that centre said tom one day the asylum seekers will all escape then we will have problems asylum seekers steal things i thought about george bill and the biscuits asylum seekers dont steal things tom i said well they come here and take our jobs said tom soon nancy will say everyone can come into our country then there will be no jobs no houses and no hospital beds for us tom said harriet what are you saying im talking about asylum seekers that come here to get a good life said tom this is our country not theirs our country who are we asked steve us me people who were born here so said harriet do you mean that i cant live here because my father was born in scotland and my mother was born in italy she was as angry as me thats different said tom why is it different asked harriet im talking about people from the other side of the world they come here and take our jobs and houses people come to this country because they are afraid to stay in their countries i said it isnt easy for them to leave their homes i hear some terrible stories at the centre these people need our help tom laughed stories thats what they are nancy is so sweet she believes anything more cake please harriet tom knew we didnt agree with him so he started talking about something else that night in bed i couldnt look at tom the one night i have you at home and you dont want to talk to me he said i dont know you any more nancy i didnt answer i waited until he was asleep and then i turned and looked at him tom with his angry ideas about asylum seekers do i still love him i asked myself i closed my eyes but i could see george and not tom chapter five in danger the next time i saw george he was standing outside the grey building smoking a cigarette he smiled at me and my heart jumped do you want a cigarette he asked i dont smoke i said and then i added but i dont mind smoking i looked at him how are you i asked im ok he replied george i said why did you come here to this country i didnt think george wanted to talk about his past but this time he answered me in my country i was in danger he said danger why i was a photo journalist he said i took some photos for the newspapers but the police didnt like them i took them because i wanted people to know what was happening in my country what were the photos of i asked they were of soldiers hurting women and young children but the police saw my photos and they came to find me thats terrible i said you were trying to help those women and children yes he said but the police didnt want people to know what was happening in our country so what did they do to you i asked they locked me in a building and they hurt me look he opened his shirt and showed me some terrible scars now you can see why i cant go home i couldnt speak when they let me go i knew i couldnt work in my country anymore george said so you came here it wasnt easy he said but i thought when i get to england i can show people my photos people can see what is really happening in my country but when i arrived they brought me to this place now im locked up again only for a short time i said they brought you here to keep you safe a lot of people dont like asylum seekers coming to our country i thought of tom but there are lawyers who can help you you tell them your story and they will help you yes he said i hope so but its possible they will send me home again people say its hard to get asylum here he put out his hand thank you for listening to me he said it helps to talk sometimes i moved away i have to go george i said quickly and i left something was happening to me i knew it i wanted it to happen but i was afraid really afraid chapter six against the rules i was not allowed to make friends with the asylum seekers but when george saw me he always came to talk to me and i enjoyed talking to george i tried to stop liking him but i couldnt one evening i was in the dining room helping with the coffee george was waiting for a drink i talked to some people today he said to me as he passed im leaving the centre tomorrow my heart jumped are you staying in this country or i asked i dont know theyre going to tell me tomorrow i felt afraid for him suddenly i decided to do something something dangerous when i started at the centre they told me never to give anyone my phone number or my address they told me that i could lose my job but i didnt want to lose george i looked about nobody was watching george i said heres my phone number if you have problems call me perhaps i can help you i gave him a piece of paper thank you he said and he put it quickly in his pocket he walked away then without another word and the next time i went to work george was not there chapter seven a letter after george left i began to hate my life with tom every saturday we went shopping we bought clothes cds and dvds once i liked shopping now when i looked at all the things in the shops i felt ill i thought about george all the time where was he was he ok why didnt he ring me ten days after george left the centre i arrived at work and there was a letter for me i went to a corner of the dining room and opened it dear nancy i hope you get this i wanted to write before but i didnt know what to say i can stay here for six months maybe longer im in east london there are a lot of other asylum seekers here some of their stories are very sad how

about george all the time as i travelled back to london on the train i couldnt wait to see george we were so in love i knew now that i never really loved tom i only thought i loved him i didnt really know what love was before and i also knew that george loved me i couldnt wait to see him to feel his arms around me the train arrived at last i looked for george there were a lot of people on the platform i couldnt see him i got out of the train and looked around i waited until the platform was empty but i still couldnt see him i felt strange and cold was something wrong no i told myself he had to get a bus here buses were often late but he knew that why didnt he leave earlier perhaps he was waiting outside but i didnt see him i felt afraid but what was there to be afraid of i waited i waited for a long time then i decided to get a taxi home perhaps george was ill the taxi stopped outside my flat i ran in and i looked about my drawers and cupboards were open and there were things everywhere george i called no reply then i saw that some of my things were not there my cd player my small television i started looking for my other things i looked by my bed for the box where i kept my gold watch i didnt wear it anymore it made me think of tom but i knew it cost a lot of money it wasnt there i was afraid i wanted george george i shouted but of course george wasnt there chapter twelve the police i walked slowly around my flat who got in and took my things i thought only george and harriet have keys it couldnt be george he loves me but someone came into my flat while i was away i began to feel afraid i called the police i didnt want to but i didnt know what else to do a policewoman came to see me does anyone have a key she asked only my best friend harriet and george harriets away and george is my boyfriend have you been with him long about two months where did you meet she asked me at work does he work with you she asked no so what does he do hes an asylum seeker

looked in the cupboard where i kept my passport it wasnt there do you have any idea where your boyfriend is asked the policewoman we need to talk to him i opened my mouth then closed it again i didnt want the police to find george no i said i dont know where he is we saw each other every day before i went to scotland but he wasnt here when i got back ok said the policewoman well if you see him please phone us of course i said and she left the rest of that day i waited i waited all day for george to call but he didnt i tried calling him but there was no answer chapter thirteen another party i couldnt sleep that night i lay in bed with my eyes open thinking and thinking did george take my things was tom right did george just want my money and my passport but then i thought of his beautiful smile i thought of his kiss i thought of all the times we talked george wanted to help people he wanted to make things better for people george was not a thief i knew he wasnt at last i fell asleep at about four oclock in the morning the next few days were terrible i went to work and when i got home i tried to phone george but he didnt answer perhaps i could go to his flat i thought his
