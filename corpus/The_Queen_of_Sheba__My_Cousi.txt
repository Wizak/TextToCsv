bookkeeper of the nautilus bank at rivermouth found himself in a position to execute a plan which he had long meditated in secret a statement like this at the present time when integrity in a place of trust has become almost an anomaly immediately suggests a defalcation but mr lyndes plan involved nothing more criminal than a horseback excursion through the northern part of the state of new hampshire a leave of absence of three weeks which had been accorded him in recognition of several years conscientious service offered young lynde the opportunity he had desired these three weeks as already hinted fell in the month of june when nature in new hampshire is in her most ravishing toilet she has put away her winter ermine which sometimes serves her quite into spring she has thrown a green mantle over her brown shoulders and is not above the coquetry of wearing a great variety of wild flowers on her bosom with her sassafras and her sweetbrier she is in her best mood as a woman in a fresh and becoming costume is apt to be and almost any one might mistake her laugh for the music of falling water and the agreeable rustle of her garments for the wind blowing through the pine forests as edward lynde rode out of rivermouth one morning an hour or two before anybody worth mention was moving he was very well contented with this world though he had his grievances too if he had chosen to think of them masses of dark cloud still crowded the zenith but along the eastern horizon against the increasing blue lay a city of golden spires and mosques and minarets an oriental city indeed such as is inhabited by poets and dreamers and other speculative persons fond of investing their small capital in such unreal estate young lynde in spite of his prosaic profession of bookkeeper had an opulent though as yet unworked vein of romance running through his composition and he said to himself as he gave a slight twitch to the reins ill put up there tonight at the sign of the golden fleece or may be ill quarter myself on one of those rich old merchants who used to do business with the bank in the colonial days before he had finished speaking the city was destroyed by a general conflagration the round red sun rose slowly above the pearlgray ruins and it was morning in his three years residence at rivermouth edward lynde had never chanced to see the town at so early an hour the cobblepaved street through which he was riding was a commercial street but now the shops had their wooden eyelids shut tight and were snoozing away as comfortably and innocently as if they were not at all alive to a sharp stroke of business in their wakeful hours there was a charm to lynde in this novel phase of a thoroughfare so familiar to him and then the morning was perfect the street ran parallel with the river the glittering harebellblue of which could be seen across a vacant lot here and there or now and then at the end of a narrow lane running up from the wharves the atmosphere had that indescribable sparkle and bloom which last only an hour or so after daybreak and was charged with fine seaflavors and the delicate breath of dewy meadowland everything appeared to exhale a fragrance even the weatherbeaten sign of j tibbets son west india goods groceries it seemed to lynde emitted an elusive spicy odor edward lynde soon passed beyond the limits of the town and was ascending a steep hill on the crest of which he proposed to take a farewell survey of the picturesque port throwing off its gauzy counterpane of seafog the wind blew blithely on this hilltop it filled his lungs and exhilarated him like champagne he set spur to the gaunt bony mare and with a flourish of his hand to the peaked roof of the nautilus bank dashed off at a speed of not less than four miles an hour for it was anything but an arabian courser which lynde had hired of honest deacon twombly she was not a handsome animal either yellow in tint and of the texture of an ancestral hairtrunk with a plebeian head and mysterious developments of muscle on the hind legs she was not a horse for fancy riding but she had her good points she had a great many points of one kind and another among which was her perfect adaptability to rough country roads and the sort of work now required of her mary aint what youd call a racer deacon twombly had remarked while the negotiations were pending i dont say she is but shes easy on the back this statement was speedily verified at the end of two miles mary stopped short and began backing deliberately and systematically as if to slow music in a circus recovering from the surprise of the halt which had taken him wholly unawares lynde gathered the slackened reins firmly in his hand and pressed his spurs to the mares flanks with no other effect than slightly to accelerate the backward movement perhaps nothing gives you so acute a sense of helplessness as to have a horse back with you under the saddle or between shafts the reins lie limp in your hands as if detached from the animal it is impossible to check him or force him forward to turn him around is to confess yourself conquered to descend and take him by the head is an act of pusillanimity of course there is only one thing to be done but if you know what that is you possess a singular advantage over your fellowcreatures finding spur and whip of no avail lynde tried the effect of moral suasion he stroked mary on the neck and addressed her in terms that would have melted the heart of almost any other mary but she continued to back slowly and with a certain grace that could have come only of confirmed habit now lynde had no desire to return to rivermouth above all to back into it in that mortifying fashion and make himself a spectacle for the townsfolk but if this thing went on forty or fifty minutes longer that would be the result if i cannot stop her he reflected ill desert the brute just before we get to the tollgate i cant think what possessed twombly to let me have such a ridiculous animal mary showed no sign that she was conscious of anything unconventional or unlooked for in her conduct mary my dear said lynde at last with dangerous calmness you would be all right or at least your proceeding would not be quite so flagrant a breach of promise if you were only aimed in the opposite direction with this he gave a vigorous jerk at the lefthand rein which caused the mare to wheel about and face rivermouth she hesitated an instant and then resumed backing now mary said the young man dryly i will let you have your head so to speak as long as you go the way i want you to this manoeuvre on the side of lynde proved that he possessed qualities which if skilfully developed would have assured him success in the higher regions of domestic diplomacy the ability to secure your own way and impress others with the idea that they are having their own way is rare among men among women it is as common as eyebrows i wonder how long she will keep this up mused lynde fixing his eye speculatively on marys pullback ears if it is to be a permanent arrangement i shall have to reverse the saddle certainly the creature is a lusus naturae her head is on the wrong end easy on the back he added with a hollow laugh recalling deacon twomblys recommendation i should say she was i never saw an easier presently mary ceased her retrograde movement righted herself of her own accord and trotted off with as much submissiveness as could be demanded of her lynde subsequently learned that this propensity to back was an unaccountable whim which seized mary at odd intervals and lasted from five to fifteen minutes the peculiarity once understood not only ceased to be an annoyance to him but became an agreeable break in the ride whenever her mood approached he turned the mare round and let her back to her souls content he also ascertained that the maximum of marys speed was five miles an hour i didnt want a fast horse anyway said lynde philosophically as i am not going anywhere in particular i need be in no hurry to get there the most delightful feature of lyndes plan was that it was not a plan he had simply ridden off into the rosy june weather with no settled destination no care for tomorrow and as independent as a bird of the tourists ordinary requirements at the crupper of his saddle an old cavalry saddle that had seen service in longforgotten trainingdays was attached a cylindrical valise of cowhide containing a change of linen a few toilet articles a vulcanized cloth cape for rainy days and the first volume of the earthly paradise the two warlike holsters in front in which colonel eliphalet bangs used to carry a brace of flintlock pistols now reposing in the historical museum at rivermouth became the receptacle respectively of a slender flask of brandy and a bologna sausage for young lynde had determined to sell his life dearly if by any chance of travel he came to close quarters with famine a broadbrimmed panama hat a suit of navyblue flannel and a pair of ridingboots completed his equipment a fieldglass in a leather case was swung by a strap over his shoulder and in the breast pocket of his blouse he carried a small compass to guide him on his journey due north the young mans costume went very well with his frank refined face and twentythree years a deadgold mustache pointed at the ends and sweeping at a level right and left like a swallows wings gave him something of a military air there was a martial directness too in the glance of his clear gray eyes undimmed as yet with looking too long on the world there could not have been a better figure for the saddle than lyndes slightly above the average height straight as a poplar and neither too spare nor too heavy now and then as he passed a farmhouse a young girl hanging out clothes in the front yard for it was on a monday would pause with a shapeless snowdrift in her hand to gaze curiously at the apparition of a gallant young horseman riding by it often happened that when he had passed she would slyly steal to the red gate in the lichencovered stone wall and follow him with her palmshaded eyes down the lonely road and it as frequently happened that he would glance back over his shoulder at the nutbrown maid whose closely clinging scant drapery gave her a sculpturesque grace to which her unconsciousness of it was a charm the more these flashes of subtile recognition between youth and youth these sudden mute greetings and farewells reached almost the dimension of incidents in that first days eventless ride once lynde halted at the porch of a hiproofed unpainted house with green paper shades at the windows and asked for a cup of milk which was brought him by the nutbrown maid who never took her flattering innocent eyes off the young mans face while he drank sipping him as he sipped the milk and young lynde rode away feeling as if something had really happened more than once that morning he drew up by the roadside to listen to some lyrical robin on an applebough or to make friends with the blackbelted durham cows and the creamcolored alderneys who came solemnly to the pasture wall and stared at him with big goodnatured faces a row of them with their lazy eyes and pink tongues and moist indiarubber noses was as good as a play at noon that day our adventureless adventurer had reached bayleys fourcorners where he found provender for himself and mary at what had formerly been a tavern in the naive stagecoach epoch it was the sole house in the neighborhood and was occupied by the exlandlord one tobias sewell who had turned farmer on finishing his cigar after dinner lynde put the saddle on mary and started forward again it is hardly correct to say forward for mary took it into her head to back out of bayleys fourcorners a feat which she performed to the unspeakable amusement of mr sewell and a quaint old gentleman named jaffrey who boarded in the house i guess that must be a suckcuss hoss remarked mr sewell resting his loosely jointed figure against the rail fence as he watched his departing guest mary backed to the ridge of the hill up which the turnpike stretched from the ancient tavern then recovered herself and went on i never saw such an outandout wilful old girl as you are mary ejaculated lynde scarlet with mortification i begin to admire you perhaps the covert reproach touched some finer chord of marys nature or perhaps mary had done her days allowance of backing whatever the case was she indulged no further caprice that afternoon beyond shying vigorously at a heavily loaded tinpedlers wagon a proceeding which may be palliated by the statement of the fact that many of marys earlier years were passed in connection with a similar establishment the afterglow of sunset had faded out behind the serrated line of hills and black shadows were assembling like conspirators in the orchards and under the spreading elms by the roadside when edward lynde came in sight of a large manufacturing town which presented a sufficiently bizarre appearance at that hour grouped together in a valley were five or six high irregular buildings illuminated from basement to roof each with a monstrous chimney from which issued a fan of partycolored flame on one long low structure with a double row of windows gleaming like the portholes of a manofwar at night was a squat round tower that now and then threw open a vast valve at the top and belched forth a volume of amber smoke which curled upward to a dizzy height and spread itself out against the sky lying in the weird light of these chimneys with here and there a gable or a spire suddenly outlined in vivid purple the huddled town beneath seemed like an outpost of the infernal regions lynde however resolved to spend the night there instead of riding on farther and trusting for shelter to some farmhouse or barn ten or twelve hours in the saddle had given him a keen appetite for rest presently the roar of flues and furnaces and the resonant din of mighty hammers beating against plates of iron fell upon his ear a few minutes later he rode into the town not knowing and not caring in the least what town it was all this had quite the flavor of foreign travel to lynde who began pondering on which hotel he should bestow his patronage a question that sometimes perplexes the tourist on arriving at a strange city in lyndes case the matter was considerably simplified by the circumstance that there was but a single aristocratic hotel in the place he extracted this information from a small boy begrimed with irondust and looking as if he had just been cast at a neighboring foundry who kindly acted as cicerone and conducted the tired wayfarer to the doorstep of the spread eagle under one of whose wings to be at once figurative and literal he was glad to nestle for the night ii in which there is a family jar while lynde is enjoying the refreshing sleep that easily overtook him after supper we will reveal to the reader so much of the young mans private history as may be necessary to the narrative in order to do this the author like deacon twomblys mare feels it indispensable to back a little one morning about three years previous to the day when edward lynde set forth on his aimless pilgrimage mr jenness bowlsby the president of the nautilus bank at rivermouth received the following letter from his wifes nephew mr john flemming a young merchant in new york new york may my dear uncle in the course of a few days a friend of mine mr edward lynde of this city will call upon you and hand you a note of introduction from myself i write this to secure for him in advance the liking and interest which i am persuaded you will not be able to withhold on closer acquaintance i have been intimate with edward lynde for twelve years or more first at the boardingschool at flatbush and afterwards at college though several years my junior he was in the same classes with me and if the truth must be told generally carried off all the honors he is not only the most accomplished young fellow i know but a fellow of inexhaustible modesty and amiability and i think it was singularly malicious of destiny to pick him out as a victim when there are so many worthless young men the name of john flemming will instantly occur to you who deserve nothing better than rough treatment you see i am taking pointblank aim at your sympathy when lynde was seven or eight years old he had the misfortune to lose his mother his father was already dead the childs nearest relative was an uncle david lynde a rich merchant of new york a bachelor and a character old lynde i call him old lynde not out of disrespect but to distinguish him from young lynde was at that period in his sixtieth year a gentleman of unsullied commercial reputation and of regular if somewhat peculiar habits he was at his countingroom precisely at eight in the morning and was the last to leave in the evening working as many hours each day as he had done in those first years when he entered as officeboy into the employment of briggs livingstone the firm at the time of which i am now writing was lynde livingstone co mr david lynde lived in a set of chambers up town and dined at his club where he usually passed the evenings at chess with some brother antediluvian a visit to the theatre when some old english comedy or some new english ballet happened to be on the boards was the periphery of his dissipation what is called society saw nothing of him he was a rough breezy thickset old gentleman betrothed from his birth to apoplexy enjoying life in his own secluded manner and insisting on having everybody about him happy he would strangle an old friend rather than not have him happy a characteristic story is told of a quarrel he had with a chum of thirty or forty years standing ripley sturdevant sen sturdevant came to grief in the financial panic of lynde held a mortgage on sturdevants house and insisted on cancelling it sturdevant refused to accept the sacrifice they both were fiery old gentlemen arcades ambo high words ensued what happened never definitely transpired but sturdevant was found lying across the office lounge with a slight bruise over one eyebrow and the torn mortgage thrust into his shirtbosom it was conjectured that lynde had actually knocked him down and forced the cancelled mortgage upon him in short david lynde was warmhearted and generous to the verge of violence but a man in every way unfitted by temperament experience and mode of life to undertake the guardianship of a child to have an infant dropped into his arms was as excellent an imitation of a calamity as could well happen to him i am told that no one could have been more sensible of this than david lynde himself and that there was something extremely touching in the alacrity and cheerfulness with which he assumed the novel responsibility immediately after the funeral mrs lynde had resided in philadelphia the uncle brought the boy to new york it was impossible to make a permanent home for young lynde in bachelor chambers or to dine him at the club after a week of inconvenience and wretchedness complicated by the sinister suspicions of his landlady david lynde concluded to send the orphan to boardingschool it was at flatbush long island that i made the acquaintance of the forlorn little fellow his cot was next to mine in the dormitory we became close friends we passed our examinations left flatbush at the same time and entered college together in the meanwhile the boys relations with his guardian were limited to a weekly exchange of letters those of the uncle invariably beginning with yours of saturday duly at hand and ending with enclosed please find in respect to pocketmoney young lynde was a prince my friend spent the long vacations with me at newburgh running down to new york occasionally to pass a day or so with the uncle in these visits their intimacy ripened old lynde was now become very proud of his bright young charge giving him astonishing dinners at delmonicos taking him to wallacks and introducing him to the old fossils at the club as my boy ned it was at the beginning of lyndes last term at college that his uncle retired from business bought a house in madison avenue and turned it into a sort of palace with frescoes and upholstery there was a library for my boy ned a smokingroom in cherrywood a billiardroom in black walnut a diningroom in oak and crimson in brief the beauideal of a den for a couple of bachelors by jove it was like a clubhouse the only model for a home of which poor old lynde had any conception six months before ned was graduated the establishment was in systematic running order under the supervision of the pearl of housekeepers here david lynde proposed to spend the rest of his days with his nephew who might for forms sake adopt some genteel profession if not well and good the boy would have money now just as ned was carrying off the first prizes in greek and mathematics and dreaming of the pleasant life he was to lead with his amiable old benefactor what does that amiable old benefactor go and do but marry the housekeeper david lynde knew very little of women he had not spoken to above a dozen in his whole life did not like them in fact had a mild sort of contempt for them as persons devoid of business ability it was in the course of nature that the first woman who thought it worth her while should twist him around her finger like a remnant of ribbon when ned came out of college he found himself in the arms of an unlookedfor aunt who naturally hated him at sight i have not the time or space my dear uncle to give you even a catalogue of the miseries that followed on the heels of this deplorable marriage besides you can imagine them old lynde loving both his wife and his nephew was by turns violent and feeble the wife cool cunning and insidious a vivien of forty leading merlin by the beard i am not prepared to contend that the nephew was always in the right but i know he always got the worst of it which amounts to about the same thing at the end of eight or ten months he saw that the position was untenable packed his trunk one night and quitted the menage the menagerie as he calls it this was three weeks ago having a small property of his own some fifteen hundred dollars a year i believe lynde at first thought to go abroad it was always his dream to go abroad but i persuaded him out of that seeing how perilous it would be for a young fellow of his inexperience and impressible disposition to go rambling alone over the continent paris was his idea paris would not make a mouthful of him i have talked him out of that i repeat and have succeeded in convincing him that the wisest course for him to pursue is to go to some pleasant town or village within hailing distance of one of our larger cities and spend the summer quietly i even suggested he should make the personal acquaintance of some light employment to help him forget the gorgeous castle of cards which has just tumbled down about his ears in six words i have sent him to rivermouth now my dear uncle i have wasted eight pages of paper and probably a hundred dollars worth of your time if you do not see that i am begging you to find a position for lynde in the nautilus bank after a little practice he would make a skilful accountant and the question of salary is as you see of secondary importance manage to retain him at rivermouth if you possibly can david lynde has the strongest affection for the lad and if vivien whose name is elizabeth is not careful how she drags merlin around by the beard he will reassert himself in some unexpected manner if he were to serve her as he is supposed to have served old sturdevant his conduct would be charitably criticised if he lives a year he will be in a frame of mind to leave the bulk of his fortune to ned they have not quarrelled you understand on the contrary mr lynde was anxious to settle an allowance of five thousand a year on ned but ned would not accept it i want uncle davids love says ned and i have it the devil take his money here you have all the points i could not state them more succinctly and do justice to each of the parties interested the most unfortunate party i take it is david lynde i am not sure after all that young lynde is so much to be pitied perhaps that clubhouse would not have worked well for him if it had worked differently at any rate he now has his own way to make and i commend him to your kindness if i have not exhausted it your affectionate nephew j flemming five or six days after this letter reached mr bowlsby mr edward lynde presented himself in the directors room of the nautilus bank the young mans bearing confirmed the favorable impression which mr bowlsby had derived from his nephews letter and though there was really no vacancy in the bank at the moment mr bowlsby lent himself to the illusion that he required a private secretary a few weeks later a vacancy occurred unexpectedly that of payingteller a position in which lynde acquitted himself with so much quickness and accuracy that when mr trefethen the assistant cashier died in the december following lynde was promoted to his desk the unruffled existence into which edward lynde had drifted was almost the reverse of the career he had mapped out for himself and it was a matter of mild astonishment to him at intervals that he was not discontented he thought rivermouth one of the most charming old spots he had ever seen or heard of and the people the most hospitable the story of his little family jar taking deeper colors and richer ornamentation as it passed from hand to hand made him at once a social success mr goldstone one of the leading directors of the bank invited lynde to dinner few persons were ever overburdened with invitations to dine at the goldstones and the door of many a refined home turned willingly on its hinges for the young man at the evening parties that winter edward lynde was considered almost as good a card as a naval officer miss mildred bowlsby then the reigning belle was ready to flirt with him to the brink of the episcopal marriage service and beyond but the phenomenal honeymoon which had recently quartered in lyndes family left him indisposed to take any lunar observations on his own account with his salary as cashier lyndes income was vanderbiltish for a young man in rivermouth unlike his great contemporary he did not let it accumulate once a month he wrote a dutiful letter to his uncle david who never failed to answer by telegraph yours received god bless you edward this whimsical fashion of reply puzzled young lynde quite as much as it diverted him until he learned through his friend john flemming that his aunt vivien had extorted from the old gentleman a solemn promise not to write to his nephew lyndes duties at the bank left him free every afternoon at four oclock his work and his leisure were equally pleasant in summer he kept a sailboat on the river and in winter he had the range of a rich collection of books connected with an antiquated public readingroom thus very happily if very quietly and almost imperceptibly the months rolled round to that period when the nautilus bank gave edward lynde a three weeks vacation and he set forth as we have seen on deacon twomblys mare in search of the picturesque and the peculiar if they were to be found in the northern part of new hampshire iii in which mary takes a new departure it was still dark enough the next morning to allow the great chimneys to show off their colored fires effectively when lynde passed through the dingy main street of k and struck into a road which led to the hill country a short distance beyond the town while he was turning in the saddle to observe the singular effect of the lurid light upon the landscape a freighttrain shot obliquely across the road within five rods of his horses head the engine flinging great flakes of fiery spume from its nostrils and shrieking like a maniac as it plunged into a tunnel through a spur of the hills mary went sideways like a crab for the next three quarters of a mile to most young men the expedition which edward lynde had undertaken would have seemed unattractive and monotonous to the last degree but lyndes somewhat sedentary habits had made him familiar with his own company when one is young and well read and amiable there is really no better company than ones self as a steady thing we are in a desperate strait indeed if we chance at any age to tire of this invisible but everpresent comrade for he is not to be thrown over during life before now men have become so weary of him so bored by him that they have attempted to escape by suicide but it is a question if death itself altogether rids us of him in no minute of the twentyfour hours since lynde left rivermouth had he felt the want of other companionship mary with her peculiarities the roadside sights and sounds the chubby children with shining morning face on the way to school the woodland solitudes the farmers at work in the fields the blue jays and the robins in the orchards the blonde and brown girls at the cottage doors his own buoyant unreproachful thoughts what need had he of company if anything could have added to his enjoyment it would have been the possibility of being waylaid by bandits or set upon in some desolate pass by wild animals but alas the nearest approximation to a bandit that fell in his way was some shabby spiritless tramp who passed by on the further side without lifting an eyelid and as for savage animals he saw nothing more savage than a monkish chipmunk here and there who disappeared into his stonewall convent the instant he laid eyes on lynde riding along those lonely new england roads he was more secure than if he had been lounging in the thronged avenues of a great city certainly he had dropped on an age and into a region sterile of adventure he felt this but not so sensitively as to let it detract from the serene pleasure he found in it all from the happy glow of his mind every outward object took a rosy light even a rustic funeral which he came upon at a crossroad that forenoon softened itself into something not unpicturesque for three days after quitting k lynde pushed steadily forward the first two nights he secured lodgings at a farmhouse on the third night he was regarded as a suspicious character and obtained reluctant permission to stow himself in a hayloft where he was so happy at roughing it and being uncomfortable that he could scarcely close an eye the amateur outcast lay dreamily watching the silver spears of moonlight thrust through the roof of the barn and extracting such satisfaction from his cheerless surroundings as would have astonished a professional tramp poverty and hardship are merely ideas after all said lynde to himself softly as he drifted off in a doze ah master lynde playing at poverty and hardship is one thing but if the reality is merely an idea it is one of the very worst ideas in the world the young man awoke before sunrise the next morning and started onward without attempting to negotiate for breakfast with his surly host he had faith that some sunburnt young woman with bowl of brownbread and milk would turn up farther on if she did not and no tavern presented itself there were the sausage and the flask of eaudevie still untouched in the holsters the mountain air had not wholly agreed with mary who at this stage of the journey inaugurated a series of abnormal coughs each one of which went near to flinging lynde out of the saddle mary he said after a particularly narrow escape there are few fine accomplishments you havent got except a spavin perhaps youve got that concealed somewhere about your person he said this in a tone of airy badinage which mary seemed to appreciate but he gravely wondered what he could do with her and how he should replace her if she fell seriously ill for the last two days farmhouses and cultivated fields had been growing rarer and rarer and the road rougher and wilder at times it made a sudden detour to avoid the outcropping of a monster stratum of granite and in places became so narrow that the rank huckleberrybushes swept the mares flanks lynde found it advisable on the morning in question to pick his way carefully a range of arid hills rose darkly before him stretching east and west further than his eye could follow rugged forlorn hills covered with a thick prickly undergrowth and sentinelled by phantomlike pines there were gloomy rocky gorges on each hand and highhanging crags and where the vapor was drawn aside like a veil in one place he saw two or three peaks with what appeared to be patches of snow on them perhaps they were merely patches of bleached rock long afterwards when edward lynde was passing through the valley of the arve on the way from geneva to chamouni he recollected this bit of switzerland in america and it brought an odd perplexed smile to his lips the thousand ghostly shapes of mist which had thronged the heights shutting in the prospect on every side had now vanished discovering as wild and melancholy a spot as a romantic heart could desire there was something sinister and ironical even in the sunshine that lighted up these bleak hills the silver waters of a spring whose source was hidden somewhere high up among the mossy boulders dripping silently from ledge to ledge had the pathos of tears the deathly stillness was broken only by the dismal caw of a crow taking abrupt flight from a blasted pine here and there a birch with its white satin skin glimmered spectrally among the sombre foliage the inarticulate sadness of the place brought a momentary feeling of depression to lynde who was not usually given to moods except of the lighter sort he touched mary sharply with the spurs and cantered up the steep he had nearly gained the summit of the hill when he felt the saddle slipping the girth had unbuckled or broken as he dismounted the saddle came off with him his foot still in the stirrup the mare shied and the rein slipped from his fingers he clutched at it but mary gave a vicious toss of the head wheeled about and began trotting down the declivity her trot at once broke into a gallop and the gallop into a full run a full run for mary at the foot of the hill she stumbled fell rolled over gathered herself up and started off again at increased speed the road was perfectly straight for a mile or two the horse was already a small yellow patch in the distance she was evidently on her way back to rivermouth lynde watched her until she was nothing but a speck against the gray road then he turned and cast a rueful glance on the saddle which suddenly took to itself a satirical aspect as it lay sprawling on the ground at his feet he had been wanting something to happen and something had happened he was unhorsed and alone in the heart of the hill country alone in a strange and it seemed to lynde as he looked about him uninhabited region iv the odd adventure which befell young lynde in the hill country it had all happened so suddenly that one or two minutes passed before edward lynde took in the full enormity of marys desertion a dim smile was still hovering about his lips when the yellow speck that was mary faded into the gray distance then his countenance fell there was no sign of mortal habitation visible from the hillside where he stood the farm at which he had spent the night was five miles away his stiff ridingboots were illadapted to pedestrianism the idea of lugging that heavy saddle five miles over a mountain road caused him to knit his brows and look very serious indeed as he gave the saddle an impatient kick his eyes rested on the bologna sausage one end of which protruded from the holster then there came over him a poignant recollection of his lenten supper of the night before and his no breakfast at all of that morning he seated himself on the saddle unwrapped the sausage and proceeded to cut from it two or three thin slices it might have been much worse he reflected as he picked off with his penknife the bits of silver foil which adhered to the skin of the sausage if mary had decamped with the commissary stores that would have been awkward lynde devoured the small pieces of pressed meat with an appetite born of his long fast and the bracing upland air talk about pate de foie gras he exclaimed with a sweep of his arm as if he were disdainfully waving back a menial bearing a tray of strasbourg pates if i live to return to rivermouth i will have bologna sausage three times a day for the rest of my life a cup of the icecold water which bubbled up from a boss of cresses by the roadside completed his spartan breakfast his next step was to examine his surroundings from the top of this hill said lynde i shall probably be able to see where i am if that will be any comfort to me it was only fifty or sixty rods to the crown of the hill where the road viewed from below seemed abruptly to come to an end against the sky on gaining the summit lynde gave an involuntary exclamation of surprise and delight at his feet in the valley below in a fertile plain walled in on all sides by the emerald slopes lay the loveliest village that ever was seen though the road by which he had approached the eminence had been narrow and steep here it widened and descended by gentle gradations into the valley where it became the main street of the village a congregation of two or possibly three hundred houses mostly cottages with gambrel and leanto roofs at the left of the village and about an eighth of a mile distant was an imposing red brick building with wings and a pair of octagon towers it stood in a forest of pines and maples and appeared to be enclosed by a high wall of masonry it was too pretentious for an almshouse too elegant for a prison it was as evidently not a schoolhouse and it could not be an arsenal lynde puzzled over it a moment and then returned for his saddle which he slung across his back holding it by a stirrupstrap brought over either shoulder if mary has got a conscience muttered lynde it would prick her if she could see me now i must be an affecting spectacle in the village they wont know whether i am the upper or the lower half of a centaur they wont know whether to rub me down and give me a measure of oats or to ask me in to breakfast the saddle with its trappings probably weighed forty pounds and lynde was glad before he had accomplished a third of the way to the village to set down his burden and rest awhile on each side of him now were cornfields and sloping orchards peopled with those grotesque humanlike appletrees which seem twisted and cramped by a pain possibly caught from their own acidulous fruit the cultivated land terminated only where the village began it was not so much a village as a garden a garden crowded with flowers of that bright metallic tint which distinguishes the flora of northern climes through the centre of this eden ran the wide main street fringed with poplars and elms and chestnuts no polluting brewery or smoky factory with its hideous architecture marred the idyllic beauty of the miniature town for everything which is not a city is a town in new england the population obviously consisted of welltodo persons with outlying stockfarms or cranberry meadows and funds snugly invested in ships and railroads in outoftheway places like this is preserved the greater part of what we have left of the hard shrewd sense and the simpler manner of those homespun old worthies who planted the seed of the republic in our great cities we are cosmopolitans but here we are americans of the primitive type or as nearly as may be it was unimportant settlements like the one we are describing that sent their quota of stout hearts and flintlock muskets to the trenches on bunker hill here too the valorous spirit which had been slumbering on its arm for half a century started up at the first shot fired against fort sumter over the chimneyplace of more than one cottage in such secluded villages hangs an infantry or a cavalry sword in its dinted sheath looked at today by wife or mother with the tenderly proud smile that has mercifully taken the place of tears beyond the town on the hillside which edward lynde had just got within the focus of his fieldglass was the inevitable cemetery on a grave here and there a tiny flag waved in the indolent june breeze if lynde had been standing by the headstones he could have read among the inscriptions such unlocal words as malvern hill andersonville balls bluff and gettysburg and might have seen the withered decoration day wreaths which had been fresh the month before lynde brought his glass to bear on the red brick edifice mentioned and fell to pondering it again ill be hanged if i dont think its a nunnery he said by and by he let his gaze wander back to the town in which he detected an appearance of liveliness and bustle not usual in new england villages large or small the main street was dotted with groups of men and women and isolated figures to which perhaps the distance lent a kind of uncanny aspect were to be seen hurrying hither and thither it must be some local celebration thought lynde rural oratory and all that sort of thing that will be capital he had returned the glass to its leather case and was settling it well on his hip when he saw a man approaching it was a heavily built old gentleman in a suit of black alpaca somewhat frayed and baggy at the knees but still respectable he carried his hat in his hand fanning himself with it from time to time as if overcome by heat and the fatigue of walking a profusion of snowwhite hair parted in the middle swept down on either side of a face remarkable if it was remarkable for anything for its benign and simple expression there was a faroff indescribable something about this person as though he had existed long ago and once had a meaning but was now become an obsolete word in the human dictionary his wide placid brows and the double chin which asserted itself above his high neckcloth gave him a curious resemblance to portraits of dr franklin the country parson said lynde to himself venerable and lovely old character ill speak to him the old gentleman with his head slightly thrown back had his eyes fixed intently on some object in the sky and was on the point of passing lynde without observing him when the young man politely lifted his hat and said i beg your pardon sir but will you be kind enough to tell me the name of the town yonder the old gentleman slowly brought his eyes down from the sky fixed them vacantly upon lynde and made no response presuming him to be deaf lynde repeated his question in a key adapted to the exigency without a change in his mild benevolent expression and in a voice whose modulations were singularly musical the old gentleman exclaimed go to the devil and passed on the rejoinder was so unexpected the words themselves were so brusque while the utterance was so gentle and melodious that lynde refused to credit his ears could he have heard aright before he recovered from his surprise the gentleman in black was far up the slope his gaze again riveted on some remote point in the zenith it wasnt the country parson after all said lynde with a laugh it was the village toper hes an early bird ill say that for him to have secured his intoxicating worm at this hour of the morning lynde picked up the saddle and resumed his march on the town in the happy valley he had proceeded only a little way when he perceived another figure advancing towards him a figure not less striking than that of the archaic gentleman but quite different this was a young girl of perhaps seventeen in a flowing dress of some soft white stuff gathered at the waist by a broad red ribbon she was without hat or shawl and wore her hair which was very long and very black hanging loosely down her shoulders in exaggeration of a style of coiffure that afterwards came into fashion she was moving slowly and in the manner of a person not accustomed to walking she was a lady lynde saw that at a glance probably some citybred bird of passage resting for the summer in this vale of health his youthful vanity took alarm as he reflected what a comical picture he must present with that old saddle on his back he would have dumped it into the barberrybushes if he could have done so unobserved but it was now too late on perceiving lynde the girl arrested her steps a moment irresolutely and then came directly towards him as she drew nearer lynde was conscious of being dazzled by a pair of heavily fringed black eyes large and lustrous set in an oval face of exquisite pallor the girl held a dandelion in one hand twirling it by the end of its long snakelike stem as she approached she was close upon him now for an instant he caught the wind of the flower as it swiftly described a circle within an inch of his cheek the girl paused in front of him and drawing herself up to her full height said haughtily i am the queen of sheba then she glided by him with a quickened pace and a suddenly timid air lynde was longer recovering himself this time he stood rooted to the ground stupidly watching the retreating gracious form of the girl who half turned once and looked back at him then she vanished over the ridge of the hill as the old gentleman had done was she following him was there any connection between those two perhaps he was the village clergyman could this be his daughter what an unconventional costume for a young lady to promenade in for she was a lady down to her fingernails and what an odd salutation the queen of sheba he repeated wonderingly what could she mean by that she took me for some country bumpkin with this confounded saddle and was laughing at me i never saw a girl at once so so audacious and modest or so lovely i didnt know there was anything on earth so lovely as that girl he had caught only an instantaneous glimpse of her face but he had seen it with strange distinctness as one sees an object by a flash of lightning and he still saw it as one seems still to see the object in the afterdarkness every line of the features lived in his eyes even an almost indistinguishable scar there was on the girls right cheek near the temple it was not a flaw that faint scar it seemed somehow to heighten her loveliness as an accent over a word sometimes gives it one knows not what of piquancy evidently she lives in the town or in the neighborhood shall i meet her again i wonder i will stay here a week or a month if what nonsense i must have distinguished myself staring at her like a gawk when she said she was the queen of sheba i ought instantly to have replied what in the deuce is it i ought to have replied how can a man be witty with a ton of soleleather pressing on his spine edward lynde with the girl and her mocking words in his mind and busying himself with all the clever things he might have said and did not say mechanically traversed the remaining distance to the village the street which had seemed thronged when he viewed it from the slope of the hill was deserted at the farther end he saw two or three persons hurrying along but there were no indications whatever of the festival he had conjectured indeed the town presented the appearance of a place smitten by a pestilence the blinds of the lower casements of all the houses were closed he would have supposed them unoccupied if he had not caught sight of a face pressed against the glass of an upper window here and there he thought it singular that these faces instantly withdrew when he looked up once or twice he fancied he heard a distant laugh and the sound of voices singing drunkenly somewhere in the open air some distance up the street a tall libertypole sustaining a swinging sign announced a tavern lynde hastened thither but the tavern like the private houses appeared tenantless the massive pine windowshutters were barred and bolted lynde mounted the three or four low steps leading to the piazza and tried the front door which was locked with the saddle still on his shoulders he stepped into the middle of the street to reconnoitre the premises a man and two women suddenly showed themselves at an open window in the second story lynde was about to address them when the man cried out oh youre a horse i suppose well there isnt any oats for you here you had better trot on lynde did not relish this pleasantry it struck him as rather insolent but he curbed his irritation and inquired as politely as he could if a horse or any kind of vehicle could be hired in the village the three persons in the window nodded to one another significantly and began smiling in a constrained manner as if there were something quite preposterous in the inquiry the man a corpulent redfaced person seemed on the point of suffocating with merriment is this a public house demanded lynde severely thats as may be answered the man recovering his breath and becoming grave are you the proprietor thats jest what i am then i require of you the accommodation which is the right of every traveller your license does not permit you to turn any respectable stranger from your door now my advice to you said the man stepping back from the window my advice to you is to trot you cant get in here if you try to ill pepper you as sure as you live though i wouldnt like to do it so trot right along the man had a gun in his hands he clutched it nervously by the stock his countenance worked strangely and his small greenish eyes had a terrified defiant expression indisputably the tavernkeeper looked upon lynde as a dangerous person and was ready to fire upon him if he persisted in his demands my friend said lynde through his set teeth if i had you down here id give you a short lesson in manners i dare say i dare say cried the man flourishing the shotgun excitedly lynde turned away disgusted and indignant but his indignation was neutralized by his astonishment at this incomprehensible brutality he had no resource but to apply to some private house and state his predicament as that luckless saddle had excited the derision of the girl and drawn down on him the contumely of the tavernkeeper he looked around for some safe spot in which to deposit it before it brought him into further disgrace his linen and all his worldly possessions except his money which he carried on his person were in the valise he could not afford to lose that the sun was high by this time and the heat would have been intolerable if it had not been for a merciful breeze which swept down from the cooler atmosphere of the hills lynde wasted half an hour or more seeking a hidingplace for the saddle it had grown a grievous burden to him at every step it added a pound to its dead weight he saw no way of relieving himself of it there it was perched upon his shoulders like the old man of the sea on the back of sindbad the sailor in sheer despair lynde flung down his load on the curbstone at a corner formed by a narrow street diagonally crossing the main thoroughfare which he had not quitted he drew out his handkerchief and wiped the heavy drops of perspiration from his brows at that moment he was aware of the presence of a tall cadaverous man of about forty who was so painfully pinched and emaciated that a sympathetic shiver ran over lynde as he glanced at him he was as thin as an exclamation point it seemed to lynde that the man must be perishing with cold even in that burning june sunshine it was not a man but a skeleton good heavens sir cried lynde tell me where i am what is the name of this town constantinople constan tinople added the man briskly a stranger here yes said lynde abstractedly he was busy running over an imaginary map of the state of new hampshire in search of constantinople good exclaimed the anatomy rustling his dry palms together ill employ you youll employ me i like that certainly im a shipbuilder i didnt know they built vessels a hundred miles from the coast said lynde i am building a ship dont say im not of course i know nothing about it a marble ship a ship to carry marble no a ship made of marble a passenger ship we have ships of iron why not of marble he asked fiercely oh the fellow is mad said lynde to himself as mad as a loon everybody here is mad or ive lost my senses so you are building a marble ship he added aloud goodnaturedly when it is finished i trust you will get all the inhabitants of this town into it and put to sea at once then youll help me cried the man enthusiastically with his eyes gleaming in their sunken sockets more than ever he looked like a specimen escaped from some anatomical museum i do not believe i can be of much assistance answered lynde laughing i have had so little experience in constructing marble vessels you see i fear my early education has been fearfully neglected by the bye continued the young man who was vaguely diverted by his growing interest in the monomaniac how do you propose to move your ship to the seaboard in the simplest manner a double railroad track twentyfour engines twelve engines on each side to support the hull that would be a simple way edward lynde laughed again but not heartily he felt that this marble ship was a conception of high humor and was not without its pathetic element the whimsicality of the idea amused him but the sad earnestness of the nervous unstrung visionary at his side moved his compassion dear me he mused may be all of us are more or less engaged in planning a marble ship and perhaps the happiest are those who like this poor soul never awake from their delusion matrimony was uncle davids marble ship he launched his have i one on the ways i wonder lynde broke with a shock from his brief abstraction his companion had disappeared and with him the saddle and valise lynde threw a hasty glance up the street and started in pursuit of the navalarchitect who was running with incredible swiftness and bearing the saddle on his head with as much ease as if it had been a feather the distance between the two men some sixty or seventy yards was not the disadvantage that made pursuit seem hopeless lynde had eaten almost nothing since the previous noon he had been carrying that cumbersome saddle for the last two or three hours he was out of breath and it was impossible to do much running in his heavy ridingboots the other man on the contrary appeared perfectly fresh he wore light shoes and had not a superfluous ounce of flesh to carry he was all bone and sinew the saddle resting upon his head was hardly an impediment to him lynde however was not going to be vanquished without a struggle though he recognized the futility of pursuit he pushed on doggedly a certain tenacious quality in the young man imperatively demanded this of him the rascal has made off with my dinner he muttered between his clinched teeth that completes the ruin mary began if i should happen to catch up with him i trust i shall have the moral strength not to knock his head off his skull off it isnt a head lyndes sole hope of overtaking him and it was a very slender hope was based on the possibility that the man might fall and disable himself but he seemed to have the surefootedness as well as the lightness of a deer when lynde reached the outskirts of the village on the road by which he had entered the agile shipbuilder was more than halfway up the hill lynde made a fresh spurt here and lost his hat but he had no time to turn back for it every instant widened the space between the two runners as one of them noticed with disgust at the top of the ascent the man halted a moment to take breath and then disappeared behind the ridge he was on the down grade now and of course gaining at each stride on his pursuer who was still toiling upward lynde did not slacken his pace however he had got what runners call their second wind with lips set elbows pressed against his sides and head thrown forward he made excellent time to the brow of the hill where he suddenly discovered himself in the midst of a crowd of men and horses for several seconds lynde was so dazed and embarrassed that he saw nothing then his eyes fell upon the girl with the long hair and the white gown she was seated sidewise on a horse without saddle and the horse was mary a strapping fellow was holding the animal by the headstall by jove cried lynde springing forward joyfully thats my mare he was immediately seized by two men who attempted to pass a cord over his wrists lynde resisted so desperately that a third man was called into requisition and the three succeeded in tying his hands and placing him upon a saddle vacated by one of the riders all this occupied hardly a minute will you go along quietly said one of the men roughly or will you be carried what is the meaning of this demanded lynde with the veins standing out on his forehead he received no reply from any of the group which seemed to be composed of farmers and laboringhands with two or three persons whose social status did not betray itself directly behind the girl and like her mounted on a horse led by a couple of rustics was the whitehaired old gentleman who had repulsed lynde so rudely lynde noticed that his hands were also secured by cords an indignity which in no wise altered the benevolent and satisfied expression of his face lyndes saddle and valise were attached to the old gentlemans horse lynde instinctively looked around for the shipbuilder there he was flushed and sullen sitting on a black nag as bony and woebegone as himself guarded by two illfavored fellows not only were the shipbuilders arms pinioned but his feet were bound by a rope fastened to each ankle and passed under the nags belly it was clear to lynde that he himself the old clergyman and the girl were the victims of some dreadful misconception possibly brought about by the wretch who had purloined the saddle gentlemen cried lynde as the party began to advance i protest against this outrage so far as i am concerned and i venture to protest on the part of the lady i am convinced that she is incapable of any act to warrant such treatment i i know her slightly he added hesitating oh yes said the girl folding her hands demurely in her lap and i know you too very well you are my husband this announcement struck lynde speechless the rough men exchanged amused glances and the shipbuilder gave vent to a curious dry laugh lynde could have killed him the party moved on up to this moment the young man had been boiling with rage his rage now yielded place to amazement what motive had prompted the girl to claim that relationship was it a desperate appeal to him for protection but brother or cousin or friend would have served as well her impulsive declaration which would be at once disproved might result in serious complications for him and her but it had not been an impulsive declaration she had said it very calmly and he fancied with just the lightest touch of coquetry you are my husband for several minutes lynde did not dare to let his eyes wander in her direction she was a pace or so in the rear at his right to see her he would be obliged to turn slightly this he presently did with a movement as if settling himself more easily in the saddle the girls loose hair was blown like a black veil over her face putting her into mourning she was steadying herself with one hand resting on marys mane her feet were crossed and a diminutive slipper had fallen from one of them there was something so helpless and appealing in the girls attitude that lynde was touched may i speak with you sir he said addressing himself to a man whom somebody had called morton and who appeared to issue the orders for the party the man came to lyndes side for heavens sake sir explain this who is that young woman you said you knew her returned the man not unpleasantly indeed i said so replied lynde reddening what has happened what has she done what have i done what has the old clergyman done that we should be seized like murderers on the public highway be quiet now said the man laying his hand soothingly on lyndes arm and looking at him steadily everything will be satisfactorily explained by and by lyndes indignation blazed up again i can assure you sir he cried as the man returned to his former position that the result of the explanation will be far from satisfactory to you i shall hold to strict account every man who has had a hand in this business i demand to be brought before a magistrate or a justice of the peace if there is one in this godforsaken country no attention was paid to lyndes fresh outbreak some one picked up his hat and set it on the back of his head giving him quite a rakish air his dignity suffered until the wind took the hat again the party proceeded in silence halting once to tighten a girth and another time to wait for a straggler if the men spoke to one another it was in subdued tones or whispers two of the horsemen trotted on a hundred yards in advance like skirmishers thrown out in front of an attacking force there was something in all this mysterious precaution and reticence which bewildered and exasperated lynde who noted every detail mary in a transient spasm of backing had fallen to the rear the young man could no longer see the girl but ever before his eyes was the piteous unslippered little foot with its arched instep the party was now at the base of the declivity instead of following the road to the village the horses turned abruptly into a bridlepath branching off to the left and in the course of a few minutes passed through an ironspiked gateway in a high brick wall surrounding the large red structure which had puzzled lynde on first discovering the town the double gates stood wide open and were untended they went to however with a clang and the massive bolts were shot as soon as the party had entered in the courtyard lynde was hastily assisted from the horse he did not have an opportunity to observe what became of the other three prisoners when his hands were freed he docilely allowed himself to be conducted up a flight of stone steps and into the vestibule of the building and thence through a long corridor to a small room in which his guard left him the door closed with a spring not practicable from the inside as lynde ascertained on inspection the chamber was not exactly a cell it resembled rather the waitingroom of a penitentiary the carpet of a tasteless gaudy pattern was well worn and the few pieces of haircloth furniture a sofa a table and chairs had a stiff official air a strongly barred window gave upon a contracted garden one of those gardens sometimes attached to prisons with mathematically cut box borders and squares of unhealthy partycolored flowers looking like gangs of convicts going to meals on his arrival at the place edward lynde had offered no resistance trusting that some sort of judicial examination would promptly set him at liberty faint from want of food jaded by his exertions and chafing at the delay he threw himself upon the sofa and waited there was a great deal of confusion in the building hurried footsteps came and went up and down the passages now and then he heard approaching voices which tantalizingly passed on or died away before reaching his door once a shrill shriek a womans shriek rang through the corridor and caused him to spring to his feet after the lapse of an hour that had given lynde some general idea of eternity the door was hastily thrown open and a small elderly blueeyed gentleman followed by a man of gigantic stature entered the chamber my dear sir cried the gentleman making a courteous deprecatory gesture with his palms spread outward we owe you a million apologies there has been a most lamentable mistake a mistake said lynde haughtily mistake is a mild term to apply to an outrage your indignation is just still it was a mistake and one i would not have had happen for the world i am dr pendegrast the superintendent of this asylum this is an asylum an asylum for the insane returned dr pendegrast i do not know how to express my regret at what has occurred i can only account for the unfortunate affair and throw myself upon your generosity will you allow me to explain lynde passed his hand over his forehead in a bewildered way then he looked at the doctor suspiciously lyndes late experience had shaken his faith in the general sanity of his species certainly he said i would like to have this matter explained to me for ill be hanged if i understand it this is an asylum yes sir and you are the superintendent yes sir then naturally you are not a lunatic certainly not said the doctor starting very well i didnt know i am listening to you sir early this morning said dr pendegrast somewhat embarrassed by lyndes singular manner a number of patients whom we had always considered tractable seized the attendants one by one at breakfast and before a general alarm could be given locked them in the cells some of us were still in our bedrooms when the assault began and were there overpowered we chanced to be shorthanded at the time two of the attendants being ill and another absent as i say we were all seized the women attendants and nurses as well and locked up higgins here my headman they put into a straitjacket yes sir spoke up higgins for himself they did so me continued dr pendegrast smiling they confined in the padded chamber lynde looked at him blankly a chamber with walls thickly cushioned to prevent violent patients from inflicting injury on themselves explained the doctor i you see was considered a very bad case indeed meanwhile morton the underkeeper was in the garden and escaped but unfortunately in his excitement he neglected to lock the main gate after him morton gave the alarm to the people in the village who i am constrained to say did not behave handsomely instead of coming to our relief and assisting to restore order which might easily have been done even then they barricaded themselves in their houses in a panic morton managed to get a horse and started for g in the meantime the patients who had made the attack liberated the patients still in confinement and the whole rushed in a body out of the asylum and spread themselves over the village that must have been the crowd i saw in the streets when i sighted the town said lynde thinking aloud if you saw persons in the street returned the doctor they were not the townsfolk they kept very snug i assure you but permit me to finish mr my name is lynde morton continued the doctor bowing having secured several volunteers before reaching g decided to return with what force he had knowing that every instant was precious on his way back he picked up three of the poor wanderers and unluckily picked up you he should not have committed such a stupid error said lynde clinging stoutly to his grievance he ought to have seen that i was not an inmate of the asylum an attendant my dear mr lynde is not necessarily familiar with all the patients he may know only those in his special ward besides you were bareheaded and running and seemed in a state of great cerebral excitement i was chasing a man who had stolen my property morton and the others report that you behaved with great violence of course i did i naturally resented being seized and bound your natural violence confirmed them in their natural suspicion you see assuredly they were to blame but the peculiar circumstances must plead for them but when i spoke to them calmly and rationally my good sir interrupted the doctor if sane people always talked as rationally and sensibly as some of the very maddest of my poor friends sometimes do there would be fewer foolish things said in the world what remark is that the great poet puts into the mouth of polonius speaking of hamlet how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of my dear mr lynde it was your excellent good sense that convicted you by the way i believe you claimed the horse which morton found adrift on the road yes sir it was mine at least i was riding it this morning when the saddlegirth broke and the mare got away from me then of course that was your saddle blaisdell was running off with blaisdell one of our most dangerous patients in fact the only really dangerous patient at present in the establishment yet you should hear him talk sometimes today thank god he happened to be in his shipbuilding mood otherwise i dare not think what he might have done i should be in despair if he had not been immediately retaken oddly enough all the poor creatures except three returned to the asylum of their own will after a brief ramble through the village and the whitehaired old gentleman who looked like a clergyman is he mad mackenzie merely idiotic replied the doctor with the cool professional air and the young girl asked lynde hesitatingly is she a very sad case interrupted dr pendegrast with a tenderer expression settling upon his countenance the saddest thing in the world insane hopelessly so i fear a nameless heaviness fell upon lyndes heart he longed to ask other questions but he did not know how to shape them he regretted that subsequently and now mr lynde said the doctor in your general pardon i wish you to include my unavoidable delay in coming or sending to you when you were brought here i was still in durance vile and higgins was in his straitjacket on being released my hands were full as you can suppose moreover i did not learn at once of your detention the saddle and the valise caused me to suspect that a blunder had been committed i cannot adequately express my regrets in ten minutes continued dr pendegrast turning a fat gold watch over on its back in the palm of his hand where it looked like a little yellow turtle in ten minutes dinner will be served unless you do me the honor to dine with me i shall not believe in the sincerity of your forgiveness thanks said lynde dejectedly i fully appreciate your thoughtfulness i am nearly famished but i do not think i could eat a mouthful here excuse me for saying it but i should have to remain here permanently if i were to stay another hour i quite forgive mr morton and the others lynde went on rising and giving the doctor his hand and i forgive you also since you insist upon being forgiven though i do not know for what if my horse and my traps and my hat really i dont see how they could have helped taking me for a lunatic can be brought together i will go and dine at the tavern half an hour afterward edward lynde dismounted at the steps of the rustic hotel the wooden shutters were down now and the front door stood hospitably open a change had come over the entire village there were knots of persons at the street corners and at garden gates discussing the event of the day there was also a knot of gossips in the hotel barroom to whom the landlord mr zeno dodge was giving a thrilling account of an attack made on the tavern by a maniac who had fancied himself a horse the critter cried mr dodge dramatically was on the pint of springin up the piazzy when martha handed me the shotgun mr dodge was still in a heroic attitude with one arm stretched out to receive the weapon and his eye following every movement of a maniac obligingly personated by the cuspidor between the windows when lynde entered mr dodges arm slowly descended to his side his jaw fell and the narrative broke off short lynde requested dinner in a private room and mr dodge deposed the maid in order to bring in the dishes himself and scrutinize his enigmatical guest in serving the meal the landlord invented countless pretexts to remain in the room after a while lynde began to feel it uncomfortable to have those sharp green eyes continually boring into the back of his head yes he exclaimed wearily i am the man i thought you was glad to see you sir said mr dodge politely this morning you took me for an escaped lunatic i did so fustoff a madman who imagined himself a horse thats what i done said mr dodge contritely an no wonder with that there saddle theyre a very queer lot them crazy chaps theres one on em up there who calls himself abraham lincoln an then theres another who thinks hes a telegraph wire an hes messages runnin up an down him continally these is new potatoes sir early rosers theres no end to their cussed kinks when i see you prancin round under the winder with that there saddle i says at once to martha martha heres a luny a very natural conclusion said lynde meekly wasnt it now and if you had shot me to death said lynde helping himself to another chop i should have been very much obliged to you mr dodge eyed the young man dubiously for a dozen seconds or so comin comin cried mr dodge in response to a seemingly vociferous call which had failed to reach lyndes ear when edward lynde had finished dinner mary was brought to the door under the supervision of a group of spectators assembled on the piazza lynde mounted and turned the mares head directly for rivermouth he had no heart to go any farther due north the joyousness had dropped out of the idle summer journey he had gone in search of the picturesque and the peculiar he had found them and he wished he had not v cinderellas slipper on the comb of the hill where his adventure had begun and culminated it seemed to him now like historic ground edward lynde reined in mary to take a parting look at the village nestled in the plain below already the afternoon light was withdrawing from the glossy chestnuts and drooping elms and the twilight it crept into the valley earlier than elsewhere was weaving its half invisible webs under the eaves and about the gables of the houses but the two red towers of the asylum reached up into the mellow radiance of the waning sun and stood forth boldly they were the last objects his gaze rested upon and to them alone his eyes sent a farewell poor little thing poor little queen of sheba he said softly then the ridge rose between him and the village and shut him out forever nearly a mile beyond the spot where mary had escaped from him that morning edward lynde drew up the mare so sharply that she sunk back on her haunches he dismounted in haste and stooping down with the rein thrown over one arm picked up an object lying in the middle of the road under the horses very hoofs it was on a tuesday morning that lynde reentered rivermouth after an absence of just eight days he had started out fresh and crisp as a new banknote and came back rumpled and soiled and tattered like that same note in a state to be withdrawn from circulation the shutters were up at all the shopwindows in the cobblepaved street and had the appearance of not having been taken down since he left everything was unchanged yet it seemed to lynde that he had been gone a year on wednesday morning when mr bowlsby came down to the bank he was slightly surprised at seeing the young cashier at his accustomed desk to mr bowlsbys brief interrogations then and to miss mildred bowlsbys more categorical questions in the evening lynde offered no very lucid reason for curtailing his vacation travelling alone had not been as pleasant as he anticipated the horse was a nuisance to look after and then the country taverns were snuffy and unendurable as to where he had been and what he had seen he must have seen something and been somewhere in eight days his answers were so evasive that miss mildred was positive something distractingly romantic had befallen the young man if you must know he said one evening i will tell you where i went tell me then i went to constantinople miss mildred found that nearly impertinent there was too an alteration in lyndes manner which cruelly helped to pique her curiosity his frank half satirical but wholly amiable way an armor that had hitherto rendered him invulnerable to miss mildreds coquettish shafts was wanting he was less ready to laugh than formerly and sometimes in the midst of company he fell into absentminded moods instead of being the instigator and leader of picnics up the river he frequently pleaded bank duties as an excuse for not joining such parties he is not at all as nice as he used to be was miss mildreds mental summing up of lynde a fortnight after his return he was in fact unaccountably depressed by his adventure in the hill country he could not get it out of his mind the recollection of details which he had not especially remarked at the time came to him in the midst of his work at the bank sometimes when he turned off the gas at night or just as he was falling asleep the sharp attenuated figure of the shipbuilder limned itself against the blackness of the chamber or the old gentlemans vacuous countenance in its frame of silver hair peered in through the hangings of the bed but more frequently it was the young girls face that haunted lynde he saw her as she came up the sunny road swinging the flower in her hand and looking like one of fra angelicos seraphs or some saint out of an illuminated mediaeval missal then he saw her seated on the horse helpless and piteous with the rude staring men about her if he dreamed it was of her drawing herself up haughtily and saying i am the queen of sheba on two or three nights when he had not been dreaming he was startled out of his slumber by a voice whispering close to his ear i know you too very well you are my husband mr bowlsby and his daughter were the only persons in rivermouth to whom lynde could have told the story of his journey he decided not to confide it to either since he felt it would be vain to attempt to explain the sombre effect which the whole affair had had on him i do not understand what makes me think of that poor girl all the time mused lynde one day as he stood by the writingtable in his sittingroom it cant be this that keeps her in my mind he took up a slipper which was lying on the table in the midst of carved pipes and paperweights and odds and ends it was a very small slipper nearly new with high pointed heel and a square jet buckle at the instep evidently of foreign make and cut after the arch pattern of the slippers we see peeping from the flowered brocade skirts of sir peter lelys fulllength ladies it was such an absurd shoe a toy shoe a child might have worn it it cannot be this said lynde and yet it was that more or less lynde had taken the slipper from his valise the evening he got home and set it on the corner of the desk where it straightway made itself into a cunning ornament the next morning he put it into one of the drawers but the table looked so barren and commonplace without it that presently the thing was back again there it had remained ever since it met his eye every morning when he opened the door of his bedroom it was there when he came home late at night and seemed to be sitting up for him in the reproachful feminine fashion when he was writing his letters there it was with a prim furtive air of looking on it was not like a mere slipper it had traits and an individuality of its own there were moments when the jet beads in the buckle sparkled with a sort of intelligence sitting at night reading under the droplight lynde often had an odd sensation as if the little shoe would presently come tripping across the green tablecloth towards him he had a hundred fanciful humors growing out of that slipper sometimes he was tempted to lock it up or throw it away sometimes he would say to himself half mockingly and half sadly that is your wifes slipper then he would turn wholly sad thinking how tragic that would be if it were really so it was a part of the girls self it had borne her lovely weight it still held the impress of her foot it would not let lynde entirely forget her while it was under his eyes the slipper had stood on the writingtable four or five months an object of consuming curiosity and speculation to the young woman who dusted lyndes chambers when an incident occurred which finally led to its banishment lynde never had visitors there were few men of his age in the town and none was sufficiently intimate with him to come to his rooms but it chanced one evening that a young man named preston dropped in to smoke a cigar with lynde preston had recently returned from abroad where he had been an attache of the american legation at london and was now generally regarded as the prospective proprietor of miss mildred he was an entertaining mercurial young fellow into whose acquaintanceship lynde had fallen at the bowlsbys ah you rogue cried preston gayly picking up the slipper did she give it you who asked lynde with a start devilish snug little foot was it a danseuse no returned lynde freezingly an actress no said lynde taking the slipper from prestons hand and gently setting it back on the writingtable it was not an actress and yet she played a role in a blacker tragedy than any you ever saw on the stage lynde i beg your pardon i spoke thoughtlessly supposing it a light matter dont you see there was no offence said lynde hiding his subtile hurt it was stupid in me said preston the next night relating the incident to miss bowlsby i never once thought it might be a thing connected with the memory of his mother or sister dont you see i took it for a half sentimental souvenir of some flirtation mr lyndes mother died when he was a child and he never had a sister said miss bowlsby thoughtfully i shouldnt wonder she added irrelevantly after a pause at what miss mildred at anything one of those womanly intuitions which set mere manlogic at defiance was come to whisper in miss bowlsbys ear that that slipper had performed some part in edward lyndes untold summer experience he was laughing at you mr preston he was grossly imposing on your unsophisticated innocence really is he as deep as that he is very deep said miss bowlsby solemnly on his way home from the bank one afternoon in that same week lynde overtook miss mildred walking and accompanied her a piece down the street mr lynde shall you go on another horseback excursion next summer she asked without prelude i havent decided but i think not of course you ought to go why of course miss mildred why because because dont ask me but i do ask you you insist positively well then how will you ever return cinderella her slipper if you dont go in search of her lynde bit his lip and felt that the blackest criminals of antiquity were as white as driven snow compared with preston the prince in the story you know continued miss bowlsby with her smile of ingenue hunted high and low until he found her again that prince was a very energetic fellow said lynde hastily putting on his old light armor possibly i should not have to travel so far from home he added with a bow i know at least one lady in rivermouth who has a cinderella foot she has two of them mr lynde responded miss mildred dropping him a courtesy the poor little slippers doom was sealed the edict for its banishment had gone forth if it were going to be the towns talk he could not keep it on his writingdesk as soon as lynde got back to his chambers he locked up cinderellas slipper in an old trunk in a closet seldom or never opened the enchantment whatever it was was broken although he missed the slipper from among the trifles scattered over his table its absence brought him a kind of relief he less frequently caught himself falling into brown studies the details of his adventure daily grew more indistinct the picture was becoming a mere outline it was fading away he might have been able in the course of time to set the whole occurrence down as a grotesque dream if he had not now and then beheld deacon twombly driving by the bank with mary attached to the battered family carryall mary was a fact not easily disposed of insensibly lynde lapsed into his old habits the latter part of this winter at rivermouth was unusually gay the series of evening parties and lectures and private theatricals extended into the spring whose advent was signalized by the marriage of miss bowlsby and preston in june lynde ran on to new york for a week where he had a clandestine dinner with his uncle at delmonicos and bade goodby to flemming who was on the eve of starting on a protracted tour through the east i shall make it a point to visit the land of the sabaeans said flemming with his great cheery laugh and discover if possible the unknown site of the ancient capital of sheba lynde had confided the story to his friend one night coming home from the theatre once more at rivermouth edward lynde took up the golden threads of his easy existence but this life of ideal tranquillity and contentment was not to be permitted him one morning in the latter part of august he received a letter advising him that his uncle had had an alarming stroke of apoplexy the letter was followed within the hour by a telegram announcing the death of david lynde vi beyond the sea in the early twilight of a july evening in the year two young americans neither dreaming of the others presence came face to face on the steps of a hotel on the quai du montblanc at geneva the two men one of whom was so bronzed by eastern suns that his friend looked pallid beside him exchanged a long incredulous stare then their hands met and the elder cried out of all men in the world flemming exclaimed the other eagerly i thought you were in egypt so i was a month ago what are you doing over here ned i dont know to tell the truth you dont know laughed flemming enjoying yourself i suppose the supposition is a little rash said edward lynde i have been over nearly a year quite a year in fact after uncle davids death poor old fellow i got the news at smyrna after he was gone and the business of the estate was settled i turned restless at rivermouth it was cursedly lonesome i hung on there awhile and then i came abroad a rich man my father wrote me i have had no letters from you your uncle treated you generously ned did he not always treat me generously said lynde with a light coming into his face and instantly dying out again yes he left me a pile of money and a heartache i can hardly bear to talk of it even now and it will be two years this august but come up to my room by jove i am glad to see you how is it you are in geneva i was thinking about you yesterday and wondering whether you were drifting down the nile in a dahabeeah or crossing the desert on a dromedary of course you have hunted tigers and elephants did you kill anything i havent killed anything but time i was always a dead shot at that lynde passed his arm through flemmings and the two friends mounted the staircase of the hotel how is it you are in geneva repeated lynde by luck answered flemming i am going home in a zigzag way ive been obliged to take a reef in my eastern itinerary the fact is i have had a letter from the old gentleman rather suggesting it i believe he has availed himself of my absence to fall into financial difficulties why i thought he was rolling in wealth no he is rolling in poverty as nearly as i can make out well not so bad as that nothing is ever as bad as it pretends to be but he has met with heavy losses i shall find letters in london and learn all about it he wrote me not to hurry that a month or two would make no difference when i got to munich i thought i would take a peep at switzerland while i had the opportunity i have done a good piece from lindau to lucerne from lucerne to martigny by way of the furca through the tete noire pass to chamouni and from chamouni here while flemming was speaking lynde unlocked a door at the end of the hall and ushered him into a sittingroom with three windows each opening upon a narrow balcony of its own sit there old fellow said lynde wheeling an easychair to the middle window and look through my glass at the view before it takes itself off it is not often as fine as it is this evening in front of the hotel the blue waters of the rhone swept under the arches of the pont des bergues to lose themselves in the turbid glacierborn arve a mile below the town between the pont des bergues and the pont du montblanc lay the island of jean jacques rousseau linked to the quay by a tiny chain bridge opposite upon the right bank of the rhone stretched the handsome facades of tileroofed buildings giving one an idea of the ancient quarter which a closer inspection dispels for the streets are crooked and steep and the houses except those lining the quays squalid it was not there however that the eye would have lingered far away seen an incredible distance in the transparent evening atmosphere mont blanc and its massed group of snowy satellites lifted themselves into the clouds all those luminous battlements and turrets and pyramids the mole the grandes jorasses the aiguilles du midi the dent du geant the aiguilles dargentiere were now suffused with a glow so magically delicate that the softest tint of the blush rose would have seemed harsh and crude in comparison you have to come away from mont blanc to see it said flemming lowering the glass when i had my nose against it at chamouni i didnt see it at all it overhung me and smothered me old boy reaching up his hand to lynde who was leaning on the back of the chair who would ever have thought that we two flemming stopped short and looked earnestly into his comrades face why ned i didnt notice how thin and pale you are are you ill the color which had mantled lyndes cheeks in the first surprise and pleasure of meeting his friend had passed away leaving indeed a somewhat haggard expression on the young mans countenance ill not that i know is anything wrong there is nothing wrong replied lynde with some constraint that is to say nothing very wrong for a month or six weeks i have been occupied with a matter that has rather unsettled me more perhaps than i ought to have allowed what is that it doesnt signify dont lets speak of it but it does signify you are keeping something serious from me out with it well the truth is said lynde after a moments hesitation it is something serious and nothing very positive thats the perplexing part of it you are not making it clear to me i dont know that i can flemming try then lynde reflected a few seconds with his eyes fixed on the remote mountain lines imperceptibly melting into the twilight do you remember our walk home from the theatre one night two or three days before you sailed from new york perfectly replied flemming do you recollect my telling you of a queer thing that happened to me up in the new hampshire hills your encounter with the little lunatic perfectly dont said lynde shrinking as if some sharp instrument had pierced him she is here here exclaimed flemming half rising from the chair and glancing towards a draped door which connected the suite of apartments not in these rooms said lynde with a short laugh but in geneva in this hotel you do not mean it when i say it is she im not sure of it of course it isnt thats what i say and the next moment i know it is and is this your trouble yes answered lynde knitting his brows i felt that i shouldnt make it clear to you i am afraid you havent ned what earthly difference does it make to you whether or not its the same girl what difference cried lynde impetuously what difference when i love the very ground she walks on oh you love her which one dont laugh at me flemming i am not laughing said flemming looking puzzled and anxious it is not possible ned you have allowed yourself to go and get interested in a a person not right in her mind miss denham is as sane as you are then miss denham is it cannot be the girl you told me about thats the point i dont see why there should be any confusion on that point dont you come let us go to the bottom of this you have fallen in with a woman in switzerland and you suspect her of being a girl you met years ago in new hampshire under circumstances which render her appearance here nearly an impossibility as i am not a man of vivid imagination that floors me what makes you think them identical a startling personal resemblance age inflection of voice manner even a certain physical peculiarity a scar then what makes you doubt everything well thats comprehensive at all events the very fact of her being here the physician at the asylum said that that girls malady was hopeless miss denham has one of the clearest intellects i ever knew she is a linguist an accomplished musician and what is more rare a girl who has moved a great deal in society or at least has travelled a great deal and has not ceased to be an unaffected fresh candid girl an american of course didnt i say so the other may have been a sister then or a cousin suggested flemming that would account for the likeness which possibly you exaggerate it was in wasnt it i have been all over that miss denham is an only child she never had a cousin today she is precisely what the other would have been with restored health and three years added to her seventeen or eighteen upon my word ned this is one of the oddest things i ever heard i feel though that you have got yourself into an unnecessary snarl where does miss denham come from she is not travelling alone how did you meet her tell me the entire story there is nothing to tell or next to nothing i met the denhams here six weeks ago it was at the table dhote two ladies came in and took places opposite me a middleaged lady and a young one i did not notice them until they were seated it was the voice of the younger lady that attracted me i looked up and there was the queen of sheba the same eyes the same hair the same face though not so pale and fuller the same form only the contours filled out i put down my knife and fork and stared at her she flushed for i fancy i stared at her rather rudely and a faint mark like a star came into her cheek and faded i saw it as distinctly as i saw it the day she passed me on the country road swinging the flower in her hand by jove its a regular romance strawberry mark and all if you dont take this seriously said lynde frowning i am done go on i shall never know how i got through the endless courses of that dinner it was an empty pantomime on my part as soon as it was over i rushed to the hotel register the only entry among the new arrivals which pointed to the two ladies was that of mrs william denham and niece united states you can understand flemming how i was seized with a desire to know those two women i had come to geneva for a day or so but i resolved to stay here a month if they stayed or to leave the next hour if they left in short i meant to follow them discreetly it was an occupation for me they remained in the course of a week i knew the denhams to speak to them when we met of a morning in the english garden a fortnight later it seemed to me that i had known them half my life they had come across the previous november they had wintered in italy and were going to chamouni some time in july where mr denham was to join them then they were to make an extended tour of switzerland accompanied by an old friend of the family a professor or a doctor or something who was in the south of france for his health miss denham her name is ruth is an orphan and was educated mostly over here when the denhams are at home they live somewhere in the neighborhood of orange new jersey there are all the simple exasperating facts i can add nothing to them if i were to tell you how this girl has perplexed and distressed me by seeming to be and seeming not to be that other person how my doubts and hopes have risen and fallen from day to day even from hour to hour it would be as uninteresting to you as a barometrical record but this is certain when miss denham and i part at chamouni as i suppose we shall this world will have come to an end so far as i am concerned the world doesnt come to an end that way when one is twentysix does she like you ned how can i say she does not dislike me we have seen very much of each other we have been together some portion of each day for more than a month but ive never had her a moment alone the aunt is always present we are like old friends with a difference i see the aunt makes the difference no flirting allowed on the premises miss denham is not a girl to flirt with she is very selfpossessed with just a suspicion of haughtiness personally tall slight a sort of dusky eastern beauty with the clear warm colors of a new england september twilight not like the brunettes on this side who are apt to have thick complexions saving their presence i say she is not a girl to flirt with and yet with that sensitivecut mouth and those deep eyes she could do awful things in the way of tenderness if she had a mind to shes a puzzle with her doves innocence and her serpents wisdom all women are problems i suppose every married man of us goes down to his grave with his particular problem not quite solved flemming gave a loud laugh the every married man of us tickled him yes said he they are all daughters of the sphinx and past finding out is miss denham an invalid he asked after a pause no she is not strong delicate rather of the pure type of american youngwomanhood more spirit than physique but not an invalid unless you have let a morbid fancy run away with you ned this lady and the other one are two different persons if i could only believe it said lynde i do believe it at times then some gesture some fleeting expression a turn of the head the timbre of her voice and there she is again the next moment i am ready to laugh at myself couldnt you question the aunt how could i you couldnt i have thought of that doctor at the asylum what in the devil was his name i might write to him but i shrink from doing it i have been brutal enough in other ways i am ashamed to confess to what unforgivable expedients i have resorted to solve my uncertainty once we were speaking of genoa where the denhams had spent a week i turned the conversation on the church of st lorenzo and the relic in the treasury there the sacra catino a supposed gift to solomon from the queen of sheba miss denham listened with the calmest interest she had not seen it the day she visited the church she was sorry to have missed that then the aunt changed the subject but whether by accident or design i was unable for the soul of me to conjecture good god flemming could this girl have had some terrible swift malady which touched her and passed and still hangs over her an hereditary doom then shes the most artful actress that ever lived i should say the leading lady of the theatre francais might go and take lessons of her but if that were so ned if that were so said lynde slowly a great pity would be added to my love you would not marry her lynde made no reply the night had settled down upon geneva while the friends were talking the room was so dark they could not distinguish each other but flemming was conscious of a pale set face turned towards him in the obscurity in the same way that he was conscious of the forlorn whiteness of mont blanc looming up out yonder unseen it was dark in the chamber but the streets were gay now with the life of a midsummer night interminable lines of lamps twinkled on the bridges and along the quays the windows of the cafes on the opposite bank of the rhone were brilliant with gas jets boats bearing merry cargoes to and from the lake passed up and down the river the street running under the hotel balcony was crowded with loungers and a band was playing in the english garden from time to time a strain of music floated up to the window where the two men were sitting neither had spoken for some minutes when lynde asked his friend where he was staying at the schweizerhof replied flemming i always take the hotel nearest the station few americans go there i fancy it is wonderfully and fearfully swiss i was strolling in here to look through the register for some american autographs when i ran against you you had better bring your traps over here it would not be worth while i am booked for paris tomorrow night ned come with me i cant flemming i have agreed to go to chamouni with the denhams dont that is like advising a famishing man not to eat his last morsel of food i have a presentiment it will all end there i never had a presentiment before i had a presentiment once said flemming impressively i had a presentiment that a certain number it was number twentyseven would draw the prize in a certain lottery i went to the office and number twentyseven was one of the two numbers unsold i bought it as quick as lightning i dreamed of number twentyseven three successive nights and the next day it drew a blank that has the ring of the old flemming cried lynde with an unforced laugh i am glad that i have not succeeded in turning all your joyous gold into lead im not always such dull company as i have been tonight with my moods and my presentiments i owe them partly perhaps to not seeing miss denham today the aunt having a headache you were not in a rollicking humor when i picked you up i had been cruising about town all the morning alone making assaults on the musee fol the botanic garden and the jewish synagogue in the afternoon i had wrecked myself on rousseaus island where i sat on a bench staring at pradiers poor statue of jean jacques until i fancied that the ugly bronze cannibal was making mouths at me when the aunt has a headache i suffer flemming you must see miss denham if only for a moment of course i should like to see her ned you do not leave until evening lynde said reflecting i think i can manage a little dinner for tomorrow now let us take a breath of fresh air i know the queerest old nook in the rue de chantpoulet where the bavarian beer is excellent and all the company smoke the most enormous porcelain pipes havent i hit one of your weaknesses you have hit a brace vii the denhams when edward lynde returned to the hotel that night after parting with flemming at the head of a crooked gablehung street leading to the schweizerhof the young man regretted that he had said anything on the subject of the denhams or rather that he had spoken of the painful likeness which had haunted him so persistently the friends had spent the gayest of evenings together at a small greentopped table in one corner of the smoky cafe over their beer and cheese they had chatted of old days at boardingschool and college and this contact with the large healthy nature of flemming which threw off depression as sunshine dissipates mist had sent lyndes vapors flying nothing was changed in the circumstances that had distressed him yet some way a load had removed itself from his bosom he was sorry he had mentioned that dark business at all as he threaded the deserted streets it was long after midnight he planned a dinner to be given in his rooms the next day and formulated a note of invitation to the ladies which he would write when he got back to the hotel and have in readiness for early delivery in the morning lynde was in one of those lightsome moods which in that varying month had not unfrequently followed a day of doubt and restless despondency as he turned into the quai des bergues he actually hummed a bar or two of opera he had not done that before in six weeks they had been weeks of inconceivable torment and pleasure to lynde he had left home while still afflicted by david lyndes death since the uncles illadvised marriage the intercourse between them as the reader knows had all but ceased they had met only once and then as if to bid each other farewell but the ties had been very close after all in the weeks immediately following his guardians death the young man occupied with settling the estate of which he was one of the executors scarcely realized his loss but when he returned to rivermouth a heavy sense of loneliness came over him the crowded happy firesides to which he was free seemed to reproach him for his lack of kinship he stood alone in the world there was no more reason why he should stay in one place than in another his connection with the bank unnecessary now from a money point of view grew irksome the quietude of the town oppressed him he determined to cut adrift from all and go abroad an educated american with no deeper sorrow than lyndes cannot travel through europe for the first time at least with indifference three months in germany and france began in lynde a cure which was completed by a winter in southern italy he had regained his former elasticity of spirits and was taking life with a relish when he went to geneva there he fell in with the denhams in the manner he described to flemming an habitual shyness and perhaps a doubt of flemmings sympathetic capacity had prevented lynde from giving his friend more than an outline of the situation in his statement lynde had omitted several matters which may properly be set down here that first day at the table dhote and the next day when he was able more deliberately to study the young woman edward lynde had made no question to himself as to her being the same person he had seen in so different and so pathetic surroundings it was unmistakably the same he had even had a vague apprehension she might recognize him and had been greatly relieved to observe that there was no glimmer of recognition in the wellbred careless glance which swept him once or twice no he had passed out of her memory with the other shapes and shadows how strange they should meet again thousands of miles from new england how strange that he alone of all the crowded city should know there had been a dark episode in this girls history what words she had spoken to him and forgotten she who now sat there robed in the beauty of her reason it was a natural interest and a deep interest certainly that impelled lynde to seek the acquaintance of the two ladies on the third day a chance service rendered the elder she had left a glove or a handkerchief beside her plate at table and lynde had followed her with it from the diningroom placed him upon speaking terms they were his countrywomen he was a gentleman and the surface ice was easily broken three days afterwards lynde found himself oddly doubting his first conviction this was not that girl the likeness was undeniable the same purpleblack hair the same long eyelashes a very distinctive feature in voice and carriage too miss denham curiously recalled the other and that mark on miss denhams cheek a birthmark was singular enough but there the analogies ended miss denham was a young woman who obviously had seen much of the world she possessed accomplishments which could have been acquired only by uninterrupted application she spoke french german and italian with unusual purity that intellect as strong and clear as crystal could never have suffered even a temporary blur he was beginning to be amazed at the blunder he had committed when suddenly one evening a peculiar note in her voice accompanied by a certain lifting of the eyelashes a movement he had noticed for the first time but which was familiar to him threw lynde into great perplexity it was that other girl how useless for him to try to blind himself to the truth besides why should he wish to and why should the fact of the identity trouble him to such a degree the next day he was staggered by miss denham alluding incidentally to the circumstance that she and her aunt had passed a part of the spring of in florida that was the date of lyndes adventure the spring of here was almost positive proof that miss denham could not have been in new england at the time lynde did not know what to think of course he was mistaken he must be mistaken and yet there were moments when he could not look at miss denham without half expecting to see the man blaisdell flitting somewhere in the background then there were days when it was impossible for lynde to picture her as anything different from what she now was but whatever conclusion he came to a doubt directly insinuated itself while he was drifting from one uncertainty to another a fortnight elapsed in which his intimacy with the denhams had daily increased they were in geneva for an indefinite time awaiting directions from mr denham the few sights in the city had been exhausted the places of interest in the environs could not be visited by ladies without escort so it fell out that lynde accompanied the denhams on several short excursions to petit and grand sacconnex to the villa tronchin to pregny and mornex these were days which lynde marked with a red letter at the end of the month however he was in the same state of distressing indecision relative to miss denham on one point he required no light he was deeply interested in her so deeply indeed that it had become a question affecting all his future whether or not she was the person he had encountered on his horseback journey three years before if she was but edward lynde had put the question out of his thought that night as he walked home from the cafe his two bars of opera music lasted him to the hotel steps though it was late a great bell somewhere striking two sent its rich reverberation across the lake while he was unlocking his chamber door lynde seated himself at a table and wrote his note to the denhams flemming had promised to come and take coffee with him early the next morning that is to say at nine oclock before flemming arrived lyndes invitation had been despatched and accepted he was rereading miss denhams few lines of acceptance when he heard his friend at the other end of the hall approaching with great strides the thousandth part of a minute late cried flemming throwing open the door theres no excuse for me when a man lives in a city where they manufacture a hundred thousand watches a year thats one watch and a quarter every five minutes day and night its a moral duty to be punctual ned you look like a prize pink this morning i have had such a sleep besides ive just gone through the excitement of laying out the menu for our dinner good heavens i forgot the flowers well go and get them after breakfast theres your coffee cream old man i am in a tremor over this dinner you know it is a maiden effort by the way flemming i wish youd forget what i said about miss denham last evening i was all wrong i told you so what has happened nothing only i have reconsidered the matter and i see i was wrong to let it upset me i saw that from the first some persons said lynde gayly always see everything from the first you belong to the itoldyouso family only you belong to the cheerful branch thank the lord for that a widespreading hopeful disposition is your only true umbrella in this vale of tears i shall have to borrow yours then if it rains heavily for ive none of my own take it my boy my names on the handle on finishing their coffee the young men lighted cigars and sallied forth for a stroll along the bank of the river which they followed to the confluence of the rhone with the arve stopping on the way to leave an order at a florists returning to the hotel some time after midday they found the flowers awaiting them in lyndes parlor where a servant was already laying the cloth there were bouquets for the ladies plates an imposing centrepiece in the shape of a pyramid and a profusion of loose flowers what shall we do with these asked lynde pointing to the latter set em around somewhere said flemming with cheerful vagueness lynde disposed the flowers around the room to the best of his judgment he hung some among the glass pendants of the chandelier gave a nosegay to each of the two gilt statuettes in the corners and piled the remainder about the base of a monumental clock on the mantelpiece thats rather a pretty idea isnt it wreathing time in flowers remarked flemming with honest envy of his friends profounder depth of poetic sentiment i thought it rather neat said lynde who had not thought of it at all in the course of that dinner if two or three unexplained demure smiles flitted over miss denhams face they might perhaps have been indirectly traced to these floral decorations though they pleased her more than if a womans hand had been visible in them flemming said lynde with a severe aesthetic air i dont think that arrangement in the fireplace is quite up to the rest of the room nor i either said flemming who had been silently admiring it for the last ten minutes the fireplace in question was stuffed with a quantity of long delicately spiral shavings sprinkled with silver spangles or flakes of isinglass and covered by a piece of pale blue illusion this device peculiarly genevese was supposed to represent a waterfall take a match and touch it off suggested flemming if we had some more flowers now exactly i am going to the hotel to get myself up like a headwaiter and ill bring some when i come back in an hour afterwards flemming reappeared followed by a youth bearing an immense basket lynde removed the alpine waterfall to an adjoining chamber and built up a huge fire of flamecolored flowers in the grate the two friends were standing in the middle of the room gravely contemplating the effect when a servant opened the door and announced mrs and miss denham a rustle of drapery at the threshold was followed by the entrance of the two ladies in ceremonious dinner toilets lynde had never seen miss denham in any but a dark travellingdress or in such unobtrusive costume as a modest girl may wear at a hotel table he stood motionless an instant seeing her in a trailing robe of some fleecy maizecolored material with a cluster of mossroses at her corsage and a cross of diamonds at her throat she was without other ornament the shade of her dress made her hair and eyes and complexion wonderful lynde was proud to have her look like that for flemming though he was himself affected by a queer impression that this queenly young person was not the simple lovely girl he had known all along he was embarrassed by her unexpected elegance but he covered his embarrassment and his pleasure by presenting his friend to the ladies and ordering the servant to serve the dinner immediately lyndes constraint was only momentary and the others had experienced none flemming indeed had a fleeting surprise at finding in the aunt a woman of thirtyfive or thirtyeight in the indian summer of her beauty lynde had given him the idea of an elderly person with spectacles as to miss denham she had not fallen short of the mental picture flemming had drawn of her which ought to have surprised him no charms or graces in a woman however could much surprise flemming he accepted them as matters of course to him all women were charming in various degrees he had that general susceptibility which preserves us the breed of bachelors the constant victim of a series of minor emotions he was safe from any major passion there was a certain chivalrous air of camaraderie in his manner to women which made them like him sooner or later the denhams liked him instantly even before the potage was removed lynde saw that his dinner was a success the cook may drop dead now if he wants to said lynde to himself he cant spoil anything you are not entirely a stranger to us mr flemming said mrs denham looking at him from behind the floral pyramid which had the happy effect of isolating two guests who sat opposite each other there is a person who goes about foreign lands with no other ostensible mission than to sound your praise you must set down a great deal to filial gratitude returned flemming i have been almost a father to our young friend he tells me that your being here is quite accidental it was one of those fortunate things madam which sometimes befall undeserving persons as if to refute the theory of a special providence on the contrary mr flemming it was miss ruth who spoke it was evidently arranged with the clearest foresight for if you had been a day later perhaps you would not have found your friend in geneva that is if mr lynde goes with us to chamouni you have heard from mr denham then said lynde turning to the aunt we had letters this morning mr denham is in paris where he will remain a week or ten days to show the sights to an old american friend of ours who is to join our party i think i told you mr lynde supposing us to be weary of geneva by this time mr denham suggests that we go on to chamouni and wait there i have left the matter to ruth and she decides in favor of leaving tomorrow if the weather is fine we are not tired of geneva said miss denham it would be ingratitude to mr lynde to admit that but we are longing for a nearer view of the mont blanc groups one ought to know them pretty well after six weeks constant looking at them but the changes in the atmosphere make any certain intimacy impossible at this distance new ranges loom up and disappear the lines alter almost every hour were you ever at the isles of shoals mr flemming flemming started slightly since miss denham entered the room he had given scarcely a thought to lyndes dismal suspicions once or twice they had come into flemmings mind but he had promptly dismissed them the girls inquiry concerning a locality in new hampshire suddenly recalled them and recalled the motive with which lynde had planned the dinner flemming flushed with vexation to think he had lent himself to the arrangement i have spent parts of two summers at the isles of shoals he said then you must have observed the singular changes that seem to take place on the mainland seen from appledore the mirage on the rye and newcastle coasts is it newcastle sometimes does wonderful things frequently you see great cities stretching along the beach some of the houses rising out of the water as in venice only they are gloomy foggy cities like london and not like venice another time you see ships sailing by upside down then it is a chain of hills with peaks and projections that melt away under your eyes leaving only the flat coastline flemming had seen all this and seemed again to see it through the clear medium of the young girls words he had witnessed similar optical illusions in the deserts also which he described to her then he remembered a curious trick of refracted light he had once seen in the sunrise on mount washington and suddenly he found himself asking miss denham if she were acquainted with the interior of new hampshire flemming had put the interrogation without a shadow of design he could have bitten his tongue off an instant after lynde who had been discussing with mrs denham the details of the next days journey looked up quickly and sent flemming a rapid scowl i have never been inland was miss denhams answer my acquaintance with new hampshire is limited to the shoals and the beaches at rye and hampton in visiting the alps first i have i know been very impolite to the mountains and hills of my own land ruth dear mr lynde and i have been speaking of the conveyance for tomorrow shall it be an open or a close carriage an open carriage by all means aunt that would have its inconvenience in case of showers said lynde when april takes her departure from the alps she is said to leave all her capriciousness behind her i suggest a partially closed vehicle you will find a covering comfortable in either rain or shine mr lynde thinks of everything remarked mrs denham he should not allow himself to be dictated to by unforeseeing woman in strict confidence mrs denham i will confess that i have arbitrarily taken this business in hand for nearly a week now i have had my eye on a vehicle that must have been built expressly for us it is driven by a tall distinguished person frosty of mustache and affable of manner evidently a french marquis in disguise what an adroit fellow ned is flemming said to himself i wonder that with all his cleverness he could have got such a foolish notion into his head about this girl we must have the french marquis at any cost said miss denham the truth is remarked lynde i have secured him we are to start at eight ruth which means breakfast at seven is mr lynde equal to a feat like that aunt as i intend to have watchers and sit up all night said lynde i think i can promise to be on hand this matter decided the conversation which had been carried on mostly in duets became general flemming soon recovered from the remorse of his inadvertent question or rather from his annoyance at the thought that possibly it had struck lynde as having an ulterior motive as to lynde he was in the highest humor miss denham had been thoroughly charming to his friend with her serious and candid manner a manner as far removed from reserve as from the thin vivacity of the average young woman of the period her rare smile had been finer than anothers laugh flemming himself went as near to falling in love with her and the aunt as his loyalty to lynde and the supposed existence of a mr denham permitted after a while the window curtains were drawn though it was scarcely dusk without and candles brought then the ices were served and then the coffee and then the clock on the mantelpiece as if it took malicious satisfaction in the fleetness with which time wreathed in flowers slips away from mortals set up a silvery chime it sounded like the angelus rung from some cathedral in the distance to tell flemming that his hour was come he had still to return to the hotel to change his dresssuit before taking the train mrs denham insisted on lynde accompanying his friend to the station though flemming had begged that he might be allowed to withdraw without disturbing the party and even without saying farewell i dont recognize goodbys said he there are too many sorrowful partings in the world already i never give them the slightest encouragement but the ladies persisted in considering the dinner at an end then the two friends conducted the denhams to the door of their own parlor and there took leave of them well said lynde as he seated himself beside flemming in the carriage what do you think of her an unusually agreeable woman returned flemming carelessly she is thirtyeight she looks twentysix and is as pleasant as nineteen i mean miss denham ned i dont care to discuss miss denham when i think of your connecting that lovely lady with a crazy creature you met somewhere or other i am troubled touching your intellect but i do not any longer connect her with that unfortunate girl i told you to put all that out of your mind i dont find it easy to do ned it is so monstrous was not this dinner an arrangement for me to see miss denham and in some way judge her no flemming there was a moment yesterday evening when i had some such wild idea i had grown morbid by being alone all day and brooding over a resemblance which i have not been able to prevent affecting me disagreeably at intervals this resemblance does not exist for you and you have not been subtile enough to put yourself in my place however all that is past it shall not disturb me in future when i invited the denhams to this dinner it was solely that i might present you to the woman i shall marry if she will have me she is too good for you ned i know it thats one thing makes me love her i admire superior people it is my single merit i wouldnt stoop to marry my equal flemming what possessed you to question her about new hampshire we were speaking of the white hills and the question asked itself i wasnt thinking of your puerilities dont imagine it i hope her reply settled you what are you going to do now i shall go with them to chamouni and afterwards my plan is to wait there until the uncle comes that would be an excellent plan if you wanted to marry the uncle if i were you ned i would go and speak with miss denham and then with the aunt who will be worth a dozen uncles if you enlist her on your side she doesnt seem unfriendly to you i will do that flemming returned lynde thoughtfully i am not sure that miss denham would marry me we are disposing of her as if she could be had for the asking i might lose everything by being premature premature ive a mind to stay over and fall in love with her myself i could do it in a day and a half and you have been six weeks about it six weeks i sometimes think i have loved her all my life said lynde from the schweizerhof the young men drove without speaking to the railroad station which they reached just in time for flemming to catch his train with hurriedly exchanged promises to write each other the two parted on the platform then lynde in a serenely happy frame of mind caused himself to be driven to the rue des paquis where he stopped at the chateau of the french marquis which looked remarkably like a liverystable and arranged for a certain travellingcarriage to be at the door of the hotel the next morning at eight viii from geneva to chamouni if there is in all the world as lovely a days ride as that from geneva to chamouni it must be the ride from chamouni to geneva lynde would not have made even this concession the next morning as a heavywheeled carriage containing three travellers and drawn by four stout savoy horses rolled through the grande place and amid a salvo of whiplash and a cloud of dust took the road to bonneville i did not think i cared very much for geneva said miss denham leaning from the carriage side to look back at the little swiss capital set so prettily on the blue edge of lake leman i did not think i cared for it at all yet i leave it with a kind of homeleaving regret that is because you found complete repose there i imagine said lynde geneva is blessed among foreign cities in having no rich picturegalleries or famous cathedrals or mouldy ruins covered all over with moss and history in other places you know one is distracted by the things which it is ones imperative duty to see and by the feeling that a lifetime is too short properly to see them coming from the great italian cities to geneva is like falling asleep after some prolonged mental strain i do not object to waking up and leaving it however i should not mind leaving eden in pleasant company on such a morning as this the company and i dare say the morning are not insensible to your handsome compliment mr lynde the morning was without flaw and the company or at least that part of it represented by miss ruth denham had more color in its cheeks than usual and its dark eyes looked very dark and melting under their long fringes mrs denham was also of a high complexion but having a practical turn of mind she was wondering whether the trunks which rose like a monument from the footboard of the vehicle were quite secure it was a lumbering comfortable concern with red and black wheels and a maroon body set upon complicated springs the back seat occupied by the denhams was protected by a leather hood leaving the forward portion of the carriage open the other seat was amicably shared between lynde and a pile of waterproofs and woollen wraps essentials in switzerland but which the ladies doubtless would have provided themselves if they had been in the tropics on the high box in front sat the driver speaking from time to time in low confidential tones to the four powerful black horses whose harnesses were lavishly hung with flaunting chamoistails and made merry with innumerable silver bells for the last two weeks lynde had been impatiently looking forward to this journey the thought of having an entire day with miss denham on such terms of intimacy as tacitly establish themselves between persons travelling together in the same carriage had softened the prospect of the final parting at chamouni though now he did not intend they should separate there unless she cruelly willed it the nature of miss denhams regard for him lynde had not fathomed she had been frank and friendly with him as she might have been with a cousin or a person much older than herself as he told flemming he had never had her a minute alone the aunt had always accompanied them on their brief walks and excursions about geneva whenever she had been unable to do so the excursion or the walk had been abandoned lynde saw among other gracious things in this days ride a promising opportunity for a teteatete with miss denham here and there along the winding ascents would be tempting footpaths short pine shaded cuts across the rocks by which the carriage could be intercepted farther on these five or ten minutes walks always made enchanting by some unlookedfor grove or grotto or cascade were nearly certain to lure miss ruth to her feet then he would have her to himself for mrs denham seldom walked when she could avoid it to make assurance doubly sure lynde could almost have wished her one of those distracting headaches from which hitherto he had suffered so keenly for the first few miles the road lay through a succession of villas and cultivated gardens indeed these gardens and villas extend all the way to chene where a thin ribbon of a stream the foron draws the boundary line between the canton of geneva and savoy at this point the scenery begins not too aggressively to be picturesque you catch some neat views of the voirons and of the range of the jura lying on your right beyond is the village of annemasse and the chateau of etrambiere with its quartette of towers rises from the foot of the petitsaleve in the bluishgray distance you no longer see mont blanc except at intervals here and there a knot of hamlets clings to some firdotted slope or tries to hide itself away in the bosom of a ravine all these alpine villages bear the same resemblance to one another as so many buttonmoulds of different sizes each has its quaint little church of stucco surrounded by clusters of gray and dingywhite headstones and crosses like a shepherd standing in the midst of his flock each has its bedrabbled main street with a great stone trough into which a stream of icecold water is forever flowing and where comely young women of substantial ankles with their flaxen hair braided down their backs are forever washing linen each has its beggar with a goitre or a wooden leg lying in wait for you and each in turn with its purple and green and red tiled roofs is charming to approach and delightful to get away from after leaving annemasse the road runs up the valley of the arve and crosses a bridge over the menoge then comes the village of nangy and then contamines beyond which on a bold height stand the two wrinkled crumbling towers of the ancient castle of faucigny whence the province takes its name it was at nangy that a pretty incident befell our travellers on the outskirts of the village they met fifty or sixty schoolchildren marching three abreast the girls on one side of the road and the boys on the other the girls each in a coarse blue or yellow frock with a snowy neckerchief pinned over her bosom and a pigtail of hair hanging down her shoulders seemed for all the world like little old women and not one of the little men appeared to be less than a hundred and five years old they suggested a collection of shems and japhets with their wives taken from a lot of toy noahs arks as the carriage rolled between the two files all the funny little women bobbed a simultaneous courtesy and all the little oldfashioned men lifted their hats with the most irresistible gravity conceivable fancy such a thing happening in the united states said lynde if we were to meet such a crowd at home half a dozen urchins would immediately fasten themselves to the hind axle and some of the more playful spirits would probably favor us with a stone or two or a snowball according to the season there comes the curee now said miss denham it is some sundayschool fete as the curee a florid stout person made an obeisance and passed on fanning himself leisurely with his shovelhat his simple round face and white feathery hair put lynde in mind of the hapless old gentleman whom he mistook for the country parson that morning so long ago instantly the whole scene rose before lyndes vision perhaps the character of the landscape through which they were passing helped to make the recollection very vivid there was not a cloud in the pale arch yonder were the farreaching peaks with patches of snow on them and there stretched the same rugged forlorn hills covered with dwarf bushes and sentinelled with phantomlike pines an odd expression drifted across lyndes countenance what are you smiling at mr lynde in that supremely selfish manner inquired mrs denham looking at him from under her tilted sunumbrella was i smiling it was at those droll little beggars they bowed and courtesied in an unconcerned wooden way as if they were moved by some ingenious piece of swiss clockwork the stiff old curee too had an air of having been wound up and set agoing i could almost hear the creak of his mainspring i was smiling at that perhaps and thinking how strongly the scenery of some portions of our own country resembles this part of switzerland do you think so i had not remarked it this is not the least like anything in the adirondack region for example observed miss ruth it may be a mere fancy of mine returned lynde however we have similar geological formations in the mountainous sections of new england the same uncompromising gothic sort of pines the same wintry bleakness that leaves its impress even on the midsummer a body of water tumbling through a gorge in new hampshire must be much like a body of water tumbling through a gorge anywhere else undoubtedly all mountain scenery has many features in common mrs denham said but if i were dropped down on the white hills softly from a balloon let us say i should know in a second i was not in switzerland i should like to put you to the test in one spot i am familiar with said lynde i should not like to be put to the test just at present rejoined mrs denham i am very simple in my tastes and i prefer the alps where in new england will you see such a picture as that asked miss ruth pointing to a village which lay in the heart of the valley shut in on the right by the jagged limestone rocks of the brezon and on the left by the grassy slopes of the mole our rural towns lack color and architecture said lynde they are mostly collections of square or oblong boxes painted white i wish we had just one village composed exclusively of rosytiled houses with staircases wantonly running up on the outside and hooded windows and airy balconies hanging out here and there where you dont expect them i would almost overlook the total lack of drainage which seems to go along with these carved eaves and gables touched in with their blues and browns and yellows this must be bonnevine we are coming to we change horses here in a few minutes they swept through an avenue of noble trees and stopped at the doorstep of an inn alive with passengers by the diligence just arrived from sallanches on its way to geneva lynde was beginning to feel a trifle out of spirits the journey thus far had been very pleasant but it had not wholly fulfilled his expectations the denhams had occupied themselves with the scenery they had not been much inclined to talk and lynde had found no opportunity to make himself especially agreeable they had spoken several times of flemming in a vein of eulogy lynde loved flemming but flemming as a topic of conversation possessed no particular advantage over landscape miss denham had never looked so lovely to lynde as she did this day he was glad to get her again in that closely fitting drab travellingdress laced up to the shapely white throat a sense of great comfort had stolen over him the two or three times when she had sunk back in the carriage cushions and let her eyes dwell upon him contemplatively for a moment he was beginning to hate mrs denham and he thoroughly loathed bonneville where a polyglot crowd of tourists came flocking into the small waitingroom just as miss ruth was putting up her hair and unconsciously framing for lynde a nevertobeforgotten picture in the little cracked innmirror passengers by diligence usually dine at bonneville a fact which lynde had ascertained when he selected cluses nine miles beyond as the restingplace for his own party they were soon on the road again with the black horses turned into roan traversing the level meadow lands between the brezon and the mole with each mile now the landscape took on new beauty and wildness the superb mountains some with cloudy white turrets some thrusting out huge snowpowdered prongs and others tapering to steely daggerpoints hemmed them in on every side here they came more frequently on those sorrowful roadside cairns surmounted by a wooden cross with an obliterated inscription and a shrivelled wreath marking the spot where some peasant or mountaineer had been crushed by a landslide or smothered in the merciless winter drift as the carriage approached cluses the road crept along the lips of precipices and was literally overhung by the dizzy walls of the brezon crossing the arve you are always crossing the arve or some mad torrent on your way from geneva to chamouni the travellers entered the town of cluses and alighted at one of those small swiss hotels which continually astonish by their tidiness and excellence in spite of the intermittent breeze wandering down from the regions above the snowline the latter part of the ride had been intensely hot the cool shadowy room with its table ready laid for dinner near the latticed window was a welcome change to the three dusty voyagers as they were ushered into it by the german landlord whose round head thinly thatched with whiteybrown hair gave him the appearance of having been left out over night in a hoar frost it was a refreshment in itself to look at him so crisp and cool with that blinding afternoon glare lying on the heated mountainslopes i could be contented here a month said mrs denham throwing off her bonnet and seating herself in the embrasure of the window the marquis allows us only three quarters of an hour lynde observed he says we cannot afford to lose much time if we want to reach chamouni before sundown chamouni will wait for us but the sunset wont lynde had a better reason than that for wishing to press on it was between there and magland or rather just beyond magland that he proposed to invite miss denham to walk the wonderful cascade of arpenaz though it could be seen as well from the carriage was to serve as pretext of course he would be obliged to include mrs denham in his invitation and he had sufficient faith in the inconsistency of woman not to rely too confidently on her declining as she never walks shell come along fast enough was lyndes grim reflection he had by no means resolved on what he should say to miss ruth if he got her alone in the ten minutes walk which would be almost equivalent to a first interview he could not say much he could tell her how grieved he was at the thought of the approaching separation and tell her in such a manner as would leave her in no great doubt as to the state of his feelings but whether he went so far as that was a problem which he intended to let chance solve for him lynde was standing on the inn steps with his afterdinner cheroot meditatively blowing circles of smoke into the air when the carriage drove round from the stable and the denhams appeared in the doorway the young woman gave lynde an ungloved hand as he assisted her to the seat the slight pressure of her fingers and the touch of her rings were possessions which he retained until long after the carriage had passed that narrow defile near the stalactite cavern in the balme where a couple of tiresome fellows insist on letting off a small cannon for you to awaken a very disobliging old echo who refuses to repeat anything more than twice what a magic there is in hands in some hands lynde could have held mrs denhams hand a fortnight without getting anything so tangible as that fleeting touch of miss ruths is the grotto worth seeing mrs denham asked with a speculative glance up the mountain side it is an hours hard climb and scarcely pays replied lynde appalled by this indication of alpine enterprise i visited it the first time i came over the road you get a good look at the peaks of mont douron on the other side of the valley and thats all the grotto itself is not remarkable but i think it will be worth while to halt a moment when we come to the fall of nant darpenaz that is really marvellous it is said to be nearly as fine as the staubbach as miss ruth leaned back in the cushions lazily fastening the third button of her glove with a hairpin there was just the faintest glimmer of humor in the eyes that looked up into the young mans face he was being read and he knew it his dark intentions in regard to that waterfall were probably as legible to her as if they had been printed in greatprimer type on his forehead on two or three occasions at geneva she had wrested his unworded thought from him with the same effortless sorcery lynde evaded her look and studied a spirelike peak on his left i shall have an air of detected villainy now when i ask her he mused thats the first shade of coquetry i ever saw in her if she accepts my invitation without the aunt she means either to flirt with me or give me the chance to speak to her seriously which is it to be miss ruth i wonder if she is afraid of mrs denham sometimes it seems to me she would be a different girl if it were not for the presence of the aunt by and by at a bend of the road after passing magland the waterfall became visible in the distance the cascade of nant darpenaz is one of the highest falls in savoy and if it is not the most beautiful one can still well afford having seen that not to see the others it is not a large volume of water except when swollen by rains as it happened to be this day but its plunge from the dizzy brown cliff is the gracefulest thing in the world the curiously stratified face of the precipice is concave and the water has a fall of several hundred feet to reach the slope which indeed it seems never to reach for before the stream has accomplished half the descent it is broken into fine spray and flaunts loosely in the wind like a veil of the most delicate lace or when the sunlight drifts through it a wondrously wrought persian scarf there it appears to hang miraculously suspended in midair while in fact it descends in imperceptible vapors to the slope where it reforms and becomes a furious little torrent that dashes across the road under a bridge and empties itself into the arve the carriageroad skirts the base of the mountain and offers numberless fine views of the cascade as you approach or leave it it was directly in front of the fall half a mile distant though it did not look so far that the driver in obedience to previous instruction from lynde drew up the horses and halted at that instant the sunshine slanted across the fall and dashed it with prismatic colors it is almost too exquisite to look at said mrs denham it makes one doubt ones own eyes i saw it once lynde said when i thought the effect even finer i was induced by some pleasant english tourists to stop over night at magland and we walked up here in the moonrise you cant imagine anything so lovely as that long strip of gossamer unfolding itself to the moonlight there was an english artist with us who made a sketch of the fall but he said a prettier thing about it than his picture what was that inquired miss ruth he called it penelopes web because it is always being unravelled and reknitted that artist mistook his profession folks often do said lynde i know painters who ought to be poets and poets who ought to be bricklayers why bricklayers because i fancy that bricklaying makes as slight drain on the imagination as almost any pursuit in life speaking of poets and waterfalls do you remember byrons daring simile in manfred he compares a certain waterfall at the foot of the jungfrau to the tail of the pale horse ridden by death in the apocalypse mrs denham said lynde abruptly the marquis tells me theres a delightful short cut through the rocks here which strikes into the road a mile further on let us take it then answered mrs denham settling herself comfortably in the cushions it is a footpath explained lynde oh our reputation as great american travellers will suffer mrs denham if we fail to do a bit of switzerland on foot rather than have that happen i would undertake the expedition alone it would be mere martyrdom though without company as lynde turned the handle of the carriage door and planted his foot on the first step he ventured a glance at miss ruth who was sitting there with a face as impenetrable as that of the memphian sphinx certainly if our reputation is at stake exclaimed mrs denham rising with alacrity lynde could not help his clouded countenance no she added slowly sinking back into the seat ive no ambition as an explorer i really have not and miss denham said lynde drawing a scarcely repressed breath of relief oh ruth can go if she likes replied mrs denham provided it is not too far it is hardly an eighth of a mile across said lynde you will find us waiting for you at the opposite end of the cut unless you drive rapidly it is more than a mile by the road do you wish to go ruth miss denham hesitated an instant and then answered by rising impulsively and giving her hand to lynde evidently her first intention had been to refuse in a moment more she was standing beside him and the carriage was lazily crawling up the hill with mrs denham looking back through her glass at the cascade a dozen rude steps partly artificial and partly formed by the strata of the limestone bank led from the roadside up to the opening of the footway for thirty or forty yards the fernfringed path was too narrow to admit of two persons walking abreast miss denham with her skirts gathered in one hand went first picking her way over the small loose stones rendered slippery by the moss and lynde followed on in silence hardly able to realize the success of the ruse which had come so near being a failure his companion was equally preoccupied once she stopped for lynde to detach her dress from a grasping twig and once to pluck one of those pallid waxen flowers which sometimes dauntlessly find a footing even among the snowdrifts of the higher alps the air was full of the resinous breath of the pines whose boughs meeting and interlacing overhead formed an arabesqued roof through the openings of which the afternoon sunshine sifted as if through stained glass with the slender stems of the trees rising on each side in the semitwilight the grove was like the transept of a cathedral it seemed a profanation to speak in such a place lynde could have wandered on forever in contented silence with that tall pliant figure in its severely cut drapery moving before him as he watched the pure outline defining itself against the subdued light he was reminded of a colored basrelief he had seen on a certain egyptian vase in the museum at naples presently the path widened a brook babbled somewhere ahead among the rocks and the grove abruptly ended as lynde stepped to miss denhams side he heaved a deep involuntary sigh what a sigh mr lynde she cried swiftly turning upon him with a surprised smile it was scarcely complimentary it was not exactly a compliment it was an unpremeditated monody on the death of this day which has flown too soon you are very ready with your monody it yet lacks three or four hours of sunset when one might probably begin to lament i am enjoying it all too much to have a regret do you know i thought you were not enjoying it the journey i mean you have not spoken a hundred words since we left geneva that was a proof of my perfect enjoyment as you would know if you knew me better fine scenery always affects me like music and with jessica i am never merry when i hear sweet music besides mr lynde i was forming a plan a plan a dark conspiracy is the spirit of lucretia borgia present in which you are to be chief conspirator mr lynde miss denham the person is dead either by steel or poison it is all one to me i am equally familiar with both methods as the girl lifted up her eyes in a halfserious halfamused way and gave him a look in which gentleness and a certain shadow of hauteur were oddly blended lynde started in spite of himself it was the very look of the poor little queen of sheba with your bowl and dagger and monody said miss denham breaking into one of her rare laughs you are in full tragedy this afternoon i am afraid my innocent plot will seem very tame to you in the face of such dreadful things i promise beforehand to regard it as the one important matter in the world what is it nothing more than this i want you to insist that aunt gertrude and i ought to make the ascent of montanvert and visit the mer de glace before uncle denham arrives why would he object i do not think anything would induce him to trust either of us on one of those narrow mulepaths but everybody goes up montanvert as a matter of course the bridleway is perfectly safe uncle denham once witnessed a painful accident on the wetterhorn indeed he himself barely escaped death and any suggestion of mountain climbing that cannot be done on wheels always meets a negative from him i suspect my aunt will not strongly favor the proposal but when i make it i shall depend on you to sustain me i shall surely do so miss denham i have had this same excursion in my mind all along i was wondering how i should get the chance to ask the favor of you when that special providence which your friend mr flemming pretends not to believe in managed it for me it wasnt i then but providence that invited you to walk it looks like it mr lynde but at first you were disposed to reject the providential aid i hesitated about leaving aunt gertrude alone if you had refused me there would have been no end to my disappointment this walk though it is sixty or seventy miles too short is the choicest thing in the whole journey come mr lynde that is an improvement on your sigh does it occur to you that this is the first time we have chanced to be alone together in all these weeks yes said miss ruth simply it is the first time i am a great admirer of mrs denham i do not see how you can help being she is charming and she likes you but sometimes i have wished that that mr denham was here why asked miss ruth regarding him full in the face because then may be she would have been less devoted to you miss denham did not reply for a moment my aunt is very fond of me she said gravely she never likes to have me absent an hour from her side i can understand that said lynde with an innocent air the girl glanced at him quickly and went on she adopted me when i was only three years old we have never been separated since she lived in paris all the time i was at school there though she did not like paris as a residence she would make any sacrifice for me that a mother would make for a daughter she has been mother and sister to me i cannot overpay her devotion by any unselfishness of mine as she spoke lynde caught a hateful glimpse of the road through the stubby pinetrees beyond it appeared to him only two minutes ago that he was assisting miss denham to mount the stone steps at the other extremity of the footpath and now he was to lose her again she was with him alone for perhaps the last time miss ruth said lynde with sudden earnestness in his voice he had never before addressed her as miss ruth she raised her eyes furtively to his face miss ruth oh theres the carriage mr lynde exclaimed miss denham releasing the arm she had accepted a few paces back and hurrying down the path which here narrowed again as at the entrance to the grove and there is aunt gertrude she added half turning to lynde with a rich bloom on her cheeks looking as distressed as if we had slipped over some precipice but we have not have we mr lynde no we havent slipped over any precipices answered lynde with a curt laugh i wish we had he muttered to himself she has dragged me through that grove and over those stones and without preventing me has not permitted me to breathe the least word of love to her i dont know how she did it that girls the most consummate coquette i ever saw i am a child in her hands i believe im beginning to be afraid of her miss ruth was already in the carriage pinning the alpine flower to the corsage of her aunts dress when lynde reached the steps mrs denhams features expressed no very deep anxiety that he could discover that was clearly a fiction of miss ruths lynde resumed his place on the front seat and the horses started forward he was amused and vexed at the inconsequence of his interview with miss denham and did not know whether to be wholly vexed or wholly amused he had at least broken the ice and it would be easier for him to speak when another opportunity offered she had understood and had not repulsed him she had merely evaded him perhaps he had been guilty of a mismove in attempting to take her at a disadvantage he was too discreet to dream of proposing any more walks a short cut was plainly not the most direct way to reach miss denham she was in livelier spirits now than she had been in at any time during the day the exercise has done you good ruth remarked mrs denham i am sorry i did not accept mr lyndes invitation myself mr lynde was also politely sorry and miss ruth contributed her regrets with an emphasis that struck lynde as malicious and overdone shortly before arriving at st martin miss ruth broached her montanvert project which as she had prophesied was coldly received by the aunt lynde hastened to assure mrs denham that the ascent was neither dangerous nor difficult even guides were not necessary though it was convenient to have them to lead the animals on the way up there were excellent views of the flegere and the brevent there was a capital inn at the summit where they could lunch and from the cliff behind the inn one could look directly down on the mer de glace then lynde fell back upon his murray and baedeker it was here that professor tyndall spent many weeks at different times investigating the theory of glacier motion and the englishmans hut which goethe mentions in his visit to the scene in was still standing miss ruth begged with both eyes the aunt wavered and finally yielded as a continuance of fine weather could not be depended on it was agreed that they should undertake the ascent the following morning immediately after daybreak then the conversation drooped the magnificent scenery through which their route now wound began to absorb them here they crossed a bridge spanning a purple chasm whose snakelike thread of water could be heard hissing among the sharp flints a hundred feet below now they rattled through the street of a sleepy village that seemed to have no reason for being except its picturesqueness now they were creeping up a tortuous steep gloomed by menacing crags and now their way lingered for miles along a precipice over the edge of which they could see the spearlike tips of the tall pines reaching up from the valley at the bridge between st martin and sallanches the dazzling silver peaks of mont blanc rising above the green pasturage of the forclaz abruptly revealed themselves to the travellers who fancied for the moment that they were close upon the mountain it was twelve miles away in a beeline from this point one never loses sight of those vast cones and tapering aiguilles a bloom as delicate as that of the ungathered peach was gradually settling on all the fairy heights as the travellers drew nearer to the termination of their journey they were less and less inclined to converse at every turn of the sinuous road fresh splendors broke upon them by slow degrees the glaciers became visible first those of gria and taconay then the glacier des boissons thrusting a crook of steelblue ice far into the valley and then faintly discernible in the distance and seemingly a hands breadth of snow framed by the sombre gorge the glacier des bois a frozen estuary of the mer de glace the twilight was now falling for the last hour or more the three inmates of the carriage had scarcely spoken they had unresistingly given themselves over to the glamour of the time and place along the ravines and in the lower gorges and chasms the gray dusk was gathering high overhead the domes and pinnacles were each instant taking deeper tinges of rose and violet it seemed as if a word loudly or carelessly uttered would break the spell of the alpgluhen it was all like a dream and it was in his quality of spectral figure in a dream that the driver suddenly turned on the box and pointing over his shoulder with the handle of his whip said chamouni ix montanvert the mist was still lingering in the valleys though the remote peaks had been kindled more than an hour by the touch of sunrise as lynde paced up and down the trottoir in front of the couronne hotel he drew out his watch from time to time and glanced expectantly towards the hotel entrance in the middle of the street stood a couple of guides idly holding the bridles of three mules two of which were furnished with sidesaddles it was nearly half an hour past the appointment and the denhams who had retired at eight oclock the night before in order to be fresh for an early start up the mountain had made no sign lynde himself had set the lark an example that morning by breakfasting by candlelight here were thirty minutes lost he quickened his pace up and down in front of the hotel as if his own rapidity of movement would possibly exert some occult influence in hastening the loiterers but another quarter of an hour dragged on without bringing them lynde was impatiently consulting his watch for the twentieth time when miss denhams troubled face showed itself in the doorway isnt it too bad mr lynde aunt gertrude cant go cant go faltered lynde she has a headache from yesterdays ride she got up and dressed but was obliged to lie down again then thats the end of it i suppose said lynde despondently he beckoned to one of the guides i dont know said miss denham standing in an attitude of irresolution on the upper step with her curved eyebrows drawn together like a couple of blackbirds touching bills i dont know what to doshe insists on our going i shall never forgive myself for letting her see that i was disappointed she added my concern for her illness to my regret about the excursion and thought me more disappointed than i really was then she declared she would go in spite of her headache unless i went the gloom which had overspread lyndes countenance vanished it is not one of her severest turns continued miss ruth ceasing to be a statue on a pedestal and slowly descending the hotel steps with her waterproof trailing from her left arm and she is quite capable of executing her threat what shall we do mr lynde i think we had better try the mountain for her sake answered lynde we need not attempt the mer de glace you know that can be left for another day the ascent takes only two hours the descent half an hour less we can easily be back in time for lunch then let us do that lynde selected the more amiablelooking of the two mules with sidesaddles dismissed one of the guides after a brief consultation and helped miss denham to mount in attending to these preliminaries lynde had sufficient mastery over himself not to make any indecorous betrayal of his intense satisfaction at the turn affairs had taken fortune had given her into his hands for five hours she should listen this time to what he had to say though the mountain should fall at a signal from lynde the remaining guide led the way at a brisk pace through the bustling town in front of the various hotels were noisy groups of tourists about to set forth on pilgrimages some bound for the neighboring glaciers and cascades and others preparing for more distant and more hardy enterprises it was a perfect babel of voices french scotch german italian and english with notes of every sort of patois above which the strident bass of the mules soared triumphantly at intervals there are not many busier spots than chamouni at early morning in the height of the season our friends soon left the tumult and confusion behind them and were skirting the pleasant meadows outside of the town passing by the way of the english church they crossed to the opposite bank of the arve and in a few minutes gained the hamlet lying at the foot of montanvert then the guide took the bridle of miss ruths mule and the ascent began the road stretches up the mountain in a succession of zigzags with sharp turns here and there the path is quarried out of the begrudging solid rock in places the terrace is several yards wide and well wooded but for the most part it is a barren shelf with a shaggy wall rising abruptly on one hand and a steep slope descending on the other higher up these slopes become quite respectable precipices a dozen turns which were accomplished in unbroken silence brought the party to an altitude of several hundred feet above the level i i dont know that i wholly like it said miss ruth holding on to the pommel of her saddle and looking down into the valley checkered with fields and crisscrossed with shining rivulets why do the mules persist in walking on the very edge that is a trick they get from carrying panniers you are supposed to be a pannier and the careful animal doesnt want to brush you off against the rocks see this creature of mine he has that hind hoof slipping over the precipice all the while but hell not slip hes as surefooted as a chamois and has no more taste for tumbling off the cliff than you have these mules are wonderfully intelligent observe how cautiously they will put foot on a loose stone feeling all around it i wish they were intelligent enough to be led in the middle of the path said miss ruth but i suppose the guide knows you may trust to him he is a person of varied accomplishments the chief of which is he doesnt understand a word of english so you can scold or say anything you like without the least reserve i picked him out for that added lynde with a bland smile his comrade was a linguist if i have anything disagreeable to say replied miss ruth with another bland smile i shall say it in french the guide who spoke four languages including english never changed a muscle lynde just before starting had closely examined the two guides on their lingual acquirements and retained the wrong man i trust you will have no occasion miss denham to be anything but amiable and that you will begin by granting me a favor will you cela depend there you go into french i havent offended you oh no what is the favor in english that you will let me call you miss ruth instead of miss denham i havent the slightest objection mr lynde and now i want you what another favor of course who ever heard of one favor to be sure what is the second i want that you should be a little sorry when all this comes to an end you mean when we leave chamouni yes i shall be sorry then said miss ruth frankly but i am not going to be sorry beforehand there was something very sweet to lynde in her candor but there was also something that restrained him for the moment from being as explicit as he had intended he rode on awhile without speaking watching the girl as the mule now and then turned the sharp angle of the path and began a new ascent this movement always brought her face to face with him a moment she on the grade above and he below miss ruth had grown accustomed to the novel situation and no longer held on by the pommel of the saddle she sat with her hands folded in her lap pliantly lending herself to the awkward motion of the animal over her usual travellinghabit she had thrown the long waterproof which reached to her feet as she sat there in a halflistless attitude she was the very picture of the queen of sheba seated upon deacon twomblys mare lynde could not help seeing it but he was schooling himself by degrees to this fortuitous resemblance it was painful but it was inevitable and he would get used to it in time perhaps he mused if i had never had that adventure with the poor insane girl i might not have looked twice at miss denham when we met and loved her it was the poor little queen who shaped my destiny and i oughtnt to be ungrateful he determined to tell the story to miss ruth some time when a fitting occasion offered it was only when the likeness flashed upon lynde suddenly as it had done in the grove the previous day that it now had the power to startle him at the present moment it did not even seriously annoy him in an idle pensive way he noted the coincidence of the man leading the mule the man was morton and the mule was mary lynde smiled to himself at the reflection that mary would probably not accept the analogy with very good grace if she knew about it this carried him to rivermouth then he thought of cinderellas slipper packed away in the old hairtrunk in the closet and how perfectly the slipper would fit one of those feet which a floating fold of the waterproof that instant revealed to him and he was in switzerland again miss ruth he said looking up quickly and urging his mule as closely behind hers as was practicable what are your plans to be when your uncle comes when my uncle comes we shall have no plans aunt gertrude and i uncle denham always plans for everybody i dont imagine he will plan for me said lynde gloomily i wish he would for i shall not know what to do with myself i thought you were going to st petersburg i have given that up its to be northern germany then no i have dropped that idea too will mr denham remain here any time probably not long what is to become of me after you are gone exclaimed lynde when i think of mr denham sweeping down on chamouni to carry you off i am tempted to drive this mule straight over the brink of one of these precipices the girl leaned forward looking at the rocky wall of the flegere through an opening in the pines and made no reply miss ruth said lynde i must speak do not speak she said turning upon him with a halfimperious halfappealing gesture i forbid you and then more gently we have four or five days perhaps a week to be together we are true frank friends let us be just that to the end those are mercifully cruel words returned the young man with a dull pain at his heart it is a sweet way of saying a bitter thing it is a way of saying that your friendship is very dear to me mr lynde she replied sitting erect in the saddle with the brightness and the blackness deepening in her eyes i wonder if i can make you understand how i prize it my life has not been quite like that of other girls partly because i have lived much abroad and partly because i have been very delicate ever since my childhood i had a serious lung trouble then which has never left me you would not think it to look at me perhaps it is the anxiety i have given aunt gertrude which has made her so tenacious of my affection that i have scarcely been permitted to form even those intimacies which girls form among themselves i have never known any one any gentleman as intimately as i have known you she has let me have you for my friend but miss ruth mr lynde she said interrupting him it was solely to your friendship that my aunt confided me today i should be deceiving her if i allowed you to speak as as you were speaking lynde saw his mistake he should have addressed himself in the first instance to the aunt he had been lacking in proper regard for the convenances forgetting that ruths education had been different from that of american girls at home if you love a girl you tell her so over here you go and tell her grandmother lynde dropped his head and remained silent resolving to secure an interview with mrs denham that night if possible after a moment or two he raised his face miss ruth said he if i had to choose i would rather be your friend than any other womans lover that is settled then she returned with heightened color we will not refer to this again and she brushed away a butterfly that was fluttering about her conceitedly in its new golden corselet meanwhile the guide marched on stolidly with ruths reins thrown loosely over the crook of his elbow in his summer courses up and down the mountain the man with his four languages had probably assisted dumbly at much fugitive lovemaking and many a conjugal passageatarms he took slight note of the conversation between the two young folks he was clearly more interested in a strip of black cloud that had come within the half hour and hung itself over the aiguille du dru the footpath and the bridleroad from chamouni unite at the caillet a spring of fresh water halfway up the mountain there the riders dismounted and rested five or six minutes at a rude hut perched like a brown bird under the cliff ive the fancy to go on foot the rest of the distance lynde remarked as he assisted ruth into the saddle again then ill let you lead the mule if you will said ruth im not the least afraid that is an excellent idea why did you not think of it sooner i shall expect a buonamano like a real guide you know i will give it you in advance she said gayly reaching forward and pretending to hold a coin between her thumb and finger lynde caught her hand and retained it an instant but did not dare to press it he was in mortal fear of a thing which he could have crushed like a flower in his palm the young man drew the reins over his arm and moved forward glancing behind him at intervals to assure himself that his charge was all right as they approached the summit of the mountain the path took abrupter turns and was crossed in numberless places by the channels of winter avalanches which had mown down great pines as if they had been blades of grass here and there a dry watercourse stretched like a wrinkle along the scarred face of the hill look at that miss ruth cried lynde checking the mule and pointing to a slope far below them nature who loves to do a gentle thing even in her most savage moods had taken one of those empty watercourses and filled it from end to end with forgetmenots as the wind ruffled the millions of petals this bed of flowers only a few inches wide but nearly a quarter of a mile in length looked like a flashing stream of heavenly blue water rushing down the mountain side by and by the faint klingkling of a cowbell sounding far up the height told the travellers that they were nearing the plateau occasionally they descried a herdsmans chalet pitched at an angle against the wind on the edge of an arete or clinging like a waspsnest to some jutting cornice of rock after making four or five short turns the party passed through a clump of scraggy windswept pines and suddenly found themselves at the top of montanvert a few paces brought them to the pavilion a small inn kept by the guide couttet here the mules were turned over to the hostler and miss ruth and lynde took a quarter of an hours rest examining the collection of crystals and mossagates and horncarvings which m couttet has for show in the apartment that serves him as salon cafe and museum then the two set out for the rocks overlooking the glacier the cliff rises precipitously two hundred and fifty feet above the frozen sea whose windings can be followed for a distance of five miles to the walls of the grandes and petites jorasses surveyed from this height the mer de glace presents the appearance of an immense ploughed field covered by a fall of snow that has become dingy the peculiar corrugation of the surface is scarcely discernible and one sees nothing of the wonderful crevasses those narrow and often fathomless partings of the ice to look into which is like looking into a split sapphire the first view from the cliff is disappointing but presently the marvel of it all assails and possesses one i should like to go down on the ice said ruth after regarding the scene for several minutes in silence we must defer that to another day said lynde the descent of the moraine from this point is very arduous and is seldom attempted by ladies besides if we do anything we ought to cross the glacier and go home by the way of the mauvais pas we will do that yet let us sit upon this boulder and talk what shall we talk about i dont feel like talking ill talk to you i dont know of what i will tell you a story a story mr lynde i like stories as if i were only six years old but i dont like those stories which begin with once there was a little girl who always turns out to be the little girl that is listening mine is not of that kind replied lynde with a smile steadying miss ruth by the hand as she seated herself on the boulder and yet it touches on you indirectly it all happened long ago it concerns me and happened long ago i am interested already begin it was in the summer of i was a clerk in a bank then at rivermouth and the directors had given me a vacation i hired a crazy old horse and started on a journey through new hampshire i didnt have any destination i merely purposed to ride on and on until i got tired and then ride home again the weather was beautiful and for the first three or four days i never enjoyed myself better in my life the flowers were growing the birds were singing the robins in the sunshine and the whippoorwills at dusk and the hours were not long enough for me at night i slept in a tumbledown barn or anywhere like a born tramp i had a mountain brook for a washbasin and the west wind for a towel sometimes i invited myself to a meal at a farmhouse when there wasnt a tavern handy and when there wasnt any farmhouse and i was very hungry i lay down under a tree and read in a book of poems oh that was just delightful said ruth knitting the fingers of both hands over one knee and listening to him with a childlike abandon which lynde found bewitching on the fourth day there are some persons crossing on the ice said lynde interrupting himself never mind the persons on the ice on the fourth day i came to a wild locality among the ragged mountains where there was not a human being nor a house to be seen i had got up before breakfast was ready that morning and i was quite anxious to see the smoke curling up from some kitchen chimney here as i mounted a hillside the saddlegirth broke and i jumped off to fix it somehow i dont know precisely how the horse gave a plunge jerked the reins out of my hands and started on a dead run for rivermouth that wasnt very pleasant suggested ruth not a bit i couldnt catch the animal and i had the sense not to try i climbed to the brow of the hill and was not sorry to see a snug village lying in the valley what village was that i dont know to this day with any certainty i didnt find out then and afterwards i didnt care to learn well i shouldered my traps and started for the place to procure another horse not being used to going under the saddle myself i had a hard time before i got through but that i shall not tell you about on my way to the village i met a young girl this young girl is the interesting part of the business she always is you know she was the most beautiful creature i had ever seen up to that time she was dressed all in white and looked like an angel i expected she would spread wing and vanish before i could admire her half enough but she did not the moment she saw me she walked straight to the spot where i stood and looked me squarely in the face wasnt that rather rude for an angel you wouldnt have thought so she did it like a young goddess with the supreme prerogative to flash herself that way on mortals by the roadside oh she was a young goddess as well as an angel after she had looked me in the eye a second continued lynde not heeding the criticism she said what do you suppose she said how can i imagine you could not in a thousand years instead of saying goodmorning sir and dropping me a courtesy she made herself very tall and said with quite a grand air i am the queen of sheba just fancy it then she turned on her heel and ran up the road oh that was very rude is this a true story mr lynde that is the sad part of it miss ruth this poor child had lost her reason as i learned subsequently she had wandered out of an asylum in the neighborhood after a while some men came and took her back again on my horse which they had captured in the road the poor poor girl i am sorry for her to the heart your story began like a real romance is that all of it it is sad enough that is all of course i never saw her afterwards but you remembered her and pitied her for a long time miss ruth i like you for that but what has this to do with me you said the story touched on you indirectly yes well so it does i will tell you how this poor girl was beautiful enough in your own fashion to be your sister and when i first saw you monsieur said the guide respectfully lifting a forefinger to his hat as he approached i think it looks like rain the man had spoken in english ruth went crimson to the temples and lyndes face assumed a comical expression of dismay looks like rain he repeated mechanically i thought you told me you did not understand english monsieur is mistaken it is jean macquart that does not spik english very well said lynde if it is going to rain we had better be moving it would not be pleasant to get blockaded up here by a storm or rather it would are the animals ready they are waiting at the foot of the path monsieur lynde lost no time getting ruth into the saddle and the party began their descent the guide again in charge of the girls mule on the downward journey they unavoidably faced the precipices and the road appeared to them much steeper than when they ascended is it wind or rain do you think asked lynde looking at a wicked black cloud that with angrily curled white edges was lowering itself over the valley i think it is both monsieur how soon i cannot know within an hour surely perhaps we were wrong to attempt going down said lynde monsieur might be kept at couttets one two three days but if monsieur wishes i will go on and tell the friends of mademoiselle that you are detained oh no cried ruth filled with horror at the suggestion we must return i shall not mind the rain if it comes as she spoke a loose handful of large drops rustled through the pineboughs overhead and softly dashed themselves against the rocks it has come said lynde i have my waterproof returned the girl i shall do very well but you the sentence was cut short by a flash of lightning followed by a heavy peal of thunder that rolled through the valley and reverberated for one or two minutes among the hills the guide grasped the reins close up to the bits and urged the mule forward at a brisk trot the sky cleared and for a moment it looked as if the storm had drifted elsewhere but the party had not advanced twenty paces before there was a strange rustling sound in the air and the rain came down the guide whipped off a coarse woollen coat he wore and threw it over the girls shoulders tying it by the sleeves under her chin oh you must not do that she cried you will catch your death mademoiselle he replied laughing as he gave another knot to the sleeves for thirtyeight years man and boy i have been rained upon and snowed upon and voila youre a fine fellow my friend if you do speak english cried lynde and i hope some honest girl has found it out before now monsieur returned the man signing himself with the cross she and the little one are in heaven the rain came down in torrents it pattered like shot against the rocks it beat the air of the valley into mist except the path immediately before them and the rocky perpendicular wall now on their right and now on their left the travellers could distinguish nothing through the blinding rain shortly the wind began to blow whistling in the stiff pines as it whistles among the taut cordage of a ship in a gale at intervals it tore along the salient zigzags and threatened to sweep the mules off their legs the flashes of lightning now followed one another in rapid succession and the thunder crashed incessantly through the gorges it appeared as if the great cones and cromlechs were tumbling pellmell from every direction into the valley though the situation of the three persons on the mountain side was disagreeable to the last extent they were exposed to only one especial danger that from a landslide or a detached boulder at every ten steps the guide glanced up the dripping steep and listened even the mules were not without a prescience of this peril the sharpest lightning did not make them wince but at the faintest sound of a splinter of rock or a pebble rustling down the slope their ears instantly went forward at an acute angle the footing soon became difficult on account of the gullies formed by the rain in spite of his anxiety concerning ruth lynde could not help admiring the skill with which the sagacious animals felt their way each fore hoof as it touched the earth seemed endowed with the sense of fingers lynde had dismounted after the rain set in and was walking beside the girls mule once as an unusually heavy clap of thunder burst over their heads she had impulsively stretched out her hand to him he had taken it and still held it covered by a fold of the waterproof steadying her so he was wet to the skin but ruths double wraps had preserved her thus far from anything beyond the dampness are you cold he asked her hand was like ice not very she replied in a voice rendered nearly inaudible by a peal of thunder that shook the mountain a ball of crimson fire hung for a second in the murky sky and then shot into the valley the guide glanced at lynde as much as to say that struck they were rapidly leaving the wind above them its decrease was noticeable as they neared the caillet the rain also had lost its first fury and was falling steadily here and there bright green patches of the level plain showed themselves through the broken vapors ruth declined to halt at the caillet her aunt would be distracted about her and it was better to take advantage of the slight lull in the storm and push on so they stopped at the hut only long enough for lynde to procure a glass of cognac a part of which he induced the girl to drink then they resumed their uncomfortable march when lynde again looked at his companion he saw that her lips were purple and her teeth set she confessed this time to being very cold the rain had at length penetrated the thick wrappings and thoroughly chilled her lynde was in despair and began bitterly to reproach himself for having undertaken the excursion without mrs denham her presence could not have warded off the storm but it would have rendered it possible for the party to postpone their descent until pleasant weather undoubtedly it had been his duty to leave miss ruth at the inn and return alone to chamouni he had not thought of that when the guide made his suggestion there was now nothing to do but to hurry the last part of the descent was accomplished at a gait which offered the cautious mules no chance to pick their steps lyndes animal left to its own devices was following on behind nibbling the freshened grass but the road was not so rough and the stretches protected by the trees were in good condition in less than three quarters of an hour from the halfway hut the party were at the foot of the mountain where they found a close carriage which mrs denham had thoughtfully sent to meet them benumbed with the cold and cramped by riding so long in one position the girl was unable to stand when she was lifted from the saddle lynde carried her to the carriage and wrapped her in a heavy afghan that lay on the seat they rode to the hotel without exchanging a word lynde was in too great trouble and ruth was too exhausted to speak she leaned back with her eyes partially closed and did not open them until the carriage stopped mrs denham stood at the hall door mr lynde mr lynde she said taking the girl in her arms the tone of reproach in her voice cut him to the quick he was in no way to blame aunt said ruth trying to bring a smile to her blanched face it was i who would go she reached back her hand unperceived by mrs denham and gave it to lynde he raised it gratefully to his lips but as he relinquished it and turned away he experienced a sudden inexplicable pang as if he had said farewell to her x in the shadow of mont blanc by the time lynde had changed his wet clothing the rain had turned into a dull drizzle which folded itself like a curtain about the valley mont blanc with its piledup acres of desolation loomed through the mist a shapeless immeasurable cloud within whose shadow the little town was to live darkly half blotted out for the next four days lynde spent the afternoon between his own chamber and the readingroom of the hotel wandering restlessly from one to the other and not venturing to halt at mrs denhams door to inquire after ruth though he held himself nearly guiltless in what had occurred mrs denhams rebuking tone and gesture had been none the less intolerable he was impatient to learn ruths condition and was growing every moment more anxious as he reflected on her extreme delicacy and the severe exposure she had undergone but he could not bring himself just then to go to mrs denham for information he concluded to wait until he met her at dinner but mrs denham did not come down to the table dhote the twilight fell earlier than usual and the long evening set in lynde smoked his cigar gloomily at an open window looking upon the street it was deserted and dismal even the shop across the way where they sold alpenstocks and woodcarvings and knickknacks in polished lapis was empty in pleasant weather the shop was always crowded with curiositymongers the raw wind spitefully blew the rain into lyndes face as he looked out quel temps de loup sighed a polite little french gentleman making his unlighted cigarette an excuse for addressing lynde the wretched little french gentleman was perishing with a desire to say a thousand graceful things to somebody but lynde was in no mood for epigrams he gave his interlocutor a light and sheered off in a corner of the readingroom was a tattered collection of tauchnitz novels lynde picked up one and tried to read but the slim types ran together and conveyed no meaning to him it was becoming plain that he was to have no communication with the denhams that night unless he assumed the initiative he pencilled a line on the reverse of a visiting card and sent it up to mrs denhams parlor the servant returned with the card on his waiter the ladies had retired then lynde took himself off to bed disconsolately it was nearly nine oclock when he awoke the following morning the storm had not lifted the colorless clouds were still letting down a fine vapory rain that blurred everything as soon as he had breakfasted lynde went to mrs denhams rooms she answered his knock in person and invited him by a silent gesture to enter the parlor he saw by the drawn expression of her countenance that she had not slept ruth is ill she said in a low voice replying to lyndes inquiry you do not mean very ill i fear so she has passed a dreadful night i have had a doctor is it as serious as that what does he say he says it is a severe cold with symptoms of pneumonia but i do not think he knows returned mrs denham despairingly i must despatch a courier to my husband our old family physician is now with him at paris i have just received a letter and they are not coming this week they must come at once i do not know how to telegraph them as they are about to change their hotel besides i believe a telegram cannot be sent from here the nearest office is at geneva i must send some messenger who will have intelligence enough to find mr denham wherever he is i will go you why not i shall waste less time than another there should be no mistake in the delivery of this message a courier might get drunk or be stupid i can do nothing here if it had not been for me possibly this unfortunate thing would not have happened i am determined to go whether you consent or not i shall be grateful to you all my life mr lynde i should not have thought of asking such a favor ruth says i was rude to you yesterday i did not mean to be i was distracted with anxiety at having her out in such a storm if there is any blame in the matter it is entirely mine you forgive me there is nothing to forgive mrs denham blame rests on no one neither you nor i could foresee the rain write a line to mr denham while i pack my valise i shall be ready in ten minutes who is his banker at paris i think he has none how do you address your letters i have written but once since mr denhams arrival and then i directed the letter to the hotel walther he has probably left his new address there however i shall have no difficulty in finding him mrs denham lynde hesitated mr lynde can i not see her a moment see ruth my request appears strange to you does it not it would not appear strange if you knew all all i dont understand you replied mrs denham resting her hand on the back of a chair and regarding him with slowly dilating pupils if you knew how troubled i am and how deeply i love her you love ruth more than i can tell you have you told her mrs denham demanded not in so many words mrs denham slowly sank into the chair and for several seconds appeared completely oblivious of the young mans presence then turning sharply on lynde and half rising she asked with a kind of fierceness does ruth know it a woman always knows when she is loved i fancy miss denham probably knew it before i did mrs denham made an impatient gesture and subsided into the chair again she remained silent a while staring at the pattern of the carpet at her feet mr lynde she said at length i was not prepared for this the possibility that you might grow interested in my niece naturally occurred to me at first i was pleased when i became convinced that the acquaintance between you had resolved itself into merely a friendly liking i was thrown off my guard by your seemingly frank manner i trusted you you have been alone with my niece but twice once for only ten minutes i will do you the justice to say that you have made the most of those two occasions i made very little of those two occasions said lynde reflectively i think you have been treacherous i do not see what there can be of treachery in my admiring miss denham he replied with a flush i entered into no compact not to admire her mr lynde mr denham will not approve of this not at first perhapsbut afterwards neither now nor afterwards mr lynde why not he has other views for ruth said mrs denham coldly other views repeated lynde paling i thought her free she is not free in that sense the assertion ruth had made to him the previous day on the mountain side to the effect that she had never known any gentleman as intimately as she had known him flashed across lyndes memory if mr denham had views for her certainly ruth was either ignorant of them or opposed to them is miss ruth aware of mr denhams intentions regarding her i must decline to answer you mr lynde said mrs denham rising with something like haughtiness in her manner you are right i was wrong to speak at present i cannot conceive what impelled me it was neither the time nor the place i beg you to consider everything unsaid if you can and i especially beg you not to mention this conversation in your note to mr denham the one important thing now is to have proper medical attendance for your niece the rest will take care of itself lynde bowed somewhat formally and was turning away when mrs denham laid her fingers lightly on the sleeve of his coat i am sorry i have pained you she said as if with a touch of remorse i confess i am pained he replied with the faintest smile but i am not discouraged mrs denham a quarter of an hour later lynde was on the way to geneva life and the world had somehow darkened for him within the hour it seemed to him incredible that that was the same road over which he had passed so joyously two days before the swollen torrents now rushed vengefully through the arches of the stone bridges the lowhanging opaque clouds pressed the vitality out of the atmosphere in the melancholy gray light the rainsoaked mountains wore a human aspect of dolor he was not sorry when the mist gathered like frost on the carriage windows and shut the landscape from his sight the storm had been terrible in geneva and in the neighborhood it was a scene of devastation all along the road approaching the town most of the trees in the suburbs had been completely stripped of foliage by the hailstones the leaves which still clung to the bent twigs were slit as if volleys of buckshot had been fired into them but the saddest thing to see was field after field of rich grain mown within a few inches of the ground by those swift keen sickles which no mans hand had held in the section of the city through which lynde passed to the railroad the streets were literally strewn with broken tiles and chimneypots in some places the brown and purple fragments lay ankledeep like leaves in autumn hundreds of houses had been unroofed and thousands of acres laid waste in a single night it will take the poor of the canton fifty years to forget the summer storm of by noon the next day lynde was in paris as he stepped from the station and stood under the blue sky in the sparkling parisian atmosphere the gloom and desolation he had left behind at geneva and chamouni affected him like the remembrance of a nightmare for a brief space he forgot his sorrowful errand then it came back to him with its heaviness redoubled by the contrast he threw his valise on the seat of a fiacre standing near the crossway and drove to the office of galignani in the rue de rivoli the morgue in which the names of all foreign travellers are daily laid out for recognition the third name lynde fell upon was that of william denham hotel meurice the young man motioned to the driver to follow him and halt at the hotel entrance which was only a few steps further in the arcade facing the gardens of the tuileries mr denham was at breakfast in the small salon opening on the paved square formed by the four interior walls of the building he had just seated himself at the table which was laid for two persons when the waiter brought him mrs denhams note and lyndes card mr denham glanced from one to the other and then broke the seal of the envelope with a puzzled air which directly changed into a perturbed expression show the gentleman in here he said speaking over the top of the notesheet to the servant and set another cover it was a strongly featured person of fifty or fiftyfive slightly bald and closely shaven with the exception of a heavy irongray mustache who rose from the chair and stepped forward to meet lynde as he entered lyndes name was familiar to mr denham it having figured rather prominently in his wifes correspondence during the latter part of the sojourn at geneva you have placed us all under deep obligations to you sir said mr denham with a smile in which the severity of his features melted the obligations are on my side sir replied lynde i owe mrs denham a great many kindnesses i wish i could have found some happier way than the present to express my sense of them i sincerely hope she was not justified in allowing you to take this long journey i beg of you to tell me what has happened mrs denham has been anything but explicit she had merely announced ruths illness leaving it to lynde to inform mr denham of the particulars that gentleman wrinkled his brows involuntarily as he listened to lyndes account of his mountain excursion alone with ruth and the result i have not seen miss denham since said lynde concluding his statement in which he had tripped and stumbled woefully i trust that mrs denhams anxiety has exaggerated her nieces condition ruth is far from strong replied mr denham and my wife is almost morbidly quick to take alarm about her in fact we both are do you know how the trains run to geneva is there anything earlier than the evening express lynde did not know we will ascertain after breakfast continued mr denham of course you have not breakfasted yet you ought to be in appetite by this time i am unusually late myself this morning and my friend the doctor is still later we tired ourselves out yesterday in a jaunt to fontainebleau the doctors an incorrigible sightseer ah there he is mr lynde my friend dr pendegrast lynde did not start at hearing this unexpected name though it pierced his ear like a sharppointed arrow he was paralyzed for an instant a blur came over his eyes and he felt that his hands and feet were turning into ice however he made an effort to rise and salute the elderly gentleman who stood at his side with a hand stretched out in the cordial american fashion evidently dr pendegrast did not recognize lynde in whose personal appearance three years had wrought many changes the doctor himself had altered in no essential he was at that period of mans life between fifty and sixty when ravaging time seems to give him a respite for a couple of lustrums as soon as lynde could regain his selfpossession he examined dr pendegrast with the forlorn hope that this was not his dr pendegrast but it was he with those round eyes like small bluefaience saucers and that slight wiry figure if any doubt had lingered in the young mans mind it would have vanished as the doctor drew forth from his fob that same fat little gold watch and turned it over on its back in the palm of his hand just as he had done the day he invited lynde to remain and dine with him at the asylum why bless me denham he exclaimed laying his ear to the crystal of the timepiece as if he were sounding a doubtful lung my watch has run down a thing that hasnt happened these twenty years as he stood with his head inclined on one side the doctors cheery eyes inadvertently rested upon mr denhams face and detected its unwonted disturbance mr lynde has just come from chamouni said mr denham answering the doctors mute interrogation it seems that ruth is ill dr pendegrast glanced at lynde and turned to mr denham again i imagine it is only a cold mr denham continued she was caught in a rainstorm on the mountain and got very wet mrs denham is of course worried about her and mr lynde has been kind enough to come all the way to paris for us that was very kind in him dr pendegrast drew a chair up to the table and began questioning lynde beyond satisfying such of the doctors inquiries as he could lynde did not speak during the meal he managed to swallow a cup of black coffee which revived him but he was unable to eat a mouthful the intelligence he had brought so occupied his companions that the young mans very noticeable agitation and constraint escaped them in a few minutes mr denham rose from his seat and begged the two gentlemen to finish their breakfast at leisure while he went to consult the timetable at the bureau of the hotel the doctor can give you a genuine havana he remarked to lynde i will join you shortly in the smokingroom while dr pendegrast silently drank his coffee lynde pieced his scattered thoughts together what course should he pursue should he take the doctor into his confidence or should he let himself drift how could the doctor help him in the circumstances ruth had been insane what could do away with that dreadful fact the revelation of which now appalled him as if he had never suspected it ruth ruth the very name was significant of calamity flemmings words rang in his ears you would not marry her he had not replied to flemming that night when the case was merely supposititious but now it seemed to lynde that he had never loved ruth until this moment the knowledge of her misfortune had added to his love that great pity of which he had spoken to his friend but could he marry her he did not dare put the question squarely for he dared not confess to himself that he could not give her up this then was the key to mrs denhams cold rejection of his suit it explained also ruths unwillingness to have him speak to her of his love how poignant must have been her anguish that day on montanvert if she cared for him she loved him how could he doubt it but she had accepted the hopelessness of the position in his own mind he had accused her of coquetry in their walk at the cascade of nant darpenaz he saw through it all now the scales had fallen from his eyes she was hiding her misery under a smooth face as women will a sudden reflection sent a chill over lynde what if she had recognized him that first day at dinner in geneva and had been playing a part all the while then she was the most subtile actress that ever lived and the leading lady of the theatre francais might indeed go and take lessons of her as flemming had said the thought gave lynde a shock he would not like to have the woman he loved such an actress as that had ruth revealed everything to the aunt and was she too playing a part in her several allusions to dr pendegrast mrs denham had called him the doctor simply or an old friend of our family and never once pronounced his name was that accidental or intentional lynde wondered it was inevitable that he and i should meet sooner or later was she endeavoring to keep the knowledge of dr pendegrast from me as long as possible the exigency has unmasked her now mr lynde i am at your service lynde gave a start as if the doctor had suddenly dropped down at his side from out of the sky dr pendegrast pushed back his chair and led the way across the quadrangle in which a number of persons were taking coffee at small tables set here and there under oleandertrees in greenpainted tubs the smokingroom was unoccupied lynde stood a moment undetermined in the centre of the apartment and then he laid his hand on the doctors shoulder you dont remember me ah then i have seen you before exclaimed dr pendegrast transfixed in the act of drawing a cigar from his case your name and your face puzzled me but i could not place you so i didnt mention it you must pardon an old mans bad memory i am confused when and where have i had the pleasure of seeing you it was scarcely a pleasure said lynde with bitterness indeed i cannot imagine that it is a pleasure now returned the doctor courteously it was three years ago at your asylum as you will recollect i was brought there by mistake the day the patients bless me exclaimed the doctor dropping the ignited match how could i forget you i took such a great liking to you too i have thought of that awkward affair a thousand times but really coming across you in this unexpected manner i suppose i have changed somewhat lynde broke in dr pendegrast i am in a very strange position here it is imperative you should be perfectly frank with me you will have to overlook my abruptness mr denham may return any instant and what i have to say cannot be said in his presence i know that miss denham has been under your charge as a patient i want to know more than that bare circumstance the doctor recoiled a step of course he said recovering himself you must have recognized her i met your friends six or seven weeks ago at geneva continued lynde i recognized miss denham at once but later i came to doubt and finally to disbelieve that i had ever seen her elsewhere i refused to accept the testimony of my eyes and ears because because so much of my happiness depended on my rejecting it does mrs denham know that you are in possession of the fact you mention denham of course doesnt no it is my meeting with you that he turned my discarded doubt into a certainty then i beg of you said dr pendegrast throwing a glance across the quadrangle not to breathe a syllable of this do not even think of it it has been kept from every one from even the most intimate friends of the family ruth herself is not aware of her temporary derangement miss denham does not know it she has not the remotest suspicion of the misfortune which befell her three years ago miss denham does not know it repeated lynde in a dazed way that that seems impossible pardon me how did it happen dr pendegrast i assume that you are not asking me through idle curiosity said the doctor looking at him attentively i have vital reasons for my question doctor i do not see why i should not tell you since you know so much the family were in florida that spring ruth had not been well for several months they had gone south on her account it was partly a pulmonary difficulty on their return north ruth was prostrated by a typhoid fever she recovered from that but with her mind strangely disordered the mental malady increased with her convalescence denham and i were old friends he had faith in my skill and she was placed in my care she was brought to the asylum because i could not attend to her anywhere else i considered her case serious at first even hopeless the human body is still a mystery after science has said its last word the human mind is a deeper mystery while i doubted of her recovery she recovered at the first intimation of returning health she was taken home when her wandering thought came back to her she was in her own room she remembered that she had been very ill a long time ill she had a faint impression that i had attended her meanwhile but she remembered nothing more the knowledge of her affliction was kept a secret from her unwisely i think they put it off and put it off until it became very awkward to tell her lynde started as he recalled his conversation with miss denham on the rocks overhanging the mer de glace with unwitting cruelty he had told ruth her own pathetic story and she had unconsciously pitied herself a lump came into his throat as he remembered it that was a mistake said lynde with an effort not to tell her an absurd mistake it has given my friends no end of trouble and embarrassment how long was she afflicted this way something less than two months it was the result of the fever that chiefly it was not hereditary lynde lingered on the word no then it is not likely to occur again i cannot think of anything more unlikely returned the doctor unless the same conditions conspire which is scarcely supposable as i could easily prove to you you can understand mr lynde that this has been a sore trial to denham and his wife they have had no children and their hearts are bound up in ruth the dread of a recurrence of the trouble has haunted them night and day in spite of all the arguments i could advance to reassure them they have got what our french friends call a fixed idea which is generally an idea that requires a great deal of fixing the girl ought to marry every woman ought to marry it is her one mission but between their affections and their apprehensions my friends have allowed ruth no opportunity to form attachments im glad of that said lynde quietly are you snapped the doctor i am not i would like to see her married some day meanwhile i would like to see a dozen lovers about her it is as natural for a young girl to coquet as it is for a canary to peck at its seed or trim its bill on a bit of fishbone it is had for the girl and the canary when they are prevented there is something human in this crisp old doctor said lynde to himself and then aloud so mr denham has no matrimonial plans for her none whatever since ruths recovery the family have been constantly on the wing either at home or abroad most of ruths life has been passed over here i trust to your discretion you will perceive the necessity of keeping all this to yourself i do and i now see that your travelling with the denhams is a circumstance in no way connected with the state of miss denhams health not in the most distant manner mr lynde i am with them because they are my old friends i was worn out with professional work and i ran across the sea to recuperate it is fortunate i did since ruth chances to need me lynde pondered a moment and then asked abruptly does mrs denham know of my former meeting with her niece i never breathed a word to mrs denham on the subject of ruths escapade replied the doctor it would have pained her without mending matters besides i was not proud of that transaction mrs denhams suppression of the doctors name then in speaking of him to lynde had been purely accidental miss ruths strange hallucination in her illness as to personality her fancy about the queen of sheba what was that traceable to asked lynde after a pause heaven only knows she was reading the old testament very much in those days i have sometimes accepted that as an explanation it often happens that a delusion takes its cue from something read or thought or experienced in a rational state in the case of the man blaisdell for example you remember him with his marble ship he was formerly an enterprising shipbuilder during the southern war he filled a contract with government for a couple of ironclads and made his fortune the depression in shipping afterwards ruined him and he fell to constructing marble vessels he is dead by the way i wonder if his reason has been given back to him in that other world lynde did not speak immediately and the doctor relighted his cigar which had gone out dr pendegrast you have lifted a crushing weight from me i cannot explain it to you now and here but you shall know some day dr pendegrast smiled i didnt recollect you at first mr lynde my memory for names and faces is shockingly derelict but i have retained most of my other faculties in tolerably good order i have been unreserved with you because i more than suspect the doctors sentence was cut short by mr denham who entered at the instant he had learned that there was no train for geneva before the nightexpress lynde lighted the cigar which he had been unconsciously holding between his fingers all this while and on the plea of cashing a draft at a bankers left the two gentlemen together he wandered absently into the place de la concorde crossed the crowded bridge there and plunged into the narrow streets of the latin quarter finding his way back after an hour or so to the other bank of the seine he seated himself on one of those little black iron chairs which seem to have let themselves down like spiders from the limetrees in the champs elysees and remained for a long time in a deep study the meeting with dr pendegrast had been so severe a shock to lynde that he could not straightway recover his mental balance the appalling shadow which the doctors presence had for the moment thrown across him had left lynde benumbed and chilled despite the reassuring sunshine of the doctors words by degrees however lynde warmed to life again his gloom slipped off and was lost in the restless tides of life which surged about him it was the hour when paris sits at small green tables in front of the cafes and sips its absinthe or cassis when the boulevards are thronged and the rich equipages come and go there was not a cloud in the tender blue sky against which the reddish obelisk of luxor looked like a column of jet the fountains were playing in the place de la concorde and in the tuileries gardens beyond the breeze dreamily stirred the foliage which hid from lyndes view the gray facade of the gutted palace still standing there calcined and cracked by the fires of the commune presently all this began to distract him and when he returned to the hotel he was in a humor that would have been comparatively tranquil if so many tedious miles had not stretched between paris and chamouni he found mr denham and dr pendegrast delaying dinner for him after dinner seeing no prospect of renewing conversation in private with the doctor lynde killed the time by writing a voluminous letter to flemming whose name he had stumbled on in the passengerlist of a steamer advertised to sail two days later from liverpool as lynde took his seat in the railroad carriage that night he had a feeling that several centuries had elapsed since daybreak every moment was a month to him until he could get back to chamouni the thought that ruth might be dangerously ill scarcely presented itself among his reflections she was free he loved her and there was no reason why he should not try to win her however strongly the denhams might be opposed to him his mind was perfectly easy on that score they had no right to wreck the girls future in their shallow fear his two travelling companions shortly dropped asleep but lynde did not close his eyes during those ten weary hours to macon thence to geneva was five hours more of impatience at geneva the party halted no longer than was necessary to refresh themselves at a buffet near the station and hire a conveyance to chamouni which they reached two or three hours after sunset the town still lay as lynde had left it in the portentous shadow of the mountain with the sullen rain dropping from the black sky lynde drew an alarming augury from the circumstance that mrs denham did not come down to greet them it dawned upon him then for the first time with any distinctness that ruth might be fatally ill mr denham accompanied by dr pendegrast hastened to his wifes apartments and lynde stationed himself at the head of a staircase in the hall where he waited nearly an hour in intolerable suspense before the doctor reappeared what is it doctor pneumonia no he added divining lyndes unspoken thought even before it had fairly shaped itself in his brain it is not the other business you are hiding the truth from me said lynde with a pang she is dead no but she is very low the disease is approaching a crisis a change must take place by tomorrow frankly i dread that change i am hiding nothing from you is there no hope you do not mean that i am afraid i do perhaps it is because she is so dear to me that i always anticipate the worst when she is concerned the other physician is more sanguine but then he does not love ruth as i do you might have saved her everything has been done that could be done he is a person of remarkable skill this paris physician i could have advised no change in his treatment of the case if i had been on the spot at first that is a great deal for one physician to say of another you had better go and get some rest added dr pendegrast in a changed voice struck by the young mans ghastly look your two nightjourneys have used you up lynde went mechanically to his room and threw himself upon the bed without undressing he had no inclination to sleep but his fatigue bodily and mental overcame him unawares as he lay listening to the wind which swept through the mountaingorges and rose and fell monotonously with a sound like the rote of the sea it was a vision of the sea that filled his unrestful slumber ruth was dead she had died in his arms and he was standing woebegone like a ghost on the deck of a homeward bound ship with the gray illimitable waste of waters stretching around him it appeared to lynde to be in the middle of the night though it was in fact on the edge of daybreak that he was awakened by some one knocking softly at his door he lighted a match and by its momentary flicker saw mr denham standing on the threshold ruth wishes to see you he said indistinctly and with an indecisive air as nearly as we can gather that is what she wants come quickly without waiting for a reply mr denham turned and passed through the hall lynde followed in silence he was less surprised than agitated by the summons it was of a piece with the dream from which he had been roused there were candles burning on the mantelpiece of the chamber and the dawn was whitening the windowpanes in that weird blended light the face of the sick girl shone like a fading star lynde was conscious of no other presence though mrs denham and dr pendegrast with a third person were standing near the chimneyplace ruth raised her eyes and smiled upon lynde as he came in then her lids closed and did not open again but the smile stayed in a dim way on her features and a flush almost too faint to be perceived crept into her cheeks lynde stooped by the bed and took one of ruths hands she turned her head slightly on the pillow and after a moment her lips moved as if she were making an effort to speak lynde remained immobile fearing to draw breath lest a word should escape his ear but she did not speak as he stood there listening in the breathless stillness the flame of the candles burned fainter and fainter in the increasing daylight a bird twittered somewhere aloft then the sunshine streamed through the windows and outside all the heights were touched with sudden gold illustration but she did not speak dr pendegrast approached lynde and rested one finger on his arm you had better go now the doctor whispered hastily i will come to you by and by lynde was sitting on the side of the bed in his own room in the broad daylight he had been sitting motionless in one posture for an hour perhaps two hours he could not tell how long when dr pendegrast opened the door without pausing to knock lynde felt the cold creeping about his heart doctor he said desperately dont tell me mr lynde said dr pendegrast walking up to the bedside and speaking very slowly as if he were doubtful of his own words and found it difficult to articulate them a change has taken place but it is a change for the better i believe that ruth will live she will live we thought she was sinking she thought so herself the poor child you were worth a thousand doctors to her thats my belief mrs denham was afraid to tell her you had gone to paris to fetch us thinking it would excite her ruth imagined that her aunt had offended you and thought you had gone not to return ah that troubled her in the state she was in troubled her mightily she has been able to take a few spoonfuls of nourishment the doctor went on irrelevantly her pulse is improved if she has no drawback she will get well lynde looked around him bewilderedly for a moment then he covered his face with his hands i thought she was dying he said under his breath that day and the next the girls life hung by a thread then the peril passed and her recovery became merely a question of careful nursing the days which immediately followed this certainty were the happiest lynde had ever experienced perhaps it was because his chamber was directly over ruths that he sat there in the windowseat reading from morning until night it was as near to her as he was permitted to approach he saw little of mr denham and still less of mrs denham during that week but the doctor spent an hour or two every evening with lynde and did not find it tiresome to talk of nothing but his patient the details of her convalescence were listened to with an interest that would have won dr pendegrast if he had not already been very well disposed towards the young fellow several of whose new york friends as it transpired were old acquaintances of the doctors dr dillon and his family and the delaneys the conversation between lynde and dr pendegrast at the hotel meurice had been hurried and disjointed and in that respect unsatisfactory but the minute history of ruths previous case which the doctor related to lynde in the course of those long summer nights set his mind completely at rest i could never have given her up anyway said lynde to himself i have loved her for three years though i didnt know it that was my wifes slipper after all he added thinking of the time when it used to seem to be sitting up for him at night on his writingtable at rivermouth and how often it threw a gloom over him with its tragic suggestion my wifes slipper he repeated the phrase softly to himself there was nothing tragic in it now by and by the hours began to drag with him the invalid could not get well fast enough to keep pace with his impatience the day she was able for the first time to sit up a while in an armchair wheeled by the bedside was a fete day to the four americans in the couronne hotel if lynde did not exhaust his entire inheritance in cut flowers on this occasion it was because dr pendegrast objected to them in any profusion in a sickchamber when am i to see her asked lynde that evening as the doctor dropped into the room to make his usual report let me think today is tuesday perhaps we shall let you see her by friday or saturday good heavens why dont you put it off thirty or forty years i havent the time returned dr pendegrast laughing seriously she will not be strong enough until then to bear the least excitement i am not going to run any risks with ruth i can tell you you are very impatient of course i will give you a soothing draught what is it a piece of information ill take it and a piece of advice ill take that too you cant frighten me it is a betrayal of confidence on my part said the doctor slowly and with an air of reconsidering his offer no matter well then ruths asking for you the other night rather amazed denham when he came to think it over quietly and mrs denham judged it best to inform him of the conversation which took place between you and her the morning you set out for paris denham was still more amazed she had attempted to cure him of one astonishment by giving him another similia similibus curantur did not work that time then the two came to me for consultation and i told them i thought ruths case required a doctor of divinity rather than a doctor of medicine did you say that certainly i did i strongly advised an operation and designated the english church here as a proper place in which to have it performed moreover as a change of air would be beneficial as soon as might be afterwards i suggested for the invalid a short trip to geneva with not too much company my dear fellow you need not thank me i am looking exclusively to ruths happiness yours can come in incidentally if it wants to mrs denham is your ally is she indeed i thought differently and ruth ruth interposed the doctor with a twinkle in his eyes ruth is the good little girl in the primer who doesnt speak until shes spoken to by jove she doesnt speak even then i have tried her twice once she evaded me and once she refused to listen the results of her false education said the doctor sententiously lynde laughed to what view of the question does mr denham incline he asked denham is not as unreasonable as he used to be but he is somewhat stunned by the unexpectedness of the thing thats the information and now for the advice doctor i advise you to speak with denham the first chance you get you will have an opportunity this evening i took the liberty of asking him to come up here and smoke a cigar with us as soon as he finishes his coffee lynde nodded his head approvingly and the doctor went on i shall leave you together after a while and then you must manage it at present he is in no state to deny ruth anything he would give her a lover just as he would buy her a pair of earrings his joy over her escape from death it was a fearfully narrow escape let me tell you has left him powerless moreover her illness in which there has not been a symptom of the old trouble has reassured him on a most painful point in short everything is remarkably smooth for you i think thats denhams step now in the hall added dr pendegrast hurriedly you can say what you please to him of ruth but mind you my dear boy not a word at this juncture about the queen of sheba shes dethroned you know xi from chamouni to geneva one morning in september a month after all this three persons a lady and two gentlemen stood on the upper step of the couronne hotel waving farewell with their handkerchiefs to a carriage which had just started from the door and was gayly taking the road to st gervaislesbains on the way to geneva a cool purple light stretched along the valley and reached up the mountain side to where the eternal snows begin the crown of mont blanc muffled in its scarf of cloud was invisible the old monarch was in that disdainful mood which sometimes lasts him for months together from those perilous heights came down a breath that chilled the air and tempered the sunshine falling upon chamouni now silent and deserted for the season was wellnigh over with the birds their brothers the summer tourists had flown southward at the rustling of the first autumnal leaf here and there a guide leaned idly against a post in front of one of the empty hotels there was no other indication of life in the main street save the little group we have mentioned watching the departing carriage this carriage a maroon body set upon red and black wheels was drawn by four white horses and driven by the marquis the doctor had prescribed white horses and he took great credit to himself that morning as he stood on the hotel steps beside mr and mrs denham who followed the retreating vehicle rather thoughtfully with their eyes until it turned a corner of the narrow street and was lost to them as the horses slackened their speed at an ascending piece of ground outside the town lynde took ruths hand the color of health had reasserted itself in her cheeks but her eyes had not lost a certain depth of lustre which they had learned during her illness the happy light in them illumined her face as she turned towards him i dont believe a word of it cried lynde it is just a dream a cheating page out of a fairybook these horses are simply four white mice transformed an hour ago perhaps this carriage was a pumpkin lying on the hearth of the hotel kitchen the coachman is a good fairy in thin disguise of overcoat and false mustache i am doubtful of even you the whole thing is a delusion it wont last it cant last presently the wicked gnome that must needs dwell in a stalactite cavern somewhere hereabouts will start up and break the enchantment it will never be broken so long as you love me said ruth softly she smiled at lyndes fancy though his words had by no means badly expressed her own sense of doubt in respect to the reality of it all here the driver leaned forward skilfully touching the ear of the offleader with the tip of his lash and the carriage rolled away in the blue september weather and here our story ends at the very point if we understand it where life began for those two my cousin the colonel i mrs wesley frequently embarrasses me by remarking in the presence of other persons our intimate friends of course wesley you are not brilliant but you are good from mrs wesleys outlook which is that of a very high ideal there is nothing uncomplimentary in the remark nothing so intended but i must confess that i have sometimes felt as if i were paying a rather large price for character yet when i reflect on my cousin the colonel and my own action in the matter i am ready with gratitude to accept mrs wesleys estimate of me for if i am not good i am not anything perhaps it is an instance of my lack of brilliancy that i am willing to relate certain facts which strongly tend to substantiate this my purpose however is not to prove either my goodness or my dulness but to leave some record even if slight and imperfect of my only relative when a family is reduced like ours to a single relative it is well to make the most of him one should celebrate him annually as it were one morning in the latter part of may a few weeks after the close of the war of the rebellion as i was hurrying down sixth avenue in pursuit of a heedless horsecar i ran against a young person whose shabbiness of aspect was all that impressed itself upon me in the instant of collision at a second glance i saw that this person was clad in the uniform of a confederate soldier an officers uniform originally for there were signs that certain insignia of rank had been removed from the cuffs and collar of the threadbare coat he wore a widebrimmed felt hat of a military fashion decorated with a tarnished gilt cord the two ends of which terminating in acorns hung down over his nose his butternut trousers were tucked into the tops of a pair of high cavalry boots of such primitive workmanship as to suggest the possibility that the wearer had made them himself in fact his whole appearance had an impromptu air about it the young man eyed me gloomily for half a minute then a light came into his countenance wesley tom wesley he exclaimed dear old boy to be sure i was thomas wesley and under conceivable circumstances dear old boy but who on earth was he you dont know me he said laying a hand on each of my shoulders and leaning back as he contemplated me with a large smile in anticipatory enjoyment of my surprise and pleasure when i should come to know him i am george w flagg and long may i wave my cousin flagg it was no wonder that i did not recognize him when the flagg family consisting of father and son removed to the south george was ten years old and i was thirteen it was twenty years since he and i had passed a few weeks together on grandfather wesleys farm in new jersey our intimacy began and ended there for it had not ripened into letters perhaps because we were too young when we parted later i had had a hundred intermittent impulses to write to him but did not meanwhile separation and silence had clothed him in my mind with something of the mistiness of a halfremembered dream yet the instant washington flagg mentioned his name the boyish features began rapidly to define themselves behind the maturer mask until he stood before me in the crude form in which my memory had slyly embalmed him now my sense of kinship is particularly strong for reasons which i shall presently touch upon and i straightway grasped my cousins hand with a warmth that would have seemed exaggerated to a bystander if there had been a bystander but it was early in the day and the avenue had not yet awakened to life as this bitter world goes a sleek prosperous welldressed man does not usually throw much heartiness into his manner when he is accosted on the street by so unpromising and dismal an object as my cousin washington flagg was that morning not at all in the way of sounding the trumpet of my own geniality but simply as the statement of a fact i will say that i threw a great deal of heartiness into my greeting this man to me meant family i stood curiously alone in the world my father died before i was born and my mother shortly afterwards i had neither brother nor sister indeed i never had any near relatives except a grandfather until my sons came along mrs wesley when i married her was not merely an only child but an orphan fate denied me even a motherinlaw i had one uncle and one cousin the former i do not remember ever to have seen and my association with the latter as has been stated was of a most limited order perhaps i should have had less sentiment about family ties if i had had more of them as it was washington flagg occupied the position of sole kinsman always excepting the little wesleys and i was as glad to see him that may morning in his poverty as if he had come to me loaded with the titledeeds of those vast estates which our ancestors i wonder that i was allowed any ancestors why wasnt i created at once out of some stray scrap of protoplasm were supposed to have held in the colonial period as i gazed upon washington flagg i thrilled with the sense that i was gazing upon the materialization in a concrete form of all the ghostly brothers and sisters and nephews and nieces which i had never had dear old boy i exclaimed in my turn holding on to his hand as if i were afraid that i was going to lose him again for another twenty years bless my stars where did you come from from dixies land he said with a laugh way down in dixie in a few words and with a picturesqueness of phrase in which i noted a rich southern flavor he explained the phenomenon of his presence in new york after lees surrender at appomattox courthouse my cousin had managed to reach washington where he was fortunate enough to get a free pass to baltimore he had nearly starved to death in making his way out of virginia to quote his words the wind that is supposed to be tempered expressly for shorn lambs was not blowing very heavily about that time at baltimore he fell in with a former mobile acquaintance from whom he borrowed a sum sufficient to pay the fare to new york a humiliating necessity as my cousin remarked for a man who had been a colonel in stonewall jacksons brigade flagg had reached the city before daybreak and had wandered for hours along the waterfront waiting for some place to open in order that he might look up my address in the directory if i were still in the land of the living he had had what he described as an antediluvian sandwich the previous day at two oclock since which banquet no food had passed his lips and ill be hanged he said if the first shop that took down its shutters wasnt a restaurant with a cursed rib of roast beef flanked with celery and a ham in curlpapers staring at me through the windowpane a little tin sign with meals at all hours painted on it what did they want to go and do that for knocked the breath clean out of me i gave one look and ploughed up the street for if i had stayed fifteen seconds longer in front of that plateglass i reckon i would have burst it in well i put distance between me and temptation and by and by i came to a newspaper office where i cornered a directory i was on the way to your house when we collided and now tom wesley for heavens sake introduce me to something to eat there is no false pride about me id shake hands with a bone the moisture was ready to gather in my eyes and for a second or two i was unable to manage my voice here was my only kinsman on the verge of collapse one miserable sandwich like a thin plank between him and destruction my own plenteous though hasty morning meal turned into reproachful lead within me dear old boy i cried again come along i can see that you are nearly famished ive a right smart appetite thomas theres no mistake about that if appetite were assets i could invite a whole regiment to rations i had thrust my hand under his arm and was dragging him towards a small oyster shop whose red balloon in a side street had caught my eye when i suddenly remembered that it was imperative on me to be at the office at eight oclock that morning in order to prepare certain papers wanted by the president of the board previous to a meeting of the directors i was at that time undersecretary of the savonarola fire insurance company the recollection of the business which had caused me to be on foot at this unusual hour brought me to a dead halt i dropped my cousins arm and stood looking at him helplessly it seemed so inhospitable not to say coldblooded to send him off to get his breakfast alone flagg misinterpreted my embarrassment of course he said with a touch of dignity which pierced me through the bosom i do not wish to be taken to any place where i would disgrace you i know how impossible i am yet this suit of clothes cost me twelve hundred dollars in confederate scrip these boots are not much to look at but they were made by a scion of one of the first families of the south i paid him two hundred dollars for them and he was right glad to get it to such miserable straits have southern gentlemen been reduced by the vandals of the north perhaps you dont like the confederate gray bother your boots and your clothes i cried nobody will notice them here which was true enough for in those days the land was strewed with shreds and patches of the war the drivers and conductors of street cars wore overcoats made out of shoddy army blankets and the dustmen went about in castoff infantry caps what troubles me is that i cant wait to start you on your breakfast i reckon i dont need much starting i explained the situation to him and suggested that instead of going to the restaurant he should go directly to my house and be served by mrs wesley to whom i would write a line on a leaf of my memorandumbook i did not suggest this step in the first instance because the little oyster saloon close at hand had seemed to offer the shortest cut to my cousins relief so youre married said he yes and you i havent taken any matrimony in mine ive been married six years and have two boys no how far is your house he inquired will i have to take a caar a caar ah yes that is to say no a car isnt worth while you see that bakery two blocks from here at the right thats on the corner of clinton place you turn down there youll notice in looking over what ive written to mrs wesley that she is to furnish you with some clothes such as are worn by by vandals of the north in comfortable circumstances tom wesley you are as good as a straight flush if you ever come down south when this cruel war is over our people will treat you like one of the crowned heads only a devilish sight better for the crowned heads rather went back on us if england had recognized the southern confederacy never mind that your tenderloin steak is cooling dont mention it i go but i say tom mrs wesley really i am hardly presentable are there other ladies around theres no one but mrs wesley do you think i can count on her being glad to see me at such short notice she will be a sister to you i said warmly well i reckon that you two are a pair of trumps au revoir be good to yourself with this my cousin strode off tucking my note to mrs wesley inside the leather belt buckled tightly around his waist i lingered a moment on the curbstone and looked after him with a sensation of mingled pride amusement and curiosity that was my family there it was in that broad back and those not ungraceful legs striding up sixth avenue with its noble intellect intent on thoughts of breakfast i was thankful that it had not been written in the book of fate that this limb of the closely pruned wesley tree should be lopped off by the sword of war but as washington flagg turned into clinton place i had a misgiving it was hardly to be expected that a person of his temperament fresh from a four years desperate struggle and a disastrous defeat would refrain from expressing his views on the subject that those views would be somewhat lurid i was convinced by the phrases which he had dropped here and there in the course of our conversation he was to all intents and purposes a southerner he had been a colonel in stonewall jacksons brigade and mrs wesley was such an uncompromising patriot it was in the blood her greatgrandfather on the mothers side had frozen to death at valley forge in the winter of and her grandfather on the paternal side had had his head taken off by a roundshot from his majestys sloop of war porpoise in i believe that mrs wesley would have applied for a divorce from me if i had not served a year in the army at the beginning of the war i began bitterly to regret that i had been obliged to present my cousin to her so abruptly i wished it had occurred to me to give him a word or two of caution or that i had had sense enough to adhere to my first plan of letting him feed himself at the little oyster establishment round the corner but wishes and regrets could not now mend the matter so i hailed an approaching horsecar and comforted myself on the rear platform with the reflection that perhaps the colonel would not wave the palmetto leaf too vigorously if he waved it at all in the face of mrs wesley ii the awkwardness of the situation disturbed me more or less during the forenoon but fortunately it was a halfholiday and i was able to leave the office shortly after one oclock i do not know how i came to work myself into such a state of mind on the way up town but as i stepped from the horsecar and turned into clinton place i had a strong apprehension that i should find some unpleasant change in the facial aspect of the little red brick building i occupieda scowl for instance on the brownstone eyebrow over the front door i actually had a feeling of relief when i saw that the facade presented its usual unaggressive appearance as i entered the hall mrs wesley who had heard my passkey grating in the lock was coming downstairs is my cousin here clara i asked in the act of reaching up to hang my hat on the rack no said mrs wesley there was a tone in that monosyllable that struck me but he has been here he has been here replied mrs wesley may be you noticed the bellknob hanging out one or two inches is mr flagg in the habit of stretching the bellwire of the houses he visits when the door is not opened in a moment has he escaped from somewhere escaped from somewhere i echoed i only asked he behaved so strangely good heavens clara what has the man done i hope that nothing unpleasant has happened flagg is my only surviving relative i may say our only surviving relative and i should be pained to have any misunderstanding i want you to like him there was a slight misunderstanding at first said clara and a smile flitted across her face softening the features which had worn an air of unusual seriousness and preoccupation but it is all right now dear he has eaten everything in the house that bit of spring lamb i saved expressly for you and has gone down town on a raid as he called it in your secondbest suit the checked tweed i did all i could for him my dear something has ruffled you what is it wesley said my wife slowly and in a perplexed way i have had so few relatives that perhaps i dont know what to do with them or what to say to them you always say and do what is just right i began unfortunately with mr flagg then mary was washing the dishes when he rang and i went to the door if he is our cousin i must say that he cut a remarkable figure on the doorstep i can imagine it my dear coming upon you so unexpectedly there were peculiarities in his costume for an instant clara went on i took him for the ashman though the ashman always goes to the area door and never comes on tuesdays and then before the creature had a chance to speak i said we dont want any supposing he had something to sell instead of going away quietly as i expected he would do the man made a motion to come in and i slammed the door on him dear dear what else could i do all alone in the hall how was i to know that he was one of the family what happened next well i saw that i had shut the lapel of his coat in the doorjamb and that the man couldnt go away if he wanted to ever so much wasnt it dreadful of course i didnt dare to open the door and there he was he began pounding on the panels and ringing the bell in a manner to curdle ones blood he rang the bell at least a hundred times in succession i stood there with my hand on the bolt not daring to move or breathe i called to mary to put on her things steal out the lower way and bring the police suddenly everything was still outside and presently i saw a piece of paper slowly slipping in over the threshold oh so slyly i felt my hands and feet grow cold i felt that the man himself was about to follow that narrow strip of paper that he was bound to get in that way or through the keyhole or somehow then i recognized your handwriting my first thought was that you had been killed in some horrible accident and had dropped you a line i didnt reason about it wesley i was paralyzed i picked up the paper and read it and opened the door and mr flagg rushed in as if he had been shot out of something dont want any he shouted but i do i want some breakfast you should have heard him he stated a fact at any rate to be sure he might have stated it less vivaciously i was beginning to be amused after that he was quieter and tried to make himself agreeable and we laughed a little together over my mistake that is he laughed of course i got breakfast for him and such a breakfast he had been without anything to eat since yesterday i should have imagined said clara that he had eaten nothing since the war broke out did he say anything in particular about himself i asked with a recurrent touch of anxiety he wasnt particular what he said about himself without in the least seeing the horror of it he positively boasted of having been in the rebel army yes a colonel that makes it all the worse replied clara but they had to have colonels you know is mr flagg a virginian or a mississippian or a georgian no my dear he was born in the state of maine but he has lived so long in the south that hes quite one of them for the present we must make allowances for him clara did he say anything else oh yes what did he say he said hed come back to supper it was clear that clara was not favorably impressed by my cousin and indeed the circumstances attending his advent were not happy it was likewise clear that i had him on my hands temporarily at least i almost reproach myself even now for saying on my hands in connection with my own flesh and blood the responsibility did not so define itself at the time it took the form of a novel and pleasing duty here was my only kinsman in a strange city without friends money or hopeful outlook my course lay before me as straight as a turnpike i had a great deal of family pride even if i did not have any family to speak of and i was resolved that what little i had should not perish for want of proper sustenance shortly before six oclock washington flagg again presented himself at our doorstep and obtained admission to the house with fewer difficulties than he had encountered earlier in the day i do not think i ever saw a man in destitute circumstances so entirely cheerful as my cousin was neither the immediate past which must have been full of hardships nor the immediate future which was not lavish of its promises seemed to give him any but a momentary and impersonal concern at the suppertable he talked much and well exceedingly well i thought except when he touched on the war which he was continually doing and then i was on tenterhooks his point of view was so opposed to ours as to threaten in several instances to bring on an engagement all along the line this calamity was averted by my passing something to him at the critical moment now i checked his advance by a slice of cold tongue and now i turned his flank with another cup of tea but i questioned my ability to preserve peace throughout the evening before the meal was at an end there had crept into claras manner a polite calmness which i never liked to see what was i going to do with these two after supper when my cousin flagg with his mind undistracted by relays of cream toast could give his entire attention to the lost cause as we were pushing the chairs back from the table i was inspired with the idea of taking our guest off to a cafe concert over in the bowery a volksgarten very popular in those days while my whispered suggestion was meeting claras cordial approval our friend bleeker dropped in so the colonel and bleeker and i passed the evening with lagerbeer and meyerbeer as my lively kinsman put it after which he spent the night on the sofa in our sittingroom for we had no spare chamber to place at his disposal i shall be very snug here he said smiling down my apologies im a possum for adapting myself to any odd hollow the next morning my cousin was early astir possibly not having found that narrow springless lounge all a possum could wish and joined us in discussing a plan which i had proposed overnight to mrs wesley namely that he should hire an apartment in a quiet street near by and take his meals that was to say his dinner with us until he could make such arrangements as would allow him to live more conveniently to return south where all the lines of his previous business connections were presumably broken was at present out of the question the war has ruined our people said the colonel i will have to put up for a while with a place in a bank or an insurance office or something in that small way the world owes me a living north or south his remark nettled me a little though he was of course unaware of my relations with the savonarola fire insurance company and had meant no slight i dont quite see that i observed dont see what how the world contrived to get so deeply into your debt how all the points of the compass managed it thomas i didnt ask to be born did i probably not but i was born wasnt i to all appearances well then but you cannot hold the world in general responsible for your birth the responsibility narrows itself down to your parents then i am euchred by one of those laws of nature which make this globe a sweet spot to live on they were taken from me just when i needed them most my mother in my infancy and my father in my childhood but your father left you something the old gentleman left me nothing and ive been steadily increasing the legacy ever since what did you do before the war inquired clara sympathetically his mention of his early losses had touched her oh a number of things i read law for a while at one time i was interested in a large concern for the manufacture of patent metallic burial cases but nobody seemed to die that year good health raged like an epidemic all over the south latterly i dabbled a little in stocks and stocks dabbled in me you were not successful then i said i was at first but when the war fever broke out and the southern heart was fired everything that didnt go down went up and you couldnt meet your obligations that wasnt the trouble i couldnt get away from them replied the colonel with a winsome smile i met them at every corner the man had a fashion of turning his very misfortunes into pleasantries surely prosperity would be wasted on a person so gifted with optimism i felt it to be kind and proper however to express the hope that he had reached the end of his adversity and to assure him that i would do anything i could in the world to help him tom wesley i believe you would before the close of that day mrs wesley who is a lady that does not allow any species of vegetation to accumulate under her feet had secured a furnished room for our kinsman in a street branching off from clinton place and at a moderate additional expense contracted to have him served with breakfast on the premises previous to this i had dined down town returning home in the evening to a rather heavy tea which was really my wifes dinner sheridan and ulysses such were the heroic names under which the two little wesleys were staggering had their principal meal at midday it was of course not desirable that the colonel should share this meal with them and mrs wesley in my absence so we decided to have a six oclock dinner a temporary disarrangement of our domestic machinery for my cousin flagg would doubtless find some acceptable employment before long and leave the household free to slip back into its regular grooves an outline of the physical aspects of the exotic kinsman who had so unexpectedly added himself to the figures at our happy fireside seems not out of place here the portrait being the result of many sittings does not in some points convey the exact impression he made upon us in the earlier moments of our intimacy but that is not important though washington flagg had first opened his eyes on the banks of the penobscot he appeared to have been planned by nature to adorn the banks of the rappahannock there was nothing of the new englander about him the sallowness of his complexion and the blackness of his straight hair which he wore long were those of the typical southerner he was of medium height and loosely built with a kind of elastic grace in his disjointedness when he smiled he was positively handsome in repose his features were nearly plain the lips too indecisive and the eyes lacking in lustre a sparse tuft of beard at his chin he was otherwise smoothly shaven lengthened the face there was when he willed it something very ingratiating in his manner even clara admitted that a courteous and unconventional sort of ease in all these surface characteristics he was a geographical anomaly in the cast of his mind he was more southern than the south as a northern convert is apt to be even his speech like the dyers arm had taken tints from his environment one might say that his pronunciation had literally been colored by his long association with the colored race he invariably said flo for floor and djew for dew but i do not anywhere attempt a phonetic reproduction of his dialect in its finer qualities it was too elusive to be snared in a network of letters in spite of his displacements for my cousin had lived all over the south in his boyhood he had contrived to pick up a very decent education as to his other attributes he shall be left to reveal them himself iii mrs wesley kindly assumed the charge of establishing washington flagg in his headquarters as he termed the snug hall bedroom in macdougal street there were numberless details to be looked to his wardrobe among the rest needed replenishing down to the most unconsidered button for flagg had dropped into our little world with as few impedimenta as if he had been a newly born infant though my condition like that desired by agur the son of jakeh was one of neither poverty nor riches greenbacks in those days were greenbacks i mention the fact in order to say that my satisfaction in coming to the rescue of my kinsman would have been greatly lessened if it had involved no selfdenial whatever the day following his installation i was partly annoyed partly amused to find that flagg had purchased a rather expensive meerschaum pipe and a pound or two of latakia tobacco i cannot afford to smoke cigars he explained i must economize until i get on my feet perhaps it would have been wiser if i had personally attended to his expenditures minor as well as major but it did not seem practicable to leave him without a cent in his pocket his pilgrimage down town that forenoon had apparently had no purpose beyond this purchase though on the previous evening i had directed his notice to two or three commercial advertisements which impressed me as worth looking into i hesitated to ask him if he had looked into them a collateral feeling of delicacy prevented me from breathing a word to clara about the pipe our reconstructed household with its unreconstructed member now moved forward on the lines laid down punctually at a quarter to six p m my cousin appeared at the front door hung his hat on the rack and passed into the sittingroom sometimes humming in the hall a bar or two of the bonny blue flag that bears a single star to the infinite distaste of mrs wesley who was usually at that moment giving the finishing touches to the dinnertable after dinner during which i was in a state of unrelaxed anxiety lest the colonel should get himself on too delicate ground i took him into my small snuggery at the foot of the hall where coffee was served to us mrs wesley being left to her own devices for several days matters went as smoothly as i could have hoped i found it so easy when desirable to switch the colonel on to one of my carefully contrived side tracks that i began to be proud of my skill and to enjoy the exercise of it but one evening just as we were in the middle of the dessert he suddenly broke out with we were conquered by mere brute force you know that is very true i replied it is brute force that tells in war wasnt it napoleon who said that he had remarked that god was generally on the side which had the heaviest artillery the north had that fast enough and crushed a free people with it a free people with four millions of slaves observed mrs wesley quietly slavery was a patriarchal institution my dear lady but i reckon it is exploded now the emancipation proclamation was a dastardly war measure it did something more and better than free the blacks said mrs wesley it freed the whites dear me she added glancing at sheridan and ulysses who in a brief reprieve from bed were over in one corner of the room dissecting a small wooden camel i cannot be thankful enough that the children are too young to understand such sentiments the colonel to my great relief remained silent but as soon as clara had closed the diningroom door behind her he said tom wesley i reckon your wife doesnt wholly like me she likes you immensely i cried inwardly begging to be forgiven but she is a firm believer in the justice of the northern cause may be she lost a brother or something no she never had a brother if she had had one he would have been killed in the first battle of the war she sent me to the front to be killed and i went willingly but i wasnt good enough the enemy wouldnt have me at any price after a years trial mrs wesley feels very strongly on this subject and i wish you would try like a good fellow not to bring the question up at dinnertime i am squarely opposed to your views myself but i dont mind what you say as she does so talk to me as much as you want to but dont talk in claras presence when persons disagree as you two do argument is useless besides the whole thing has been settled on the battlefield and it isnt worth while to fight it all over again on a tablecloth i suppose it isnt he assented goodnaturedly but you people up at the north here dont suspicion what we have been through you caught only the edge of the hurricane the most of you i take it werent in it at all our dearest were in it well we got whipped wesley i acknowledge it but we deserved to win if ever bravery deserved it the south was brave nobody contests that but t is not enough to be brave the angry valor dashed on the awful shield of god as one of our poets says blast one of your poets our people were right too come now flagg when you talk about your people you ought to mean northerners for you were born in the north that was just the kind of luck that has followed me all my life my body belongs to bangor maine and my soul to charleston south carolina youve got a problem there that ought to bother you it does said the colonel with a laugh meanwhile my dear boy dont distress mrs wesley with it she is ready to be very fond of you if you will let her it would be altogether sad and shameful if a family so contracted as ours couldnt get along without internal dissensions my cousin instantly professed the greatest regard for mrs wesley and declared that both of us were good enough to be southrons he promised that in future he would take all the care he could not to run against her prejudices which merely grew out of her confused conception of state rights and the right of selfgovernment women never understood anything about political economy and government anyhow having accomplished thus much with the colonel i turned my attention on his departure to smoothing clara i reminded her that nearly everybody north and south had kinsmen or friends in both armies to be sure it was unfortunate that we having only one kinsman should have had him on the wrong side that was better than having no kinsman at all clara was inclined to demur at this it had not been practicable for him to divide himself if it had been he would probably have done it and the two halves would doubtless have arrayed themselves against each other they would in a manner have been bound to do so however the war was over we were victorious and could afford to be magnanimous but he doesnt seem to have discovered that the war is over returned clara he still waves it is likely that certain obstinate persons on both sides of mason and dixons line will be a long time making the discovery some will never make it so much the worse for them and the country mrs wesley meditated and said nothing but i saw that so far as she and the colonel were concerned the war was not over iv this slight breeze cleared the atmosphere for the time being my cousin flagg took pains to avoid all but the most indirect allusions to the war except when we were alone and in several small ways endeavored with not too dazzling success to be agreeable to clara the transparency of the effort was perhaps the partial cause of its failure and then too the nature of his little attentions was not always carefully considered on his part for example mrs wesley could hardly be expected to lend herself with any grace at all to the proposal he made one sultry june evening to knock her up a mintjulep the most refreshing beverage on earth madam in hot weather i can assure you judge ashburton todhunter of fauquier county had taught him to prepare this pungent elixir from a private receipt for which the judge had once refused the sum of fifty dollars offered to him by colonel stanley bluegrass of chattanooga and this was at a moment too when the judge had been losing very heavily at draw poker all quiet along the potomac whispered the colonel with a momentary pride in the pacific relations he had established between himself and mrs wesley as the mint and one or two other necessary ingredients were lacking to our family stores the idea of julep was dismissed as a vain dream and its place supplied by iced congress water a liquid which my cousin characterized in a hasty aside to me as being a drink fit only for imbecile infants of a tender age washington flaggs frequent and familiar mention of governors judges colonels and majors clearly indicated that he had moved in aristocratic latitudes in the south and threw light on his disinclination to consider any of the humbler employments which might have been open to him he had so far conceded to the exigency of the case as to inquire if there were a possible chance for him in the savonarola fire insurance company he had learned of my secretaryship there was no vacancy in the office and if there had been i would have taken no steps to fill it with my cousin he knew nothing of the business besides however deeply i had his interests at heart i should have hesitated to risk my own situation by becoming sponsor for so unmanageable an element as he appeared to be at odd times in my snuggery after dinner flagg glanced over the wants columns of the evening journal but never found anything he wanted he found many amusing advertisements that served him as pegs on which to hang witty comment but nothing to be taken seriously i ventured to suggest that he should advertise he received the idea with little warmth no my dear boy i cant join the long procession of scullions cooks butlers valets and bottlewashers which seem to make up so large a part of your population i couldnt keep step with them it is altogether impossible for me to conduct myself in this matter like a menialofallwork out of place wanted a situation by a respectable young person of temperate habits understands the care of horses is willing to go into the country and milk the cow with the crumpled horn no many thanks state your own requirements flagg i didnt propose that you should offer yourself as coachman it would amount to the same thing wesley i should at once be relegated to his level some large opportunity is dead sure to present itself to me if i wait i believe the office should seek the man i have noticed that a man has to meet his opportunities more than halfway or he doesnt get acquainted with them mohammed was obliged to go to the mountain after waiting for the mountain to come to him mohammeds mistake was that he didnt wait long enough he was too impatient but dont you fret i have come to yankeedom to make my fortune the despots heel is on your shore and it means to remain there until he hears of something greatly to his advantage a few days following this conversation mr nelson of files nelson wholesale grocers on front street mentioned to me casually that he was looking for a shippingclerk before the war the firm had done an extensive southern trade which they purposed to build up again now that the ports of the south were thrown open the place in question involved a great deal of outdoor work the loading and unloading of spicy cargoes a life among the piers all which seemed to me just suited to my cousins woodland nature i could not picture him nailed to a desk in a countingroom the salary was not bewildering but the sum was to be elastic if ability were shown here was an excellent chance a steppingstone at all events perhaps the large opportunity itself artfully disguised as fifteen dollars a week i spoke of flagg to mr nelson and arranged a meeting between them for the next day i said nothing of the matter at the dinnertable that evening but an encouraging thing always makes a lantern of me and clara saw the light in my face as soon as dinner was over i drew my cousin into the little side room and laid the affair before him and i have made an appointment for you to meet mr nelson tomorrow at one oclock i said in conclusion my dear wesley he had listened to me in silence and now spoke without enthusiasm i dont know what you were thinking of to do anything of the sort i will not keep the appointment with that person the only possible intercourse i could have with him would be to order groceries at his shop the idea of a man who has moved in the best society of the south who has been engaged in great if unsuccessful enterprises who has led the picked chivalry of his oppressed land against the northern hordes the idea of a gentleman of this kidney meekly simmering down into a factotum to a yankee dealer in canned goods no sir i reckon i can do better than that the lantern went out i resolved that moment to let my cousin shape his own destiny a task which in no way appeared to trouble him and indeed now that i look back to it why should he have troubled himself he had a comfortable if not luxurious apartment in macdougal street a daily dinner that asked only to be eaten a wardrobe that was replenished when it needed replenishing a weekly allowance that made up for its modesty by its punctuality if ever a man was in a position patiently to await the obsequious approach of large opportunities that man was washington flagg he was not insensible to the fact he passed his time serenely he walked the streets flagg was a great walker sometimes wandering for hours in the central park his southern life passed partly among plantations had given him a relish for trees and rocks and waters he was also a hungry reader of novels when he had devoured our slender store of fiction which was soon done he took books from a small circulating library on sixth avenue that he gave no thought whatever to the future was clear he simply drifted down the gentle stream of the present sufficient to the day was the sunshine thereof in spite of his unforgivable inertia and the egotism that enveloped him like an atmosphere there was a charm to the man that put my impatience to sleep i tried to think that this indifference and sunny idleness were perhaps the natural reaction of that larger life of emotion and activity from which he had just emerged i reflected a great deal on that life and though i lamented the fact that he had drawn his sword on the wrong side there was down deep in my heart an involuntary sympathetic throb for the valor that had not availed i suppose the inexplicable ties of kinship had something to do with all this washington flagg had now been with us five weeks he usually lingered awhile after dinner sometimes spent the entire evening with the family or rather with me for mrs wesley preferred the sittingroom to my den when i had company besides there were sheridan and ulysses to be looked to toward the close of the sixth week i noticed that flagg had fallen into a way of leaving immediately after dinner he had also fallen into another way not so open to pleasant criticism by degrees by degrees so subtle as almost to escape measurement he had glided back to the forbidden and dangerous ground of the war at first it was an intangible reference to something that occurred on such and such a date the date in question being that of some sanguinary battle then a swift sarcasm veiled and softly shod then a sarcasm that dropped its veil for an instant and showed its sharp features at last his thought wore no disguise possibly the man could not help it possibly there was something in the atmosphere of the house that impelled him to say things which he would have been unlikely to say elsewhere whatever was the explanation my cousin flagg began to make himself disagreeable again at mealtimes he had never much regarded my disapproval and now his early illdefined fear of mrs wesley was evaporated he no longer hesitated to indulge in his war reminiscences which necessarily brought his personal exploits under a calciumlight these exploits usually emphasized his intimacy with some of the more dashing southern leaders such as stonewall jackson and jeb stuart and mosby we found ourselves practically conscripted in the confederate army we were taken on long midnight rides through the passes of the cumberland mountains and hurled on some federal outpost we were made a mere handful as we were to assault and carry most formidable earthworks we crossed dangerous fords and bivouacked under boughs hung with weird gonfalons of gray moss slit here and there by the edge of a star many a time we crawled stealthily through tangled vines and shrubs to the skirt of a wood and across a fallen log sighted the yankee picket whose bayonet point glimmered now and then far off in the moonlight we spent a great many hours around the campfire counting our metaphorical scalps one evening the colonel was especially exasperating with anecdotes of stonewall jackson and details of what he said to the general and what the general said to him stonewall jackson often used to say to me george he always called me george in just that offhand way george when we get to new york you shall have quarters in the astor house and pasture your mare spitfire in the park that was very thoughtful of stonewall jackson remarked mrs wesley with the faintest little whiteness gathering at the lips i am sorry that your late friend did not accompany you to the city and personally superintend your settlement here he would have been able to surround you with so many more comforts than you have in macdougal street the colonel smiled upon clara and made a deprecating gesture with his left hand nothing seemed to pierce his ironclad composure a moment afterward he returned to the theme and recited some verses called stonewall jacksons way he recited them very well one stanza lingers in my memory we see him now the old slouched hat cocked oer his brow askew the shrewd dry smile the speech so pat so calm so blunt so true the bluelight elder knows em well says he thats banks hes fond of shell lord save his soul well give him well thats stonewall jacksons way his ways must have been far from agreeable observed my wife if that is a sample of them after the colonel had taken himself off mrs wesley sinking wearily upon the sofa said i think i am getting rather tired of stonewall jackson we both are my dear and some of our corps commanders used to find him rather tiresome now and then he was really a great soldier clara perhaps the greatest on the other side i suppose he was but flagg comes next according to his own report why tom if your cousin had been in all the battles he says he has the man would have been killed ten times over hed have had at least an arm or a leg shot off that washington flagg had all his limbs on was actually becoming a grievance to mrs wesley the situation filled me with anxiety between my cousins deplorable attitude and my wifes justifiable irritation i was extremely perplexed if i had had a dozen cousins the solution of the difficulty would have been simple but to close our door on our only kinsman was an intolerable alternative if any word of mine has caused the impression that clara was not gentle and sympathetic and altogether feminine i have wronged her the reserve which strangers mistook for coldness was a shell that melted at the slightest kind touch her masterful air the merest seeming but whatever latent antagonism lay in her nature the colonel had the faculty of bringing to the surface it must be conceded that the circumstances in which she was placed were trying and clara was without that strong perhaps abnormal sense of relationship which sustained me in the ordeal later on when matters grew more complicated i could but admire her resignation if it were not helpless despair sometimes indeed she was unable to obliterate herself and not only stood by her guns but carried the war into the enemys country i very frequently found myself between two fires and was glad to drag what small fragments were left of me from the scene of action in brief the little house in clinton place was rapidly transforming itself into a ghastly caricature of home up to the present state of affairs the colonel had never once failed to appear at dinnertime we had become so accustomed to his ring at the prescribed hour and to hearing him outside in the hall softly humming the bonny blue flag or i wish i was in dixies land a wish which he did not wholly monopolize we had i repeat become so accustomed to these details that one night when he absented himself we experienced a kind of alarm it was not until the clock struck ten that we gave over expecting him then fearing that possibly he was ill i put on my hat and stepped round to macdougal street mr flagg had gone out late in the afternoon and had not returned no he had left no word in case any one called what had happened i smile to myself now and i have smiled a great many times at the remembrance of how worried i was that night as i walked slowly back to clinton place the next evening my cousin explained his absence he had made the acquaintance of some distinguished literary gentlemen who had invited him to dine with them at a certain german cafe which at an earlier date had been rather famous as the rendezvous of a group of young journalists wits and unblossomed poets known as the bohemians the war had caused sad havoc with these light hearted knights of the long table and it was only upon a scattered remnant of the goodly company that the colonel had fallen how it came about i do not know i know that the acquaintance presently flowered into intimacy and that at frequent intervals after this we had a vacant chair at table my cousin did not give himself the pains to advise us of his engagements so these absences were not as pleasant as they would have been if we had not expected him every minute recently too our expectation of his coming was tinged with a dread which neither i nor mrs wesley had named to each other a change was gradually taking place in my cousin hitherto his amiability even when he was most unendurable had been a part of him obviously he was losing that lightness of spirit which we once disliked and now began to regret he was inclined to be excitable and sullen by turns and often of late i had been obliged to go to the bottom of my diplomacy in preventing some painful scene as i have said neither my wife nor i had spoken definitely of this alteration but the cause and nature of it could not long be ignored between us how patient you are with him dear said mrs wesley as i was turning out the gas after one of our grim and grotesque little dinners the colonel had not dined with us before for a week i dont see how you can be so patient with the man blood is thicker than water clara but it isnt thicker than whiskey and water is it she had said it the colonel was drinking it was not a question of that light elixir the precious receipt for which had been confided to him by judge ashburton todhunter of fauquier county it was a question of a heavier and more immediate poison the fact that flagg might in some desperate state drop in on us at any moment stared us in the face that was a very serious contingency and it was one i could not guard against i had no false ideas touching my influence over washington flagg i did not dream of attempting to influence him i was powerless i could do nothing but wait and wonder what would happen there was nothing the man might not be capable of in some insane moment in the meanwhile i was afraid to go out of an evening and leave clara alone it was impossible for us to ask a friend to dinner though indeed we had not done that since my cousin dropped down on us it was no relief that his visits grew rarer and rarer the apprehension remained it was no relief when they ceased altogether for it came to that at last a month had elapsed since he had called at the house i had caught sight of him once on broadway as i was riding up town in an omnibus he was standing at the top of the steep flight of steps that led to herr pfaffs saloon in the basement it was probably flaggs dinner hour mrs morgan the landlady in macdougal street a melancholy little soul was now the only link between me and my kinsman i had a weekly interview with her i learned that mr flagg slept late was seldom in during the day and usually returned after midnight a person with this eccentric scheme of life was not likely to be at home at such hours as i might find it convenient to call nevertheless from time to time i knocked at the unresponsive door of his room the two notes i had written to him he left unanswered all this was very grievous he had been a trouble to me when i had him and he was a trouble to me now i had lost him my trouble had merely changed its color on what downward way were his footsteps what was to be the end of it sometimes i lay awake at night thinking of him of course if he went to the dogs he had nobody to blame but himself i was not responsible for his wronggoing nevertheless i could not throw off my anxiety in the matter that flagg was leading a wild life in these days was presumable indeed certain rumors to that effect were indirectly blown to me from the caves of gambrinus not that i believe the bohemians demoralized him he probably demoralized the bohemians i began to reflect whether fate had not behaved rather handsomely after all in not giving me a great many relatives if i remember rightly it was two months since i had laid eyes on my cousin when on returning home one evening i noticed that the front door stood wide open and had apparently been left to take care of itself as i mounted the steps a little annoyed at marys carelessness i heard voices in the hall washington flagg was standing at the foot of the staircase with his hand on the newelpost and mrs wesley was halfway up the stairs as if in the act of descending i learned later that she had occupied this position for about three quarters of an hour she was extremely pale and much agitated flaggs flushed face and tilted hat told his part of the story he was not in one of his saturnine moods he was amiably and if i may say it gracefully drunk and evidently had all his wits about him ive been telling mrs wesley he began at once as if i had been present all the while and he was politely lifting me into the conversation ive been telling mrs wesley that im a lost cause a lost soul was mrs wesleys amendment from the staircase oh tom i am so glad you have come i thought you never would i let him in an hour or two ago and he has kept me here ever since you were so entertaining said my cousin with a courteous sweep of his disengaged hand and speaking with that correctness of enunciation which sometimes survives everything flagg i said stepping to his side you will oblige me by returning to your lodgings you think im not all right i am sure of it and you dont want me here dear old boy no i dont want you here the time has come for me to be frank with you flagg and i see that your mind is clear enough to enable you to understand what i say i reckon i can follow you thomas my stock of romantic nonsense about kinship and family duties and all that has given out and will not be renewed wont do business any more at the old stand exactly so i have done everything i could to help you and you have done nothing whatever for yourself you have not even done yourself the scant justice of treating clara and me decently in future you will be obliged to look after your own affairs financial as well as social your best plan now is to go to work i shall no longer concern myself with your comings and goings except so far as to prevent you from coming here and disturbing clara have you put that down wesley my boy ill pay you for this if you do it will be the first thing you have paid for since you came north my statement however accurate was not wholly delicate and i subsequently regretted it but when a patient man loses his patience he goes to extremes washington flagg straightened himself for an instant and then smiled upon me in an amused patronizing way quite untranslatable thomas that was neat very neat for you when i see judge ashburton todhunter ill tell him about it its the sort of mild joke he likes i should be proud to have judge ashburton todhunters approval of any remark of mine but in the meanwhile it would be a greater pleasure to me to have you return at once to macdougal street where no doubt mrs morgan is delaying dinner for you say no more wesley ill never set foot in your house again as sure as my name is flagg and long may i wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave he is a kind of flagg that i dont wish to have wave over my home said mrs wesley descending the stairs as my cousin with painful care closed the door softly behind him so the end was come it had come with less unpleasantness than i should have predicted the ties of kindred too tightly stretched had snapped but they had snapped very gently so to speak v washington flagg was as good as his word which is perhaps not a strong indorsement he never again set foot in my house a week afterward i found that he had quitted macdougal street he has gone south said mrs morgan did he leave no message for me he didnt leave a message for nobody did he happen to say to what part of the south he was bound he said he was going back to dixies land and didnt say no more that was all his departure had been as abrupt and unlocked for as his arrival i wondered if he would turn up again at the end of another twenty years and i wondered how he had paid his travelling expenses to the land of the magnolia and the persimmon that mystery was solved a few days subsequently when a draft for so reasonable a sum as not to be worth mentioning to clara was presented to me for payment at my office washington flagg was gone but his shadow was to linger for a while longer on our household it was difficult to realize that the weight which had oppressed us had been removed we were scarcely conscious of how heavy it had been until it was lifted i was now and then forced to make an effort not to expect the colonel to dinner a month or two after his disappearance an incident occurred which brought him back very vividly and in a somewhat sinister shape to our imaginations quite late one night there was a sharp ring at the door mary having gone to bed i answered the bell on the doorstep stood a tall pale girl rather shabbily dressed but with a kind of beauty about her it seemed to flash from her eyelashes which i noticed were very heavy the hall light fell full upon this slight figure standing there wrapped in an insufficient shawl against a dense background of whirling snowflakes she asked if i could give her colonel flaggs address on receiving my reply the girl swiftly descended the steps and vanished into the darkness there was a tantalizing point of romance and mystery to all this as i slowly closed the front door i felt that perhaps i was closing it on a tragedy one of those piteous unwritten tragedies of the great city i have wondered a thousand times who that girl was and what became of her before the end of the year another incident this time with a touch of comedy lighted up the past of my kinsman among the travelling agents for the savonarola fire insurance company was a young man by the name of brett charles brett a new employee his family had been ruined by the war and he had wandered north as the son of many a southern gentleman had been obliged to do to earn his living we became friends and frequently lunched together when his business brought him to the city brett had been in the confederate army and it occurred to me one day to ask him if he had ever known my cousin the colonel brett was acquainted with a george w flagg had known him somewhat intimately in fact but it was probably not the same man we compared notes and my flagg was his flagg but he wasnt a colonel said brett why flagg wasnt in the war at all i dont fancy he heard a gun fired unless it went off by accident in some trainingcamp for recruits he got himself exempt from service in the field by working in the government saltworks a heap of the boys escaped conscription that way in the saltworks that connected my cousin with the navy rather than with the army i would have liked not to believe bretts statement but it was so circumstantial and precise as not to be doubted brett was far from suspecting how deeply his information had cut me in spite of my loyalty the discovery that my kinsman had not been a fullblown rebel was vastly humiliating how that once curiously regarded flower of chivalry had withered what about those reckless moonlight raids what had become of prince rupert at the head of his plumed cavaliers sweeping through the valley of the shenandoah and dealing merited destruction to the boys in blue in view of bretts startling revelation my kinsmans personal anecdotes of stonewall jackson took on an amusing quality which they had not possessed for us in the original telling i was disappointed that claras astonishment was much more moderate than mine he was too brave tom dear he always seemed to be overdoing it just a grain dont you think i didnt think so at the time i was afraid he was telling the truth and now by one of those contradictions inseparable from weak humanity i regretted that he was not a hero had tumbled from the family pedestal a misguided hero to be sure but still a hero my vanity which in this case was of a complex kind had received a shock i did not recover from it for nearly three months when i received a second shock of a more serious nature it came in the shape of a letter dated at pensacola florida and written by one sylvester k matthews advising me that george flagg had died of the yellow fever in that city the previous month i gathered from the letter that the writer had been with my cousin through his illness and was probably an intimate friend at all events the details of the funeral had fallen to the charge of mr matthews who enclosed the receipted bills with the remark that he had paid them but supposed that i would prefer to do so leaving it in a way at my option the news of my cousins death grieved me more than i should have imagined beforehand he had not appreciated my kindness he had not added to my happiness while i was endeavoring to secure his he had been flagrantly ungrateful and in one or two minor matters had deceived me yet after all said and done he was my cousin my only cousin and he was dead let us criticise the living but spare the dead i put the memoranda back into the envelope they consisted of a bill for medical attendance a board bill the nurses account and an undertakers bill with its pathetic and to me happily unfamiliar items for the rest of the day i was unable to fix my attention on my work or to compose myself sufficiently to write to mr matthews i quitted the office that evening an hour earlier than was my habit whether clara was deeply affected by what had happened or whether she disapproved of my taking upon myself expenses which under the peculiar circumstances might properly be borne by flaggs intimate friend and comrade was something i could not determine she made no comments if she considered that i had already done all that my duty demanded of me to do for my cousin she was wise enough not to say so for she must have seen that i took a different and unalterable view of it clara has her own way fiftynine minutes out of the hour but the sixtieth minute is mine she was plainly not disposed to talk on the subject but i wanted to talk with some one on the subject so when dinner was through i put the matthews papers into my pocket and went up to my friend bleekers in seventeenth street though a little cynical at times he was a man whose judgment i thought well of after reading the letter and glancing over the memoranda bleeker turned to me and said you want to know how it strikes me is that it well yes the man is dead yes and buried assuredly and the bills are paid you see yourself they are receipted well then said bleeker considering all things i should let well enough alone you mean you would do nothing in the matter i should let the dead past bury its dead as longfellow says bleeker was always quoting longfellow but it isnt the dead past its the living present that has attended to the business and he has sent in his account with all the items i cant have this matthews going about the country telling everybody that i allowed him to pay my cousins funeral expenses then pay them you have come to me for advice after making up your mind to follow your own course thats just the way people do when they really want to be advised ive done it myself wesley ive done it myself the result was i sent mr matthews a check after which i impulsively threw those dreadful bills into the office grate i had no right to do it for the vouchers really belonged to mr matthews and might be wanted some day but they had haunted me like so many ghosts until i destroyed them i fell asleep that night trying to recollect whether the items included a headstone for my cousins grave i couldnt for the life of me remember and it troubled me not a little there were enough nameless graves in the south without his being added to the number one day a fortnight later as clara and i were finishing dinner young brett called at the house i had supposed him to be in omaha he had in effect just come from there and elsewhere on one of his long business tours and had arrived in the city too late in the afternoon to report himself at the office he now dropped in merely for a moment but we persuaded him to remain and share the dessert with us i purposed to keep him until clara left us to our cigars i wished to tell him of my cousins death which i did not care to do while she was at the table we were talking of this and that when brett looked up and said rather abruptly by the way i saw flagg on the street the other day in mobile he was looking well the bit of melon i had in my mouth refused to be swallowed i fancy that my face was a study a dead silence followed and then my wife reached across the table and pressing my hand said very gently wesley you were not brilliant but you were good all this was longer ago than i care to remember i heard no more from mr matthews last week oddly enough while glancing over a file of recent southern newspapers i came upon the announcement of the death of george w flagg it was yellow fever this time also if later on i receive any bills in connection with that event i shall let my friend bleeker audit them for bravery on the field of battle i the recruitingoffice at rivermouth was in a small unpainted weatherstained building on anchor street not far from the customhouse the tumbledown shell had long remained tenantless and now with its mousecolored exterior easily lent itself to its present requirements as a little military mousetrap in former years it had been occupied as a threadandneedle and candy shop by one dame trippew all such petty shops in the town were always kept by old women and these old women were always styled dames it is to be lamented that they and their innocent traffic have vanished into the unknown the interior of the building consisting of one room and an attic covered by a leanto roof had undergone no change beyond the removal of dame trippews pathetic stock at the time of her bankruptcy the narrow counter painted peagreen and divided in the centre by a swinging gate still stretched from wall to wall at the farther end of the room and behind the counter rose a series of small wooden drawers which now held nothing but a fleeting and inaccurate memory of the lavender and pennyroyal and the other sweet herbs that used to be deposited in them even the tiny cowbell which once served to warn dame trippew of the advent of a customer still hung from a bit of curved iron on the inner side of the streetdoor and continued to give out a petulant spasmodic jingle whenever that door was opened however cautiously if the good soul could have returned to the scene of her terrestrial commerce she might have resumed business at the old stand without making any alterations whatever everything remained precisely as she had left it at the instant of her exit but a wide gulf separated dame trippew from the present occupant of the premises dame trippews slight figure with its crisp snowy cap and apron and steelbowed spectacles had been replaced by the stalwart personage of a sergeant of artillery in the regular army between whose overhanging red mustache and the faint white down that had of late years come to dame trippews upper lip it would have been impossible to establish a parallel the only things these two might have claimed in common were a slackness of trade and a liking for the aromatic virginia leaf though dame trippew had taken hers in a dainty idealistic powder and the sergeant took his in realistic plug through the medium of an aggressive clay pipe in spite of the starry shield supported by two crossed cannon cut out of tin and surmounted by the national bird in the same material which hung proudly over the transom outside in spite of the drummerboy from the fort who broke the silence into slivers at intervals throughout the day in brief in spite of his own martial bearing and smart uniform the sergeant found trade very slack at rivermouth the war with mexico was not a popular undertaking if there were any heroic blood left in the old town by the sea it appeared to be in no hurry to come forward and get itself shed there were hours in which sergeant oneil despaired of his country but by degrees the situation brightened recruits began to come in and finally the town and the outlying districts chiefly the outlying districts managed to furnish a company for the state regiment one or two prominent citizens had been lured by commissions as officers but neither of the two rivermouthians who went in as privates was of the slightest civic importance one of these men was named james dutton why on earth james dutton wanted to go to the war was a puzzle to the few townsfolk who had any intimate acquaintance with the young man intimate acquaintance is perhaps too strong a term for though button was born in the town and had always lived there he was more or less a stranger to those who knew him best comrades he had of course in a manner the boys with whom he had formerly gone to the public school and two or three maturer persons whose acquaintance he had contracted later in the way of trade but with these he could scarcely be said to be intimate james duttons rather isolated condition was not in consequence of any morbid or uncouth streak in his mental makeup he was of a shy and gentle nature and his sedentary occupation had simply let the habit of solitude and unsociability form a shell about him dutton was a shoemaker and cobbler like his father before him plying his craft in the shabby cottage where he was born and had lived ever since at the foot of a narrow lane leading down to the river a lonely doleful sort of place enlivened with a bit of shelving sand where an ancient fisherman occasionally came to boil lobsters in the open lots facing the unhinged gate was an old relinquished tannery that still flavored the air with decayed hemlock and fir bark which lay here and there in dullred patches killing the grass the undulations of a colonial graveyard broke tamely against the western base of the house headstones and monuments if there had ever been any monuments had melted away only tradition and those slowly subsiding wavelike ridges of graves revealed the character of the spot within the memory of man nobody had been dropped into that dead sea the duttons father and son had dwelt here nearly twentyfour years they owned the shanty the old man was now dead having laid down his awl and lapstone just a year before the rise of those international complications which resulted in the appearance of sergeant oneil in rivermouth where he immediately tacked up the blazoned aegis of the united states over the doorway of dame trippews little shop as has been indicated the war with mexico was not looked upon with favor by the inhabitants of rivermouth who clearly perceived its underlying motive the extension of slave territory the abolition element in the town had instantly been blown to a white heat moreover war in itself excepting as a defensive measure or on a point of honor seemed rather poor business to the thrifty rivermouthians they were wholly of the opinion of birdofredom sawin that nimepunce a day fer killin folks comes kind o low fer murder that old nehemiah duttons son should have any interest one way or the other in the questions involved was inconceivable and the morning he presented himself at the recruitingoffice a strong ripple of surprise ran over the group of idlers that hung day after day around the door of the crazy tenement drawn thither by the drumtaps and a morbid sense of gunpowder in the air these idlers were too sharp or too unpatriotic to enlist themselves but they had unbounded enthusiasm for those who did after a moments hesitation they cheered jemmy dutton handsomely on the afternoon of his enlistment he was met near the postoffice by marcellus palfrey the sexton of the old brick church what are you up to anyhow jemmy asked palfrey whats your idee my idea is replied dutton that ive never been able to live freely and respectably as ive wanted to live but i mean to die like a gentleman when it comes to that what do you call a gentleman jemmy well a man who serves faithfully and stands by to lay down his life for his duty hes a gentleman thats so said palfrey he neednt have no silverplated handles nor much outside finish if hes got a satin linin hes one of gods men what really sent james dutton to the war had he some unformulated and hitherto unsuspected dream of military glory or did he have an eye to supposable gold ingots piled up in the subbasement of the halls of the montezumas was it a case of despised love or was he simply tired of reheeling and resoling the boots of rivermouth folk tired to death of the river that twice a day crept up to lap the strip of sandy beach at the foot of nutters lane tired to death of being alone and poor and aimless his motive is not positively to be known only to be guessed at we shall not trouble ourselves about it neither shall the war which for a moment casts a lurid light on his figure delay us long it was a tidy comfortable little war not without picturesque aspects out of its flame and smoke leaped two or three fine names that dazzled mens eyes awhile and among the fortunate was a silent young lieutenant of infantry a taciturn but not unamiable young lieutenant who was afterward destined to give the name of a great general into the keeping of history forever wrapped up somewhere in this mexican war is the material for a brief american epic but it is not to be unrolled and recited here ii with the departure of our countrys gallant defenders as they were loosely denominated by some the idiots as they were compactly described by others monotony again settled down upon rivermouth sergeant oneils heraldic emblems disappeared from anchor street and the quick rattle of the tenor drum at five oclock in the morning no longer disturbed the repose of peaceloving citizens the tide of battle rolled afar and its echoes were not of a quality to startle the drowsy old seaport indeed it had little at stake only four men had gone from the town proper one captain kittery died before reaching the seat of war one deserted on the way one lieutenant bangs was sent home invalided and only james dutton was left to represent the land force of his native town he might as well have died or deserted for he was promptly forgotten from time to time accounts of battles and bombardments were given in the columns of the rivermouth barnacle on which occasions the stars and stripes held in the claws of a spread eagle decorated the editorial page a cut which until then had been used only to celebrate the bloodless victories of the ballot the lists of dead wounded and missing were always read with interest or anxiety as might happen for one had friends and country acquaintances if not fellowtownsmen with the army on the rio grande meanwhile nobody took the trouble to bestow a thought on james dutton he was as remote and shadowy in mens memories as if he had been killed at thermopylae or bunkers hill but one day the name of james dutton blazed forth in a despatch that electrified the community at the storming of chapultepec private james dutton company k rivermouth had done a very valorous deed he had crawled back to a plateau on the heights from which the american troops had been driven and had brought off his captain who had been momentarily stunned by the wind of a roundshot not content with that private dutton had returned to the dangerous plateau and under a heavy fire had secured a small fieldpiece which was about to fall into the hands of the enemy later in the day this little howitzer did eminent service after touching on one or two other minor matters the despatch remarked incidentally that private james dutton had had his left leg blown off the name of james dutton was instantly on every lip in town citizens who had previously ignored his existence or really had not been aware of it were proud of him the hon jedd deane said that he had long regarded james dutton as a young man of great promise a er most remarkable young person in short one of the kind with much er latent ability postmaster mugridge observed with the strong approval of those who heard him that young dutton was nobodys fool though what especial wisdom dutton had evinced in having his leg blown off was not clear captain tewksberry commanding the local militia company the rivermouth tigers was convinced that no one who had not carefully studied scotts tactics could have brought away that gun under the circumstances here you will observe was the exposed flank of the heights there behind the chevauxdefrise lay the enemy etc etc duttons former schoolfellows began to remember that there had always been something tough and gritty in jim dutton the event was one not to be passed over by parson wibird hawkins who made a most direct reference to it in his sundays sermon job xxxix he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting after the first burst of local pride and enthusiasm had exhausted itself over young duttons brilliant action the grim fact connected with young duttons left leg began to occupy the public mind the despatch had vaguely hinted at amputation and had stopped there if his leg had been shot away was it necessary that the rest of him should be amputated in the opinion of schoolmaster grimshaw such treatment seemed almost tautological however all was presumably over by this time had poor dutton died under the operation solicitude on that point was widespread and genuine later official intelligence relieved the stress of anxiety private dutton had undergone the operation successfully and with great fortitude he was doing well and as soon as it was possible for him to bear transportation he was to be sent home he had been complimented in the commanding officers report of the action to headquarters and general winfield scott had sent private dutton a silver medal for bravery on the field of battle if the government had wanted one or two hundred volunteers from rivermouth that week was the week to get them then intervened a long silence touching james dutton this meant feverish nights and weary days in hospital and finally blissful convalescence when the scent of the orange and magnolia blossoms blown in at the open window seemed to james dutton a richer recompense than he deserved for his martyrdom at last he was in condition to be put on board a transport for new orleans thence a manofwar was to convey him to rivermouth where the ship was to be overhauled and have its own wounds doctored when it was announced from the fort that the vessel bearing james dutton had been sighted off the coast and would soon be in the narrows the town was thrown into such a glow of excitement as it had not experienced since the day a breathless and bedraggled man on horseback had dashed into rivermouth with the news that the sons of liberty in boston had pitched the british tea overboard the hero of chapultepec the only hero rivermouth had had since the colonial period was coming up the narrows it is odd that three fourths of anything should be more estimable than the whole supposing the whole to be estimable when james dutton had all his limbs he was lightly esteemed and here was rivermouth about to celebrate a fragment of him the normally quiet and unfrequented street leading down to the boatlanding was presently thronged by rivermouthians men women and children the arrival of a united states vessel always stirred an emotion in the town naval officers were prime favorites in aristocratic circles and there were few ships in the service that did not count among their bluejackets one or more men belonging to the port thus all seaworn mariners in uncle sams employ were sure of both patrician and democratic welcome at rivermouth but the present ship contained an especially valuable cargo it was a patient and characteristically undemonstrative crowd that assembled on the wharf a crowd content to wait an hour or more without a murmur after the ship had dropped anchor in midstream for the captains gig to be lowered from the davits the shrill falsetto of the boatswains whistle suddenly informed those on shore of what was taking place on the starboard side and in a few minutes the gig came sweeping across the blue water with james dutton seated in the sternsheets and looking very pale he sat there from time to time pulling his blond mustache evidently embarrassed a cheer or two rose from the wharf when the eight gleaming blades simultaneously stood upright in air as if the movement had been performed by some mechanism the disembarkment followed in dead silence for the interest was too novel and too intense to express itself noisily those nearest to james dutton pressed forward to shake hands with him but this ceremony had to be dispensed with as he hobbled on his crutches through the crowd piloted by postmaster mugridge to the hack which stood in waiting at the head of the wharf dutton was driven directly to his own little cottage in nutters lane which had been put in order for his occupancy the small grocery closet had been filled with supplies the fire had been lighted in the diminutive kitchen stove and the teakettle was twittering on top like a bird on a bough the twombly girls priscilla and mehitabel had set some pansies and lilacs here and there in blue china mugs and decorated with greenery the faded daguerreotype of old nehemiah dutton which hung like a slowly dissolving ghost over his ancient shoemakers bench as james dutton hobbled into the contracted room where he had spent the tedious years of his youth and manhood he had to lift a hand from one of the crutches to brush away the tears that blinded him it was so good to be at home again illustration with caption held an informal reception that afternoon dutton held an informal reception there was a constant coming and going of persons not in the habit of paying visits in so unfashionable a neighborhood as nutters lane now and then a townsman conscious that his unimportance did not warrant his unintroduced presence inside lounged carelessly by the door and through the rest of the day several small boys turned somersaults and skylarked under the window or sat in rows on the rail fence opposite the gate among others came the hon jedd deane with his most pronounced websterian air he was always oscillating between the manner of webster and that of rufus choate to pay his respects to james dutton which was considered a great compliment indeed a few days later this statesman invited dutton to dine with him at the ancestral mansion in mulberry avenue in company with parson wibird hawkins postmaster mugridge and silas trefethen the collector of the port it was intimated that young dutton had handled himself under this ordeal with as much selfpossession and dignity as if he had always dined off colonial china and had always stirred his afterdinner coffee with a spoon manufactured by paul revere a motion to give james dutton a limited public banquet at which the politicians could have a chance to unfold their eloquence was discussed and approved by the board of selectmen but subsequently laid on the table it being reported that mr dutton had declared that he would rather have his other leg blown off than make a speech this necessarily killed the project for a reply from him to the chairmans opening address was a sine qua non life now opened up all sunshine to james dutton his personal surroundings were of the humblest but it was home sweet sweet home one may roam amid palaces even amid the halls of the montezumas yet after all ones own imperfect drain is the best the very leatherparings and bits of thread that had drifted from the workbench into the front yard and seemed to have taken root there like some strange exotic weed were a delight to him duttons inability to move about as in former years sometimes irked him but everything else was pleasant he resolved to make the best of this one misfortune since without it he would never have been treated with such kindness and consideration the constant employment he found at his trade helped him to forget that he had not two legs a man who is obliged to occupy a cobblers bench day after day has no special need of legs at all everybody brought jobs to his door and dutton had as much work as he could do at times indeed he was forced to decline a commission he could hardly credit his senses when this occurred so life ran very smoothly with him for the first time in his existence he found himself humming or whistling an accompaniment to the rattattat of his hammer on the soleleather no hour of the twentyfour hung heavily on him in the rear of the cottage was a bit of ground perhaps forty feet square with an old elm in the centre under which dutton liked to take his nooning it was here he used to play years ago a quiet dreamy lad with no companions except the squirrels a family of them still inhabited the ancient boughs and it amused him to remember how he once believed that the nimble brown creatures belonged to a tribe of dwarf indians who might attempt to scalp him with their little knives if they caught him out after dusk though his childhood had not been happy he had reached a bend in the road where to pause and look back was to find the retrospect full of fairy lights and coloring almost every evening one or two old acquaintances with whom he had not been acquainted dropped in to chat with him mainly about the war he had shared in all the skirmishes and battles from cerro gordo and molino del rey up to the capture of chapultepec and it was something to hear of these matters from one who had been a part of what he saw it was considered a favor to be allowed to examine at short range that medal for bravery on the field of battle it was a kind of honor just to heft it as somebody said one night there were visitors upon whom the impression was strong that general scott had made the medal with his own hands james dutton was ever modest in speaking of his single personal exploit he guessed he didnt know what he was doing at the moment when he tumbled the howitzer into the ravine from which the boys afterward fished it out you see things were anyway up on that plateau the copper bullets were flying like hailstones so it didnt much matter where a fellow went he was sure to get peppered of course the captain couldnt be left up there we wanted him for morning parades then i happened to see the little fieldpiece stranded among the chaparral it was a cursed nice little cannon it would have been a blighting shame to have lost it i suppose you didnt leave your heart down there along with the senoriteers did you jemmy inquired a town lovelace no said dutton always perfectly matter of fact i left my leg ah yes life was very pleasant to him in those days not only kindnesses but honors were showered upon him parson wibird hawkins in the course of an address before the rivermouth historical and genealogical society that winter paid an eloquent tribute to the glorious military career of our young townsman which was no more than justice for if a man who has had a limb shot off in battle has not had a touch of glory then war is an imposition whenever a distinguished stranger visited the town he was not let off without the question are you aware sir that we have among us one of the heroes of the late mexican war and then a stroll about town to the various points of historic interest invariably ended at the unpretending doorstep of duttons cottage at the celebration of the first fourth of july following his return from mexico james dutton was pretty nearly if not quite the chief feature of the procession riding in an open barouche immediately behind that of the governor the boys would have marched him all by himself if it had been possible to form him into a hollow square from this day james dutton in his faded coat and battered artillery cap was held an indispensable adjunct to all turnouts of a warlike complexion nor was his fame wholly local now and then as time went on some old comrade of the army of the rio grande a member perhaps of old company k would turn up in rivermouth for no other apparent purpose than to smoke a pipe or so with button at his headquarters in nutters lane if he sometimes chanced to furnish the caller with a dollar or two of the sinews of war it was nobodys business the days on which these visits fell were redletter days to james dutton it was a proud moment when he found himself one afternoon sitting at schoolmaster grimshaws invitation on the platform in the recitationroom of the temple grammar school sitting on the very platform with the green baizecovered table to which he had many a time marched up sideways to take a feruling something of the old awe and apprehension which master grimshaw used to inspire crept over him there were instants when dutton would have abjectly held out his hand if he had been told to do it he had been invited to witness the evolutions of the graduating class in history and oratory and the moisture gathered in his honest blue eyes when a panicstricken urchin faltered forth we were not many we who stood before the iron sleet that day dutton listened to it all with unruffled gravity there was never a more gentle hero or one with a slighter sense of humor than the hero of chapultepec duttons lot was now so prosperous as to exclude any disturbing thoughts concerning the future the idea of applying for a pension never entered his head until the subject was suggested to him by postmaster mugridge a more worldly man an officeholder himself with a carefully peeled eye on government patronage dutton then reflected that perhaps a pension would be handy in his old age when he could not expect to work steadily at his trade even if he were able to work at all he looked about him for somebody to manage the affair for him lawyer penhallow undertook the business with alacrity but the alacrity was all on his side for there were thousands of yards of red tape to be unrolled at washington before anything in that sort could be done at that conservative stage of our national progress it was not possible for a man to obtain a pension simply because he happened to know the brother of a man who knew another man that had intended to go to the war and didnt duttons claims too were seriously complicated by the fact that he had lost his discharge papers so the matter dragged and was still dragging when it ceased to be of any importance to anybody whenever james dutton glanced into the future it was with a tranquil mind he pictured himself should he not fall out of the ranks a whitehaired possibly a baldheaded old boy sitting of summer evenings on the doorstep of his shop and telling stories to the children the children and grandchildren of his present associates and friends he would naturally have laid up something by that time besides there was his pension meanwhile though he moved in a humble sphere was not his lot an enviable one there were long years of pleasant existence to be passed through before he reached the period of old age of course that would have its ailments and discomforts but its compensations also it seemed scarcely predictable that the years to come held for him either great sorrows or great felicities he would never marry and though he might have to grieve over a fallen comrade here and there his heart was not to be wrung by the possible death of wife or child with the tints of the present he painted his simple future and was content sometimes the experiences of the last few years took on the semblance of a haunting dream those long marches through a land rich with strange foliage and fruits the enchanted southern nights the life in camp the roar of battle and that one bewildering day on the heights of chapultepec it all seemed phantasmagoric but there was his mutilation to assure him of the reality and there on anchor street growing grayer and more wrinkled every season stood the little building where he had enlisted to be sure the shield was gone from the transom and the spiders had stretched their reticulated barricades across the entrance but whenever dutton hobbled by the place he could almost see sergeant oneil leaning in an insidious attitude against the doorsill and smoking his short clay pipe as of old yet as time elapsed this figure also grew indistinct and elusive like the rest possibly but this is the merest conjecture and has bearing only on a later period possibly it may have sometimes occurred to james dutton in a vague way that after all there had been something ironical and sinister in his good fortune the very circumstance that had lifted him from his obscurity had shut him out from further usefulness in life his one success had defeated him he was stranded and could do no more if such a reflection ever came to him no expression of it found a way to his lips the weeks turned themselves into months and the months into years perhaps four years had passed by when clouds of a perceptible density began to gather on james duttons bright horizon the wisest of poets has told us that custom dulls the edge of appetite one gets used to everything even to heroes james dutton was beginning to lose the bloom of his novelty indeed he had already lost it the process had been so gradual so subtile in its working that the final result came upon him like something that had happened suddenly but this was not the fact he might have seen it coming if he had watched one by one his customers had drifted away from him his shop was out of the beaten track and a fashionable boot and shoe establishment newly sprung up in the business part of the town had quietly absorbed his patrons there was no conscious unkindness in this desertion thoughtless neglect all the more bitter by contrast had followed thoughtless admiration admiration and neglect are apt to hunt in couples nearly all the customers left on duttons hands had resolved themselves into two collateral classes those who delayed and those who forgot to pay that unreached pension which flitted like an ignis fatuus the instant one got anywhere near it would have been very handy to have just then the want of it had come long before old age dutton was only twentynine yet he somehow seemed old the indoor confinement explained his pallor but not the deepening lines that recently began to spread themselves fanlike at the corners of his eyes callers at nutters lane had now become rare birds the dwindling of his visitors had at first scarcely attracted his notice it had been so gradual like the rest but at last dutton found himself alone the old solitude of his youth had reknitted its shell around him now that he was unsustained by the likelihood of some one looking in on him the evenings especially the winter evenings were long to dutton owing to weak eyes he was unable to read much and then he was not naturally a reader he was too proud or too shy to seek the companionship which he might have found at meekss drugstore moreover the society there was not of a kind that pleased him it had not pleased him in the old days and now he saw how narrow and poor it was having had a glimpse of the broad world the moonlight nights when he could sit at the window and look out on the gleaming river and the objects on the farther shore were bearable something seemed always to be going on in the old disused buryingground he was positive that on certain nights uncanny figures flitted from dark to dark through a broad intervening belt of silvery moonshine a busy spot after all these years but when it was pitchblack outside he had no resources his workbench with its polished concave leather seat the scanty furniture and his fathers picture on the wall grew hateful to him at an hour when the social life of the town was at its beginning he would extinguish his melancholy tallowdip and go to bed lying awake until long after all the rest of the world slumbered this lying awake soon became a habit the slightest sound broke his sleep the gnawing of a mouse behind the mopboard or a change in the wind and then insomnia seized upon him he lay there listening to the summer breeze among the elms or to the autumn winds that sweeping up from the sea teased his ear with muffled accents of wrecked and drowning men the pay for the few jobs which came to him at this juncture was insufficient to supply many of his simple wants it was sometimes a choice with him between food and fuel when he was younger he used to get all the chips and kindling he wanted from sherburns shipyard three quarters of a mile away but handicapped as he now was it was impossible for him to compass that distance over the slippery sidewalk or through the drifted roadbed during the particular winter here in question james dutton was often cold and oftener hungry and nobody suspected it a word in the ear of parson wibird hawkins or the hon jedd deane or any of the scores of kindhearted townsfolk would have changed the situation but to make known his distress to appeal for charity to hold out his hand and be a pauper that was not in him from his point of view if he could have done that he would not have been the man to rescue his captain on the fiery plateau and then go back through that hell of musketry to get the mountain howitzer he was secretly and justly proud of saving his captains life and of bringing off that cursed nice little cannon he gloried over it many a time to himself and often of late took the medal of honor from its imitationmorocco case and read the inscription by the light of his flickering candle the embossed silver words seemed to spread a lambent glow over all the squalid little cabin seemed almost to set it on fire more than once some irrepressible small boy prowling at night in the neighborhood and drawn like a moth by the flame of duttons candle had set his eye to a crack in the doorpanel and seen the shoemaker sitting on the edge of his bed with the medal in his hand until within a year or eighteen months dutton had regularly attended the sunday morning service at the old brick church one service was all he could manage for it was difficult for him to mount the steep staircase leading to his seat in the gallery that his attendance slackened and finally ceased altogether he tried in his own mind to attribute to this difficulty and not to the fact that his best suit had become so threadbare as to make him ashamed though the congregation now seldom glanced up as it used to do at the organloft where he sat separated from the choir by a low green curtain thus he had on his hands the whole unemployed day with no break in its monotony and it often seemed interminable the puritan sabbath as it then existed was not a thing to be trifled with all temporal affairs were sternly set aside earth came to a standstill dutton however conceived the plan of writing down in a little blankbook the events of his life the task would occupy and divert him and be no flagrant sin but there had been no events in his life until the one great event so his autobiography resolved itself into a single line on the first page sept had my leg shot off what else was there to record except a transient gleam of sunshine immediately after his return home and his present helplessness and isolation it was one morning at the close of a particularly bitter december the rivershore was sheathed in thicker ice than had been known for twenty years the cold snap with its freaks among waterpipes and windowglass and strawbedded roots in front gardens was a thing that was to be remembered and commented on for twenty years to come all natural phenomena have a curious attraction for persons who live in small towns and villages the weathercock on the spire and the barometer on the back piazza are studied as they are not studied by dwellers in cities a habit of keen observation of trivial matters becomes second nature in rural places the provincial eye grows as sharp as the woodsmans thus it happened that somebody passing casually through nutters lane that morning noticed noticed it as a thing of course since it was so that no smoke was coming out of duttons chimney the observer presently mentioned the fact at the brick market up town and some of the bystanders began wondering if dutton had overslept himself or if he were under the weather nobody recollected seeing him lately and nobody recollected not seeing him a person so seldom in the street as dutton is not soon missed dr meeks concluded that he would look in at nutters lane on the way home with his marketing the man who had remarked the absence of smoke had now a blurred impression that the shutters of duttons shopwindow had not been taken down it looked as if things were not quite right with him two or three persons were going in dr meekss direction so they accompanied him and turned into nutters lane with the doctor the shopshutters were still up and no feather of smoke was curling from the one chimney of duttons little house dr meeks rapped smartly on the door without bringing a response after waiting a moment he knocked again somewhat more heavily but with like ill success then he tried the latch the door was bolted i think the lad must be sick said dr meeks glancing hurriedly over his shoulder at his companions what shall we do i guess wed better see if he is said a man named philbrick let me come there and without further words philbrick pressed his full weight against the pinewood panels the rusty fastening gave way and the door flew open cold as it was without a colder breath seemed to issue from the interior the door opened directly into the main apartment which was duttons shop and sleepingplace in one it was a lovely morning and the sunshine as if it had caught a glitter from the floating points of ice on the river poured in through a rear window and flooded the room with gold james dutton was lying on his pallet in the farther corner he was dead he must have been dead several hours perhaps two or three days the medal lay on his breast from which his right hand had evidently slipped the downlike frost on the medal was so thick as to make it impossible to distinguish the words for bravery on the field of battle
