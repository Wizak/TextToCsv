the incredible event occurred during my third visit to gustav von seyfertitz my foreign psychoanalyst i should have guessed at the strange explosion before it came after all my alienist truly alien had the coincidental name von seyfertitz of the tall lean aquiline menacing and therefore beautiful actor who played the high priest in the film she in she the wondrous villain waved his skeleton fingers hurled insults summoned sulfured flames destroyed slaves and knocked the world into earthquakes after that at liberty he could be seen riding the hollywood boulevard trolley cars as calm as a mummy as quiet as an unwired telephone pole where was i ah yes it was my third visit to my psychiatrist he had called that day and cried douglas you stupid goddamn son of a bitch its time for beddybye beddybye was of course his couch of pain and humiliation where i lay writhing in agonies of assumed jewish guilt and northern baptist stress as he from time to time muttered a fruitcake remark or dumb or if you ever do that again ill kill you as you can see gustav von seyfertitz was a most unusual mine specialist mine yes our problems are land mines in our heads step on them shocktroop therapy he once called it searching for words blitzkrieg i offered ja he grinned his shark grin thats it again this was my third visit to his strange metalliclooking room with a most odd series of locks on a roundish door suddenly as i was maundering and treading dark waters i heard his spine stiffen behind me he gasped a great death rattle sucked air and blew it out in a yell that curled and bleached my hair dive dive i dove thinking that the room might be struck by a titanic iceberg i fell to scuttle beneath the lionclawfooted couch dive cried the old man dive i whispered and looked up to see a submarine periscope all polished brass slide up to vanish in the ceiling gustav von seyfertitz stood pretending not to notice me the sweatoiled leather couch or the vanished brass machine very calmly in the fashion of conrad veidt in casablanca or erich von like jack nicklaus hits a ball bamm a hand grenade that was the sound my germanic friends boots made as he knocked them together in a salute crrrack gustav mannerheim auschlitz von seyfertitz baron woldstein at your service he lowered his voice unterderseaboat i thought he might say doktor but unterderseaboat captain i scrambled off the floor another crrrack andthe periscope slid calmly down out of the ceiling the most beautiful freudian cigar i had ever seen no i gasped have i ever lied to you many times but he shrugged little white ones he stepped to the periscope slapped two handles in place slammed one eye shut and crammed the other angrily against the view piece turning the periscope in a slow roundabout of the room the couch and me fire one he ordered i almost heard the torpedo leave its tube fire two he said and a second soundless and invisible bomb motored on its way to infinity struck midships i sank to the couch you you i said mindlessly it i pointed at the brass machine this i touched couch why sit down said von seyfertitz i am lie down id rather not i said uneasily von seyfertitz turned the periscope so its topmost eye raked at an angle glared at me it had an uncanny resemblance in its glassy coldness his own fierce hawks gaze his voice from behind the periscope echoed so you want to know eh how gustav von seyfertitz baron woldstein suffered to leave the cold ocean depths depart his dear north sea ship flee his destroyed and beaten fatherland to become the unterderseaboat doktor now that you mention i never mention i declare and my declarations are seabattle commands so i noticed shut up sit back not just now i said uneasily his heels knocked as he let his right hand spider to his top coat pocket and slip forth yet a forth eye with which to fasten me a bright thin monocle which he screwed into his stare as if decupping a boiled egg i winced for now the monocle was part of his glare and regarded me with cold fire why the monocle i said idiot it is to cover my good eye so that neither there eye can see and my intuition is free to work oh i said and he began his monologue and as he talked i realized his need had been pent up capped years so he talked on and on forgetting me and it was during this monologue that a strange thing occurred i rose slowly to my feet as herr doktor von seyfertitz circled his long slim cigar printing smoke cumuli on the air which read like white rorschach blots with each implantation of his foot a word ca out and then another in a sort of plodding grammar sometimes he stopped and stood poised with one leg raised and one word stopped in his mouth to be turned on his tongue and examined then the shoe went down the noun slid forth and the verb and object in good time until at last circling i found myself in a chair stunned for i saw herr doktor von seyfertitz stretched on his couch his long spider fingers laced on his chest it has been no easy thing to come forth on land he sibilated some days i was the jellyfish frozen others the shorestrewn octopi at least with tentacles or the crayfish sucked back into my skull but i have built my spine year on year and now i walk among the land men and survive he paused to take a trembling breath then continued i moved in stages from the depths to a houseboat to a wharf bungalow to a shoretent and then back to a canal in a city and at last to new york an island surrounded by water eh but where where in all this i wondered would a submarine commander find his place his work his mad love and activity it was one afternoon in a building with the worlds longest elevator that it struck me like a hand grenade in the ganglion going down down down other people crushed around me and the numbers descending and the floors whizzing by the glass windows rushing by flickerflash flickerflash conscious subconscious id egoid life death lust kill lust dark light plummeting falling ninety eighty fifty lower depths high exhilaration id ego id until this shout blazed from my raw throat in a great allaccepting panicmanic shriek dive dive i remember i said dive i screamed so loudly that my fellow passengers in shock peed merrily among stunned faces i stepped out of the lift to find onesixteenth of an inch of pee on the floor have a nice day i said jubilant with selfdiscovery then ran to selfemployment to hang a shingle and next my periscope carried from the mutilated divested castrated unterderseaboat all these years too stupid to see in it my psychological future and my final downfall my beautiful artifact the brass genitalia of psychotic research the von seyfertitz mark nine periscope thats quite a story i said damn right snorted the alienist eyes shut and more than half of it true did you listen what have you learned that more submarine captains should become psychiatrists so i have often wondered did nemo really die when his submarine was destroyed or did he run off to become my greatgrandfather and were his psychological bacteria passed along until i came into the world thinking to command the ghostlike mechanisms that haunt the under tides to wind up with the fiftyminute vaudeville routine in this sad psychotic city i got up and touched the fabulous brass symbol that hung like a scientific stalactite in midceiling may i look i wouldnt if i were you he only half heard me lying in the midst of his depression as in a dark cloud its only a periscope but a good cigar is a smoke i remembered sigmund freuds quote about cigars laughed and touched the periscope again dont he said well you dont actually use this for anything do you its just a remembrance of your past from your last sub yes you think that he sighed look i hesitated then pasted one eye to the viewer shut the other and cried oh jesus i warned you said von seyfertitz for they were there enough nightmares to paper a thousand cinema screens enough phantoms to haunt ten thousand castle walls enough panics to shake forty cities into ruin my god i thought he could sell the film rights to this worldwide the first psychological kaleidoscope in history and in the instant another thought came how much of that stuff in there is me or von seyfertitz or both are these strange shapes my maundering daymares sneezed out in the past weeks when i talked eyes shut did my mouth spray invisible founts of small beasts which caught in the periscope chambers grew outsize like the microscopic photos of those germs that hide in eyebrows and pores magnified a million times to become elephants on scientific american covers are these images from other lost souls trapped on that couch and caught in the submarine device or leftovers from my eyelashes and psyche its worth millions i cried do you know what this is collected spiders gila monsters trips to the moon without gossamer wings iguanas toads out of bad sisters mouths diamonds out of good fairies ears crippled shadow dancers from bali cutstring puppets from geppettos attic littleboy statues that pee white wine sexual trapeze performers alleyoop obscene fingerpantomimes evil clown faces gargoyles that talk when it rains and whisper when the wind rises basement bins full of poisoned honey dragonflies that sew every fourteenyearolds orifices to keep them neat until they rip the sutures aged eighteen towers with mad witches garrets with mummies for lumber he ran out of steam you get the general drift nuts i said youre bored i could get you a fivemilliondollar deal with amalgamated fruitcakes inc and the sigmund f dreamboats split three ways you dont understand said von seyfertitz i am keeping myself busy busy so i wont remember all the people i torpedoed sank drowned midatlantic in i am not in the amalgamated fruitcake cinema business i only wish to keep myself occupied by paring fingernails cleaning earwax and erasing inkblots from odd beanbags like you if i stop i will fly apart that periscope contains all and everything i have seen and known in the past forty years of observing pecans cashews and almonds by staring at them i lose my own terrible life lost in the tides if you won my periscope in some shoddy flybynight hollywood strip poker i would sink three times in my waterbed never to be seen again have i shown you my waterbed three times as large as any pool i do eighty laps asleep each night sometimes forty when i catnap noons to answer your million fold offer no and suddenly he shivered all over his hands clutched at his heart my god he shouted too late he was realizing he had let me step into his mind and life now he was on his feet between me and the periscope staring at it and me as if we were both terrors you saw nothing in that nothing at all i did you lie how could you be such a liar do you know what would happen if this got out if you ran around making accusations my god he raved on if the world knew if someone said his words gummed shut in his mouth as if he were tasting the truth of what he said as if he saw me for the first time and i was a gun fired full in his face i would be laughed out of the city such a goddamn ridiculous hey wait a minute you it was as if he had slipped a devil mask over his face his eyes grew wide his mouth gaped i examined his face and saw murder i sidled toward the door you wouldnt say anything to anyone he said no how come you suddenly know everything about me you told me yes he admitted dazed looking around for a weapon wait if you dont mind i said id rather not and i was out the door and down the hall my knees jumping to knock my jaw come back cried von seyfertitz behind me i must kill you i was afraid of that i reached the elevator first and by a miracle it flung wide its doors when i banged the down button i jumped in say goodbye cried von seyfertitz raising his fist as if it held a bomb goodbye i said the doors slammed i did not see von seyfertitz again for a year meanwhile i dined out often not without guilt telling friends and strangers on street corners of my collision with a submarine commander become phrenologist so with my giving one shake of the ripe fruit tree nuts fell overnight they brimmed the barons lap to flood his bank account his grand slam will be recalled at centurys end appearances on phil donahue oprah winfrey and gerarldo in one single cyclonic afternoon with interchangeable hyperboles positivenegativepositive every hour there were von seyfertitz laser games and duplicates of his submarine periscope sold at the museum of modern art and the smithsonian with the super inducement of a halfmillion dollars he forcefed and easily sold a bad book duplicates of the animalcules lurks and curious critters trapped in his brass viewer arose in popup coloring books pasteon tattoos and inkpad rubberstamp nightmares at beastsrus i had hoped that all this would cause him to forgive and forget no one noon a year and a month later my doorbell rang and there stood gustav von seyfertitz f baron woldstein tears streaming down his cheeks how come i didnt kill you that day he mourned you didnt catch me i said oh ja that was it i looked into the old mans rainwashed tearravened face and said who died me or is it i ah to hell with it me you see before you he grieved a creature who suffers from the rumpelstiltskin syndrome rumpel stiltskin two halves with a rip from chin to fly yank my forelock go ahead watch me fall apart at the seam like zipping a psychotic zipper i fall two herr doktor admirals for the sick price of one and which is the doktor who heals and which the sellout bestseller admiral it takes two mirrors to tell not to mention the smoke he stopped and looked around holding his head together with his hands can you see the crack am i splitting again to become this crazy sailor who desires richness and fame being sieved through the hands of crazed ladies with ruptured libidos suffering fish i call them but take their money spit spend you should have such a year dont laugh im not laughing then cheer up while i finish can i lie down is that a couch too short what do i do with my legs sit sidesaddle von seyfertitz laid himself out with his legs draped over one side hey not bad sit behind dont look over my shoulder avert your gaze neither smirk nor pull long faces as i get out the crazyglue and paste rumpel back with stiltskin the name of my next book god help me damn you to hell you and your damned periscope not mine yours you wanted me to discover it that day i suppose you had been whispering dive dive for years to patients half asleep but you couldnt resist the loudest scream ever dive that was your captain speaking wanting fame and money enough to chock a horse show god murmured von seyfertitz how i hate it when youre honest feeling better already how much do i owe you he arose now we go kill the monsters instead of you monsters at my office if we can get in past the lunatics you have lunatics outside as well as in now have i ever lied to you often but i added little white ones come he said we got out of the elevator to be confronted by a long line of worshippers and supplicants there must have been seventy people strung out between the elevator and the barons door waiting with copies of books by madame blavatsky krishna murti and shirley maclaine under their arms there was a roar like a suddenly opened furnace door when they saw the baron we beat it on the double and got inside his office before anyone could surge to follow see what you have done to me von seyfertitz pointed the office walls were covered with expensive teak paneling the desk was from napoleons age an exquisite empire piece worth at least fifty thousand dollars the couch was the best soft leather i had ever seen and the two pictures on the wall were originalsa renoir and a monet my god millions i thought okay i said the beasts you said youll kill them not me the old man wiped his eyes with the back of one hand then made a fist yes he cried stepping up to the fine periscope which reflected his face madly distorted in its elongated shape like this thus and so and before i could prevent he gave the brass machine a terrific slap with his hand and then a blow and another blow and another with both fists cursing then he grabbed the periscope as if it were the neck of a spoiled child and throttled and shook it i cannot say what i heard in that instant perhaps real sounds perhaps imagined temblors like a glacier cracking in the spring or icicles in midnight perhaps it was a sound like a great kite breaking its skeleton in the wind and collapsing in folds of tissue maybe i thought i heard a vast breath in sucked a cloud dissolving up inside itself or did i sense clock machineries spun so wildly they smoked off their foundations and fell like brass snowflakes i put my eye to the periscope i looked in upon nothing it was just a brass tube with some crystal lenses and a view of an empty couch no more i seized the view piece and tried to screw it into some new focus on a far place and some dream bacteria that might fibrillate across an unimaginable horizon but the couch remained only a couch and the wall beyond looked back at me with its great blank face von seyfertitz leaned forward and a tear ran off the tip of his nose to fall on one rusted fist are they dead he whispered gone good they deserved to die now i can return to some kind of normal sane world and with each word his voice fell deeper within his throat his chest his soul until it like the vaporous haunts within the perikaleidoscope melted into silence he clenched his fists together in a fierce clasp of prayer like one who beseeches god to deliver him from plagues and whether he was once again praying for my death eyes shut or whether he simply wished me gone with the visions within the brass device i could not say i only knew that my gossip had done a terrible and irrevocable thing me and my wild enthusiasm for a psychological future and the fame of this incredible captain from beneath nemos tidal seas gone murmured gustav von seyfertitz baron woldstein whispered for the last time gone that was almost the end i went around a month later the landlord reluctantly let me look over the premises mostly because i hinted that i might be renting we stood in the middle of the empty room where i could see the dent marks where the couch had once stood i looked up at the ceiling it was empty whats wrong said the landlord didnt they fix it so you cant see damn fool baron made a damn big hole up into the office above rented that too but never used it for anything i knew of there was just that big damn hole he left when he went away i sighed with relief nothing left upstairs nothing i looked up at the perfectly blank ceiling nice job of repair i said thank god said the landlord what i often wonder ever happened to gustav von seyfertitz did he move to vienna to take up residence perhaps in or near dear sigmunds very own address does he live in rio aerating fellow unterderseaboat captains who cant sleep for seasickness roiling on their waterbeds under the shadow of the andes cross or is he in south pasadena within striking distance of the fruit larder nut farms disguised as film studios i cannot guess all i know is that some nights in the year oh once or twice in a deep sleep i hear this terrible shout his cry dive dive dive and wake to find myself sweating far und my bed zaharoffrichtcr mark v in the twilight just before sunrise it was the most ordinarylooking building he had seen since the chicken farm of his youth it stood in the middle of an empty field full of cricket weeds and cacti mostly dust and some neglected footpaths in the half darkness charlie crowe left the rollsroyce engine runfling at the curb behind him and babbled going along the shadowed path leading the way for rank gibson who glanced back at the gently purring car shouldnt you no no charlie crowe cut in no one would steal a rollsroyce now would they how far would they get to the next corner before someone else stole it from them come along whats the hurry weve got all morning thats what you think chum weve got charlie

paintflaked door inside to yet another locked door which opened when charlie crowe pointed his electric laser at it they stepped into an elevator whats an elevator doing in a shack in an empty lot at five in the morning hush the floor sank under them and they traveled what might have been seventy or eighty feet straight down to where another door whispered aside and they stepped out into a long hall of a dozen doors on each side with a few dozen pleasantly glowing lights above before he could exclaim again hank gibson was hustled past these doors that bore the names of cities and countries damn cried hank gibson i hate being rushed through one godawful mystery after another im working on a novel and a feature for my newspaper ive no time for the biggest story in the world bosh you and i will write it share the profits you cant resist calamities chaos holocausts you were always great for hyperbole quiet its my turn to show and tell charlie crowe displayed his wristwatch were wasting

special door marked haussmann places and dates dates and places how in hell should i know why or how to choose dont these cities and dates ring any bells stir any dust peek here glance there go on hank gibson peeked to one side through a glass window on the topmost part of a door marked he saw looks like paris press the button there under the glass hank gibson pressed the button now look hank gibson looked my god paris in flames and theres the guillotine correct now next door next window hank gibson moved and peeked paris again by god do i press the button why not he pressed jesus its

major countrygone biggest quake in that territory in half a century they paused at two more windows tokyo and san francisco both whole entire intact at first glance touch the button all fall down gibson turned away shaken and pale well said his friend charlie whats the sum gibson stared along the hall to left and right war and peace or peace destroying itself without war touche why are you showing me all this for your future and mine untold riches incredible revelations amazing truths andale vamoose charlie crowe flashed his laser pen at the largest door at the far end of the hall the double locks hissed the door sank away to one side revealing a large boardroom with a huge table forty feet in length surrounded by twenty leather chairs on each side and something like a throne somewhat elevated at the far end go sit up at the end said charlie hank gibson moved slowly oh for christ sake shake a leg weve only seven more minutes before the end of the world end just joking ready hank gibson sat fire away the table the chairs and the room shook gibson leaped up what was that nothing charlie crowe checked his watch at least not yet sit back what have you seen gibson settled in his chair uneasily grasping the arms damned if i know history yes but what kind war and peace peace and war bad peace of course earthquakes and fire admirable now whos responsible for all that destruction two kinds what war politicians i guess ethnic mobs greed jealousy munitions manufacturers the krupp works in germany zaharoff wasnt that his name the big munitions king the grand mullah of all the warmongers films of him on the newsreels in cinemas when i was a kid zaharoff yes what about the other side of the hall the earthquakes god did it only god no helpers how can anyone help an earthquake partially indirectly collaboratively an earthquake is an earthquake a city just happens to be in its way underfoot wrong hank wrong what if i told you that those cities were not accidentally built there what if i told you w had planned to build them there on purpose to be destroyed nuts no hank creative annihilation we were up to these tricks as far back as the tang dynasty earthquakewise on the one hand citywise paris warwise we we whos we me hank and my cohorts not in crimson and gold but good dark cloth and decent ties and fine architectural school graduates we did it hank we built the cities so as to tear them down to knock them apart with earthquakes or kill their with bombs and war war and bombs we we in this room or rooms like it all across the world men sat in those chairs on the left and right with the grand muckymuck of all architects there where you sit architects you dont think all of those earthquakes all of those wars happened by mere accident pure chance we did it hank the blueprint urbanplan architects of the world not the munitions makers or politicians oh we used them as puppets marionettes useful idiots but we the superb hired city architects set out to build and then destroy our pets our buildings our cities for gods sake how insane why why so that every forty fifty sixty ninety years we could start over with fresh projects new concepts renewed jobs cash on the line for everyone blueprinters planners craftsmen builders stonemasons diggers carpenters glaziers gardeners knock it all down start new you mean you studied where the earthquakes hid where they might erupt every seam crack and fault in every territory stage land in the world thats where we built the cities or most of them bs you couldnt do that you and your planners people would find out they never knew or found out we met in secret covered our tracks a small klan a wee band of conspirators in every country in every age like the masons eh or some inquisitional catholic sect or an underground muslim grot it doesnt take many or much and the average politician dumb or stupid took our word for it this is the site heres the very place plant your capital here your town there perfectly safe until the next quake eh hank poppycock watch your language i refuse to believe the room shook the chairs trembled half out of his chair hank gibson sank back the color in his face sank too two minutes to go said charlie crowe shall i talk fast well you dont think the destiny of the world would be left to your ordinary farmbeast politico do you have you ever sat at a rotarylions lunch with those sweet imbecile chamber of commerce stallions sleep an dreams would you let the world jog along wit zaharoff and his gunmakerpowder experts hell no they only know how to fire steel and package nitro so our people the same people who built the cities on the earthquake fault lines to ensure new work to build more cities we planned the wars secretly we provoked guided steered influenced the politicians to boil over one way or tother and paris and the terror followed dogged by napoleon trailed by the paris commune in which haussmann taking advantage of the chaos tore down and rebuilt the city to the madness of some delight of others consider dresden london tokyo hiroshima we architects paid cold cash to get hitler out of jail in then we architect mosquitopestered the japanese to invade manchuria import junk iron antagonize roosevelt bomb pearl harbor sure the emperor approved sure the generals knew delight sure the kamikazes took off for oblivion joyously happy but behind the scenes we architects clapping hands rubbing palms for the moola shoved them up not the politicians not the military not the arms merchants but the sons of haussmann and the future sons of frank lloyd wright sent them on there way glory hallelujah hank gibson exhaled a great gust and sat weighted with an ounce of information and a ton of confusion at the head of this table he stared down its length there were meetings here in to fester tokyo poison washington for war and at the same time make sure that san francisco was built in the best way for a new downfall and that california cities all up and down the cracks and seams nursed at the mother fault san andreas so when the big one came it would rain money for forty days son of a bitch said hank gibson yes arent i arent we son of a bitch hank gibson repeated in a whisper mans wars and gods earthquakes what a collaboration eh all done by the secret government the government of surprise architects across the world and into the next century the floor shook the table and the chair and the ceiling did likewise time said hank gibson charlie crowe laughed glancing at his watch time out they ran for the door ran down the hall past the doors marked tokyo and london and dresden past the doors marked and and and past the doors marked armenia and mexico city and san francisco and shot up in the elevator and along the way hank gibson said again whyve you told me this im retiring the others are gone we wont use this place again itll be gone maybe now you write the book about all this fabulous stuff i edit it well grab the money and run but wholl believe it no one but its so sensational everyone will buy millions of copies and no one will investigate for theyre all guilty city fathers chambers of commerce real estate salesmen army generals who thought they made up and fought their own wars or made up and built their own cities pompous freaks here we are out they made it out of the elevator and the shack as the next quake came both fell and got up with nervous laughter good old california yes is my rolls still there yep no carjackers in with his hand on the rolls doorframe gibson stared over at his friend does the san andreas fault come through this block you better believe wanna go see your home gibson shut his eyes christ im afraid take courage from the insurance policy in your coat pocket shall we go in a moment gibson swallowed hard what will we name our book what time is it and date gibson looked at the sun about to rise early sixthirty and the date on my watch reads february fifth nineteen ninetyfour sixthirty am february fifth then thats the title of our book or why not zaharoff add richter for the earthquake richter scale at caltech zaharoffrichter mark v okay okay the doors slammed the motor roared do we go home go fast jesus fast they went fast remember sascha remember why how could they forget although they knew him for only a little while years later his name would arise and they would smile or even laugh and reach out to hold hands remembering sascha what a tender witty comrade what a sly hidden individual what a child of talent teller of tales bon vivant latenight companion everpresent illumination on foggy noons sascha he whom they had never seen to whom they spoke often at three am in their small bedroom away from friends who might roll their eyeballs under their lids doubting their sanity hearing his name well then who and what was sascha and where did they meet or perhaps only dream him and who were they quickly they were maggie and douglas spaulding and they lived by the loud sea and the warm sand and the rickety bridges over the almost dead canals of venice california though lacking money in the bank or goodwill furniture in their tiny tworoom apartment they were incredibly happy he was a writer and she worked to support him while he finished the great american novel their routine was she would arrive home each night from downtown los angeles and he would have hamburgers waiting or they would walk down the beach to eat hot dogs spend ten or twenty cents in the penny arcade go home make love go to sleep and repeat the whole wondrous routine the next night hot dogs penny arcade love sleep work etc it was all glorious in that year of being very young and in love therefore it would go on forever until he appeared the nameless one for then he had no name he had threatened to arrive a few months after their marriage to destroy their economy and scare off the novel but then he had melted away leaving only his echo of a threat but now the true collision loomed one night over a ham omelet with a bottle of cheap red and the conversation loping quietly leaning on the card table and promising each other grander and more ebullient futures maggie suddenly said i feel faint what said douglas spaulding ive felt funny all day and i was sick a little bit this morning oh my god he rose and came around the card table and took her head in his hands and pressed her brow against his side and looked down at the beautiful part in her hair suddenly smiling well now he said dont tell me that sascha is back sascha whos that when he arrives hell tell us where did that name come from dont know its been in my mind all year sascha she pressed his hands to her cheeks laughing sascha call the doctor tomorrow he said the doctor says sascha has moved in for light housekeeping she said over the phone the next day great he stopped i guess he considered their bank deposits no first thoughts count great when do we meet the martian invader october hes infinitesimal now tiny i can barely hear his voice but now that he has a name i hear it he promises to grow if we take care the fabulous invalid shall i stock up on carrots spinach broccoli for what date halloween impossible true people will claim we planned him and my vampire book to arrive that week things that go bump and cry in the night oh sascha will surely do that happy frightened yes but happy lord yes come home mrs rabbit and bring him along it must be explained that maggie and douglas spaulding were best described as crazed romantics long before the interior christening of sascha they loving laurel and hardy had called each other stan and ollie the machines the dustbusters and can openers around the apartment had names as did various parts of their anatomy revealed to no one so sascha as an entity a presence growing toward friendship was not unusual and when he actually began to speak up they were not surprised the gentle demands of their marriage with love as currency instead of cash made it inevitable someday they said if they owned a car it too would be named they spoke on that and a dozen score of things late at night when hyperventilating about life they propped themselves up on their pillows as if the future might happen right now they waited anticipating in seance for the silent small offspring to speak his first words before dawn i love our lives said maggie lying there all the games i hope it never stops youre not like other men who drink beer and talk poker dear god i wonder how many other marriages play like us no one nowhere remember what he lay back to trace his memory on the ceiling the day we were married yes our friends driving and dropping us off here and we walked down to the drugstore by the pier and bought a tube of toothpaste and two toothbrushes big bucks for our honeymoon one red toothbrush one green to decorate our empty bathroom and on the way back along the beach holding hands suddenly behind us two little girls and a boy followed us and sang happy marriage day to you happy marriage day to you happy marriage day happy marriage day happy marriage day to you she sang it now quietly he chimed in remembering how they had blushed with pleasure at the childrens voices but walked on feeling ridiculous but happy and wonderful how did they guess did we look married it wasnt our clothes our faces dont you think smiles that made our jaws ache we were exploding they got the concussion those dear children i can still hear their voices and so here we are seventeen months later he put his arm around her and gazed at their future on the dark ceiling and here i am a voice murmured who douglas said me the voice whispered sascha douglas looked down at his wifes mouth which had barely trembled so at last youve decided to speak said douglas yes came the whisper we wondered said douglas when we would hear from you he squeezed his wife gently its time the voice murmured so here i am welcome sascha both said why didnt you talk sooner asked douglas spaulding i wasnt sure that you liked me the voice whispered why would you think that first i was then i wasnt once i was only a name remember last year i was ready to come and stay scared you we were broke said douglas quietly and nervous whats so scary about life said sascha maggies lips twitched its that other thing not being ever not being wanted on the contrary douglas spaulding moved down on his pillow so he could watch his wifes profile her eyes shut but her mouth breathing softly we love you but last year it was bad timing understand no whispered sascha i only understand you didnt want me and now you do i should leave but you just got here here i go anyway dont sascha stay goodbye the small voice faded oh goodbye and then silence maggie opened her eyes with saschas gone she said he cant be the room was still cant be he said its only a game more than a game oh god i feel cold hold me he moved to hug her its okay no i had the funniest feeling just now as if he were real he is hes not gone unless we do something help me help he held her even tighter then shut his eyes and at last called sascha silence i know youre there you cant hide his hand moved to where sascha might be listen say something dont scare us sascha we dont want to be scared or scare you we need each other we three against the world sascha silence well whispered douglas maggie breathed in and out they waited yes there was a soft flutter the merest exhalation on the night air yes youre back both cried another silence welcome asked sascha welcome both said and that night passed and the next day and the night and day after that until there were many days but especially midnights when he dared to declare himself pipe opinions grow stronger and firmer and longer in halfheard declarations as they lay in anticipatory awareness now she moving her lips now he taking over both open as warm live ventriloquists mouthpieces the small voice shifted from one tongue to the other with soft bouts of laughter at how ridiculous but loving it all seemed never knowing what sascha might say next but letting him speak on until dawn and a smiling sleep whats this about halloween he asked somewhere in the sixth month halloween both wondered isnt that a death holiday sascha murmured well yes im not sure i want to be born on a night like that well what night would you like to be born on silence as sascha floated a while guy fawkes he finally whispered guy fawkes thats mainly fireworks gunpowder plots houses of parliament yes please to remember the fifth of november do you think you could wait until then i could try i dont think i want to start out with skulls and bones gunpowders more like it i could write about that will you be a writer then get me a typewriter and a ream of paper and keep us awake with the typing pen pencil and pad then done so it was agreed and the nights passed into weeks and the weeks leaned from summer into the first days of autumn and his voice grew stronger as did the sound of his heart and the small commotions of his limbs sometimes as maggie slept his voice would stir her awake and she would reach up to touch her mouth where the surprise of his dreaming came forth there there sascha rest now sleep sleep he whispered drowsily sleep and faded away pork chops please for supper no pickles with ice cream both said almost at once pork chops he said and more days passed and more dawns arose and he said hamburgers for breakfast with onions he said october stood still for one day and then halloween departed thanks said sascha for helping me past that whats up ahead in five nights guy fawkes ah yes he cried and at one minute after midnight five days later maggie got up wandered to the bathroom and wandered back stunned dear she said sitting on the edge of the bed douglas spaulding turned over half awake yes what day is it whispered sascha guy fawkes at last so i dont feel well said sascha or no i feel fine full of pep ready to go its time to say goodbye or is it hello what do i mean spit it out are there neighbors who said no matter when theyd take us to the hospital yes call the neighbors said sascha they called the neighbors at the hospital douglas kissed his and listened its been nice said sascha only the best we wont talk again goodbye said sascha goodbye both said at dawn there was a small clear cry somewhere not long after douglas entered his wifes hospital room she looked at him and said saschas gone i know he said quietly but he left word and someone else is here look he approached the bed as she pulled back a coverlet well ill be damned he looked down at a small pink face and eyes that for a brief moment flickered bright blue and then shut whos that he asked your daughter meet alexandra hello alexandra he said and do you know what the nickname for alexandra is she said what sascha she said he touched the small cheek very gently hello sascha he said another fine mess the sounds began in the middle of summer in the middle of the night bella winters sat up in bed about three am and listened and then lay back down ten minutes later she heard the sounds again out in the night down the hill bella winters lived in a firstfloor apartment on top of vendome heights near effie street in los angeles and had lived there now for only a few days so it was all new to her this old house on an old street with an old staircase made of concrete climbing steeply straight up from the lowlands below one hundred and twenty steps count them and right now someones on the steps said bella to herself what said her husband sam in his sleep there are some men out on the steps said bella talking yelling not fighting but almost i heard them last night too and the night before but what sam muttered shh go to sleep ill look she got out of bed in the dark and went to the window and yes two men were indeed talking out there grunting groaning now loud now soft and there was another noise a kind of bumping sliding thumping like a huge object being carted up the hill no one could be moving in at this hour of the night could they asked bella of the darkness the window and herself no murmured sam it sounds like like what asked sam fully awake now like two men moving moving what for gods sake moving a piano up those steps at three in the morning a piano and two men just listen the husband sat up blinking alert far off in the middle of the hill there was a kind harping strum the noise a piano makes when suddenly thumped and its harp strings hum there did you hear jesus youre right but why would anyone steal theyre not stealing theyre delivering a piano i didnt make the rules sam go out and ask no dont i will and she wrapped herself in her robe and was out the door and on the sidewalk bella sam whispered fiercely behind the porch screen crazy so what can happen at night to a woman fiftyfive fat and ugly she wondered sam did not answer she moved quietly to the rim of the hill somewhere down there she could hear the two men wrestling with a huge object the piano on occasion gave a strumming hum and fell silent occasionally one of the men yelled or gave orders the voices said bella i know them from somewhere she whispered and moved in utter dark on stairs that were only a long pale ribbon going down as a voice echoed heres another fine mess youve got us in bella froze where have i heard that voice she wondered a million times hello she called she moved counting the steps and stopped and there was no one there suddenly she was very cold there was nowhere for the strangers to have gone to the hill was steep and a long way down and a long way up and they had been burdened with an upright piano hadnt they how come i know upright she thought i only heard butyes upright not only that but inside a box she turned slowly and as she went back up the steps one by one slowly slowly the voices began to sound again below as if disturbed they had waited for her to go away what are you doing demanded one voice i was just said the other give me that cried the first voice that other voice thought bella i know that too and i know whats going to be said next now said the echo far down the hill in the night just dont stand there help me yes bella closed her eyes and swallowed hard and half fell to sit on the steps getting her breath back as blackandwhite pictures flashed in her head suddenly it was and she was very small in a theater with dark and light pictures looming above the first row where she sat transfixed and then laughing and then transfixed and laughing again she opened her eyes the two voices were still down there a faint wrestle and echo in the night despairing and thumping each other with their hard derby hats zelda thought bella winters ill call zelda she knows everything shell tell me what this is zelda yes inside she dialed z and e and l and d and a before she saw what she had done and started over the phone rang a long while until zeldas voice angry with sleep spoke half way across la zelda this is bella sam just died no no im sorry youre sorry zelda i know youre going to think im crazy but go ahead be crazy zelda in the old days when they made films around la they used lots of places right like venice ocean park chaplin did langdon did harold lloyd sure laurel and hardy what laurel and hardy did they use lots of locations palms they used palms lots culver city main street effie street effie street dont yell bella did you say effie street sure and god its three in the morning right at the top of effie street hey yeah the stairs everyone knows them thats where the music box chased hardy downhill and ran over him sure zelda sure oh god zelda if you could see hear what i hear zelda was suddenly wide awake on the line whats going on you serious oh god yes on the steps just now and last night and the night before maybe i heard i heartwo men hauling aa piano up the hill someones pulling your leg no no theyre there i go out and theres nothing but the steps are haunted zelda one voice says heres another fine mess youve got us in you got to hear that mans voice youre drunk and doing this because you know im a nut for them no no come zelda listen tell maybe half an hour later bella heard the old tin lizzie rattle up the alley behind the apartments it was a car zelda in her joy at visiting silentmovie theaters had bought to lug herself around in while she wrote about the past always the past and steaming into cecil b demilles old place or circling harold lloyds nationstate or cranking and banging around the universal backlot paying her respects to the phantoms opera stage or sitting on ma and pa kettles porch chewing a sandwich lunch that was zelda who once wrote in a silent country in a silent time for silver screen zelda lumbered across the front porch a huge body with legs as big as the bernini columns in front of st peters in rome and a face like a harvest moon on that round face now was suspicion cynicism skepticisms in equal pieparts but when she saw bellas pale stare she cried belle you see im not lying said bella i see keep your voice down zelda oh its scary and strange terrible and nice so come on and the two women edged along the walk to the rim of the old hill near the old steps in old hollywood and suddenly as they moved they felt time take a half turn around them and it was another year because nothing had changed all the buildings were the way they were in and the hills beyond like they were in and the steps just the way they were when the cement was poured in listen zelda there and zelda listened and at first there was only a creaking of wheels down in the dark like crickets and then a moan of wood and a hum of piano strings and then one voice lamenting about this job and the other voice claiming he had nothing to do with it and then the thumps as two derby hats fell and an exasperated voice announced heres another fine mess youve got us in zelda stunned almost toppled off the hill she held tight to bellas arm as tears brimmed in her eyes its a trick someones got a tape recorder or no i checked nothing but the steps zelda the steps tears rolled down zeldas plump cheeks oh god that is his voice im the expert im the mad fanatic bella thats ollie and that other voice stan and youre not nuts after all the voices below rose and fell and one cried why dont you do something to help me zelda moaned oh god its so beautiful what does it mean asked bella why are they here are they really ghosts and why would ghosts climb this hill every night pushing that music box night after night tell me zelda why zelda peered down the hill and shut her eyes for a moment to think why do any ghosts go anywhere retribution revenge no not those two love maybes the reason lost loves or something yes bella let her heart pound once or twice and then said maybe nobody told them told them what or maybe they were told a lot but still didnt believe because maybe in their old years things got bad i mean they were sick and sometimes when youre sick you forget forget what how much we loved them they knew did they sure we told each other but maybe not enough of us ever wrote or waved when they passed and just yelled love you think hell bella theyre on tv every night yeah but that dont count has anyone since they left us come here to these steps and said maybe those voices down there ghosts or whatever have been here every night for years pushing that music box and nobody thought or tried to just whisper or yell all the love we had all the years why not why not zelda stared down into the long darkness where perhaps shadows moved and maybe a piano lurched clumsily among the shadows youre right if im right said bella and you say so theres only one thing to do you mean you and me who else quiet come on they moved down a step in the same instant lights came on around them in a window here another there a screen door opened somewhere and angry words shot out into the night hey whats going on pipe down you know what time it is my god bella whispered everyone else hears now no no zelda looked around wildly theyll spoil everything im calling the cops a window slammed god said bella if the cops come what itll be all wrong if anyones going to tell them to take it easy pipe down its gotta be us we care dont we god yes but no buts grab on here we go the two voices murmured below and the piano tuned itself with hiccups of sound as they edged down another step and another their mouths dry hearts hammering and the night so dark they could see only the faint streetlight at the stair bottom the single street illumination so far away it was sad being there all by itself waiting for shadows to move more windows slammed up more screen doors opened at any moment there would be an avalanche of protest incredible outcries perhaps shots fired and all this gone forever thinking this the women trembled and held tight as if to pummel each other to speak against the rage say something zelda quick what anything theyll get hurt if we dont they you know what i mean save them okay jesus zelda froze clamped her eyes shut to find the words then opened her eyes and said hello louder hello zelda called softly then loudly shapes rustled in the dark below one of the voices rose while the other fell and the piano strummed its hidden harp strings dont be afraid zelda called thats good go on dont be afraid zelda called braver now dont listen to those others yelling we wont hurt you its just us im zelda you wouldnt remember and this here is bella and weve known you forever or since we were kids and we love you its late but we thought you should know weve loved you ever since you were in the desert or on that boat with ghosts or trying to sell christmas trees doortodoor or in that traffic where you tore the headlights off cars and we still love you right bella the night below was darkness waiting zelda punched bellas arm yes bella cried what she said we love you we cant think of anything else to say but its enough yes bella leaned forward anxiously its enough a night wind stirred the leaves and grass around the stairs and the shadows below that had stopped moving with the music box suspended between them as they looked up and up at the two women who suddenly began to cry first tears fell from bellas cheeks and when zelda sensed them she let fall her own so now said zelda amazed that she could form words but managed to speak anyway we want you to know you don t have to come back anymore you dont have to climb the hill every night waiting for what we said just now is it isnt it i mean you wanted to hear it here on this hill with those steps and that piano yes thats the whole thing it had to be that didnt it so now here we are and there you are and its said so rest dear friends oh there ollie added bella in a sad sad whisper oh stan stanley the piano hidden in the dark softly hummed its wires and creaked its ancient wood and then the most incredible thing happened there was a series of shouts and then a huge banging crash as the music box in the dark rocketed down the hill skittering on the steps playing chords where it hit swerving rushing and ahead of it running the two shapes pursued by the musical beast yelling tripping shouting warning the fates crying out to the gods down and down forty sixty eighty one hundred steps and half down the steps hearing feeling shouting crying themselves and now laughing and holding to each other the two women alone in the night wildly clutching grasping trying to see almost sure that they did see the three things ricocheting off and away the two shadows rushing one fat one thin and the piano blundering after discordant and mindless until they reached the street where instantly the one overhead streetlamp died as if struck and the shadows floundered on pursued by the musical beast and the two women abandoned looked down exhausted with laughing until they wept and weeping until they laughed until suddenly zelda got a terrible look on her face as if shot my god she shouted in panic reaching out wait we didnt mean we dont wantdont go forever sure go so the neighbors here sleep but once a year you hear once a year one night a year from tonight and every year after that come back it shouldnt bother anyone so much but we got to tell you all over again huh come back and bring the box with you and well be here waiting wont we bella waiting yes there was a long silence from the steps leading down into an old blackandwhite silent los angeles you think they heard they listened and from somewhere far off and down there was the faintest explosion like the engine of an old jalopy knocking itself to life and then the merest whisper of a lunatic music from a dark theater when they were very young it faded after a long while they climbed back up the steps dabbing at their eyes with wet kleenex then they turned for a final time to stare down into the night you know something said zelda i think they heard the electrocution she let him tie the black silk over her eyes and he knotted it and jerked it so tight that she gasped and said loosen it damn you johnny loosen it or i wont go on sure he said easily and she smelled his sharp breath while beyond the crowd rustled against the rope barrier and the carnival tent flapped in the night wind and off there was a drift of calliope music and the rattle of a trap drum dimly through the black silk she could see the men the boys the few women a good crowd paying out dimes to see her strapped in this electric chair the electrodes on her wrists and neck waiting there johnnys voice whispered through the blindfold that better she said nothing but her hands gripped the ends of the wooden chair she felt her pulse beating in her arms and neck outside the pitchman yelled through his small cardboard megaphone and slapped his cane across the banner where electras portrait shivered in the wind yellow hair hard blue eyes sharp chin seated in her deathchair like someone come for tea with the black silk blinding her it was easier to let her mind run back to wherever it wanted to go the carnival was either setting up in a new town or letting go its brown tents inhaling by day exhaling its stale air by night as the canvases slid rustling down along the dark poles and then last monday night this young man with the long arms and the eager pink face bought three tickets to the sideshow and stood watching electra three times as the electricity burned through her like blue fire while this young man strained at the rope barrier and memorized her every move as she sat high up there on the platform all fire and pale flesh he came four nights in a row you got an audience ellie said johnny on the third night so i see she said dont pay no attention said johnny i wont she said why should i dont worry after all shed done the act for years johnny slammed on the power and it filled her from ankle to elbows to ears as he handed her the bright sword and she thrust it out blindly over the audience smiling under her half mask to let them tap shoulders and brows as the blue sparks crackled and spat on the fourth night she shoved the sword far out toward the young man with the sweating pink face first among the crowd the young man raised his hand swiftly eagerly as if to seize the blade blue sparks leaped the gap but his hand didnt flinch or stop as he grabbed on and took the fire in his fingers and then his fist and then his wrist and his arm into his body his eyes in the light flared with blue alcohol flame fed by the sword whose fire in passing lit her arm and face and body he stretched his hand still farther out his waist jammed against the rope silent and tense then johnny cried everybody touch it every one and electra lifted the blade out on the air for others to feel and stroke while johnny cursed through the blindfold she saw the terrible illumination which would not leave the young mans face the fifth night instead of touching the young mans fingers she tapped the blazing tip of the sword against the palm of his hand brushing and burning until he shut his eyes that night she walked out on the lake pier after the show and did not look back as she moved but listened and began to smile the lake shook against the rotting piles the carnival lights made wandering uneasy roads on the black water the ferris wheel whirled high and around with its faint screams and far away the calliope steamed and sobbed beautiful ohio she slowed her walking she put out her right foot slowly then her left then she stopped and turned her head and as she turned she saw the shadow and his arms moved around her a long time later she leaned back in his arms and stared up into his healthy excited pink face and said my god youre more dangerous than my chair is your name really electra he said the next night as the power leaped through her she stiffened shuddered and clamped her lips in her teeth moaning her legs stirred her hands groped and scratched the chair arms whats wrong beyond the blindfold johnny cried out what and cut the power im all right she gasped the crowd murmured its nothing go on now and he hit the switch the fire crawled through her and again she clenched her teeth and threw her head back against the chair a face rushed out of the dark and a body with it to press against her the power exploded the electric chair stopped then melted johnny a million miles off in the dark handed her the sword her limp twitching hand dropped it he handed it back and instinctively she shoved it far out into the night someone out there in the roaring darkness touched the blade she could imagine his eyes burning there his lips parted as the power jolted him he was pressed against the rope hard hard against the rope and could not breathe or cry out or pull back the power died the smell of lightning stayed thats it someone cried johnny left her to squirm out of the leather straps jumped off the low platform and walked out toward the midway convulsively she tore off the bonds trembling she ran from the tent not looking back to see if the young man was still there against the rope she fell upon the cot of the trailer behind the tent perspiring and shaking and was still crying when johnny stepped in to look down at her whats the matter he said nothing nothing johnny what was that you pulled out there just now nothing nothing nothing nothing he said like hell it is his face twisted like hell you havent done anything like that for years i was nervous years its been he said when we were first married you did that you think i forgot how when i switched the power on this same happened like tonight you been sitting in that chair for three years like someone listening to a radio and tonight and tonight he cried choking standing over her his fists tightened damn it tonight please please johnny i was nervous what were you thinking there in the chair he demanded leaning down wildly what did you think about nothing johnny nothing he grabbed her hair please he threw her head down turned walked out and stopped outside i know what you were thinking he said i know and she heard his footsteps fade away and the night passed and the day and another night with another crowd but nowhere in the crowd did she see his face now in the blackness with the blindfold tight to her face she sat in the electric chair and waited while johnny described the wonders of the skeleton man over on the next platform and still she waited and stared at everyone who entered the tent johnny walked around the skeleton man all stiffness describing the living skull and the terrible bones and at last the crowd rustled turned led by johnny his voice like a battered brass horn as he jumped up onto the platform with her so violently that she jerked aside and licked her red lips and now the knot of the blindfold was tied tighter and yet tighter as he bent to whisper miss him she said nothing but held her head up the crowd stirred below like animals in a straw stable hes not here he whispered and locked the electrodes on her arms she was silent he whispered again hell never come back he fitted the black skullcap over her hair she trembled afraid he wondered quietly what of he snapped the straps around her ankles dont be afraid good clean electricity a gasp escaped her lips he stood up i hit him he said softly touching her blindfold hit him so hard i broke his front teeth then i knocked him against a wall and hit him again and again he stopped and shouted ladies and gentlemen witness the most astounding act in carnival history here you see a penitentiary electric chair exactly like those used in our biggest prisons perfect for the destruction of criminals with this last word she fell forward fingers scratching the wood as he cried before your very eyes this dear lady will be electrocuted the crowd murmured and she thought of the tesla transformer under the platform and how johnny might have fixed it so she got amperage not voltage accident bad accident shame amperage not voltage she wrenched her right hand free of its leather strap and heard the power switch slam shut as the blue fire seized and shook her screaming the audience applauded and whistled and stomped oh she thought wildly this is good my death great more applause more screams out of the black spaces a body fell hit him so hard broke his teeth the body jerked then i hit him and hit him again the body fell was picked up fell again she screamed high and long as a million unseen mouths stung and bit her blue flames seized her heart the young man body writhed and exploded in bone shrapnel flame and ash calmly johnny handed her the sword now he said being safe was like a blow to the stomach she sobbed fumbling at the sword quivering and jerking unable to move the power hummed and the crowd stuck out their hands some like spiders some like birds leaping away wherever the sword sizzled and spat the power still lived in her bones as all over the carnival grounds the lights dimmed click the switch lay in its off bed she sank in upon herself the sweat running around her nose and her sagging mouth gasping she fought free to pull the blindfold away the crowd had gone off to another platform another miracle where the fat lady called and they obeyed johnnys hand lay on the switch he dropped his hand stood there watching her his dark eyes cold not flickering the tent lights looked dirty old yellow and unclean she stared blindly at the retreating crowd johnny the tent the lights she looked shrunken in the chair half of her had poured out through the wires flushed into the copper cable that fled over the town leaping from high pole to pole she lifted her head as if it weighed ninety pounds the clean light had come entered into and slid through her and blasted out again but it was not the same light anymore she had changed it she saw how she had made it and she shivered because the light was discolored johnnys mouth opened she didnt hear him at first he had to repeat what had to be said youre dead he said firmly and again youre dead and sitting there in the electric chair trapped by the leather straps with a wind from the tent flaps playing over her face evaporating the wetness staring at him and seeing the dark in his eyes she gave the only answer it was possible to give yes she said eyes shut oh yes i am hopscotch vinia woke to the sound of a rabbit running down and across an endless moonlit field but it was only the soft quick beating of her heart she lay on the bed for a moment getting her breath now the sound of the running faded and was gone at a great distance at last she sat up and looked down from her secondstory bedroom window and there below on the long sidewalk in the faint moonlight before dawn was the hopscotch late yesterday some child had chalked it out immense and endlessly augmented square upon square line after line numeral following numeral you could not see the end of it down the street it built its crazy pattern on up to then on away to turn far corners never in all the childrens world a hopscotch like this you could jump forever toward the horizon now in the very early very quiet morning her eyes traveled and jumped paused and hopped along that presumptuous ladder of chalkscratches and she heard herself whisper sixteen but she did not run on from there the next square waited she knew with the scribbled blue chalk but her mind flung out its arms and balanced teetering poised with her numb foot planted across the and the and could go no further trembling she lay back down the room was like the bottom of a cool well all night and she lay in it like a white stone in a well enjoying it floating in the dark yet clear element of half dreams and half wakening she felt the breath move in small jets from her nostrils and she felt the immense sweep of her eyelids shutting and opening again and again and at last she felt the fever brought into her room by the presence of the sun beyond the hills morning she thought it might be a special day after all its my birthday anything might happen and i hope it does the air moved the white curtains like a summer breath vinia a voice was calling but it couldnt be a voice yetvinia raised herselfthere it was again vinia she slipped from bed and ran to the window of her high secondstory window there on the fresh lawn below calling up to her in the early hour stood james conway no older than she seventeen very seriously smiling waving his hand now as her head appeared jim whatre you doing here she said and thought does he know what day this is ive been up an hour already he replied im going for a walk starting early all day want to come along oh but i couldnt my folks wont be back till late tonight im alone im supposed to stay she saw the green hills beyond the town and the roads leading out into summer leading out into august and rivers and places beyond this town and this house and this room and this particular moment i cant go she said faintly i cant hear you he protested mildly smiling up at her under a shielding hand why did you ask me to walk with you and not someone else he considered this for a moment i dont know he admitted he thought it over again and gave her his most pleasant and agreeable look because thats all just because ill be down she said hey he said but the window was empty they stood in the center of the perfect jeweled lawn over which one set of prints hers had run leaving marks and another his had walked in great slow strides to meet them the town was silent as a stopped clock all the shades were still down my gosh said vinia its early its crazyearly ive never been up this early and out this early in years listen to everyone sleeping they listened to the trees and the whiteness of the houses in this early whispering hour the hour when mice went back to sleep and flowers began untightening their bright fists which way do we go pick a direction vinia closed her eyes whirled and pointed blindly which way am i pointing north she opened her eyes lefts go north out of town then i dont suppose we should why and they walked out of town as the sun rose above the hills and the grass burned greener on the lawns there was a smell of hot chalk highway of dust and sky and waters flowing in a creek the color of grapes the sun was a new lemon the forest lay ahead with shadows stirring like a million birds under each tree each bird a leafdarkness trembling at noon vinia and james conway had crossed vast meadows that sounded brisk and starched underfoot the day had grown warm as an iced glass of tea grows warm the frost burning off left in the sun they picked a handful of grapes from a wild barbedwire vine holding them up to the sun you could see the clear grape thoughts suspended in the dark amber fluid the little hot seeds of contemplation stored from many afternoons of solitude and plant philosophy the grapes tasted of fresh clear water and something that they had saved from the morning dews and the evening rains they were the warmedover flesh of april ready now in august to pass on their simple gain to any passing stranger and the lesson was this sit in the sun head down within a prickly vine in flickery light or open light and the world will come to you the sky will come in its time bringing rain and the earth will rise through you from beneath and make you rich and make you full have a grape said james conway have two they munched their wet full mouths they sat on the edge of a brook and took off their shoes and let the water cut their feet off to the ankles with an exquisite cold razor my feet are gone thought vinia but when she looked there they were underwater living comfortably apart from her completely acclimated to an amphibious existence they ate egg sandwiches jim had brought with him in a paper sack vinia said jim looking at his sandwich before he bit it would you mind if i kissed you i dont know she said after a moment i hadnt thought will you think it over he asked did we come on this picnic just so you could kiss me she asked suddenly oh dont get me wrong its been a swell day i dont want to spoil it but if you should decide later that its all right for me to kiss you would you tell me ill tell you she said starting on her second sandwich if i ever decide the rain came as a cool surprise it smelled of soda water and limes and oranges and the cleanest freshest river in the world made of snowwater falling from the high parched sky first there had been a motion as of veils in the sky the clouds had enveloped each other softly a faint breeze had lifted vinias hair sighing and evaporating the moisture from her upper lip and then as she and jim began to run the raindrops fell down all about without touching them and then at last began to touch them coolly as they leaped greenmoss logs and darted among vast trees into the deepest muskiest cavern of the forest the forest sprang up in wet murmurs overhead every leaf ringing and painted fresh with water this way cried jim and they reached a hollow tree so vast that they could squeeze in and be warmly cozy from the rain they stood together arms about each other the first coldness from the rain making them shiver raindrops on their noses and cheeks laughing hey he gave her brow a lick drinking water jim they listened to the rain the soft envelopment of the world in the velvet clearness of falling water the whispers in deep grass evoking odors of old wet wood and leaves that had lain a hundred years moldering and sweet then they heard another sound above and inside the hollow warm darkness of the tree was a constant humming like someone in a kitchen far away baking and crusting pies contentedly dipping in sweet sugars and snowing in baking powders someone in a warm dim summerrainy kitchen making a vast supply of food happy at it humming between lips over it bees jim up there bees shh up the channel of moist warm hollow they saw little yellow flickers now the last bees wettened were hurrying home from whatever pasture or meadow or field they had covered dipping by vinia and jim vanishing up the warm flue of summer into hollow dark they wont bother us just stand still jim tightened his arms vinia tightened hers she could smell his breath with the wild tart grapes still on it and the harder the rain drummed on the tree the tighter they held laughing at last quietly letting their laughter drain away into the sound of the bees home from the far fields and for a moment vinia thought that she and jim might be caught by a sudden drop of great masses of honey from above sealing them into this tree forever enchanted in amber to be seen by anyone in the next thousand years who strolled by while the weather of all ages rained and thundered and turned green outside the tree it was so warm so safe so protected here the world did not exist there was raining silence in the sunless forested day vinia whispered jim after a while may i now his face was very large near her larger than any face she had ever seen yes she said he kissed her the rain poured hard on the tree for a full minute while everything was cold outside and everything was treewarmth and hidden away inside it was a very sweet kiss it was very friendly and comfortably warm and it tasted like apricots and fresh apples and as water tastes when you rise at night and walk into a dark warm summer kitchen and drink from a cool tin cup she had never imagined that a kiss could be so sweet and immensely tender and careful of her he held her not as he had held her a moment before hard to protect her from the green rain weather but he held her now as if she were a porcelain clock very carefully and with consideration his eyes were closed and the lashes were glistening dark she saw this in the instant she opened her eyes and closed them again the rain stopped it was a moment before the new silence shocked them into an awareness of the climate beyond their world now there was nothing but the suspension of water in all the intricate branches of the forest clouds moved away to show the blue sky in great quilted patches they looked out at the change with some dismay they waited for the rain to come back to keep them by necessity in this hollow tree for another minute or an hour but the sun appeared shining through upon everything making the scene quite commonplace again they stepped from the hollow tree slowly and stood with their hands out balancing finding their way it seemed in these woods where the water was drying fast on every limb and leaf i think wed better start walking said vinia that way they walked off into the summer afternoon they crossed the town limits at sunset and walked hand in hand in the last glowing of the summer day they had talked very little the rest of the afternoon and now as they turned down one street after another they looked at the passing sidewalk under their feet vinia he said at last do you think this is the beginning of something oh gosh jim i dont know do you think maybe were in love oh i dont know that either they passed down into the ravine and over the bridge and up the other side to her street do you think well ever be married its too early to tell isnt it she said i guess youre right he bit his lip will we go walking again soon i dont know i dont know lets wait and see jim the house was dark her parents not home yet they stood on her porch and she shook his hand gravely thanks jim for a really fine day she said youre welcome he said they stood there then he turned and walked down the steps and across the dark lawn at the far edge of lawn he stopped in the shadows and said good night he was almost out of sight running when she in turn said good night in the middle of the night a sound wakened her she half sat up in bed trying to hear it again the folks were home everything was locked and secure but it hadnt been them no this was a special sound and lying there looking out at the summer night that had not long ago been a summer day she heard the sound again and it was a sound of hollowing warmth and moist bark and empty tunneled tree the rain outside but comfortable dryness and secretness inside and it was the sound of bees come home from distant fields moving upward in the flue of summer into wonderful darkness and this sound she realized putting her hand up in the summernight room to touch it was coming from her drowsy halfsmiling mouth which made her sit bolt upright and very quietly move downstairs out through the door onto the porch and across the wetgrass lawn to the sidewalk where the crazed hopscotch chalked itself way off into the future her bare feet hit the first numbers leaving moist prints up to and thumping until she stopped at staring down at hesitating swaying then she gritted her teeth made fists reared back and jumped right in the middle of the square she stood there for a long moment eyes shut seeing how it felt then she ran upstairs and lay out on the bed and touched her mouth to see if a summer afternoon was breathing out of it and listening for that drowsy hum the golden sound and it was there and it was this sound eventually which sang her to sleep the finnegan to say that i have been haunted for the rest of my life by the affair finnegan is to grossly understate the events leading up to that final melancholy only now at threescore and ten can i write these words for an astonished constabulary who may well run with picks and shovels to unearth my truths or bury my lies the facts are these three children went astray and were missed their bodies were found in the midst of chatham forest and each bore no marks of criminal assassination but all had suffered their lifeblood to be drained only their skin remained like that of some discolored vineyard grapes withered by sunlight and no rain from the withered detritus of these innocents rose fresh rumors of vampires or similar beasts with similar appetites such myths always pursue the facts to stun them in their tracks it could only have been a tombyard beast it was said that fed on and destroyed three lives and ruined three dozen more the children were buried in the most holy ground soon after sir robert merriweather pretender to the throne of sherlock holmes but modestly refusing the claim moved through the ten dozen doors of his antique house to come forth to search for this terrible thief of life with myself i might add to carry his brandy and bumbershoot and warn him of underbrush pitfalls in that dark and mysterious forest sir robert merriweather you say just that plus the ten times ten plus twelve amazing doors in his shutup house were the doors used not one in nine how had they appeared in sir roberts old manse he had shipped them in as a collector of doors from rio paris rome tokyo and midamerica once collected he had stashed them hinged to be seen from both sides on the walls of his upper and lower chambers there he conducted tours of these odd portals for such antique fools as were ravished by the sight of the curiously overdone the undersimplified the rococo or some first empire cast aside by napoleons nephews or seized from hermann goering who had in turn ransacked the louvre others pelted by oklahoma dust storms were jostled home in flatbeds cushioned by bright posters from carnivals buried in the windblown desolations of america name your least favorite door it was his name the best quality he owned it also hidden and safe true beauties behind oblivions portals i had come to see his doors not the deaths at his behest which was a command i had bought my curiosity a steamship ticket and arrived to find sir robert involved not with ten dozen doors but some great dark door a mysterious portal still unfound and beneath a tomb sir robert hurried the grand tour opening and shutting panels rescued from peking long buried near etna or filched from nantucket but his heart gone sick was not in this what should have been delightful tour he described the spring rains that drenched the country to make things green only to have people to walk out in that fine weather and one week find the body of a boy emptied of life through two incisions in his neck and in the next weeks the bodies of the two girls people shouted for the police and sat drinking in pubs their faces long and pale while mothers locked their children home where fathers lectured on the dooms that lay in chatham forest will you come with me said sir robert at last on a very strange sad picnic i will i said so we snapped ourselves in weatherproofs lugged a hamper of sandwiches and red wine and plunged into the forest on a drear sunday there was time as we moved down a hill into the dripping gloom of the trees to recall what the papers had said about the vanished childrens bloodless flesh the police thrashing the forest ten dozen times clueless while the surrounding estates slammed their doors drumtight at sunset rain damn rain sir roberts pale face stared up his gray mustache quivering over his thin mouth he was sick and brittle and old our picnic will be ruined picnic i said will our killer join us for eats i pray to god he will sir robert said yes pray to god he will we walked through a land that was now mists now dim sunlight now forest now open glade until we came into a silent part of the woods a silence made of the way the trees grew wetly together and the way the green moss lay in swards and hillocks spring had not yet filled the empty trees the sun was like an arctic disk withdrawn cold and almost dead this is the place said sir robert at last where the children were found i inquired their bodies empty as empty can be i looked at the glade and thought of the children and the people who had stood over them with startled faces and the police who had come to whisper and touch and go away lost the murderer was never apprehended not this clever fellow how observant are you asked sir robert what do you want observed theres the catch the police slipped up they were stupidly anthropomorphic about the whole bloody mess seeking a killer with two arms two legs a suit of clothes and a knife so hypnotized with their human concept of the killer that they overlooked one obvious unbelievable fact about this place so he gave his cane a quick light tap on the earth something happened i stared at the ground do that again i whispered you saw it i thought i saw a small trapdoor open and shut may i have your cane he gave me the cane i tapped the ground it happened again a spider i cried gone god how quick finnegan sir robert muttered what you know the old saying in again out again finnegan here with his penknife sir robert dug in the soil to lift an entire clod of earth breaking off bits to show me the tunnel the spider in panic leaped out its small wafer door and fell to the ground sir robert handed me the tunnel like gray velvet feel a model builder that small chap a tiny shelter camouflaged and him alert he could hear a fly walk then pounce out seize pop back slam the lid i didnt know you loved nature loathe it but this wee chap theres much we share doors hinges wouldnt consider other arachnids but my love of portals drew me to study this incredible carpenter sir robert worked the trap on its cobweb hinges what craftsmanship and it all ties to the tragedies the murdered children sir robert nodded notice any special thing about this forest its too quiet quiet sir robert smiled weakly vast quantities of silence no familiar birds beetles crickets toads not a rustle or stir the police didnt notice why should they but it was this absence of sound and motion in the glade that prompted my wild theory about the murders he toyed with the amazing structure in his hands what would you say if you could imagine a spider large enough in a hideout big enough so that a running child might hear a vacuumed sound be seized and vanish with a soft thud below how say you sir robert stared at the trees poppycock and bilge yet why not evolution selection growth mutations andpfft again he tapped with his cane a trapdoor flew open shut finnegan he said the sky darkened rain casting a cold gray eye at the clouds he stretched his frail hand to touch the showers damn arachnids hate rain and so will our huge dark finnegan finnegan i cried irritably i believe in him yes a spider larger than a child twice as large the cold wind blew a mizzle of rain over us lord i hate to leave quick before we go here sir robert raked away the old leaves with his cane revealing two globular graybrown objects what are they i bent old cannonballs no he cracked the grayish globes soil through and through i touched the crumbled bits our finnegan excavates said sir robert to make his tunnel with his large rakelike chelicerae he dislodges soil works it into a ball carries it in his jaws and drops it beyond his hole sir robert displayed half a dozen pellets on his trembling palm normal balls evicted from a tiny trapdoor tunnel toysize he knocked his cane on the huge globes at our feet explain those i laughed the children mustve made them with mud nonsense cried sir robert irritably glaring about at trees and earth by god somewhere our dark beast lurks beneath his velvet lid we might be standing on it christ dont stare his door has beveled rims some architect this finnegan a genius at camouflage sir robert raved on and on describing the dark earth the arachnid its fiddling legs its hungry mouth as the wind roared and the trees shook suddenly sir robert flung up his cane no he cried i had no time to turn my flesh froze my heart stopped something snatched my spine i thought i heard a huge bottle uncorked a lid sprung then this monstrous thing crawled down my back here cried sir robert now he struck with his cane i fell dead weight he thrust the thing from my spine he lifted it the wind had cracked the dead tree branch and knocked it onto my back weakly i tried to rise shivering silly i said a dozen times silly damn awful silly silly no brandy yes said sir robert brandy the sky was very black now the rain swarmed over us door after door after door and at last into sir roberts country house study a warm rich room where a fire smoldered on a drafty hearth we devoured our sandwiches waiting for the rain to cease sir robert estimated that it would stop by eight oclock when by moonlight we might return ever so reluctantly to chatham forest i remembered the fallen branch its spidering touch and drank both wine and brandy the silence in the forest said sir robert finishing his meal what murderer could achieve such a silence an insanely clever man with a series of baited poisoned traps with liberal quantities of insecticide might kill off every bird every rabbit every insect i said why should he do that to convince us that there is a large spider nearby to perfect his act we are the only ones who have noticed this silence the police did not why should a murderer go to all that trouble for nothing why is a murderer you might well ask i am not convinced sir robert topped his food with wine this creature with a voracious mouth has cleansed the forest with nothing left he seized the children the silence the murders the prevalence of trapdoor spiders the large earth balls it all fits sir roberts fingers crawled about the desktop quite like a washed manicured spider in itself he made a cup of his frail hands held them up at the bottom of a spiders burrow is a dustbin into which drop insect remnants on which the spider has dined imagine the dustbin of our grand finnegan i imagined i visioned a great legged thing fastened to its dark lid under the forest and a child running singing in the halflight a brisk insucked whisk of air the song cut short then nothing but an empty glade and the echo of a softly dropped lid and beneath the dark earth the spider fiddling cabling spinning the stunned child in its silently orchestrating legs what would the dustbin of such an incredible spider resemble what the remnants of many banquets i shuddered rains letting up sir robert nodded his approval back to the forest ive mapped the damned place for weeks all the bodies were found in one halfopen glade thats where the assassin if it was a man arrives or where the unnatural silkspinning earthtunneling architect of special doors abides his tomb must i hear all this i protested listen more sir robert downed the last of his burgundy the poor childrens prolapsed corpses were found at thirteenday intervals which means that every two weeks our loathsome eightlegged hideandseeker must feed tonight is the fourteenth night after the last child was found nothing but skin tonight our hidden friend must hunger afresh so within the hour i shall introduce you to finnegan the great and horrible all of which i said makes me want to drink here i go sir robert stepped through one of his louis the fourteenth portals to find the last and final and most awful door in all my life you will follow damn yes i followed the sun had set the rain was gone and the clouds cleared off to show a cold and troubled moon we moved in our own silence and the silence of the exhausted paths and glades while sir robert handed me a small silver pistol not that that would help killing an outsize arachnid is sticky hard to know where to fire the first shot if you miss therell be no time for a second damned things large or small move in the instant thanks i took the weapon i need a drink done sir robert handed me a silver brandy flask drink as needed i drank what about you i have my own special flask sir robert lifted it for the right time why wait i must surprise the beast and mustnt be drunk at the encounter four seconds before the thing grabs me i will imbibe of this dear napoleon stuff spiced with a rude surprise surprise ah wait youll see so will this dark thief of life now dear sir here we part company i this way you yonder do you mind mind when im scared gutless whats that here if i should vanish he handed me a sealed letter read it aloud to the constabulary it will help them locate me and finnegan lost and found please no details i feel like a damned fool following you while finnegan if he exists is underfoot snug and warm saying ah those idiots above running about freezing i think ill let them freeze one hopes not get away now if we walk together he wont jump up alone hell peer out the merest crack glom the scene with a huge bright eye flip down again ssst and one of us gone to darkness not me please not me we walked on about sixty feet apart and beginning to lose one another in the half moonlight are you there called sir robert from half the world away in leafy dark i wish i werent i yelled back onward cried sir robert dont lose sight of me move closer were near on the site i can intuit i almost feel as a final cloud shifted moonlight glowed brilliantly to show sir robert waving his arms about like antennae eyes half shut gasping with expectation closer closer i heard him exhale near on be still perhaps he froze in place there was something in his aspect that made me want to leap race and yank him off the turf he had chosen sir robert oh god i cried run he froze one hand and arm orchestrated the air feeling probing while his other hand delved brought forth his silvercoated flask of brandy he held it high in the moonlight a toast to doom then afflicted with need he took one two three my god four incredible swigs arms out balancing the wind tilting his head back laughing like a boy he swigged the last of his mysterious drink all right finnegan below and beneath he cried come get me he stomped his foot cried out victorious and vanished it was all over in a second a flicker a blur a dark bush had grown up from the earth with a whisper a suction and the thud of a body dropped and a door shut the glade was empty sir robert quick but there was no one to quicken not thinking that i might be snatched and vanished i lurched to the spot where sir robert had drunk his wild toast i stood staring down at earth and leaves with not a sound save my heart beating while the leaves blew away to reveal only pebbles dry grass and earth i must have lifted my head and bayed to the moon like a dog then fell to my knees fearless to dig for lids for tunneled tombs where a voiceless tangle of legs wove themselves binding and mummifying a thing that had been my friend this is his final door i thought insanely crying the name of my friend i found only his pipe cane and empty brandy flask flung down when he had escaped night life everything swaying up i fired the pistol six times here into the unanswering earth a dumb thing gone stupid as i finished and staggered over his instant graveyard his lockedin tomb listening for muffled screams shrieks cries but heard none i ran in circles with no ammunition save my weeping shouts i would have stayed all night but a downpour of leaves a great spidering flourish of broken branches fell to panic and suffer my heart i fled still calling his name to a silence lidded by clouds that hid the moon at his estate i beat on the door wailing yanking until i recalled it opened inward it was unlocked alone in the library with only liquor to help me live i read the letter that sir robert had left behind my dear douglas i am old and have seen much but am not mad finnegan exists my chemist had provided me with a sure poison that i will mix in my brandy for our walk i will drink all finnegan not knowing me as a poisoned morsel will give me a swift invite now you see me now you dont i will then be the weapon of his death minutes after my own i do not think there is another outsize nightmare like him on earth once gone thats the end being old i am immensely curious i fear not death for my physicians tell me that f no accidents kill me cancer will i thought of giving a poisoned rabbit to our nightmare assassin but then id never know where he was or if he really existed finnegan would die unseen in his monstrous closet and i never the wiser this way for one victorious moment i will know fear for me envy me pray for me sorry to abandon you without farewells dear friend carry on i folded the letter and wept no more was ever heard of him some say sir robert killed himself an actor in his own melodrama and that one day we shall unearth his brooding lost and gothic body and that it was he who killed the children and that his preoccupation with doors and hinges and more doors led him crazed to study this one species of spider and wildly plan and build the most amazing door in history an insane burrow into which he popped to die before my eyes thus hoping to perpetuate the incredible finnegan but i have found no burrow i do not believe a man could construct such a pit even given sir roberts overwhelming passion for doors i can only ask would a man murder draw his victims blood build an earthen vault for what motive create the finest secret exit in all time madness and what of those large grayish balls of earth supposedly tossed forth from the spiders lair somewhere finnegan and sir robert lie clasped in a velvetlined unmarked crypt deep under whether one is the paranoiac alter ego of the other i cannot say but the murders have ceased the rabbits once more rush in chatham forest and its bushes teem with butterflies and birds it is another spring and the children run again through a loud glade no longer silent finnegan and sir robert requiescat in peace that woman on the lawn very late at night he heard the weeping on the lawn in front of his house it was the sound of a woman crying by its sound he knew it was not a girl or a mature woman but the crying of someone eighteen or nineteen years old it went on then faded and stopped and again started up now moving this way or that on the latesummer wind he lay in bed listening to it until it made his eyes fill with tears he turned over shut his eyes let the tears fall but could not stop the sound why should a young woman be weeping long after midnight out there he sat up and the weeping stopped at the window he looked down the lawn was empty but covered with dew there was a trail of footsteps across the lawn to the middle where someone had stood turning and another trail going off toward the garden around the house the moon stood full in the sky and filled the lawn with its light but there was no more sadness and only the footprints there he stepped back from the window suddenly chilled and went down to heat and drink a cup of chocolate he did not think of the weeping again until dusk the next day and even then thought that it must be some woman from a house nearby unhappy with life perhaps locked out and in need of a place to let her sadness go yet as the twilight deepened coming home he found himself hurrying from the bus at a steady pace which astonished him why why all this idiot he thought a woman unseen weeps under your window and here at sunset the next day you almost run yes he thought but her voice was it beautiful then no only familiar where had he heard such a voice before wordless in crying who could he ask living in an empty house from which his parents had vanished long ago he turned in at his front lawn and stood still his eyes shadowed what had he expected that whoever she was would be waiting here was he that lonely that a single voice long after midnight roused all his senses no simply put he must know who the crying woman was and he was certain she would return tonight as he slept he went to bed at eleven and awoke at three panicked that he had missed a miracle lightning had destroyed a nearby town or an earthquake had shaken half the world to dust and he had slept through it fool he thought and slung back the covers and moved to the window to see that indeed he had overslept for there on the lawn were the delicate footprints and he hadnt even heard the weeping he would have gone out to kneel in the grass but at that moment a police car motored slowly by looking at nothing and the night how could he run to prowl to probe to touch the grass if that car came by again what doing picking clover blossoms weeding dandelions what what his bones cracked with indecision he would go down he would not already the memory of that terrible weeping faded the more he tried to make it clear if he missed her one more night the memory itself might be gone behind him in his room the alarm clock rang damn he thought what time did i set it for he shut off the alarm and sat on his bed rocking gently waiting eyes shut listening the wind shifted the tree just outside the window whispered and stirred he opened his eyes and leaned forward from far off coming near and now down below the quiet sound of a woman weeping she had come back to his lawn and was not forever lost be very quiet he thought and the sounds she made came up on the wind through the blowing curtains into his room careful now careful but quick he moved to the window and looked down in the middle of the lawn she stood and wept her hair long and dark on her shoulders her face bright with tears and there was something in the way her hands trembled at her sides the way her hair moved quietly in the wind that shook him so that he almost fell he knew her and yet did not he had seen her before but had never seen turn your head he thought almost as if hearing this the young woman sank to her knees to half kneel on the grass letting the wind comb her hair head down and weeping so steadily and bitterly that he wanted to cry out oh no it kills my heart and as if she had heard quite suddenly her head lifted her weeping grew less as she looked up at the moon so that he saw her face and it was indeed a face seen somewhere once but where a tear fell she blinked it was like the blinking of a camera and a picture taken god save me he whispered no he whirled and stumbled toward the closet to seize down an avalanche of boxes and albums in the dark he scrabbled then pulled on the closet light tossed aside six albums until finally dragging another forth and riffling pages he gave a cry stopped and held a photo close then turned and moved blindly to the window there he stared down at the lawn and then at the photograph very old very yellowed with age yes yes the same the image struck his eyes and then his heart his whole body shook made an immense pulsation as he leaned at the album leaned on the window frame and almost shouted you how dare you come back how dare you be young how dare you be what a girl untouched wandering late on my lawn you were never that young never damn oh damn your warm blood damn your wild soul but this he did not shout or say for something in his eyes like a beacon must have flashed the crying of the young woman on the lawn stopped she looked up at which instant the album fell from his fingers through the burstwide screen and down like a dark bird fluttering to strike the earth the young man gave a muted cry whirled and ran no no he cried aloud i didnt meancome back he was down the stairs and out on the porch in a matter of seconds the door slammed behind him like a gunshot the explosion nailed him to the rail half down to the lawn where there was nothing to be seen but footprints either way up the street lay empty sidewalks and shadows under trees a radio played off in an upstairs window in a house behind trees a car passed murmuring at a far intersection wait he whispered come back i shouldnt have said he stopped he had said nothing but only thought it but his outrage his jealousy she had felt that she had somehow heard and now shell never come back he thought oh god he sat on the porch steps for a while quietly biting his knuckle at three in the morning in bed he thought he heard a sigh and soft footsteps in grass and waited the photo album lay closed on the floor even though it lay shut he could see and know her face and it was utterly impossible utterly insane his last thought before sleep was ghost the strangest ghost that ever walked the ghost of someone dead the ghost of someone who died very old but somehow come back not as her old self but a ghost that was somehow young werent ghosts always when they returned the same age as when they died no not this one anyway why he whispered and dream took over the whisper one night passed and then another and another and there was nothing on the lawn but the light of a moon that changed its face from outright stare to half grimace he waited the first night a more than ordinarily casual cat crossed the yard at two am the second night a dog trotted by wearing his tongue half out of his mouth like a loosely tied red cravat smiling at trees the third night a spider spent from twelvetwentyfive until four am building a baroque clockface on the air between lawn and trees which a bird broke in passing at dawn he slept most of sunday and awoke with a fever that was not an illness at dusk late in the twilight of the fifth day the color of the sky somehow promised her return as did the way the wind leaned against the trees and the look of the moon when it finally rose to set the scene all right he said half aloud now but at midnight nothing come on he whispered one oclock nothing you must he thought no you will he slept for ten minutes and woke suddenly at twoten knowing that when he went to the window she would be there she was at first he didnt see her and groaned and then in the shadow of the great oak far out on the edge of the lawn he saw something move and one foot came out and she took a step and stood very still he held his breath quieted his heart told himself to turn walk and take each step down with precision numbering them fifteen fourteen thirteen moving in darkness with no rush six five four and at last one he opened the front screen door with only a whisper and was on the porch without frightening what might be out beyond waiting for him quietly he moved down the porch steps to the edge of the lawn like one who stands on the rim of a pond out in the center of that pond the young woman stood trapped like someone on thin ice that might at any moment break and drop her through she did not see him and then she did a thing that was a signal tonight her hair was fixed in a knot at the back of her head she lifted her white arms in a gesture and with one touch of her fingers a touch of snow loosened her hair it fell in a dark banner to blow and repattern itself across her shoulders which trembled with their shadows the wind stirred her hair in the night and moved it about her face and on her uplifted hands the shadows laid down by the moon under every tree leaned as if called by the motion the entire world shifted in its sleep the wind blew as the young woman waited but no footsteps sounded along the white sidewalks no front doors opened far down the street no windows were raised no motion caused front porches to creak and shift he took another step out onto the small meadow of night who are you she gasped and stepped back no no he said softly its all right another trembling had taken over her body where before it had been some hope some anticipation now it was fear one hand stopped her hair from blowing the other half shielded her face ill stand right here he said believe me she waited a long while staring at him until her shoulders relaxed and the lines around her mouth vanished her whole body sensed the truth of his words i dont understand she said i dont either what are you doing here i dont know what am i doing here you came to meet someone he said did i the town clock struck three in the morning far away she listened to it her face shadowed by the sound but its so late people dont walk around late on front lawns they do if they must he said but why maybe we can find out if we talk about what what about why youre here if we talk long enough we may know i know why im here of course i heard you crying oh im so ashamed dont be why are people ashamed of tears i cry often then i start laughing but the crying must come first go ahead what a strange man you are her hand fell away from her hair her other hand moved away so her face was illuminated by a small and growing curiosity i thought i was the only one who knew about crying she said everyone thinks that its one of those little secrets we keep from each other show me a serious man and ill show you a man who has never wept show me a madman and ill show you a man who dried his tears a long time ago go ahead i think im done she said any time start over she burst out a tiny laugh oh you are strange who are you well come to that she peered across the lawn at his hands his face his mouth and then at his eyes oh i know you but from where that would spoil it you wouldnt believe anyway i would now it was his turn to laugh quietly youre very young no nineteen ancient girls by the time they go from twelve to nineteen are full of years yes i dont know but it must be so now please why are you out here in the middle of the night i she shut her eyes to think in on it im waiting yes and im sad its the waiting that makes you sad yes i think no yes no and you dont quite know what youre waiting for oh i wish i could be sure all of mes waiting i dont know all of me i dont understand im impossible no youre everyone that ever grew up too fast and wanted too much i think girls women like you have slipped out at night since time began if it wasnt here in green town it was in cairo or alexandria or rome or paris in summer anywhere there was a private place and late hours and no one to see so they just rose up and out as if someone had called their name i was called yes thats it someone did call my name its true how did you know was it you no but someone we both know youll know his name when you go back to bed tonight wherever that is why in that house behind you she said thats my house i was born in it wellhe laughedso was i you how can that be are you sure yes anyway you heard someone calling you had to come out i did many nights now but always no ones here they must be there or why would i hear them one day therell be someone to fit the voice oh dont joke with me im not believe there will be thats what all those other women heard in other years and places middle of summer dead of winter go out and risk cold stand warm in snow banks and listen and look for strange footprints on the midnight snow and only an old dog trotting by all smiles damn damn oh yes damn damn and her smile showed for a moment even as the moon came out of the clouds and went away isnt it silly no men do the same they take long walks when theyre sixteen seventeen they dont stand on lawns waiting no but my god how they walk miles and miles from midnight until dawn and come home exhausted and explode and die in bed what a shame that those who stand and wait and those who walk all night cant meet yes dont you think its a shame they do finally oh no i shall never meet anyone im old and ugly and terrible and i dont know how many nights ive heard that voice making me come here and theres nothing and i just want to die oh lovely young girl he said gently dont die the cavalry is on its way you will be saved there was such certainty in his voice that it made her glance up again for she had been looking at her hands and her own soul in her hands you know dont you she asked yes you truly know you tell the truth swear to god swear by all thats living tell me more theres little more to tell tell me everything will be all right with you some night soon or some day someone will call and theyll really be there when you come to find the game will be over hideandseek you mean but its gone on too long its almost over marie you know my name he stopped confused he had not meant to speak it how did you know who are you she demanded when you get back to sleep tonight youll know if we say too much youll disappear or ill disappear im not quite sure which of us is real or which is a ghost not me oh surely not me i can feel myself im here why look and she showed him the remainder of her tears brushed from her eyelids and held on her palms oh thats real all right well then dear young woman i must be the visitor i come to tell you it will all go right do you believe in special ghosts are you special one of us is or maybe both the ghost of young love or the ghost of the unborn is that what i am you are paradoxes arent easy to explain then depending on how you look at it youre impossible and so am i if it makes it easier just think im not really here do you believe in ghosts i think i do it comes to me to imagine then that there are special ghosts in the world not ghosts of dead people but ghosts of want and need or i guess you might say desire i dont understand well have you ever lain in bed late afternoons late nights and dreamed something so much awake you felt your soul jump out of your body as if something had yanked a long pure white sheet straight out the window you want something so much your soul leaps out and follows my god fast why yes yes boys do that men do that when i was twelve i read burroughs mars novels john carter used to stand under the stars hold up his arms to mars and ask to be taken and mars grabbed his soul yanked him like an aching tooth across space and landed him in dead martian seas thats boys thats men and girls women they dream yes and their ghosts come out of their bodies living ghosts living wants living needs and go to stand on lawns in the middle of winter nights thats about it am i a ghost then yes the ghost of wanting so much it kills but doesnt kill you shakes and almost breaks you and you i must be the answerghost the answerghost what a funny name yes but youve asked and i know the answer tell me all right the answer is this young

there will be a man to go with the voice that calls oh please dont tell me that if it isnt true her voice trembled tears flashed again in her eyes she half raised her arms again in defense i wouldnt dream to hurt you i only came to tell the town clock struck again in the deep morning its late she said very late get along now is that all youre going to say you dont need to know any more the last echoes of the great clock faded how strange she murmured the ghost of a question the ghost of an answer what better ghosts can there be none that i ever heard of were twins far nearer than you think she took a step looked down and gasped with delight look oh look i can move yes what was it you said boys walk all night miles and miles yes i could go back in but i cant sleep now i must walk too do that he said gently but where shall i go why he said and he suddenly knew he knew where to send her and was suddenly angry with himself for knowing angry with her for asking a burst of jealousy welled in him he wanted to race down the street to a certain house where a certain young man lived in another year and break the window burn the roof and yet oh yet if he did that yes she said for he had kept her waiting now he thought you must tell her theres no escape for if you dont tell her angry fool you yourself will never be born a wild laugh burst from his mouth a laugh that accepted the entire night and time and all his crazed thinking so you want to know where to go he said at last oh yes he nodded his head up to that corner four blocks to the right one block to the left she repeated it quickly and the final number eleven green park oh thank you thank you she ran a few steps then stopped bewildered her hands were helpless at her throat her mouth trembled silly i hate to leave why why because im afraid ill never see you again you will three years from now are you sure i wont look quite the same but itll be me and youll know me forever oh im glad for that your face is familiar i somehow know you well she began to walk slowly looking over at him as he stood near the porch of the house thanks she said youve saved my life and my own along with it the shadows of a tree fell across her face touched her cheeks moved in her eyes oh lord girls lie in bed nights listing the names for their future children silly joe john christopher samuel stephen and right now will she touched the gentle rise of her stomach then lifted her hand out halfway to point to him in the night is your name will yes tears absolutely burst from her eyes he wept with her oh thats fine fine she said at last i can go now i wont be out here on the lawn anymore thank god thank you good night she went away into the shadows across the lawn and along the sidewalk down the street at the far corner he saw her turn and wave and walk away good night he said quietly i am not born yet he thought or she has been dead many years which is it which the moon sailed into clouds the motion touched him to step walk go up the porch stairs wait look out at the lawn go inside shut the door a wind shook the trees the moon came out again and looked upon a lawn where two sets of footprints one going one way one going another in the dew slowly slowly as the night continued vanished by the time the moon had gone down the sky there was only an empty lawn and no sign and much dew the great town clock struck six in the morning fire showed in the east a cock crowed the very gentle murders joshua enderby awoke in the middle of the night because e felt someones fingers at his throat in the rich darkness above him he sensed but could not see his wifes frail skelatinous weight seated on his chest while she dabbled and clenched tremblingly again and again at his neck he opened his eyes wide he realized what she was trying to do it was so ridiculous he almost cried out with laughter his rickety jaundiced eightyfiveyearold wife was trying to strangle him she panted forth a rumandbitters smell as she perched there toppling like a drunken moth tinkering away as if he were a toy she sighed irritably and her skinny fingers began to swear as she gasped why dont you oh why don t you why dont i what he wondered idly lying there he swallowed and this faint action of his adams apple dislodged her feeble clutch why dont i die is that it he cried silently he lay another few moments wondering if shed gain strength enough to do him in she didnt should he snap on the light to confront her wouldnt she look a silly ass a skinny chicken aloft sidesaddle on her hated husbands amazed body and him laughing joshua enderby groaned and yawned missy her hands froze on his collarbone will you he turned pretending half sleep will youplease he yawned move to your side of the bed eh good girl missy moved off in the dark he heard ice tinkle she was having another shot of rum at noon the next day enjoying the weather and waiting for luncheon guests to arrive old joshua and missy traded drinks in the garden pavilion he handed her dubonnet she gave him sherry there was a moment of silence as both eyed the stuff and hesitated to sip he handled his glass in such a way that his large white diamond ring sparked and glittered on his palsied hand its light made him flinch and at last he gathered his phlegm missy he said you havent long to live you know missy was hidden behind jonquils in a crystal bowl and now peered out at her mummified husband both perceived that the others hands shook she wore a cobalt dress heavily iced with luncheon jewels little glittery planets under each ear a scarlet design for a mouth the ancient whore of babylon he thought dryly how odd my dear how very odd missy said with a polite scrape of her voice why only last night you were thinking of me we must talk yes we must he leaned like a wax mannequin in his chair no rush but if i do you in or if you do me in lets protect each other yes oh dont look at me in amaze my dear i was perfectly aware of your little gallup last night on my ribs fumbling with my esophagus feeling the tumblers click or whatever dear me blood rose in missys powdery cheeks were you awake all during im mortified i think i shall have to go lie down nonsense joshua stopped her if i die you should be shielded so no onell accuse you same with me if you die why go to all the trouble of trying toeliminateeach other if it just means a gallowsdrop or a french fry logical enough she agreed i suggest aa series of mash notes to each other umm lavish displays of sentiment before friends gifts et cetera ill run up bills for flowers diamond bracelets you purchase fine leather wallets and goldferruled canes for me you have a head for things i must say she admitted it will help allay suspicion if we appear madly anciently in love you know she said tiredly it doesnt matter joshua which of us dies first except that im very old and would like to do one thing right in my life ive always been such a dilettante ive never liked you loved you yes but thats ten million years back you never were a friend if it werent for the children motives are bilge he said we are two querulous old pots with nothing to do but kick off and make a circus of that but how much better the dying game if we write a few rules act it neatly with no one the wiser how long has this assassination plot of yours been active she beamed remember the opera last week you slipped from the curb that car almost nailed you good lord he laughed i thought someone shoved both of us he leaned forward chuckling okay when you fell in the bath last month i greased the tub unthinkingly she gasped drank part of her dubonnet then froze reading her mind he stared at his own drink this isnt poisoned by any chance he sniffed his glass dont be silly she replied touching her dubonnet with a lizards doubtful tongue theyd find the residue in whats left of your stomach just be sure you doublecheck your shower tonight i have kited the temperature which might bring on a seizure you didnt he scoffed ive thought about it she confessed the frontdoor chimes rang but not with their usual joy sounding more funereal nonsense joshua thought bosh thought missy then brightened we have forgotten our luncheon guest thats the gowrys hes a bore but be nice fix your collar its damned tight too much starch one more plot to strangle me i wish i had thought of that double time now and they marched arm in arm with idiot laughter off to meet the halfforgotten gowrys cocktails were served the old relics sat side by side hands laced like school chums laughing with weak heartiness at gowrys dire jokes they leaned forward to show him their porcelain smiles saying oh thats a good one loudly and softly sotto voce to each other thought of anything new electric razor in your bath not bad not bad and then pat said to mike cried mr gowry from the corner of his mouth joshua whispered to missy you know i dislike you with something approaching the colossal proportions of first love you have taught me mayhem how when the teacher is ready the pupil will arrive whispered missy laughter rose in tumbling whirling waves the room was giddy airy light so pat says to mike do it yourself boomed gowry oh ho everyone exploded now dear missy waved at her ancient husband tell one of your jokes oh but first she remembered cleverly trot downcellar darling and fetch the brandy gowry sprang forward with wild courtesy i know where it is oh mr gowry dont missy gestured frantically mr gowry ran from the room oh dear dear me cried missy a moment later gowry uttered a loud shriek from the basement followed by a thunderous crash missy hippetyhopped out only to reappear moments later her hand clutched to her throat heavens to betsy she wailed come look i do believe mr gowry has pitched himself straight down the cellar stairs the next morning joshua enderby shuffled into the house lugging a large green velvet board some five feet by three on which pistols were clasped in display here i am he shouted missy appeared with a rum collins in one braceletjangly hand her cane thumping in the other whats that she demanded first hows old gowry broken leg wished it had been his vocal cords shame about that top cellar step gone loose eh the old man hooked the green velvet board to the wall good thing gowry lurched for the brandy not i shame the wife drank thirstily explain im in the antiqueguncollecting business he waved at the weapons in their neat leather nests i dont see with a collection of guns to cleanbang he beamed man shoots wife while oiling matchlock garter pistol didnt know it was loaded says weeping spouse touche she said an hour later while oiling a revolver he almost blew his brains out his wife came thumping in and froze hell youre still alive loaded by god he lifted the weapon in a trembling hand none were loaded unless unless he seized three more weapons all loaded you me she said while you ate lunch i suppose ill have to give you tea now come along he stared at the bullet hole in the wall tea hell he said wheres the gin it was her turn for a shopping spree there are ants in the house she rattled her full shopping bag and set out antpaste pots in all the rooms sprinkled ant powders on windowsills in his golf bag and over his gun collection from other sacks she drew rat poisons mousekillers and bugexterminators a bad summer for roaches she distributed these liberally among the foods thats a doubleedged sword he observed youll fall on it bilge the victim mustnt choose his demise yes but no violence i wish a serene face for the coroner vanity dear josh your face will twist like a corkscrew with one heaping teaspoon of black leaf forty in your midnight cocoa i he shot back know a recipe that will break you out in a thousand lumps before expiring she quieted why josh i wouldnt dream of using black leaf forty he bowed i wouldnt dream of using the thousandlump recipe shake she said their assassins game continued he bought huge rattraps to hide in the halls you run barefoot so small wounds large infections she in turn stuck the sofas full of antimacassar pins wherever he laid a hand it drew blood ow damn he sucked his fingers are these amazon indian blowgun darts no just plain old rusty lockjaw needles oh he said though he was aging fast joshua enderby dearly loved to drive you could see him motoring with feeble wildness up and down the hills of beverly mouth gaped eyes blinking palely one afternoon he phoned from malibu missy my god i almost dove from a cliff my right front wheel flew off on a straightaway i planned it for a curve sorry got the idea from action news loosen cars wheel lugs tomato surprise never mind about careless old me he said whats new with you rug slipped on the hall stairs maid fell on her prat poor lila i send her everywhere ahead now she bucketed down like a laundry bag lucky shes all fat well kill that one between us if were not careful do you think oh i do like lila so lay lila off for a spell hire someone new if we catch them in our crossfire wont be so sad hate to think of lila smashed under a chandelier or chandelier missy shrieked you been fiddling with my grandmas fountainbleu palace crystal hangings listen here mister youre not to touch that chandelier promise he muttered good grief those lovely crystals if they fell and missed me id hop on one leg to cane you to death then wake you up and cane you again slam went the phone joshua enderby stepped in from the balcony at supper that night hed been smoking he looked at the table wheres your strawberry crumpet i wasnt hungry i gave it to the new maid idiot she glared dont tell me you poisoned that crumpet you old sob there was a crash from the kitchen joshua went to look and returned shes not new anymore he said they stashed the new maid in an attic trunk no one telephoned to ask for her disappointing observed missy on the seventh day i felt certain thered be a tall cold man with a notebook and another with a camera and flashbulbs flashing poor girl was lonelier than we guessed cocktail parties streamed wildly through the house it was missys idea so we can pick each other off in a forest of obstacles moving targets mr gowry gamely returning to the house limping after his tumble of some weeks before joked laughed and didnt quite blow his ear off with one of the dueling pistols everyone roared but the party broke up early gowry vowed never to return then there was a miss kummer who staying overnight borrowed joshuas electric razor and was almost but not quite electrocuted she left the house rubbing her right underarm joshua promptly grew a beard soon after a mr schlagel vanished so did a mr smith the last seen of these unfortunates was at a saturday night soiree at the enderbys mansion hideandseek friends slapped joshuas back jovially how do you do it kill em with toadstools plant em like mushrooms grand joke yes chortled joshua no no ha not toadstools but one got locked in our standup fridge overnight eskimo pie the other tripped on a croquet hoop defenestrated through a greenhouse window eskimo pie defenestrated hooted the party people dear joshua you are a card i speak only the truth joshua protested what wont you think of next one wonders what did happen to old schlagel and that rascal smith what did happen to schlagel and smith missy inquired some days later let me explain the eskimo pie was my dessert but the croquet hoop no did you spot it in the wrong place hoping id pop by and lunge through the greenhouse panes missy turned to stone he had touched a nerve well now its time for a wee talk he said cancel the parties one more victim and sirens will announce the arrival of the law yes missy agreed our target practice seems to wind up in ricochet about that croquet hoop you always take midnight greenhouse walks why was that damn fool schlagel stumbling about out there at two am dumb ox is he still under the compost until i stash him with hewhoisfrozen dear dear no more parties just you me andahthe chandelier ah no ive hid the stepladder so you cant climb damn said joshua that night by the fireplace he poured a few glasses of their best port while he was out of the room answering the telephone she dropped a little white powder in her own glass hate this she murmured terribly unoriginal but there wont be an inquest he looked long dead before he died theyll say as they shut the lid and she added a touch more lethal stuff to her port just as he wandered in to sit and pluck up his glass heeyed it and fixed his wife a grin ah no no you dont dont what she said all innocence the fire crackled warmly gently on the hearth the mantel clock ticked you dont mind do you my dear if we exchange drinks surely you dont think i poisoned your drink while you were out trite banal but possible well then fussbudget trade he looked surprised but traded glasses heres not looking at you both said and laughed they drank with mysterious smiles and then they sat with immense satisfaction in their easy chairs the firelight glimmering on their ghostpale faces letting the port warm their almost spidery veins he stuck his legs out and held one hand to the fire ah he sighed nothing nothing quite like port she leaned her small gray head back dozing gumming her redsticky mouth and glancing at him with halfsecretive lazy eyes poor lila she murmured yes he murmured lila poor the fire popped and she at last added poor mr schlagel yes he drowsed poor schlagel dont forget smith and you old man she said finally slowly slyly how do you feel sleepy very sleepy unhuh he studied her with bright eyes and my dear what about you sleepy she said behind closed eyes then they popped wide why all these questions indeed he said stirring alert why oh well because she examined her little black shoe moving in a low rhythm a long way off below her knee i think or perhaps imagine i have just destroyed your digestive and nervous systems for the moment he was drowsily content and examined the warm fire and listened to the clock tick what you mean is that you have just poisoned me he dreamed the words you what he jumped as all the air gusted from his body the port glass shattered on the floor she leaned forward like a fortuneteller eagerly predicting futures i cleverly poisoned my own drink and knew that youd ask to trade off so you felt safe and we did her laugh tinkled he fell back in his chair clutching at his face to stop the wild swiveling of his eyes then suddenly he remembered something and let out an incredible explosion of laughter why cried missy why are you laughing because he gasped tears streaming down his cheeks his mouth grinning horribly i poisoned my drink and hoped for an excuse to change with you oh dear she cried no longer smiling how stupid of us why didnt i guess because both of us are much too clever by far and he lay back chortling oh the mortification the embarrassment i feel stark naked and hate myself no no he husked think instead how much you still hate me with all my withered heart and soul you no deathbed forgiveness here old lilywhite ironmaiden wife mine cheerio he added faintly far away if you think ill say cheerio back youre crazed she whispered her head rolling to one side her eyes clamped her mouth gone loose around the words but what the hell cheer at which her breath ceased and the fire burned to ashes as the clock ticked and ticked in the quiet room friends found them strewn in their library chairs the next day both looking more than usually pleased with their situation a suicide pact said all so great their love they could not bear to let the other vanish alone into eternity i hope said mr gowry on his crutches my wife will someday join me in similar drinks quicker than the eye it was at a magic show i saw the man who looked enough like me to be my twin my wife and i were seated at a saturday night performance it was summer and warm the audience melting in weather and conviviality all around i saw married and engaged couples delighted and then alarmed by the comic opera of their lives which was being shown in immense symbol onstage a woman was sawed in half how the husbands in the audience smiled a woman in a cabinet vanished a bearded magician wept for her in despair then at the tiptop of the balcony she appeared waving a whitepowdered hand infinitely beautiful unattainable far away how the wives grinned their cat grins look at them i said to my wife a woman floated in midair a goddess born in all mens minds by their own true love let not her dainty feet touch earth keep her on that invisible pedestal watch it god dont tell me how its done anyone ah look at her float and dream and what was that man who spun plates globes stars torches his elbows twirling hoops his nose balancing a blue feather sweating everything at once what i asked myself but the commuter husband lover worker the quick luncher juggling hour benzedrine nembutal bank balances and budgets obviously none of us had come to escape the world outside but rather to have it tossed back at us in more easily digested forms brighter cleaner quicker neater a spectacle both heartening and melancholy who in life has not seen a woman disappear there on the black plush stage women mysteries of talc and rose petal vanished cream alabaster statues sculptures of summer lily and fresh rain melted to dreams and the dreams became empty mirrors even as the magician reached hungrily to seize them from cabinets and nests of boxes from flung seanets shattering like porcelain as the conjurer fired his gun the women vanished symbolic i thought why do magicians point pistols at lovely assistants unless through some secret pact with the male subconscious what asked my wife eh you were muttering said my wife sorry i searched the program oh next comes miss quick the only female pickpocket in the world that cant be true said my wife quietly i looked to see if she was joking in the dark her dim mouth seemed to be smiling but the quality of that smile was lost to me the orchestra hummed like a serene flight of bees the curtains parted there with no great fanfare no swirl of cape no bow only the most condescending tilt of her head and the faintest elevation of her left eyebrow stood miss quick i thought it was a dog act when she snapped her fingers volunteers all men sit down my wife pulled at me i had risen there was a stir like so many hounds a silently baying pack rose and walked to the snapping of miss quicks colorless fingernails it was obvious instantly that miss quick was the same woman who had been vanishing all evening budget show i thought everyone doubles in brass i dont like her what asked my wife am i talking out loud again but really miss quick provoked me for she looked as if she had gone backstage shrugged on a rumpled tweed walking suit one size too large gravyspotted and grassstained and then purposely rumpled her hair painted her lipstick askew and was on the point of exiting the stage door when someone cried youre on so here she was now in her practical shoes her nose shiny her hands in motion but her face immobile getting it over with feet firmly and resolutely planted she waited her hands deep in her lumpy tweed pockets her mouth cool as the dumb volunteers dogged it to the stage this mixed pack she set right with a few taps lining them up in a military row the audience waited thats all acts over back to your seats snap went her plain fingers the men dismayed sheepishly peering at each other ambled off she let them stumble half down the stairs into darkness then yawned havent you forgotten something eagerly they turned here with a smile like the very driest wine she lazily unwedged a wallet from one of her pockets she removed another wallet from within her coat followed by a third a fourth a fifth ten wallets in all she held them forth like biscuits to good beasts the men blinked no those were not their wallets they had been onstage for only an instant she had mingled with them only in passing it was all a joke surely she was offering them brandnew wallets compliments of the show but now the men began feeling themselves like sculptures finding unseen flaws in old hastily flung together armatures their mouths gaped their hands grew more frantic slapping their chestpockets digging their pockets all the while miss quick ignored them to calmly sort their wallets like the morning mail it was at this precise moment i noticed the man on the far right end of the line half on the stage i lifted my opera glasses i looked once i looked twice well i said lightly there seems to be a man there who somewhat resembles me oh said my wife i handed her the glasses casually far right its not like you said my wife its you well almost i said modestly the fellow was nicelooking it was hardly cricket to look thus upon yourself and pronounce favorable verdicts simultaneously i had grown quite cold i took back the opera glasses and nodded fascinated crew cut hornrimmed glasses pink complexion blue eyes your absolute twin cried my wife and this was true and it was strange sitting there watching myself onstage no no no i kept whispering but yet what my mind refused my eye accepted arent there two billion people in this world yes all different snowflakes no two the same but now here delivered into my gaze endangering my ego and my complacency here was a casting from the same absolutes the identical mold should i believe disbelieve feel proud or run scared for here i stood witness to the forgetfulness of god i dont think said god ive made one like this before but i thought entranced delighted alarmed god errs flashes from old psychology books lit my mind heredity environment smith jones helstrom onstage in bland drillsergeant tones miss quick called roll and handed back the stolen goods you borrow your body from all your forebears i thought heredity but isnt the body also an environment winters environment they say surrounds you well doesnt the body surround with its lakes its architectures of bone its overabundances or wastelands of soul does not what is seen in passing windowmirrors a face either serene snowfalls or a pitted abyss the hands like swans or sparrows the feet anvils or hummingbirds the body a lumpy wheatsack or a summer fern do these not seen paint the mind set the image shape the brain and psyche like clay they do bidwell rogers well then trapped in the same environmental flesh how fared this stranger onstage in the old fashion i wanted to leap to my feet and call what oclock is it and he like the town crier passing late with my face might half mournfully reply nine oclock and alls well but was all well with him question did those hornrims cover a myopia not only of light but of spirit question was the slight obesity pressed to his skeleton symbolic of a similar gathering of tissue in his head in sum did his soul go north while mine went south the same flesh cloaking us but our minds reacting one winter one summer my god i said half aloud suppose were absolutely identical shh said a woman behind me i swallowed hard suppose i thought he is a chainsmoker light sleeper overeater manicdepressive glib talker deepshallow thinker flesh fancier no one with that body that face could be otherwise even our names must be similar our names bl er miss quick spoke his someone coughed i missed it perhaps shed repeat it but no he my twin moved forward damn he stumbled the audience laughed i focused my binoculars swiftly my twin stood quietly center stage now his wallet returned to his fumbling hands stand straight i whispered dont slouch shh said my wife i squared my own shoulders secretly i never knew i looked that fine i thought cramming the glasses to my eyes surely my nostrils arent that thinly made the true aristocrat is my skin that fresh and handsome my chin that firm i blushed in silence after all if my wife said that was me accept it the lamplight of pure intelligence shone softly from every pore of his face the glasses my wife nudged me reluctantly i gave them up she trained the glasses rigidly not on the man but now on miss quick who was busy cajoling flirting and repicking the pockets of the nearest men on occasion my wife broke into a series of little satisfied snorts and giggles miss quick was indeed the goddess shiva if i saw two hands i saw nine her hands an aviary flew rustled tapped soared petted whirled tickled as miss quick her face blank swarmed coldly over her victims touched without touching whats in this pocket and this and here she shook their vests pinched their lapels jingled their trousers money rang she punched them lightly with a vindictive forefinger ringing totals on cash registers she unplucked coat buttons with mannish yet fragile motions gave wallets back sneaked them away she thrust them took them stole them again while peeling money to count it behind the mens backs then snatched their watches while holding their hands she trapped a live doctor now have you a thermometer she asked yes he searched his face panicked he searched again the audience cued him with a roar he glanced over to find miss quick standing with the thermometer in her mouth like an unlit smoke she whipped it out eyed it temperature she cried one hundred ten she closed her eyes and gave an insincere shake of her hips the audience roared and now she assaulted her victims bullied them tugged at their shirts rumpled their hair asked wheres your tie they clapped their hands to their empty collars she plucked their ties from nowhere tossed them back she was a magnet that invisibly drew goodluck charms saints medals roman coins theater stubs handkerchiefs stickpins while the audience ran riot convulsed as these rabbit men stood peeled of all prides and protections hold your hip pocket she vacuumed your vest clutch your vest she jackpotted your trousers blithely bored firm but evanescent she convinced you you missed nothing until she extracted it with faint loathing from her own tweeds moments later whats this she held up a letter dear helen last night with you a furious blush as the victim tussled with miss quick snatched the letter stowed it away but a moment later the letter was restolen and reread aloud dear helen last night so the battle raged one woman ten men she kissed one stole his belt stole anothers suspenders the women in the audiencewhinnied their men shocked joined in what a magnificent bully miss quick how she spanked her dear idiotgrinning carryonsomehow men turned boys as she spun them like cigarstore indians knocked them with her brontosaur hip leaned on them like barberpoles calling each one cute or lovely or handsome this night i thought is lunatic all about me wives hilarious with contempt hysterical at being so shabbily revealed in their national pastimes gagged for air their husbands sat stunned as if a war were over that had not been declared fought and lost before they could move each nearby had the terrible look of a man who fears his throat is cut and that a sneeze would fill the aisle with heads quickly i thought do something you you onstage my twin dodge escape and she was coming at him be firm i told my twin strategy duck weave zigzag dont look where she says look where she doesnt say go it now if i shouted this or merely ground it to powder in my teeth i dont recall for all the men froze as miss quick seized my twin by the hand careful i whispered too late his watch was gone he didnt know it your watch is gone i thought he doesnt know what time it is i thought miss quick stroked his lapel back off i warned myself too late his fortydollar pen was gone he didnt know it she tweaked his nose he smiled idiot there went his wallet not your nose fool your coat padded she pinched his shoulder he looked at his right arm no i cried silently for now she had the letters out of his left coat pocket she planted a red kiss on his brow and backed off with everything else he had on him coins identification a package of chocolates which she ate greedily use the sense god gave a cow i shouted behind my face blind see what shes doing she whirled him round measured him and said this yours and returned his tie my wife was hysterical she still held the glasses fixed on every nuance and vibration of loss and deprivation on the poor idiots face her mouth was spoiled with triumph my god i cried in the uproar get off the stage i yelled within wishing i could really yell it at least get out while you have some pride the laughter had erupted a volcano in the theater high and rumbling and dark the dim grotto seemed lit with unhealthy fever an incandescence my twin wanted to break off like one of pavlovs dogs too many bells on too many days no reward no food his eyes were glazed with his insane predicament fall jump in the pit crawl away i thought the orchestra sawed at destiny with violins and valkyrian trumpets in full flood with one last snatch one last contemptuous wag of her body miss quick grasped my twins clean white shirt and yanked it off she threw the shirt in the air as it fell so did his pants as his pants fell unbelted so did the theater an avalanche of shock soared to bang the rafters and roll over us in echoes a thundering hilarity the curtain fell we sat covered with unseen rubble drained of blood buried in one upheaval after another degraded and autopsied and minus eulogy tossed into a mass grave we men took a minute to stare at that dropped curtain behind which hid the pickpocket and her victims behind which a man quickly hoisted his trousers up his spindly legs a burst of applause a prolonged tide on a dark shore miss quick did not appear to bow she did not need to she was standing behind the curtain i could feel her there no smile no expression standing coldly estimating the caliber of the applause comparing it to the metered remembrances of other nights i jumped up in an absolute rage i had after all failed myself when i should have ducked i bobbed when i should have backed off i ran in what an ass what a fine show said my wife as we milled through the departing audience fine i cried didnt you like it all except the pickpocket obvious act overdone no subtlety i said lighting a cigarette she was a whiz this way i steered my wife toward the stage door of course said my wife blandly that man the one who looks like you he was a plant they call them shills dont they paid by the management to pretend to be part of the audience no man would take money for a spectacle like that i said no he was just some boob who didnt know how to be careful what are we doing back here blinking around we found we were backstage perhaps i wished to stride up to my twin shouting halfbaked ox insulter of all men play a flute you dance tickle your chin you jump like a puppet jerk the truth was of course i must see my twin closeup confront the traitor and see where his true flesh differed from mine after all wouldnt i have done better in his place the backstage was lit in blooms and isolated flushes now bright now dark where the other magicians stood chatting and there there was miss quick and there smiling was my twin you did fine charlie said miss quick my twins name was charlie stupid name charlie patted miss quicks cheek you did fine maam god it was true a shill a confederate paid what five ten dollars for letting his shirt be torn oft letting his pants drop with his pride what a turncoat traitor i stood glaring he glanced up perhaps he saw me perhaps some bit of my rage and impacted sorrow reached him he held my gaze for only a moment his mouth wide as if he had just seen an old school chum but not remembering my name could not call out so let the moment pass he saw my rage his face paled his smile died he glanced quickly away he did not look up again but stood pretending to listen to miss quick who was laughing and talking with the other magicians i stared at him and stared again sweat oiled his face my hate melted my temper cooled i saw his profile clearly his chin eyes nose hairline i memorized it all then i heard someone say it was a fine show my wife moving forward shook the hand of the pickpocketing beast on the street i said well im satisfied about what asked my wife he doesnt look like me at all chins too sharp nose is smaller lower lip isnt full enough too much eyebrow onstage far oft had me going but close up no no it was the crew cut and hornrims fooled us anyone could have hornrims and a crew cut yes my wife agreed anyone as she climbed into our car i could not help but admire her long lovely legs driving off i thought i glimpsed that familiar face in the passing crowd the face however was watching me i wasnt sure resemblances i now knew are superficial the face vanished in the crowd ill never forget said my wife when his pantsfell i drove very fast then drove very slow all the way home dorian in excelsus good evening welcome i see you have my invitation in your hands decided to be brave did you fine here we are grab onto this the tall handsome stranger with the heavenly eyes and the impossibly blond hair handed me a wineglass clean your palate he said i took the glass and read the label on the bottle he held in his left hand bordeaux it read st emilion go on said my host its not poison may i sit and might you drink i might i sipped shut my eyes and smiled youre a connoisseur this is the best ive had in years but why this wine and why the invitation what am i doing here at grays anatomy bar and grill my host sat and filled his own glass i am doing a favor to myself this is a great night perhaps for both of us greater than christmas or halloween his lizard tongue darted into his wine to vanish back into his contentment we celebrate my being honored at last becoming he exhaled it all out becoming he said a friend to dorian dorians friend me ah i laughed that explains the name of this place then does dorian own grays anatomy more inspires and rules over it and deservedly so you make it sound as if being a friend to dorian is the most important thing in the world no in life in all of life he rocked back and forth drunk not from the wine but from some inner joy guess at what how old i am you look to be twentynine at the most twentynine what a lovely sound not thirty forty or fifty but i said i hope youre not going to ask what sign i was born under i usually leave when people ask that i was born on the cusp august i pretended to half rise he pressed a gentle hand to my lapel no no dear boyyou dont understand look here and here he touched under his eyes and then around his neck look for wrinkles but you have none i said how observant none and that is why i have become this very night a fresh new stunningly handsome friend to dorian i still dont see the connection look at the backs of my hands he showed his wrists no liver spots i am not turning to rust i repeat the question how old am i i swirled the wine in my glass and studied his reflection in the swirl sixty i guessed seventy good god he fell back in his chair astonished how did you know word association youve been rattling on about dorian i know my oscar wilde i know my dorian gray which means you sir have a portrait of yourself stashed in an attic aging while you yourself drinking old wine stay young no no the handsome stranger leaned forward not stayed young became young i was old very old and it took a year but the clock went back and after a year of playing at it i achieved what i set out for twentynine was your target how clever you are and once you became twentynine you were fully elected as a friend to dorian bullseye but there is no portrait no attic no staying young its becoming young agains the ticket im still puzzled child of my heart you might possibly be another friend come along before the greatest revelation let me show you the far end of the room and some doors he seized my hand bring your wine youll need it he hustled me along through the tables in a swiftly filling room of mostly middleaged and some fairly young men and a few smokeexhaling ladies i jogged along staring back at the exit as if my future life were there before us stood a golden door and behind the door i asked what always lies behind any golden door my host responded touch i reached out to print the door with my thumb what do you feel my host inquired youngness youth beauty i touched again all the springtimes that ever were or ever will be jeez the mans a poet push we pushed and the golden door swung soundlessly wide is this where dorian is no no only his students his disciples his almost friends feast your eyes i did as i was told and saw at the longest bar in the world a line of men a lineage of young men reflecting and rereflecting each other as in a fabled mirror maze that illusion seen where mirrors face each other and you find yourself repeated to infinity large small very small smallest gone the young men were all staring down the long bar at us and then as if unable to pull their gaze away at themselves you could almost hear their cries of appreciation and with each cry they grew younger and younger and more splendid and more beautiful i gazed upon a tapestry of beauty a golden phalanx freshly out of the elysian fields and hills the gates of mythology swung wide and apollo and his demiapollos glided forth each more beautiful than the last i must have gasped i heard my host inhale as if he drank my wine yes arent they he said come whispered my new friend run the gauntlet dont linger you may find tigertears on your sleeve and blood rising now and he glided he undulated me along on his soundless tuxedo slippers his fingers a pale touch on my elbow his breath a flower scent too near i heard myself say its been written that h g wells attracted women with his breath which smelled of honey then i learned that such breath comes with illness how clever do i smell of hospitals and medicines i didnt mean quickly youre rare meat in the zoo hup two three hold on i said breathless not from walking fast but from perceiving quickly this man and the next and the one after that yes my god i said theyre almost all the same lookalikes bullseye half true and the next and the next after that as far behind as we have gone as far ahead as we might go all twentynine years old all golden tan all six feet tall white of teeth bright of eye each different but beautiful like me i glanced at him and saw what i saw around me similar but different beauties so much youngness i was stunned isnt it time you told me your name dorian but you said you were his friend i am they are but we all share his name this chap here and the next oh once we had commoner names smith and jones harry and phil jimmy and jake but then we signed up to become friends is that why i was invited to sign up i saw you in a bar across town a year ago made queries a year later you look the proper age proper well arent you just leaving sixtynine arriving at seventy well my god are you happy being seventy itll do do wouldnt you like to be really happy steal some wild oats sow them that times over its not i asked and you came curious curious about what this he bared me his neck again and flexed his pale white wrists and all those he waved at the fine faces as we passed dorians sons dont you want to be gloriously wild and young like them how can i decide lord youve thought of it all night for years soon you could be part of this we had reached the far end of the line of men with bronzed faces white teeth and breath like h g wells scent of honey arent you tempted he pursued will you refuse immortality no to live the next twenty years die at ninety and look twentynine in the damn tomb in the mirror over therewhat do you see an old goat among ten dozen fauns yes where do i sign up i laughed do you accept no i need more facts damn heres the second door get in he swung wide a door more golden than the first shoved me followed and slammed the door i stared at darkness whats this i whispered dorians gym of course if you work out here all year hour by hour day by day you get younger thats some gym i observed trying to adjust my eyes to the dim areas beyond where shadows tumbled and voices rustled and whispered ive heard of gyms that help keep not make you young now tell me i read your mind for every old man that became young in there at the bar is there an attic portrait well is there no theres only dorian a single person who grows old for all of you touche behold his gym i gazed off into a vast high arena where a hundred shadows stirred and moaned like a tide on a terrible shore i think its time to leave i said nonsense come no one will see you theyre all busy i am moses said the sweet breath at my elbow and i hereby tell the red sea to part and we moved along a path between two tides each shadowed each more terrifying with its gasps its cries its slippages of flesh its slapping like waves its repeated whispers for more more ah god more i ran but my host grabbed on look right left now right again there must have been a hundred two hundred animals beasts no men wrestling leaping falling rolling in darkness it was a sea of flesh undulant a writhing of limbs on acres of tumbling mats a glistening of skin flashes of teeth where men climbed ropes spun on leather horses or flung themselves up crossbars to be seized down in the tidal flux of lamentations and muffled cries i stared across an ocean of rising and falling shapes my ears were scorched by their bestial moans what my god i exclaimed does it all mean there see and above the wild turbulence of flesh in a far wall was a great window forty feet wide and ten feet tall and behind that cold glass something watching savoring alert one vast stare and over all there was the suction of a great breath a vast inhalation which pulled at the gymnasium air with a constant hungry and invisible need as the shadows tumbled and writhed this inhalation tugged at them and the raw air in my nostrils somewhere a huge vacuum machine sucked in darkness but did not exhale there were long pauses as the shadows flailed and fell and then another savoring inhalation it swallowed breath in in always in devouring the sweaty air hungering the passions and the shadows were pulled i was pulled toward that vast glass eye that immense window behind which a shapeless something stared to dine on gymnasium airs dorian i guessed come meet him yes but i watched the wild convulsive shadows what are they doing go find out afraid cowards never live so he swung wide a third door and whether it was golden hot and alive i could not feel for suddenly i lurched into a hothouse as the door slammed and was locked by my blond young friend ready lord i must go home not until you meet said my host him he pointed at first i could see nothing the lights were dim and the place like the gymnasium was mostly shadow i smelled jungle greens the air stirred on my face with sensuous strokes i smelled papaya and mango and the wilted odor of orchids mixed with the salt smells of an unseen tide but the tide was there with that immense inhaled breathing that rose and was quiet and began again i see no one i said let your eyes adjust wait i waited i watched there were no chairs in the room for there was no need of chairs he did not sit he did not recline he prolonged himself on the largest bed in history the dimensions might easily have been fifteen feet by twenty it reminded me of the apartment of a writer i once knew who had completely covered his room with mattresses so that women stumbled on the sill and fell flat out on the springs so it was with this nest with dorian immense a gelatinous skin a vitreous shape undulant within that nest and if dorian was male or female i could not guess this was a great pudding an emperor jellyfish a monstrous heap of sexual gelatin from the exterior of which on occasion noxious gases escaped with rubbery sounds great lips sibilating that and the sough of that labored pump that constant inhalation were the only sounds within the chamber as i stood anxious alarmed but at last impressed by this beached creature cast up from a dark landfall the thing was a gelatinous cripple an octopus without limbs an amphibian stranded unable to undulate and seep back to an ocean sewer from which it had inched itself in monstrous waves and gusts of lungs and eruptions of corrupt gas until now it lay featureless with a mere xray ghost of legs arms wrists and hands with skeletal fingers at last i could discern at the far end of this flesh peninsula what seemed a halfflat face with a frail phantom of skull beneath an open fissure for an eye a ravenous nostril and a red wound which ripped wide to surprise me as a mouth and at last this thing this dorian spoke or whispered or lisped and with each lisp each sibilance an odor of decay was expelled as if from a vast nightswamp balloon sunk on its side lost in fetid water as its unsavory breath rinsed my cheeks it expelled but one lingering syllable yessss yes what and then it added soooo how long how long i murmured has it has he been here no one knows when victoria was queen when booth emptied his makeup kit to load his pistol when napoleon yellowstained the moscow snows forevers not bad what else i swallowed hard is is he dorian dorian of the attic he of the portrait and somewhere along the line found portraits not enough oil canvas no depth the world needed something that could soak in sponge the midnight rains breakfast and lunch on loss depravitys guilt something to truly take in drink digest a pustule imperial intestine a rheum oesophagus for sin a laboratory plate to take bacterial snows dorian the long archipelago of membranous skin flushed some buried tubes and valves and a semblance of laughter was throttled and drowned in the aqueous gels a slit widened to emit gas and again the single word yessss hes welcoming you my host smiled i know i know i said impatiently but why i dont even want to be here im ill why cant we go becausemy host laughedyou were selected selected weve had our eye on you you mean youve watched followed spied on me christ who gave you permission temper temper not everyone is picked who said i wanted to be picked if you could see yourself as we see you youd know why i turned to stare at the vast mound of priapic gelatin in which faint creeks gleamed as the creature wept its lids wide in holes to let it stare then all its apertures sealed the sabercut mouth the slitted nostrils the cold eyes gummed shut so that its skin was faceless the sibilance pumped with gaseous suctions yessss it whispered lisssst it murmured and list it is my host pulled forth a small computer pad which he tapped to screen my name address and phone he glanced from the pad to reel off such items as wilted me single he said married and divorced now single no women in your life im walking wounded he tapped his pad visiting strange bars i hadnt noticed creative blindness getting to bed late sleeping all day drinking heavily three nights a week twice going to the gym look every day workouts excessive prolonged steam baths overlong massages sudden interest in sports endless basketball soccer tennis matches every night and half the noons thats hyperventilation my business and ours youre balanced giddily on the rim shove all these facts in that onearmed bandit in your head yank and watch the lemons and ripe cherries spin yank jesus god yes bars drinks late nights gyms saunas masseurs basketball tennis soccer yank pull spin well my host searched my face amused three jackpot cherries in a row i shuddered circumstance no court would convict me this court elects you we tell palms to read ravenous groins yes gas steamed up from one shriveled aperture in the restless mound yessss they say that men in the grip of passion blind to their own darkness make love and run mad stunned by guilt they find themselves beasts having done the very thing they were warned not to do by church town parents life in explosive outrage they turn to the sinful lure seeing her as unholy provocateur they kill women in similar rages and guilts overdose eve lies selfslain in the garden adam hangs himself with the snake as noose but here was no passionate crime no woman no provocateur only the great mound of siphoning breath and my blond host and only words which riddled me with fusillades of arrows like an oriental hedgehog bristled with shafts my body exploded with no no no echoed and then real no yessss whispered the vapor from the mounded tissue the skeleton buried in ancient soups yessss i gasped to see my games steams midnight bars latedawn beds a maniac sum i rounded dark corridors to confront a stranger so pockmarked creased and oiled by passion so cobwebbed and smashed by drink that i tried to avert my gaze the terror gaped his mouth and reached for my hand stupidly i reached to shake his andrapped glass a mirror i stared deep into my own life i had seen myself in shop windows dim undersea men running in creeks mornings shaving i saw my mirrored health but this this troglodyte trapped in amber myself snapshotted like ten dozen sexual acrobats and who jammed this mirror at me my beautiful host and that corrupt flatulence beyond you are selected they whispered i refuse i shrieked and whether i shrieked aloud or merely thought a great furnace gaped the oceanic mound erupted thunders of gaseous streams my beautiful host fell back stunned that their search beneath my skin behind my mask had brought revulsion always when dorian cried friend raw gymnast teams had mobbed to catapult that armless legless featureless sargasso sea before they had smothered to drown in his miasma to arise embrace and wrestle in the dark gymnasium then run forth young to assault a world and i what had i dared to do that quaked that membranous sac into regurgitated whistling and broken winds idiot cried my host all teeth and fists out out out i cried spun to obey and tripped i do not clearly know what happened as i fell and if it was a swift reaction to the holocaust erupted like vile spit and vomit from that putrescent mound i cannot say i knew no lightning shock of murder yet knew perhaps some summer heat flash of revenge for what i thought what are you to dorian or he to you that frees the hydra behind your face or causes the slightest twitch of leg arm hand or fingernail as the last fetid air from dorian burned my hair and stuffed my nostrils it was over in a second something shoved me did my secret self insulted give that push i was flung as if on wires knocked to sprawl at dorian he gave two terrible cries one of warning one of despair i was recovered so in landing i did not sink my hands deep in that poisonous yeast into that multiflorid man of war jelly i swear that i touched raked scarified him with only one thing the smallest fingernail of my right hand my fingernail and so this dorian was shot and foundered and so the mammoth with screams collapsed and so the nauseous balloon sank fold on midnight fold upon its own boneless sell fissuring volcanic sulfurs immense rectal airs outgassed whistles and whimpers of selfpitying despair christ what have you done murderer damn you cried my host riven to stare at dorians exhaustions unto death he whirled to strike but ran to reach the door and cry lock this lock whatever happens for gods sake dont open now the door slammed i ran to lock it and turn quietly dorian was falling away he sank down and down out of sight like a great membranous tent with its poles removed he vanished into the floor down flues and vents on all sides of his great platform nest vents obviously created for such a massive diseasesac melting into viral fluid and sewer gas even as i watched the last of the noxious clot was sucked into the vents and i stood abandoned in a room where but a few minutes before an unspeakable strata of discards and halfborn fetuses had lain sucking at sins spoiled bones and souls to send forth beasts in semblance of beauty that perverse royalty that lunatic monarch gone all gone a last choke and throttle from the sewer vent underlined its death my god i thought even now that all that that terrible miasma that stuff is on its way to the sea to wash in with bland tides to lie on clean shores where bathers come at dawn even now i stood eyes shut waiting for what there had to be a next thing yes it came there was a trembling shivering and then a quaking of the wall but especially the golden door behind me i spun to see as well as hear i saw the door shaken and then bombarded from the other side fists pummeled struck hammered voices cried out and screamed and then shrieked i felt a great mass ram the door to shiver to slam it on its hinges i stared fearful that the door might explode and let in the flood tide of nightmareravening terrified beasts the kennel of dying things for now their shrieks as they mauled and rattled to escape to beg for mercy were so terrible that i clamped my fists to my ears dorian was gone but they remained shrieks screams screams shrieks an avalanche of limbs beyond the door struck and fell yammering what must they look like now i thought all those bouquets all those beauties the police will come i thought soon but no matter what i would not unlock that door no news or what killed the dog it was a day of holocausts cataclysms tornadoes earthquakes blackouts mass murders eruptions and miscellaneous dooms at the peak of which the sun swallowed the earth and the stars vanished but to put it simply the most respected member of the bentley family up and died dog was his name and dog he was the bentleys arising late saturday morning found dog stretched on the kitchen floor his head toward mecca his paws neatly folded his tail not athump but silent for the first time in twenty years twenty years my god everyone thought could it really have been that long and now without permission dog was cold and gone susan the younger daughter woke everyone yelling somethings wrong with dog quick without bothering to don his bathrobe roger bentley in his underwear hurried out to look at that quiet beast on the kitchen tiles his wife ruth followed and then their son skip twelve the rest of the family married and flown rodney and sal would arrive later each in turn would say the same thing no dog was forever dog said nothing but lay there like world war ii freshly finished and a devastation tears poured down susans cheeks then down ruth bentleys followed in good order by tears from father and at last when it had sunk in skip instinctively they made a ring around dog kneeling to the floor to touch him as if this might suddenly make him sit up smile as he always did at his food bark and beat them to the door but their touching did nothing but increase their tears but at last they rose hugged each other and went blindly in search of breakfast in the midst of which ruth bentley said stunned we cant just leave him there roger bentley picked dog up gently and moved him out on the patio in the shade by the pool what do we do next i dont know said roger bentley this is the first death in the family in years and he stopped snorted and shook his head i mean you meant exactly what you said said ruth bentley if dog wasnt family he was nothing god i loved him a fresh burst of tears ensued during which roger bentley brought a blanket to put over dog but susan stopped him no no want to see him i wont be able to see him ever again hes so beautiful hes so old they all carried their breakfasts out on the patio to sit around dog somehow feeling they couldnt ignore him by eating inside roger bentley telephoned his other children whose response after the first tears was the same theyd be right over wait when the other children arrived first rodney twentyone and then the older daughter sal twentyfour a fresh storm of grief shook everyone and then they sat silently for a moment watching dog for a miracle what are your plans asked rodney at last i know this is silly said roger bentley after an embarrassed pause after all hes only a dog only cried everyone instantly roger had to back off look he deserves the taj mahal what hell get is the orion pet cemetery over in burbank pet cemetery cried everyone but each in a different way my god said rodney thats silly whats so silly about it skips face reddened and his lip trembled dog why dog was a pearl of rare price yeah added susan well pardon me roger bentley turned away to look at the pool the bushes the sky i suppose i could call those trash people who pick up dead bodies trash people exclaimed ruth bentley dead bodies said susan dog isnt a dead body what is he then asked skip bleakly they all stared at dog lying quietly there by the pool hes blurted susan at last hes hes my love before the crying could start again roger bentley picked up the patio telephone dialed the pet cemetery talked and put the phone down two hundred dollars he informed everyone not bad for dog said skip not enough are you really serious about this asked ruth bentley yeah said roger ive made fun of those places all my life but now seeing as how well never be able to visit dog again he let a moment pass theyll come take dog at noon services tomorrow services snorting rodney stalked to the rim of the pool and waved his arms you wont get me to that everyone stared rodney turned at last and let his shoulders slump hell ill be there dog would never forgive you if you didnt susan snuffed and wiped her nose but roger bentley had heard none of this staring at dog then his family and up to the sky he shut his eyes and exhaled a great whisper oh my god he said eyes shut do you realize that this is the first terrible thing thats happened to our family have we ever been sick gone to the hospital been in an accident he waited no said everyone gosh said skip gosh indeed you sure as hell notice accidents sickness hospitals maybe said susan and had to stop and wait because her voice broke maybe dog died just to make us notice how lucky we are lucky roger bentley opened his eyes and turned yes you know what we are the science fiction generation offered rodney lighting a cigarette casually what you rave on about that your school lectures or during dinner can openers science fiction automobiles radio tv films everything so science fiction well dammit they are cried roger bentley and went to stare at dog as if the answers were there amongst the last departing fleas hell not so long ago there were no cars can openers tv someone had to dream them start of lecture someone had to build them midlecture so science fiction dreams became finished science fact lecture finis i bet rodney applauded politely roger bentley could only sink under the weight of his sons irony to stroke the dear dead beast sorry dog bit me cant help myself thousands of years all we did is die now that times over in sum science fiction bull rodney laughed stop reading that junk dad junk roger touched dogs muzzle sure but how about lister pasteur salk hated death jumped to stop it thats all science fiction was ever about hating the way things are wanting to make things different junk ancient history pop ancient roger bentley fixed his son with a terrible eye christ when i was born in if you wanted to visit your family on sundays you went to the graveyard said rodney yes my brother and sister died when i was seven half of my family gone tell me dear children how many of your friends died while you were growing up in grammar school high school he included the family in his gaze and waited none said rodney at last none you hear that none christ six of my best friends died by the time i was ten wait i just remembered roger bentley hurried to rummage in a hall closet and brought out an old rpm record into the sunlight blowing off the dust he squinted at the label no news or what killed the dog everyone came to look at the ancient disc hey how old is that heard it a hundred times when i was a kid in the twenties said roger no news or what killed the dog sal glanced at her fathers face this gets played at dogs funeral he said youre not serious said ruth bentley just then the doorbell rang that cant be the pet cemetery people come to take dog no cried susan not so soon instinctively the family formed a wall between dog and the doorbell sound holding off eternity then they cried one more time the strange and wonderful thing about the funeral was how many people came i didnt know dog had so many friends susan blubbered he freeloaded all around town said rodney speak kindly of the dead well he did dammit otherwise why is bill johnson here or gert skall or jim across the street dog said roger bentley i sure wish you could see this he does susans eyes welled over wherever he is good old sue whispered rodney who cries at telephone books shut up cried susan hush both of you and roger bentley moved eyes down toward the front of the small funeral parlor where dog was laid out head on paws in a box that was neither too rich nor too simple but just right roger bentley placed a steel needle down on the black record which turned on top of a flakepainted portable phonograph the needle scratched and hissed all the neighbors leaned forward no funeral oration said roger quickly just this and a voice spoke on a day long ago and told a story about a man who returned from vacation to ask friends what had happened while he was gone it seemed that nothing whatsoever had happened oh just one thing everyone wondered what had killed the dog the dog asked the vacationer my dog died yes and maybe it was the burned horseflesh did it burned horseflesh cried the vacationer well said his informant when the barn burned the horseflesh caught fire so the dog ate the burned horseflesh died the barn cried the vacationer how did it catch fire well sparks from the house blew over torched the barn burned the horseflesh dog ate them died sparks from the house shouted the vacationer how it was the curtains in the house caught fire curtains burned from the candles around the coffin coffin your aunts funeral coffin candles there caught the curtains house burned sparks from the house flew over burned down the barn dog ate the burned horsefleshin sum no news or what killed the dog the record hissed and stopped in the silence there was a little quiet laughter even though the record had been about dogs and people dying now do we get the lecture said rodney no a sermon roger bentley put his hands on the pulpit to stare for long moments at notes he hadnt made i dont know if were here for dog or ourselves both i suppose were the nothingeverhappenedtous people today is a first not that i want a rush of doom or disease god forbid death come slowly please he turned the phonograph record round and round in his hands trying to read the words under the grooves no news except the aunts funeral candles catch the curtains sparks fly and the dog goes west in our lives just the opposite no news for years good livers healthy hearts good times sowhats it all about roger bentley glanced at rodney who was checking his wristwatch someday we must die also roger bentley hurried on hard to believe were spoiled but susan was right dog died to tell us this gently and we must believe and at the same time celebrate what the fact that were the start of an amazing dumbfounding history of survival that will only get better as the centuries pass you may argue that the next war will take us all maybe i can only say i think you will grow to be old very old people ninety years from now most people will have cured hearts stopped cancers and jumped life cycles a lot of sadness will have gone out of the world thank god will this be easy to do no will we do it yes not in all countries right off but finally in most as i said yesterday fifty years ago if you wanted to visit your aunts uncles grandparents brothers sisters the graveyard was it death was all the talk you had to talk it times up rodney rodney signaled his father he had one last minute roger bentley wound it down sure kids still die but not millions old folks wind up in sun city instead of marble orchard the father surveyed his family brighteyed in the pews god look at you then look back a thousand centuries of absolute terror absolute grief how parents stayed sane to raise their kids when half of them died damned if i know yet with broken hearts they did while millions died of flu or the plague so here we are in a new time that we cant see because we stand in the eye of the hurricane where everythings calm ill shut up now with a last word for dog because we loved him weve done this almost silly thing this service but now suddenly were not ashamed or sorry we bought him a plot or had me speak we may never come visit him who can say but he has a place dog old boy bless you now everyone blow your nose everyone blew his nose dad said rodney suddenly couldwe hear the record again everyone looked at rodney surprised just said roger bentley what i was going to suggest he put the needle on the record it hissed about a minute in when the sparks from the house flew over to burn the barn and torch the horseflesh and kill the dog there was a sound at the back doorway to the small parlor everyone turned a strange man stood in the door holding a small wicker basket from which came familiar small yapping sounds and even as the flames from the candles around the coffin caught the curtains and the last sparks blew on the wind the whole family drawn out into the sunlight gathered around the stranger with the wicker basket waiting for father to arrive to throw back the coverlet on the small carrier so they could all dip their hands in that moment as susan said later was like reading the telephone book one more time the witch doctor it was a pounding on a door a furious frantic insistent pounding born of hysteria and fear and a great desire to be heard to be freed to be let loose to escape it was a wrenching at hidden paneling it was a hollow knocking a rapping a testing a clawing it was a scratching at hollow boards a ripping at bedded nails it was a muffled closet shouting and demanding far away and a call to be noticed followed by a silence the silence was the most empty and terrible of all robert and martha webb sat up in bed did you hear it yes again downstairs now whoever it was who had pounded and rapped and made his fingers raw drawn blood with his fever and quest to be free had drawn into silence listening himself to see if his terror and drumming had summoned any help the winter night lay through the house with a fallingsnow silence silence snowing into every room drifting over tables and floors and banking up the stairwell then the pounding started again and then a sound of soft crying downstairs someone in the house lotte do you think the front doors unlocked shed have knocked cant be lotte shes the only one it could be she phoned they both glanced at the phone if you lifted the receiver you heard a winter stillness the phones were dead they had died days ago with the riots in the nearest towns and cities now in the receiver you heard only your own heartbeat can you put me up lone had cried from six hundred miles away just overnight but before they could answer her the phone had filled itself with long miles of silence lotte is coming she sounded hysterical that might be her said martha webb no said robert i heard that crying other nights too dear god they lay in the cold room in this farmhouse back in the massachusetts wilderness back from the main roads away from the towns near a bleak river and a black forest it was the frozen middle of december the white smell of snow cut the air they arose with an oil lamp lit they sat on the edge of the bed as if dangling their legs over a precipice theres no one downstairs there cant be whoever it is sounds frightened were all frightened damn it thats why we came out here to be away from cities riots all that damned foolishness no more wiretaps arrests taxes neurotics now when we find it at last people call and upset us and tonight this christ he glanced at his wife you afraid i dont know i dont believe in ghosts this is im sane or like to think i am wheres your gun we wont need it dont ask me why but we wont they picked up their oil lamps in another month the small power plant would be finished in the white barns behind the house and thered be power to spare but now they haunted the farm coming and going with dim lamps or candles they stood at the stairwell both thirtythree both immensely practical the crying the sadness and the plea came from below in the winter rooms she sounds so damned sad said robert god im sorry for her but dont even know who it is come on they went downstairs as if hearing their footsteps the crying grew louder there was a dull thudding against a hidden panel somewhere the witch door said martha webb at last cant be is they stood in the long hall looking at that place under the stairs where the panels trembled faintly but now the cries faded as if the crier was exhausted or something had diverted her or perhaps their voices had startled her and she was listening for them to speak again now the winternight house was silent and the man and wife waited with the oil lamps quietly fuming in their hands robert webb stepped to the witch door and touched it probing for the hidden button the secret spring there cant be anyone in there he said my god weve been here six months and thats just a cubby isnt that what the realtor said when he sold the place no one could hide in there and us not know it we listen they listened nothing shes gone its gone whatever it was hell that door hasnt been opened in our lifetime everyones forgotten where the spring is that unlocks it i dont think there is a door only a loose panel and rats nests thats all the walls scratching why not he turned to look at his wife who was staring at the hidden place silly she said good lord rats dont cry that was a voice asking to be saved lotte i thought but now i know it wasnt she but someone else in as much trouble martha webb reached out and trembled her fingertips along the beveled edge of ancient maple cant we open it with a crowbar and hammer tomorrow oh robert dont oh robert me im tired you cant leave her in there to shes quiet now christ im exhausted ill come down at the crack of dawn and knock the damned thing apart okay all right she said and tears came to her eyes women said robert webb oh my god you and lotte lotte and you if she is coming here if she makes it ill have a houseful of lunatics lottes fine sure but she should keep her mouth shut it doesnt pay now to say youre socialist democrat libertarian prolife abortionist sinn fein fascist commie any damn thing the towns are bombed out people are looking for scapegoats and lotte has to shoot from the hip get herself smeared and now hell on the run theyll jail her if they catch her or kill her yes kill her were lucky to be here with our own food thank god we planned ahead we saw it coming the starvation the massacres we helped ourselves now we help lone if she makes it through without answering he turned to the stairs im dead on my feet im tired of saving anyone even lotte but hell if she comes through the front door shes saved they went up the stairs taking the lamps advancing in an evermoving aura of trembling white glow the house was as silent as snow falling god he whispered damn i dont like women crying like that it sounded like the whole world crying he thought the whole world dying and needing help and lonely but what can you do live in a farm like this far off the main highway where people dont pass away from all the stupidity and death what can you do they left one of the lamps lit and drew the covers over their bodies and lay listening to the wind hit the house and creak the beams and parquetry a moment later there was a cry from downstairs a splintering crash the sound of a door flung wide a bursting out of air footsteps rapping all the rooms a sobbing almost an exultation then the front door banged open the winter wind blowing wildly in footsteps across the front porch and gone there cried martha yes with the lamp they were down the stairs swiftly wind smothered their faces as they turned now toward the witch door opened wide still on its hinges then toward the front door where they cast their light out upon a snowing winter darkness and saw nothing but white and hills no moon and in the lamplight the soft drift and mothflicker of snowflakes falling from the sky to the mattressed yard gone she whispered who well never know unless she comes back she wont look they moved the lamplight toward the white earth and the tiny footprints going off across the softness toward the dark forest it was a woman then but why god knows why anything now in this crazy world they stood looking at the footprints a long while until shivering they moved back through the hall to the open witch door they poked the lamp into this hollow under the stairs lord its just a cell hardly a closet and look inside stood a small rocking chair a braided rug a used candle in a copper holder and an old worn bible the place smelled of must and moss and dead flowers is this where they used to hide people yes a long time back they hid people called witches trials witch trials they hung or burned some yes yes they both murmured staring into the incredibly small cell and the witches hid here while the hunters searched the house and gave up and left yes oh my god yes he whispered rob yes she bent forward her face was pale and she could not look away from the small worn rocking chair and the faded bible rob how old this house how old maybe three hundred years that old why crazy stupid crazy houses old like this all the years and more years and more after that god feel if you put your hand in yes would you feel it change silly and what if i sat in that rocking chair and shut the door what that woman how long was she in there howd she get there from way way back wouldnt it be strange bull but if you wanted to run away badly enough wished for it prayed for it and people ran after you and someone hid you in a place like this a witch behind a door and heard the searchers run through the house closer and closer wouldnt you want to get away anywhere to another place why not another time and then in a house like this a house so old nobody knows if you wanted and asked for it enough couldnt you run to another year maybeshe pausedhere no no he muttered really stupid but still some quiet motion within the closeted space caused both at almost the same instant to hold their hands out on the air curious like people testing invisible waters the air seemed to move one way and then another now warm now cold with a pulsation of light and a sudden turning toward dark all this they thought but could not say there was weather here now a quick touch of summer and then a winter cold which could not be of course but there it was passing along their fingertips but unseen by their eyes a stream of shadows and sun ran as invisible as time itself clear as crystal but clouded by a shifting dark both felt if they thrust their hands deep they might be drawn in to drown in a mighty storm of seasons within an incredibly small space all this too they thought or almost felt but could not say they seized their frozen but sunburned hands back to stare down and hold them against the panic in their breasts damn whispered robert webb oh damn he backed off and went to open the front door again and look at the snowing night where the footprints had almost vanished no he said no no just then the yellow flash of headlights on the road braked in front of the house lotte cried martha webb it must be lotte the car lights went out they ran to meet the running woman half up the front yard lotte the woman wildeyed hair windblown threw herself at them martha bob god i thought id never find you lost im being followed lets get inside oh i didnt mean to get you up in the middle of the night its good to see you jesus hide the car here are the keys robert webb ran to drive the car behind the house when he came back around he saw that the heavy snowfall was already covering the tracks then the three of them were inside the house talking holding onto each other robert webb kept glancing at the front door i cant thank you cried lotte huddled in a chair youre at risk i wont stay long a few hours until its safe then stay as long as you want no theyll follow in the cities the fires the murders everyone starving i stole gas do you have more enough to get me to phil merdiths in greenborough i lotte said robert webb yes lotte stopped breathless did you see anyone on your way up here a woman running on the road what i drove so fast a woman yes i almost hit her then she was gone why well shes not dangerous no no it is all right my being here yes fine fine sit back well fix some coffee wait ill check and before they could stop her lotte ran to the front door opened it a crack and peered out they stood with her and saw distant headlights flourished over a low hill and gone into a valley theyre coming whispered lotte they might search here god where can i hide martha and robert glanced at each other no no thought robert webb god no preposterous unimaginable fantastic so damned coincidental the mind raves at it crows hoots guffaws no none of this get oft circumstance get away with your goings and comings on not neat or too neat schedules come back lotte in ten years five years maybe a year a month a week and ask to hide even tomorrow show up but dont come with coincidence in each hand like idiot children and ask only half an hour after one terror one miracle to test our disbelief im not after all charles dickens to blink and let this pass whats wrong said lotte i said robert no place to hide me yes he said weve a place well here he turned slowly away stunned they walked down the hall to the halfopen paneling this lotte said secret did you no its been here since the house was built long ago lotte touched and moved the door on its hinges does it work will they know where to look and find it no its beautifully made shut you cant tell its there outside in the winter night cars rushed their beams flashing up the road across the house windows lotte peered into the witch door as one peers down a deep lonely well a filtering of dust moved about her the small rocking chair trembled moving in silently lotte touched the halfburned candle why its still warm martha and robert said nothing they held to the witch door smelling the odor of warm tallow lotte stood rigidly in the little space bowing her head beneath the beamed ceiling a horn blew in the snowing night lotte took a deep breath and said shut the door they shut the witch door there was no way to tell that a door was there they blew out the lamp and stood in the cold dark house waiting the cars rushed down the road their noise loud and their yellow headlights bright in the falling snow the wind stirred the footprints in the yard one pair going out another coming in and the tracks of lottes car fast vanishing and at last gone thank god whispered martha the cars honking whipped around the last bend and down the hill and stopped waiting looking in at the dark house then at last they started up away into the snow and the hills soon their lights were gone and their sound gone with them we were lucky said robert webb but shes not she that woman whoever she was ran out of here theyll find here somebodyll find her christ thats right and she has no id no proof of herself and she doesnt know whats happened to her and when she tells them who she is and where she came from yes yes god help her they looked into the snowing night but saw nothing everything was still you cant escape she said no matter what you do no one can escape they moved away from the window and down the hall to the witch door and touched it lotte they called the witch door did not tremble or move lotte you can come out now there was no answer not a breath or a whisper robert tapped the door hey in there lotte he knocked at the paneling his mouth agitated lotte open it im trying damn it lotte well get you out wait everythings all right he beat with both fists cursing then he said watch out took a step back raised his leg kicked once twice three times vicious kicks at the paneling that crunched holes and crumbled wood into kindling he reached in and yanked the entire paneling free lotte they leaned together into the small place under the stairs the candle flickered on the small table the bible was gone the small rocking chair moved quietly back and forth in little arcs and then stood still lotte they stared at the empty room the candle flickered lotte they said you dont believe i dont know old houses are old old you think lotte she i dont know i dont know then shes safe at least safe thank god safe wheres she gone you really think that a woman in new clothes red lipstick high heels short skirt perfume plucked brows diamond rings silk stockings safe safe he said staring deep into the open frame of the witch door yes safe why not he drew a deep breath a woman of that description lost in a town called salem in the year he reached over and shut the witch door they sat waiting by it for the rest of the long cold night the ghost in the machine the talk in the village in the year was of course about the madman above in his sodandbrick hut with an untended garden and a wife who had fled silent about his madness never to return the people of the village had never drunk enough courage to go see what the special madness was or why the wife had vanished tearstained leaving a vacuum into which atmospheres had rushed to thunderclap and yet on a sweltering hot day with no cloud to offer shadow comfort and no threat of rain to cool man or beast the searcher arrived which is to say dr mortimer goff a man of many parts most of them curious and selfserving but also traveling the world for some baroque event or miraculous revelation the good doctor came tramping up the hill stumbling over cobbles that were more stone than paving having abandoned his coachandhorses fearful of crippling them with such a climb dr goff it turned out had come from london inhaling fogs bombarded by storms and now stunned by too much light and heat this good if curious physician stopped exhausted to lean against a fence sight further up the hill and ask is this the way to the lunatic a farmer who was more scarecrow than human raised his eyebrows and snorted that would be elijah wetherby if lunatics have names yes we call him crazed or mad but lunatic will do it sounds like book learning are you one of those i own books yes and chemical retorts and a skeleton that was once a man and a permanent pass to the london historical and scientific museum all well and good the farmer interrupted but of no use for failed crops and a dead wife follow your nose and when you find the fool or whatever you name him take him with you were tired of his shouts and commotions late nights in his iron foundry and anvil menagerie rumor says he will soon finish some monster that will run to kill us all is that true asked dr goff no it lies easy on my tongue good day doctor and god deliver you from the lightning bolts that wait for you above with this the farmer spaded the earth to bury the conversation so the curious doctor threatened climbed on under a dark cloud which did not stop the sun and at last arrived at a hut that seemed more tomb than home surrounded by land more graveyard than garden outside the ramshackle sodandbrick dwelling a shadow stepped forth as if waiting and became an old very old man well there you are at last it cried dr goff reared back at this you sound sir as if you expected me i did said the old man some years ago what took you so long you are not exactly cheek by jowl with london sir i am not the old man agreed and added the name is wetherby the inventor mr wetherby the inventor i am dr goff the socalled searcher for i move in behalf of our good queen turning rocks digging truffles curious for stuffs that might delight her majesty or fill her museums shops and streets in the greatest city in the world have i reached the right place and just in time for i am now in my eightieth year and of inconsequential vigor if you had arrived next year you might have found me in the churchyard do come in at this moment dr goff heard a gathering of people behind him all with a most unpleasant muttering so at mr wetherbys beckoning he was glad to enter sit and watch an almost rare whiskey being poured without invitation when he had quaffed the glass dr goff swiveled his gaze about the room well where is it where is what sir the lunatic device the insane machine that goes nowhere but in going might run down a child a lamb a priest a nun or an old blind dog where so i am that famous am i the old man let a few crumbs of laughter fall from his toothless mouth well sir i keep it locked in the goats shed behind the outhouse of machines finish that to strengthen your sanity when you at last behold the delight and grievance of my long inventive life so the doctor drank was replenished and soon out the door across a small smooth circle of turf and to a shed whose door was triplekept with numerous padlocks and keys old wetherby entered lit many candles and beckoned the good doctor in he pointed as to a manger the medical searcher looked expecting a mother crib and holy babe by the way wetherby gestured and cried there she be is it female then come to think she is and there in the candlelight was wetherbys mechanical pride dr goff coughed to hide his chagrin that sir is but a metal frame but what a frame to hold velocities ha and the old man young with fevers rushed to seize a largish wheel which he transported to fit to the front part of the frame then he fetched yet another circular object to fit into the frames rear well he cried i see two wheels half a cart and no horse we will shoot all horses exclaimed wetherby my invention by the tens of thousands will shy off all horses and banish manures do you know each day in london a thousand tons of horse clods must be cleared fertilizer wasted not spread on neighbor fields but dumped as sludge downthames god how i talk but sir continue those look to be spinning wheels borrowed from nearby farms they are but spliced and strengthened with metal to sustain wetherby touched himself one hundred twenty pounds and heres the saddle for that weight whereupon he fitted a saddle midframe and here the stirrups and ribbon to run the back wheel so saying he affixed a longish leather ribbon to one stirrups rotary and tightened it on a spool at the rear do you begin to perceive doctor i am stranded in ignorance sir well then be alert for i now enthrone myself and the old man light as a chimpanzee slung himself in place on a leather seat midframe between the silent spinning wheels i still see no horse sir i am the horse doctor i am the horse agallop and the old man thrust his feet in the stirrups to chum them up around and down up around and down as the rear wheels provoked did likewise up down around with a lovely hum fastened in place on the platform planks aha the doctors face brightened this is a device to manufacture electrical power something from benjamin franklins stormlightning notebooks gods no it could make lightnings yes but this sir not seeming one is a horse and i its night rider so and wetherby pumped and wheezed wheezed and pumped and the rear wheels locked in place spun faster faster with a siren whine all very well snorted the good doctor but the horse if it is and the rider if you are seem to be going nowhere what will you call your machine i have had many nights and years to think wetherby pumped and wheezed the velocitor perhaps pumpwheeze or the precipitor but no that sounds as if i might be thrown from my horse the galvanizer yes or why not wheezepump the landstride or diminisher for wheezepump it does diminish time and distance doctor you know latin eh so feet to wheel wheel run by feet name it the elijah your given name sir the elijah but he saw a wheel way in the middle of the air and it was a wheel in a wheel is that not so when last i was in church yes and you are grounded that is plain to see why not velocipede then having to do with speed and the applied toe and ankle closeon dr goff closeon why do you stare so fixedly it comes to mind that great times call forth great inventions the inventor is child to his year and day this is not a great time for such as you and yours did this century call you forth as its mightiest of all men of genius old wetherby let his machine coast for a moment and smiled no i and my tilda here i call her tilda will instead be the gravity that calls forth the century we will influence the year the decade and the millennium it is hard for me to believe said the medical gentleman that you will build a road from your sill to the city on which to glide your notinconsiderable dream nay doctor the reverse is true the city and the world when they know me and this will run a concourse here to deliver me to fame your head knocks heaven mr wetherby said the doctor dryly but your roots ache for sustenance water minerals air you stroke and pump wildly but go nowhere once off that rack will you not fall on your side destroyed nay nay wetherby in gusts pumped again for i have discovered some physics as yet nameless the faster you propel this bodily device the less tendency to fall left or right but continue straight if no obstacles prevent with only two wheels beneath prove it release your invention set it free in flight let us see you sustain your forward motion without breaking your bum oh god shut up cried wetherby as his kindling legs thrashed the pedals racketing round as he leaned into a phantom wind eyes clenched against an invisible storm and churned the wheels to a frenzy dont you hear listen that whine that cry that whisper the ghost in the machine which promises things most new unseen unrealized only a dream now but tomorrow great god dont you see if i were on a real path this would be swifter than gazelles a panic of deer all pedestrians vanquished all coachandhorses in dust not twenty miles a day but thirty forty miles in a single glorious hour stand off time beware meadowbeasts here glides in full plummet wetherby with nothing to stop him aye said the searcher dryly you pump up a storm on that stand but set free how would you balance on only two wheels like this cried wetherby and with a thrust of his hands and an uplift of frame seized the traveler the motion machine the pathfinder up free of its stand and in an instant plunged through the room and out the door with dr goff in full pursuit yelling stop youll kill yourself no exhilarate my heart oxygenate my blood cried wetherby and there he was in a chickenyard he had trampled flat paths some sixty feet around on which he now flailed his metal machine with scythings of ankle toe heel and leg sucking air gusting out great laughs see i do not fall two legs two wheels and presto my god cried dr goff eyes thrust forth like hardboiled eggs gods truth how so i fly forward faster than i fall downward an unguessed law of physics but lo i almost fly fly goodbye horses doomed and dead and with dead he was overcome with such a delirium of pant and pump perspiration raining off him in showers that with a great cry he wobbled and was flung a meteor of flesh over and down on a coop where the chickens in dumb featherduster alarms exploded in shrieks as wetherby slid in one direction while his vehicle selfmotivated wheels aspin mounted dr goff who jumped aside fearful of being spliced wetherby helped to his feet protested his trajectory ignore that do you at last understand fractures wounds broken skulls yes no a future brave with motion tween my legs you have come a long way doctor will you adopt and further my machine well said the doctor already out of the yard into the house and to the front door his face confused his wits a patch of nettles ah he said say you will doctor or my device dies and i with it but said the doctor and opened the outer door only to draw back alarmed what have i done he cried peering over his shoulder wetherby expressed further alarm your presence is known doctor the word has spread a lunatic has come to visit a lunatic and it was true on the road and in the front garden yard were some twelve or twenty farmers and villagers some with rocks some with clubs and with looks of malice or outright hostility caught in their eyes and mouths there they are someone cried have you come to take him away someone else shouted yah echoed the struggling crowd moving forward thinking quickly dr goff replied yes i will take him away and turned back to the old man take me where doctor whispered wetherby clutching his elbow one moment cried the doctor to the crowd which then subsided in murmurs let me think standing back cudgeling his bald spot and then massaging his brow for rampant inspiration dr goff at last exhaled in triumph i have it by george a genius of an idea which will please both villagers to be rid of you and you to be rid of them what what doctor why sir you are to come down to london under cover of night and i will let you through the side door of my museum with your blasphemous toy of satan to what purpose purpose why sir i have found the path the smooth surface the road you spoke of at some future time the road the path the surface the museum floors marble smooth lovely wondrous ohmigod for all your needs needs dont be thick each night as many nights as you wish to your hearts content you can ride that wheeled demon round and round past the rembrandts and turners and fra angelicos through the grecian statues and roman busts careful of porcelains minding the crystals but pumping away like lucifer all night till dawn oh dear god murmured wetherby why didnt i think if you had you wouldve been too shy to ask the only place in the world with roads like future roads paths like tomorrows paths boulevards without cobbles pure as aphrodites cheeks smooth as apollos rump and here wetherby unlocked his eyes to let fall tears pent up for months and long hilltop years dont cry said dr goff i must with joy or burst do you mean it my good man heres my hand they shook and the shaking let free at least one drop of rain from the good doctors cheek also the excitement will kill me said wetherby wiping the backs of his fists across his eyes no better way to die tomorrow night but what will people say as i lead my machine through the streets to your museum if anyone sees say youre a gypsy whos stolen treasure from a distant year well well elijah wetherby im off be careful downhill careful half out the door dr goff tripped on a cobble and almost fell as a farmer said did you see the lunatic i did will you take him to a madhouse yes asylum dr goff adjusted his cuffs crazed worthless you will see him no more good said all as he passed grand said goff and picked his way down the stone path listening and uphill was there not a final joyful wheelcircling cry from that distant yard dr goff snorted think on it he said half aloud no more horses no more manure think and thinking fell on the cobbles lurching toward london and the future at the end of the ninth year well said sheila chewing on her breakfast toast and examining her complexion distorted in the side of the coffee urn here it is the last day of the last month of the ninth year her husband thomas glanced over the rampart of the wall street journa saw nothing to fasten his regard and sank back in place what i said said sheila the ninth years finished and you have a completely new wife or to put it properly the old wifes gone so i dont think were married anymore thomas floored the journal on his asyetuntouched scrambled eggs tilted his head this way and that and said not married no that was another time another body another me she buttered more toast and munched on it philosophically hold on he took a stiff jolt of coffee explain well dear thomas dont you remember reading as children and later that every nine years i think it was nine the body churning like a genechromosome factory did your entire person over fingernails spleen ankles to elbows belly bum and earlobes molecule by molecule oh get to it he grumbled the point wife the point the point dear tom she replied finishing her toast is that with this breakfast i have replenished my soul and psyche completed the reworking of my entire flesh blood and bones this person seated across from you is not the woman you married i have often said that be serious are you he said let me finish if the medical research is true then at the end of nine years there is not an eyebrow eyelash pore dimple or skin follicle in this creature here at this celebratory breakfast that in any way is related to that old sheila tompkins married at eleven am of a saturday nine years ago this very hour two different women one in bondage to a nice male creature whose jaw jumps out like a cash register when he scans the journal the other now that it is one minute after the deadline hour born free so she rose swiftly and prepared to flee wait he gave himself another jolt of coffee where are you going hallway to the door she said out perhaps away and who knows forever born free hogwash come here sit down she hesitated as he assumed his liontamers voice dammit you owe me an explanation sit she turned slowly for only as long as it takes to draw a picture draw it then sit she came to stare at her plate i seem to have eaten everything in sight he jumped up ran over to the side table rummaged more omelet and banged it in front of her there speak with your mouth full she forked in the eggs you do see what im driving at dont you tomasino damnation i thought you were happy yes but not incredibly happy thats for maniacs on their honeymoons yes wasnt it she remembered that was then this is now well i could feel it happening all year lying in bed i felt my skin prickle my pores open like ten thousand tiny mouths my perspiration run like faucets my heart race my pulse sound in the oddest places under my chin my wrists the backs of my knees my ankles i felt like a huge wax statue melting after midnight i was afraid to turn on the bathroom light and find a stranger gone mad in the mirror all right all right he stirred four sugars in his coffee and drank the slops from the saucer sum it up every hour of every night and then all day i could feel it as if i were out in a storm being struck by hot august rain that washed away the old to find a brandnew me every drop of serum every red and white corpuscle every hot flash of nerve ending rewired and restrung new marrow new hair for combing new fingerprints even dont look at me that way perhaps no new fingerprints but all the rest see am i not a freshsculpted freshpainted work of gods creation he searched her up and down with a razor glare i hear mad carlotta maundering he said i see a woman hyperventilated by a midlife frenzy why dont you just say it do you want a divorce not necessarily not necessarily he shouted ill just simply go away where will you go there must be some place she said vaguely stirring her omelet to make paths is there another man he said at last holding his utensils with fists not quite yet thank god for small favors he let a great breath gust out now go to your room beg pardon she blinked youll not be allowed out for the rest of this week go to your room no phone calls no tv no she was on her feet you sound like my father in high school ill be damned he laughed quietly yes upstairs now no lunch for you my girl ill put a plate by your door at suppertime when you behave ill give you your car keys meanwhile march pull out your telephone plugs and hand over your cd player this is outrageous she cried im a grown woman ingrown no progress regress if that damn theorys true you didnt add on just sank back nine years out you go up she ran palefaced to the entry stairs wiping tears from her eyes as she was hallway up he putting his foot on the first step pulled the napkin from his shirt and called quietly wait she froze in place but did not look back down at him waiting sheila he said at last tears running down his cheeks now yes she whispered i love you he said i know she said but it doesnt help yes it does listen she waited hallway up to her room he rubbed his hand over his face as if trying to massage some truth out of it his hand was almost frantic searching for something hidden around his mouth or near his eyes then it almost burst from him sheila im supposed to go to my room she said dont what then his face began to relax his eyes to fix on a solution as his hand rested on the banister leading up to where she stood with her back turned if what you say is true it is she murmured every cell every pore every eyelash nine years yes yes i know yes but listen he swallowed hard and that helped him digest the solution which he now spoke very weakly then quietly and then with a kind of growing certainty if what you say happened it did she murmured head down well then he said slowly and then it happened to me too what her head lifted a trifle it doesnt just happen to one person right it happens to all people everyone in the world and if thats true well my body has been changing along with yours during all the last nine years every follicle every fingernail all the dermis and epidermis or whatever i never noticed but it must have her head was up now and her back was not slumped he hurried on and if thats true good lord then im new too the old tom thomas tommy tomasino is left behind back there with the shed snakeskin her eyes opened and she listened and he finished so were both brandnew youre the new beautiful woman ive been thinking about finding and loving in the last year and im that man you were heading out to search for isnt that right isnt that true there was the merest hesitation and then she gave the smallest almost imperceptible nod mercy he called gently thats not my name she said it is now new woman new body new name so i picked one for you mercy after a moment she said what does that make you let me think he chewed his lip and smiled how about frank frankly my dear i do give a damn frank she murmured frank and mercy mercy and frank it doesnt exactly ring but itll do mercy yes will you marry me what i said will you marry me today an hour from now noon she turned at last to look down at him with a face all freshly tanned and washed oh yes she said and well run away and be maniacs again for a little while no she said here is fine here is wonderful come down then he said holding his hand up to her we have another nine years before another change come down and finish your wedding breakfast mercy she came down the steps and took his hand and smiled wheres the champagne she said bug looking back now i cant remember a time when bug wasnt dancing bug is short for jitterbug and of course those were the days in the late thirties our final days in high school and our first days out in the vast world looking for work that didnt exist when jitterbugging was all the rage and i can remember bug during a jazzband blast at our final audcall for our high school senior class suddenly leaping up to dance with an invisible partner in the middle of the front aisle of the auditorium that brought the house down you never heard such a roar or such applause the bandleader stricken with bugs oblivious joy gave an encore and bug did the same and we all exploded after that the band played thanks for the memory and we all sang it with tears pouring down our cheeks nobody in all the years after could forget bug dancing in the aisle eyes shut hands out to grasp his invisible girlfriend his legs not connected to his body just his heart all over the place when it was over nobody not even the band wanted to leave we just stood there in the world bug had made hating to go out into that other world that was waiting for us it was about a year later when bug saw me on the street and stopped his roadster and said come on along to my place for a hot dog and a coke and i jumped in and we drove over with the top down and the wind really hitting us and bug talking and talking at the top of his lungs about life and the times and what he wanted to show me in his front parlorfront parlor hell dining room kitchen and bedroom what was it he wanted me to see trophies big ones little ones solid gold and silver and brass trophies with his name on them dance trophies i mean they were everywhere on the floor by his bed on the kitchen sink in the bathroom but in the parlor especially they had settled like a locust plague there were so many of them on the mantel and in bookcases instead of books and on the floor you had to wade through kicking some over as you went they totaled he said tilting his head back and counting inside his eyelids to about three hundred and twenty prizes which means grabbing onto a trophy almost every night in the past year all this i gasped just since we left high school aint i the cats pajamas bug cried youre the whole darned department store who was your partner all those nights not partner partners bug corrected three hundred give or take a dozen different women on three hundred different nights where do you find three hundred women all talented all good enough to win prizes they werent talented or all good said bug glancing around at his collection they were just ordinary good everynight dancers i won the prizes i made them good and when we got out there dancing we cleared the floor everyone else stopped to watch us there out in the middle of nowhere and we never stopped he paused blushed and shook his head sorry about that didnt mean to brag but he wasnt bragging i could see he was just telling the truth you want to know how this all started said bug handing over a hot dog and a coke dont tell me i said i know how could you said bug looking me over the last audcall at la high i think they played thanks for the memory but just before that roll out the barrel the barrel yes and there you were in front of god and everyone jumping i never stopped said bug eyes shut back in those years never he said stopped you got your life all made i said unless said bug something happens what happened was of course the war looking back i remember that in that last year in school sap that i was i made up a list of my one hundred and sixtyfive best friends can you imagine that one hundred and sixtyfive count em best friends its a good thing i never showed that list to anyone i would have been hooted out of school anyway the war came and went and took with it a couple dozen of those listed friends and the rest just disappeared into holes in the ground or went east or wound up in malibu or fort lauderdale bug was on that list but i didnt figure out i didnt really know him until half a lifetime later by that time i was down to half a dozen pals or women i might turn to if i needed and it was then walking down hollywood boulevard one saturday afternoon i heard someone call how about a hot dog and a coke bug i thought without turning and thats who it was standing on the walk of stars with his feet planted on mary pickford and ricardo cortez just behind and jimmy stewart just ahead bug had taken off some hair and put on some weight but it was bug and i was overjoyed perhaps too much and showed it for he seemed embarrassed at my enthusiasm i saw then that his suit was not half new enough and his shirt frayed but his tie was neatly tied and he shook my hand off and we popped into a place where we stood and had that hot dog and that coke still going to be the worlds greatest writer said bug working at it i said youll get there said bug and smiled meaning it you were always good so were you i said that seemed to pain him slightly for he stopped chewing for a moment and took a swig of coke yes sir he said i surely was god i said i can still remember the day i saw all those trophies for the first time what a family whatever before i could finish asking he gave the answer put em in storage some some wound up with my first wife goodwill got the rest im sorry i said and truly was bug looked at me steadily how come youre sorry hell i dunno i said its just they seemed such a part of you i havent thought of you often the last few years or so to be honest but when i do there you are kneedeep in all those cups and mugs in your front room out in the kitchen hell in your garage ill be damned said bug what a memory you got we finished our cokes and it was almost time to go i couldnt help myself even seeing that bug had fleshed himself out over the years when i started to say and stopped when what said bug when i said with difficulty when was the last time you danced years said bug but how long ago ten years fifteen maybe twenty yeah twenty i dont dance anymore i dont believe that bug not dance nuts truth gave my fancy nightout shoes to the goodwill too cant dance in your socks can and barefoot too bug had to laugh at that youre really something well its been nice he started edging toward the door take care genius not so fast i walked him out into the light and he was looking both ways as if there were heavy traffic you know one thing i never saw and wanted to see you bragged about it said you took three hundred ordinary girls out on the dance floor and turned them into ginger rogers inside three minutes but i only saw you once at that audcall in so i dont believe you what said bug you saw the trophies you could have had those made up i pursued looking at his wrinkled suit and frayed shirt cuffs anyone can go in a trophy shop and buy a cup and have his name put on it you think i did that cried bug i think that yes bug glanced out in the street and back at me and back in the street and back to me trying to decide which way to run or push or shout whats got into you said bug whyre you talking like that god i dont know i admitted its just we might not meet again and ill never have the chance or you to prove it id like after all this time to see what you talked about id love to see you dance again bug naw said bug ive forgotten how dont hand me that you may have forgotten but the rest of you knows how bet you could go down to the ambassador hotel this afternoon they still have tea dances there and clear the floor just like you said after youre out there nobody else dances they all stop and look at you and her just like thirty years ago no said bug backing away but coming back no no pick a stranger any girl any woman out of the crowd lead her out hold her in your arms and just skim her around as if you were on ice and dream her to paradise if you write like that youll never sell said bug bet you bug i dont bet all right then bet you you cant bet you by god that youve lost your stuff now hold on said bug i mean it lost your stuff forever for good bet you wanna bet bugs eyes took on a peculiar shine and his face was flushed how much fifty bucks i dont have thirty bucks then twenty you can afford to lose that cant you who says id lose dammit i say twenty is it a deal youre throwing your money away no im a sure winner because you cant dance worth shoats and shinola wheres your money cried bug incensed now here wheres your car i dont own a car never learned to drive wheres yours sold it jesus no cars how do we get to the tea dance we got we grabbed a cab and i paid and before bug could relent dragged him through the hotel lobby and into the ballroom it was a nice summer afternoon so nice that the room was filled with mostly middleaged men and their wives a few younger ones with their girlfriends and some kids out of college who looked out of place embarrassed by the mostly oldfolks music out of another time we got the last table and when bug opened his mouth for one last protest i put a straw in it and helped him nurse a marguerita why are you doing this he protested again because you were just one of one hundred sixtyfive close friends i said we were never friends said bug well today anyway theres moonlight serenade always liked that never danced myself clumsy fool on your feet bug he was on his feet swaying who do you pick i said you cut in on a couple or theres a few wallflowers over there a tableful of women i dare you to pick the least likely and give her lessons yes that did it casting me a glance of the purest scorn he charged off half into the pretty teatime dresses and immaculate men searching around until his eyes lit on a table where a woman of indeterminate age sat hands folded face thin and sickly pale half hidden under a widebrimmed hat looking as if she were waiting for someone who never came that one i thought bug glanced from her to me i nodded and in a moment he was bowing at her table and a conversation ensued it seemed she didnt dance didnt know how to dance didnt want to dance ah yes he seemed to be saying ah no she seemed to reply bug turned holding her hand and gave me a long stare and a wink then without looking at her he raised her by her hand and arm and out with a seamless glide onto the floor what can i say how can i tell bug long ago had never bragged but only told the truth once he got hold of a girl she was weightless by the time he had whisked and whirled and glided her once around the floor she almost took off it seemed he had to hold her down she was pure gossamer the closest thing to a hummingbird held in the hand so you cannot feel its weight but only sense its heartbeat sounding to your touch and there she went out and around and back with bug guiding and moving enticing and retreating and not fifty anymore no but eighteen his body remembering what his mind thought it had long forgotten for his body was free of the earth now too he carried himself as he carried her with that careless insouciance of a lover who knows what will happen in the next hour and the night soon following and it happened just like he said within a minute a minute and a half at most the dance floor cleared as bug and his stranger lady whirled by with a glance every couple on the floor stood still the bandleader almost forgot to keep time with his baton and the members of the orchestra in a similar trance leaned forward over their instruments to see bug and his new love whirl and turn without touching the floor when the serenade ended there was a moment of stillness and then an explosion of applause bug pretended it was all for the lady and helped her curtsy and took her to her table where she sat eyes shut not believing what had happened by that time bug was on the floor again with one of the wives he borrowed from the nearest table this time no one even went out on the floor bug and the borrowed wife filled it around and around and this time even bugs eyes were shut i got up and put twenty dollars on the table where he might find it after all he had won the bet hadnt he why had i done it well i couldnt very well have left him out in the middle of the high school auditorium aisle dancing alone could i on my way out i looked back bug saw me and waved his eyes as brimmed full as mine someone passing whispered hey come on lookit this guy god i thought hell be dancing all night me i could only walk and i went out and walked until i was fifty again and the sun was going down and the low june fog was coming in early over old los angeles that night just before going to sleep i wished that in the morning when bug woke up he would find the floor around his bed covered with trophies or at the very least he would turn and find a quiet and understanding trophy with her head on his pillow near enough to touch once more legato fentriss sat up in his chair in the garden in the middle of a fine autumn and listened the drink in his hand remained unsipped his friend black unspoken to the fine house unnoticed the very weather itself neglected for there was a veritable fountain of sound in the air above them my god he mid do you hear what the birds asked his friend black doing just the opposite sipping his drink noticing the weather admiring the rich house and neglecting the birds entirely until this moment great god in heaven listen to them cried fentriss black listened rather nice clean out your ears black made a halfhearted gesture symbolizing the cleaning out of ears well damn it dont be funny i mean really listen theyre singing a tune birds usually do no they dont birds paste together bits and pieces maybe five or six notes eight at the most mockingbirds have repertoires that change but not entire melodies these birds are different now shut up and give over both men sat enchanted blacks expression melted ill be damned he said at last they do go on he leaned forward and listened intently yes murmured fentriss eyes shut nodding to the rhythms that sprang like fresh rain from the tree just above their heads ohmigod indeed black rose as if to move under the tree and peer up fentriss protested with a fierce whisper dont spoil it sit be very still wheres my pencil ah half peering around he found a pencil and notepad shut his eyes and began to scribble blindly the birds sang youre not actually writing down their song said black what does it look like quiet and with eyes now open now shut fentriss drew scales and jammed in the notes i didnt know you read music said black astonished i played the violin until my father broke it please there there yes slower he whispered wait for me as if hearing the birds adjusted their lilt moving toward piano instead of bravado a breeze stirred the leaves like an invisible conductor and the singing died fentriss perspiration beading his forehead stopped scribbling and fell back ill be damned black gulped his drink what was that all about writing a song fentriss stared at the scales he had dashed on paper or a tone poem let me see that wait the tree shook itself gently but produced no further notes i want to be sure theyre done silence black seized the pages and let his eyes drift over the scales jesus joseph and mary he said aghast it works he glanced up at the thick green of the tree where no throat warbled no wing stirred what kind of birds are those the birds of forever the small beasts of an immaculate musical conception something said fentriss has made them with child and its name is song hogwash is it something in the air in the seeds they ate at dawn some whim of climate and weather god but now theyre mine its mine a fine tune it is said black but cant be never question the miraculous when it happens good grief maybe those damned wonderful creatures have been throwing up incredible songs for months years but no one listened today for the first time someone did me now what to do with the gift you dont seriously mean ive been out of work for a year i quit my computers retired early im only fortynine and have been threatening to knit macrame to give friends to spoil their walls day after day which shall it be friend macrame or mozart are you mozart just his bastard son nonsense cried black pointing his face like a blunderbuss at the trees as if he might blast the choir that tree those birds are a rorschach test your subconscious is picking and choosing notes from pure chaos theres no discernible tune no special rhythm you had me fooled but i see and hear it now youve had a repressed desire since childhood to compose and youve let a clutch of idiot birds grab you by the ears put down that pen nonsense right back at you fentriss laughed youre jealous that after twelve layabout years thunderstruck with boredom one of us has found an occupation i shall follow it listen and write write and listen sit down youre obstructing the acoustics ill sit black exclaimed but he clapped his hands over his ears fair enough said fentriss escape fantastic reality while i change a few notes and finish out this unexpected birth glancing up at the tree he whispered wait for me the tree rustled its leaves and fell quiet crazy muttered black one two three hours later entering the library quietly and then loudly black cried out what are you doing bent over his desk his hand moving furiously fentriss said finishing a symphony the same one you began in the garden no the birds began the birds the birds then black edged closer to study the mad inscriptions how do you know what to do with that stuff they did most ive added variations an arrogance the ornithologists will resent and attack have you composed before notfentriss let his fingers roam loop and scratchuntil today you realize of course youre plagiarizing those songbirds borrowing black borrowing if a milkmaid singing at dawn can have her hum borrowed by berlioz well or if dvorak hearing a dixie banjo plucker pluck goin home steals the banjo to eke out his new world why cant i weave a net to catch a tune there finito done give us a title black i who sings offkey what about the emperors nightingale stravinsky the birds hitchcock damn hows this its only john cage in a gilded bird brilliant but no one knows who john cage was well then ive got it and he wrote fortyseven magpies baked in a pie blackbirds you mean go back to john cage bosh fentriss stabbed the phone hello willie could you come over yes a small job symphonic arrangement for a friend or friends whats your usual philharmonic fee eh good enough tonight fentriss disconnected and turned to gaze at the tree with wonder in it what next he murmured fortyseven magpies with title shortened premiered at the glendale chamber symphony a month later with standing ovations incredible reviews fentriss outside his skin with joy prepared to launch himself atop large small symphonic operatic whatever fell on his ears he had listened to the strange choirs each day for weeks but bad noted nothing waiting to see if the magpie experiment was to be repeated when the applause rose in storms and the critics hopped when they werent skipping he knew he must strike again before the epilepsy ceased there followed wings flight night chorus the fledgling madrigals and dawn patrol each greeted by new thunderstorms of acclamation and critics angry at excellence but forced to praise by now said fentriss i should be unbearable to live with but the birds caution modesty also said black seated under the tree waiting for a sprig of benison and the merest touch of symphonic manna shut up if all those sly dimwit composers who will soon be lurking in the bushes cop your secret youre a gone poacher poacher by god yes fentriss laughed poacher and damn if the first poacher didnt arrive glancing out at tree in the morning fentriss witnessed a runty shadow stretching up handheld tape recorder poised warbling and whistling softly at the tree when this failed the halfseen poacher tried dovecoos and then orioles and roosters half dancing in a circle damn it to hell fentriss leaped out with a shotgun cry is that wolfgang prouty poaching my garden out wolfgang go dropping his recorder prouty vaulted a bush impaled himself on thorns and vanished fentriss cursing picked up an abandoned notepad nightsong it read on the tape recorder he found a lovely satielike birdchoir after that more poachers arrived midnight to depart at dawn their spawn fentriss realized would soon throttle his creativity and still his voice he loitered fulltime in the garden now not knowing what seed to give his beauties and heavily watered the lawn to fetch up worms wearily he stood guard through sleepless nights nodding off only to find wolfgang proutys evil minions astride the wall prompting arias and one night by god perched in the tree itself humming in hopes of singalongs a shotgun was the final answer after its first fiery roar the garden was empty for a week that is until someone came very late indeed and committed mayhem as quietly as possible he cut the branches and sawed the limbs oh envious composers dreadful murderers cried fentriss and the birds were gone and the career of amadeus two with it black cried fentriss yes dear friend said black looking at the bleak sky where once green was is your car outside when last i looked drive but driving in search didnt do it it wasnt like calling in lost dogs or telephonepoled cats they must find and cage an entire mormon tabernacle team of soprano springtimeintherockies birdseed lovers to prove one in the hand is worth two in the bush but still they hastened from block to block garden to garden lurking and listening now their spirits soared with an echo of hallelujah chorus oriole warbling only to sink in a drab sparrow twilight of despair only when they had crossed and recrossed interminable mazes of asphalt and greens did one of them finally light his pipe and emit a theory did you ever think to wonder he mused behind a smokecloud what season of the year this is season of the year said fentriss exasperated well coincidentally wasnt the night the tree fell and the wee songsters blew town was not that the first fall night of autumn fentriss clenched a fist and struck his brow you mean your friends have flown the coop their migration must be above san miguel allende just now if they are migratory birds do you doubt it another pained silence another blow to the head shit precisely said black friend said fentriss sir drive home it was a long year it was a short year it was a year of anticipation it was the burgeoning of despair it was the revival of inspiration but at its heart fentriss knew just another tale of two cities but he did not know what the other city was how stupid of me he thought not to have guessed or imagined that my songsters were wanderers who each autumn fled south and each springtime swarmed north in a cappella choirs of sound the waiting he told black is madness the phone never stops the phone rang he picked it up and addressed it like a child yes yes of course soon when very soon and put the phone down you see that was philadelphia they want another cantata as good as the first at dawn today it was boston yesterday the vienna philharmonic soon i say when god knows lunacy where are those angels that once sang me to my rest he threw down maps and weather charts of mexico peru guatemala and the argentines how far south do i scour buenos aires or rio mazatlan or cuernavaca and then wander about with a tin ear standing under trees waiting for birddrops like a spotted owl will the argentine critics trot by scoffing to see me leaning on trees eyes shut waiting for the quasimelody the lost chord id let no one know the cause of my journey my search otherwise pandemoniums of laughter but in what city under what kind of tree would i wander to stand a tree like mine do they seek the same roosts or will anything do in ecuador or peru god i could waste months guessing and come back with birdseed in my hair and bird bombs on my lapels what to do black speak well for one thingblack stuffed and lit his pipe and exhaled his aromatic concepts you might clear off this stump and plant a new tree they had been circling the stump and kicking it for inspiration fentriss froze with one foot raised say that again i said good grief you genius let me kiss you rather not hugs maybe fentriss hugged him wildly friend always was lets get a shovel and spade you get ill watch fentriss ran back a minute later with a spade and pickax sure you wont join me black sucked his pipe blew smoke later how much would a fullgrown tree cost too much yes but if it were here and the birds did return black let out more smoke might be worth it opus number two in the beginning by charles fentriss stuff like that in the beginning or maybe the return one of those or fentriss struck the stump with the pickax rebirth he struck again ode to joy another strike spring harvest another let the heavens resound hows that black i prefer the other said black the stump was pulled and the new tree bought dont show me the bill fentriss told his accountant pay it and the tallest tree they could find of the same family as the one dead and gone was planted what if it dies before my choir returns said fentriss what if it lives said black and your choir goes elsewhere the tree planted seemed in no immediate need to die neither did it look particularly vital and ready to welcome small singers from some far southern places meanwhile the sky like the tree was empty dont they know im waiting said fentriss not unless offered black you majored in crosscontinental telepathy ive checked with audubon they say that while the swallows do come back to capistrano on a special day give or take a white lie other migrating species are often one or two weeks late if i were you said black i would plunge into an intense love affair to distract you while you wait i am fresh out of love affairs well then said black suffer the hours passed slower than the minutes the days passed slower than the hours the weeks passed slower than the days black called no birds no birds pity i cant stand watching you lose weight and black disconnected on a final night when fentriss had almost yanked the phone out of the wall fearful of another call from the boston symphony he leaned an ax against the trunk of the new tree and addressed it and the empty sky last chance he said if the dawn patrol doesnt show by seven am its quits and he touched axblade against the treebole took two shots of vodka so swiftly that the spirits squirted out both eyes and went to bed he awoke twice during the night to hear nothing but a soft breeze outside his window stirring the leaves with not a ghost of song and awoke at dawn with tearfilled eyes having dreamed that the birds had returned but knew in waking it was only a dream and yet hark someone might have said in an old novel list as in an old play eyes shut he finetuned his ears the tree outside as he arose looked fatter as if it had taken on invisible ballasts in the night there were stirrings there not of simple breeze or probing winds but of something in the very leaves that knitted and purled them in rhythms he dared not look but lay back down to ache his senses and try to know a single chirp hovered in the window he waited silence go on he thought another chirp dont breathe he thought dont let them know youre listening hush a fourth sound then a fifth note then a sixth and seventh my god he thought is this a substitute orchestra a replacement choir come to scare off my loves another five notes perhaps he prayed theyre only tuning up another twelve notes of no special timbre or pace and as he was about to explode like a lunatic conductor and fire the bunchit happened note after note line after line fluid melody following spring freshet melody the whole choir exhaled to blossom the tree with joyous proclamations of return and welcome in chorus and as they sang fentriss sneaked his hand to find a pad and pen to hide under the covers so that its scratching might not disturb the choir that soared and dipped to soar again firing the bright air that flowed from the tree to tune his soul with delight and move his hand to remember the phone rang he picked it up swiftly to hear black ask if the waiting was over without speaking he held the receiver in the window ill be damned said blacks voice no anointed whispered the composer scribbling cantata no laughing he called softly to the sky please more slowly legato not agitato and the tree and the creatures within the tree obeyed agitato ceased legato prevailed exchange there were too many cards in the file too many books on the shelves too many children laughing in the childrens room too many newspapers to fold and stash on the racks all in all too much miss adams pushed her gray hair back over her lined brow adjusted her goldrimmed pincenez and rang the small silver bell on the library desk at the same time switching off and on all the lights the exodus of adults and children was exhausting miss ingraham the assistant librarian had gone home early because her father was sick so it left the burden of stamping filing and checking books squarely on miss adams shoulders finally the last book was stamped the last child fed through the great brass doors the doors locked and with immense weariness miss adams moved back up through a silence of forty years of books and being keeper of the books stood for a long moment by the main desk she laid her glasses down on the green blotter and pressed the bridge of her smallboned nose between thumb and forefinger and held it eyes shut what a racket children who fingerpainted or cartooned frontispieces or rattled their roller skates high school students arriving with laughters departing with mindless songs taking up her rubber stamp she probed the files weeding out errors her fingers whispering between dante and darwin a moment later she heard the rapping on the frontdoor glass and saw a mans shadow outside wanting in she shook her head the figure pleaded silently making gestures sighing miss adams opened the door saw a young man in uniform and said its late were closed she glanced at his insignia and added captain hold on said the captain remember me and repeated it as she hesitated remember she studied his face trying to bring light out of shadow yes i think i do she said at last you once borrowed books here right many years ago she added now i almost have you placed as he stood waiting she tried to see him in those other years but his younger face did not come clear or a name with it and his hand reached out now to take hers may i come in well she hesitated yes she led the way up the steps into the immense twilight of books the young officer looked around and let his breath out slowly then reached to take a book and hold it to his nose inhaling then almost laughing dont mind me miss adams you ever smell new books binding pages print like fresh bread when youre hungry he glanced around im hungry now but dont even know what for there was a moment of silence so she asked him how long he might stay just a few hours im on the train from new york to la so i came up from chicago to see old places old friends his eyes were troubled and he fretted his cap turning it in his long slender fingers she said gently is anything wrong anything i can help you with he glanced out the window at the dark town with just a few lights in the windows of the small houses across the way i was surprised he said by what i dont know what i expected pretty damn dumb he said looking from her to the windows to expect that when i went away everyone froze in place waiting for me to come home that when i stepped off the train all my old pals would unfreeze run down meet me at the station silly no she said more easily now i think we all imagine that i visited paris as a young girl went back to france when i was forty and was outraged that no one had waited buildings had vanished and all the hotel staff where i had once lived had died retired or traveled he nodded at this but could not seem to go on did anyone know you were coming she asked i wrote a few but no answers i figured hell theyre busy but theyll be there they werent she felt the next words come off her lips and was faintly surprised im still here she said you are he said with a quick smile and i cant tell you how glad i am he was gazing at her now with such intensity that she had to look away you know she said i must confess you look familiar but i dont quite fit your face with the boy who came here twenty years ago and as for what he looked like that other one me well he brought out a smallish wallet which held a dozen pictures and handed over a photograph of a boy perhaps twelve years old with an impish smile and wild blond hair looking as if he might catapult out of the frame ah yes miss adams adjusted her pincenez and closed her eyes to remember that one spaulding william henry spaulding he nodded and peered at the picture in her hands anxiously was i a lot of trouble yes she nodded and held the picture closer and glanced up at him a fiend she handed the picture back but i loved you did you he said and smiled more broadly in spite of you yes he waited a moment and then said do you still love me she looked to left and right as if the dark stacks held the answer its a little early to know isnt it forgive no no a good question time will tell lets not stand like your frozen friends who didnt move come along ive just had some latenight coffee there may be some left give me your cap take off that coat the file index is there go look up your old library cards for the hellheckof it are they still there in amaze librarians save everything you never know whos coming in on the next train go when she came back with the coffee he stood staring down into the index file like a bird fixing its gaze on a halfempty nest he handed her one of the old purplestamped cards migawd he said i took out a lot of books ten at a time i said no but you took them and she added read them here she put his cup on top of the file and waited while he drew out canceled card after card and laughed quietly i cant believe i must not have lived anywhere else but here may i take this with me to sit he showed the cards she nodded can you show me around i mean maybe ive forgotten something she shook her head and took his elbow i doubt that come on over here of course is the adult section i begged you to let me cross over when i was thirteen youre not ready you said but i let you cross over anyway you did and much thanks another thought came to him as he looked down at her you used to be taller than me he said she looked up at him amused ive noticed that happens quite often in my life but i can still do this before he could move she grabbed his chin in her thumb and forefinger and held tight his eyes rolled he said i remember when i was really bad youd hold on and put your face down close and scowl the scowl did it after ten seconds of your holding my chin very tight i behaved for days she nodded released his chin he rubbed it and as they moved on he ducked his head not looking at her forgive i hope you wont be upset but when i was a boy i used to look up and see you behind your desk so near but far away and how can i say this i used to think that you were mrs god and that the library was a whole world and that no matter what part of the world or what people or thing i wanted to see and read youd find and give it to me he stopped his face coloring you did too you had the world ready for me every time i asked there was always a place i hadnt seen a country i hadnt visited where you took me ive never forgotten she looked around slowly at the thousands of books she felt her heart move quietly did you really call me what you just said mrs god oh yes often always come along she said at last they walked around the rooms together and then downstairs to the newspaper files and coming back up he suddenly leaned against the banister holding tight miss adams he said what is it captain he exhaled im scared i dont want to leave im afraid her hand all by itself took his arm and she finally said there in the shadows sometimesim afraid too what frightens you i dont want to go away without saying goodbye if i never return i want to see all my friends shake hands slap them on the back i dont know make jokes he stopped and waited then went on but i walk around town and nobody knows me everyones gone the pendulum on the wall clock slid back and forth shining with the merest of sounds hardly knowing where she was going miss adams took his arm and guided him up the last steps away from the marble vaults below to a final brightly decorated room where he glanced around and shook his head theres no one here either do you believe that well where are they do any of my old pals ever come visit borrow books bring them back late not often she said but listen do you realize thomas wolfe was wrong wolfe the great literary beast wrong the title of one of his books you cant go home again he guessed thats it he was wrong this is home your friends are still here this was your summer place yes myths legends mummies aztec kings wicked sisters who spat toads where i really lived but i dont see my people well and before he could speak she switched on a greenshaded lamp that shed a private light on a small table isnt this nice she said most libraries today too much light there should be shadows dont you think some mystery yes so that late nights the beasts can prowl out of the stacks and crouch by this jungle light to turn the pages with their breath am i crazy not that i noticed good sit now that i know who you are it all comes back it couldnt possibly no youll see she vanished into the stacks and came out with ten books that she placed upright their pages a trifle spread so they could stand and he could read the titles the summer of when you were what ten you read all of these in one week oz dorothy the wizard oh yes she placed still others nearby alice in wonderland through the lookingglass a month later you reborrowed both but i said youve already read them but you said not enough so i can speak i want to be able to tell them out loud my god he said quietly did i say that you did heres more you read a dozen times greek myths roman egyptian norse myths chinese you were ravenous king tut arrived from the tomb when i was three his picture in the rotogravure started me what else have you there tarzan of the apes you borrowed it three dozen times john carter warlord of mars four dozen my god dear lady how come you remember all this you never left summertimes you were here when i unlocked the doors you went home for lunch but sometimes brought sandwiches and sat out by the stone lion at noon your father pulled you home by your ear some nights when you stayed late how could i forget a boy like that but still you never played never ran out in baseball weather or football i imagine why he glanced toward the front door they were waiting for me they you know the ones who never borrowed books never read they them those she looked and remembered ah yes the bullies why did they chase you because they knew i loved books and didnt much care for them its a wonder you survived i used to watch you getting reading hunchbacked late afternoons you looked so lonely no i had these company heres more she put down ivanhoe robin hood and treasure island oh he said and dear and strange mr poe how i loved his red death you took it so often i told you to keep it on permanent loan unless someone else asked someone did six months later and when you brought it in i could see it was a terrible blow a few days later i let you have poe for another year i dont recall did you ever its out in california shall i no no please well here are your books let me bring others she came out not carrying many books but one at a time as if each one were indeed special she began to make a circle inside the other stonehenge circle and as she placed the books in lonely splendor he said their names and then the names of the authors who had written them and then the names of those who had sat across from him so many years ago and read the books quietly or sometimes whispered the finest parts aloud so beautifully that no one said quiet or silence or even shh she placed the first book and there was a wild field of broom and a wind blowing a young woman across that field as it began to snow and someone far away called kathy and as the snows fell he saw a girl he had walked to school in the sixth grade seated across the table her eyes fixed to the windblown field and the snow and the lost woman in another time of winter a second book was set in place and a black and beauteous horse raced across a summer field of green and on that horse was another girl who hid behind the book and dared to pass him notes when he was twelve and then there was the far ghost with a snowmaiden face whose hair was a long golden harp played by the summer airs she who was always sailing to byzantium where emperors were drowsed by golden birds that sang in clockwork cages at sunset and dawn she who always skirted the outer rim of school and went to swim in the deep lake ten thousand afternoons ago and never came out so was never found but suddenly now she made landfall here in the greenshaded light and opened yeats to at last sail home from byzantium and on her right john huff whose name came clearer than the rest who claimed to have climbed every tree in town and fallen from none who had raced through watermelon patches treading melons never touching earth to knock down rainfalls of chestnuts with one blow who yodeled at your sunup window and wrote the same mark twain book report in four different grades before the teachers caught on at which he said vanishing just call me huck and to his right the pale son of the town hotel owner who looked as if he had gone sleepless forever who swore every empty house was haunted and took you there to prove it with a juicy tongue compressed nose and throat gargling that sounded the long october demise the terrible and unutterable fall of the house of usher and next to him was yet another girl and next to her and just beyond miss adams placed a final book and he recalled the fair creature long ago when such things were left unsaid glancing up at him one day when he was an unknowing twelve and she was a wise thirteen to quietly say i am beauty and you are you the beast now late in time he wanted to answer that small and wondrous ghost no he hides in the stacks and when the clock strikes three will prowl forth to drink and it was finished all the books were placed the outer ring of his selves and the inner ring of remembered faces deathless with summer and autumn names he sat for a long moment and then another long moment and then one by one reached for and took all of the books that had been his and still were and opened them and read and shut them and took another until he reached the end of the outer circle and then went to touch and turn and find the raft on the river the field of broom where the storms lived and the pasture with the black and beauteous horse and its lovely rider behind him he heard the lady librarian quietly back away to leave him with words a long while later he sat back rubbed his yes and looked around at the fortress the encirclement the roman encampment of books and nodded his eyes wet yes he heard her move behind him yes what what you said thomas wolfe the title of that book of his wrong everythings here nothings changed nothing will as long as i can help it she said dont ever go away i wont if youll come back more often just then from below the town not so very far off a train whistle blew she said is that yours no but the one soon after he said and got up and moved around the small monuments that stood very tall and one by one shut the covers his lips moving to sound the old titles and the old dear names do we have to put them back on the shelves he said she looked at him and at the double circle and after a long moment said tomorrow will do why maybe he said during the night because of the color of those lamps green the jungle maybe those creatures you mentioned will come out and turn the pages with their breath and maybe what else maybe my friends whove hid in the stacks all these years will come out too theyre already here she said quietly yes he nodded they are and still he could not move she backed off across the room without making any sound and when she reached her desk she called back the last call of the night closing time closing time children and turned the lights quickly off and then on and then halfway between a library twilight he moved from the table with the double circle of books and came to her and said i can go now yes she said william henry spaulding you can they walked together as she turned out the lights turned out the lights one by one she helped him into his coat and then hardly thinking to do so he took her hand and kissed her fingers it was so abrupt she almost laughed but then she said remember what edith whanon said when henry james did what you just did what the flavor starts at the elbow they broke into laughter together and he turned and went down the marble steps toward the stainedglass entry at the bottom of the stairs he looked up at her and said tonight when youre going to sleep remember what i called you when i was twelve and say it out loud i dont remember she said yes you do below the town a train whistle blew again he opened the front door stepped out and he was gone her hand on the last light switch looking in at the double circle of books on the far table she thought what was it he called me oh yes she said a moment later and switched off the light free dirt the cemetery was in the center of the city on four sides it was bounded by gliding streetcars on glistening blue tracks and cars with exhaust fumes and sound but once inside the wall the world was lost for half a mile in four directions the cemetery raised midnight trees and headstones that grew from the earth like pale mushrooms moist and cold a gravel path led back into darkness and within the gate stood a gothic victorian house with six gables and a cupola the frontporch light showed an old man there alone not smoking not reading not moving silent if you took a deep breath he smelled of the sea of urine of papyrus of kindling of ivory and of teak his false teeth moved his mouth automatically when it wanted to talk his tiny yellow seed eyes twitched and his pokehole nostrils thinned as a stranger crunched up the gravel path and set foot on the porch step good evening said the stranger a young man perhaps twenty the old man nodded but his hands lay quietly on his knees i saw that sign out front the stranger went on free dirt it said the old man almost nodded the stranger tried a smile crazy but that sign caught my eye there was a glass fan over the front door a light shone through this glass fan colored blue red yellow and touched the old mans face it seemed not to bother him i wondered free dirt never struck me youd have much left over when you dig a hole and put the coffin in and refill the hole you havent much dirt left have you i should think the old man leaned forward it was so unexpected that the stranger pulled his foot off the bottom step you want some said the old man why no no i was just curious signs like that make you curious set down said the old man thanks the young man sat uneasily on the steps you know how it is you walk around and never think how it is to own a graveyard and said the old man i mean like how much time it takes to dig graves the old man leaned back in his chair on a cool day two hours hot day four very hot day six very cold day not cold so it freezes but real cold a man can dig a grave in one hour so he can head in for hot chocolate brandy in the chocolate then again you get a good man on a hot day hes no better than a bad man in the cold might take eight hours to open up but heres easydigging soil here all loam no rocks im curious about winter in blizzards we got a icebox mausoleum to stash the dead undelivered mail until spring and a whole month of shovels and spades seeding and planting time eh the stranger laughed you might say that dont you dig in winter anyhow for special funerals special dead some yards got a hoseshovel contraption pump hot water through the blade shape a grave quick like placer mining even with the ground an icepond we dont cotton to that use picks and shovels the young man hesitated does it bother you you mean i get scared ever well yes the old man at last took out and stuffed his pipe with tobacco tamped it with a callused thumb lit it let out a small stream of smoke no he said at last the young mans shoulders sank disappointed said the old man i thought maybe once oh when youre young maybe one time then there was a time the young man shifted up a step the old man glanced at him sharply then resumed smoking one time he stared at the marbled hills and the dark trees my grandpa owned this yard i was born here a gravedigger son learns to ignore things the old man took a number of deep puffs and said i was just eighteen folks off on vacation me left to tend things alone mow the lawn dig holes and such alone four graves to dig in october and a cold came hard off the lake frost on the graves tombstones like snow ground froze solid one night i walked out no moon hard grass underfoot could see my breath hands in my pockets walking listening the old man exhaled frail ghosts from his thin nostrils then i heard this sound deep under i froze it was a voice screaming someone woke up buried heard me walk by cried out i just stood they screamed and screamed earth banged on a cold night grounds like porcelain rings you see well the old man shut his eyes to remember i stood like the wind off the lake stopped my blood a joke i searched around and thought imagination no it was underfoot sharp clear a womans voice i knew all the gravestones the old mans eyelids trembled could recite them alphabetical year month day name any year and ill tell how about jake smith departed and betty dallman lost and p h moran name a month august august last year buried henrietta wells august grandma hanlon whole family influenza name a day august fourth smith burke shelby carried off williamson hes on that hill pink marble douglas by the creek the story the young man urged eh the story you were telling oh the voice below well i knew all the stones standing there i guessed that voice out of the ground was henrietta fremwell fine girl twentyfour years played piano at the elite theatre tall graceful blond how did i know her voice i stood where there was only mens graves hers was the only womans i ran to put my ear on her stone yes her voice way down screaming miss fremwell i shouted miss fremwell i yelled again deep down i heard her only weeping now maybe she heard me maybe not she just cried i ran downhill so fast i tripped and split my head on a stone got up screamed myself got to the tool shed all blood dragged out the tools and just stood there in the moonlight with one shovel the ground was ice solid solid i fell back against a tree it would take three minutes to get back to her grave and eight hours of cold night to dig to her box the ground was like glass a coffin is a coffin only so much space for air henrietta fremwell had been buried two days before the freeze been asleep all that time using up air and it rained just before the cold spell and the earth over her soaked with rainwater now froze id have to dig maybe eight hours and the way she cried there wasnt another hour of air left the old mans pipe had gone out he rocked in his chair back and forth back and forth silently but said the young man what did you do nothing said the old man nothing nothing i could do that ground was solid six men couldnt have dug that grave no hot water near and she mightve been screaming hours before i heard so you didnothing something put the shovel and pick back in the tool shed locked it and went back to the house and built a fire and drank some hot chocolate shivering and shivering would you have done different i would you have dug for eight hours in hard ice rock sos to reach her when she was truly dead of exhaustion cold smothered and have to bury her all over again then call her folks and tell them the young man was silent on the porch the mosquitoes hummed about the naked light bulb i see said the young man the old man sucked his pipe i think i cried all night because there was nothing i could do he opened his eyes and stared about surprised as if he had been listening to someone else thats quite a story said the young man no said the old man gods truth want to hear more see that big stone with the ugly angel that was adam crispins relatives fought got a writ from a judge dug him up hoping for poison found nothing put him back but by that time the dirt from his grave mixed with other dirts we shoveled in stuff from all around next plot the angel with broken wings marylou phipps dug her up to lug her off to elgin illinois more relatives where shed been the pit stayed open oh three weeks no funerals meanwhile her dirt got crossshoveled with others six stones over one stone north that was henry douglas jones became famous sixty years after no one paid attention now hes planted under the civil war monument his grave lay wide two months nobody wanted to utilize the hole of a southerner all of us leaning north with grant so his dirt got scattered that give you some notion of what that free dirt sign means the young man eyed the cemetery landscape well he said where is that dirt youre handing out the old man pointed with his pipe and the stranger looked and indeed by a nearby wall was a sizable hillock some ten feet long by about three feet high loam and grass tufts of many shades of tan brown and burnt umber go look said the old man the young man walked slowly over to stand by the mound kick it said the old man see if its real the young man kicked and his face paled did you hear that he said what said the old man looking somewhere else the stranger listened and shook his head nothing well now said the old man knocking out the ashes from his pipe how much free dirt you need i hadnt thought yes you have said the old man or you wouldnt have driven your lightweight delivery truck up by the cemetery gate i got cats ears heard your motor just when you stopped how much oh said the young man uneasily my backyards eighty feet by forty i could use a good inch of topsoil so id say said the old man half of that mound there hell take it all nobody wants it you mean i mean that mound has been growing and diminishing diminishing and growing mixtures up and down since grant took richmond and sherman reached the sea theres civil dirt there coffin splinters satin casket shreds from when lafayette met the honor guards edgar allan poe theres funeral flowers blossoms from ten hundred obsequies condolencecard confetti for hessian troopers parisian gunners who never shipped home that soil is so laced with bone meal and casket corsages i should charge you to buy the lot grab a spade before i do stay right there the young man raised one hand im not going anywhere said the old man nor is anyone else nearby the halftruck was pulled up by the dirt mound and the young man was reaching in for a spade when the old man said no i think not the old man went on graveyard spades best familiar metal familiar soil easy digging when like takes to like so the old mans head indicated a spade half stuck in the dark mound the young man shrugged and moved the cemetery spade came free with a soft whispering pellets of ancient mound fell with similar whispers he began to dig and shift and fill the back of his halftruck as the old man from the corners of his eyes observed its more than dirt as i said war of san juan hill manassas gettysburg october flu epidemic all strewn from graves filled and evicted to be refilled various occupants leavened out to dust various glories melted to mixtures rust from metal caskets coffin handles shoelaces but no shoes hairs long and short ever see wreaths made of hair saved to weave crowns to fix on mortal pictures all thats left of a smile or that funny look in the eyes of someone who knows shes not alive anymore ever hair epaulettes not whole ones but one strand of epaulette all there along with blood thats gone to silt the young man finished sweating and started to thrust the spade back in the earth when the old man said take it cemetery dirt cemetery spade like takes to like ill bring it back tomorrow the young man tossed the spade into the mounded truck no you got the dirt so keep the spade just dont bring the free dirt back why would i do that just dont said the old man but did not move as the young man climbed in his truck to start the engine he sat listening to the dirt mound tremble and whisper in the flatbed whatre you waiting for asked the old man the flimsy halftruck ran toward the last of the twilight pursued by the everencroaching dark clouds raced overhead perturbed by the invisible back on the horizon thunder sounded a few drops of rain fell on the windshield causing the young man to ram his foot on the gas and swerve into his home street even as the sun truly died the wind rose and the trees around his cottage bent and beckoned climbing out he stared at the sky and then his house and then the empty garden a few drops of cold rain on his cheeks decided him he drove the rattling halftruck into the empty garden unlatched the metal backflap opened it just an inch so as to allow a proper flow and then began motoring back and forth across the garden letting the dark stuffs whisper down letting the strange midnight earth sift and murmur until at last the truck was empty and he stood in the blowing night watching the wind stir the black soil then he locked the truck in the garage and went to stand on the back porch thinking i wont need water the storm will soak the ground he stood for a long while simply staring at the graveyard mulch waiting for rain until he thought what am i waiting for jesus and went in at ten oclock a light rain tapped on the windows and sifted over the dark garden at eleven it rained so steadily that the gutter drains swallowed and rattled at midnight the rain grew heavy he looked to see if it was eroding the new dark earth but saw only the black muck drinking the downpour like a great black sponge lit by distant flares of lightning then at one in the morning the greatest niagara of all shuddered the house rinsed the windows to blindness and shook the lights and then abruptly the downpour the immense niagara ceased followed by one great downfell blow of lightning which plowed and pinioned the dark earth close by near outside with explosions of light as if ten thousand flashbulbs had been fired off then darkness fell in curtains of thunder cracking breaking the bones in bed wishing for the merest dog to hold for lack of human company hugging the sheets burying his head then rising full to the silent air the dark air the storm gone the rain shut and a silence that spread in whispers as the last drench melted into the trembling soil he shuddered and then shivered and then hugged himself to stop the shivering of his cold flesh and he was thirsty but could not make himself move to find the kitchen and drink water milk leftover wine anything he lay back drymouthed with unreasonable tears filling his eyes free dirt he thought my god what a damnfool night free dirt at two oclock he heard his wristwatch ticking softly at twothirty he felt his pulse in his wrists and ankles and neck and then in his temples and inside his head the entire house leaned into the wind listening outside in the still night the wind failed and the yard lay soaked and waiting and at last yes he opened his eyes and turned his head toward the shaded window he held his breath what yes yes what beyond the window beyond the wall beyond the house outside somewhere a whisper a murmur growing louder and louder grass growing blossoms opening soil shifting crumbling a great whisper a mix of shadows and shades something rising something moving ice froze beneath his skin his heart ceased outside in the dark in the yard autumn had arrived october was there his garden gave him a harvest last rites harrison cooper was not that old only thirtynine touching at the warm rim of forty rather than the cold rim of thirty which makes a great difference in temperature and attitude he was a genius verging on the brilliant unmarried unengaged with no children that he could honestly claim so having nothing much else to do woke one morning in the summer of weeping why out of bed he faced his mirror to watch the tears examine his sadness trace the woe like a child curious after emotion he charted his own map found no capital city of despair but only a vast and empty expanse of sorrow and went to shave which didnt help for harrison cooper had stumbled on some secret supply of melancholy that even as he shaved spilled in rivulets down his soaped cheeks great god he cried im at a funeral but whos dead he ate his breakfast toast somewhat soggier than usual and plunged off to his laboratory to see if gazing at his time traveler would solve the mystery of eyes that shed rain while the rest of him stood fair time traveler all yes for harrison cooper had spent the better part of his third decade wiring circuitries of impossible pasts and as yet untouchable futures most men philosophize in their asbeautifulaswomen cars harrison cooper chose to dream and knock together from pure air and electric thunderclaps what he called his mobius machine he had told his friends with winecolored nonchalance that he was taking a future strip and a past strip giving them a now half twist so they looped on a single plane like those figureeight ribbons cut and pasted by that dear mathematician a f mobius in the nineteenth century ah yes mobius friends murmured what they really meant was ah no good night harrison cooper was not a mad scientist but he was irretrievably boring knowing this he had retreated to finish the mobius machine now this strange morning with cold rain streaming from his eyes he stood staring at the damned contraption bewildered that he was not dancing about with creations joy he was interrupted by the ringing of the laboratory doorbell and opened the door to find one of those rare people a real western union delivery boy on a real bike he signed for the telegram and was about to shut the door when he saw the lad staring fixedly at the mobius machine what exclaimed the boy eyes wide is that harrison cooper stood aside and let the boy wander in a great circle around his machine his eyes dancing up over and around the immense circling figure eight of shining copper brass and silver sure cried the boy at last beaming a time machine bullseye when do you leave said the boy where will you go to meet which person where alexander caesar napoleon hitler no no the boy exploded his list lincoln more like it general grant roosevelt benjamin franklin franklin yes arent you lucky am i stunned harrison cooper found himself nodding yes by god and suddenly suddenly he knew why he had wept at dawn he grabbed the young lads hand much thanks youre a catalyst cat a rorschach testmaking me draw my own listnow gently swiftlyout no offense the door slammed he ran for his library phone punched numbers waited scanning the thousand books on the shelves yes yes he murmured his eyes flicking over the gorgeous sunbright titles some of you two three maybe four hello sam samuel can you get here in five minutes make it three dire emergency come he slammed the phone swiveled to reach out and touch shakespeare he murmured willywilliam will it beyou the laboratory door opened and samsamuel stuck his head in and froze for there seated in the midst of his great mobius figure eight leather jacket and boots shined picnic lunch packed was harrison cooper arms flexed elbows out fingers alert to the computer controls wheres your lindbergh cap and goggles asked samuel harrison cooper dug them out put them on smirking raise the titanic then sink it samuel strode to the lovely machine to confront its rather outre occupant well cooper what he cried i woke this morning in tears sure i read the phone book aloud last night that did it no you read me these cooper handed the books over sure we gabbed till three drunk as owls on english lit to give me tears for answers to what to their loss to the fact that they died unknown unrecognized to the grim fact that some were only truly recognized republished raved over from on cut the cackle and move the buns said samuel did you call to sermonize or ask advice harrison cooper leaped from his machine and elbowed samuel into the library you must map my trip for me trip trip i go ajourneying fartraveling the grand literary tour a salvation army of one to save lives no souls what good is life if the souls dead sit tell me all the authors we raved on by night to weep me at dawn heres brandy drink remember i do list them then the new england

we spoke go on well samuel gulped his brandy fire burned his eyes write this down they wrote and ran what will you do when you get there librarian doctor harrison cooper seated back in the shadow of the great hovering mobius ribbon laughed and nodded yes harrison cooper lmd literary meadow doctor curer of fine old lions off their feed in dire need of tender love small applause the wine of words all in my heart all on my tongue say ah so long goodbye god bless he slammed a lever whirled a knob and the machine in a spiral of metal a whisk of butterfly ribbon very simplyvanished a moment later the mobius machine gave a twist of its atoms andreturned voila cried harrison cooper pinkfaced and wildeyed its done so soon exclaimed his friend samuel a minute here but hours there did you succeed look proof positive for tears dripped off his chin what happened what this and this andthis a gyroscope spun a celebratory ribbon spiraled endlessly on itself and the ghost of a massive window curtain haunted the air exhaled and then ceased as if fallen from a deliverychute the books arrived almost before the footfalls and then the halfseen feet and then the fogwrapped legs and body and at last the head of a man who as the ribbon spiraled itself back into emptiness crouched over the volumes as if warming himself at a hearth he touched the books and listened to the air in the dim hallway where dinnertime voices drifted up from below and a door stood wide near his elbow from which the faint scent of illness came and went arrived and departed with the stilted breathing of some patient within the room plates and silverware sounded from the world of evening and quiet good health downstairs the hall and the sickroom were for a time deserted in a moment someone might ascend with a tray for the halfsleeping man in the intemperate room harrison cooper rose with stealth checking the stairwell and then carrying a sweet burden of books moved into the room where candles lit both sides of a bed on which the dying man lay supine arms straight at his sides head weighting the pillow eyes grimaced shut mouth set as if daring the ceiling mortality itself to sink and extinguish him at the first touch of the books now on one side now on the other of his bed the old mans eyelids fluttered his dry lips cracked the air whistled from his nostrils whos there he whispered what time is it whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can replied the traveler at the foot of the bed quietly what what the old man in the bed whispered swiftly it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation quoted the visitor who now moved to place a book under each of the dying mans hands where his tremoring fingers could scratch pull away then touch braillelike again one by one the stranger held up book after book to show the covers then a page and yet another title page where printed dates of this novel surfed up adrift but to stay forever on some far future shore the sick mans eyes lingered over the covers the tides the dates and then fixed to his visitors bright face he exhaled stunned my god you have the look of a traveler from where do the years show harrison cooper leaned forward well theni bring you an annunciation such things come to pass only with virgins whispered the old man no virgin lies here buried under his unread books i come to unbury you i bring tidings from a far place the sick mans eyes moved to the books beneath his trembling hands mine he whispered the traveler nodded solemnly but began to smile when the color in the old mans face grew warmer arid the expression in his eyes and on his mouth was suddenly eager is there hope then there is i believe you the old man took a breath and then wondered why because said the stranger at the foot of the bed i love you i do not know you sir but i know you fore and aft port to starboard main topgallants to gunnels every day in your long life to here oh the sweet sound cried the old man every word that you say every light from your eyes is foundationoftheworld true how can it be tears winked from the old mans lids why because i am the truth said the traveler i have come a long way to find and say you are not lost your great beast has only drowned some little while in another year lost ahead great and glorious plain and simple men will gather at your grave and shout he breeches he rises he breeches he rises and the white shape will surface to the light the great terror lift into the storm and thunderous st elmos fire and you with him each bound to each and no way to tell where he stops and you start or where you stop and he goes off around the world lifting a fleet of libraries in his and your wake through nameless seas of subsublibrarians and readers mobbing the docks to chart your far journeyings alert for your lost cries at three of a wild morn christs wounds said the man in his windingsheet bedclothes to the point man the point do you speak truth i give you my hand on it and pledge my soul and my hearts blood the visitor moved to do just this and the two mens fists fused as one take these gifts to the grave count these pages like a rosary in your last hours tell no one where they came from scoffers would knock the ritual beads from your fingers so tell this rosary in the dark before dawn and the rosary is this you will live forever you are immortal no more of this no more be still i can not hear me where you have passed a fire path will burn miraculous in the bengal bay the indian seas hopes cape and around the horn past perditions landfall as far as living eyes can see he gripped the old mans fist ever more tightly i swear in the years ahead a million millions will crowd your grave to sleep you well and warm your bones do you hear great god you are a proper priest to sound my last rites and will i enjoy my own funeral i will his hands freed clung to the books at each side as the ardent visitor raised yet other books and intoned the dates nineteen twentytwo can you read and know what it means he held the last volume close to the old mans face the fiery eyes moved the old mouth creaked nineteen ninety yours one hundred years from tonight dear god i must go but i would hear chapter one speak the old mans eyes slid and burned he licked his lips traced the words and at last whispered beginning to weep call me ishmael there was snow and more snow and more snow after that in the dissolving whiteness the silver ribbon twirled in a massive whisper to let forth in an exhalation of time the journeying librarian and his book bag as if slicing white bread rinsed by snow the ribbon as the traveler ghosted himself to flesh sifted him through the hospital wall into a room as white as december there abandoned lay a man as pale as the snow and the wind almost young he slept with his mustaches oiled to his lip by fever he seemed not to know nor care that a messenger had invaded the air near his bed his eyes did not stir nor did his mouth increase the passage of breath his hands at his sides did not open to receive he seemed already lost in a bomb and only his unexpected visitors voice caused his eyes to roll behind their shut lids are you forgotten a voice asked unborn the pale man replied never remembered only only in france wrote nothing at all not worthy feel the weight of what i place on your bed no dont look feel tombstones with names yes but not tombstones not marble but paper dates yes but the day after tomorrow and tomorrow and ten thousand after that and your name on each it will not be is let me speak the names listen masque red death the fall of usher pit pendulum telltale heart my heart heart repeat for the love of god montresor silly repeat montresor for the love of god for the love of god montresor do you see this label i see read the date nineteen ninetyfour no such date again and the name of the wine nineteen ninetyfour amontillado and my name yes now shake your head make the foolscap bells ring heres mortar for the last brick quickly im here to bury you alive with books when death comes how will you greet him with a shout and requiescat in pace say it again requiescat in pace the time wind roared the room emptied nurses ran in summoned by laughter and tried to seize the books that weighed down his joy whats he saying someone cried in paris an hour a day a year a minute later there was a run of st elmos fire along a church steeple a blue glow in a dark alley a soft tread at a street corner a turnabout of wind like an invisible carousel and then footfalls up a stair to a door which opened on a bedroom where a window looked out upon cafes filled with people and far music and in a bed by the window a tall man lying his pale face immobile until he heard alien breath in his room the shadow of a man stood over him and now leaned down so that the light from the window revealed a face and a mouth as it inhaled and then spoke the single word that the mouth said was oscar the other highway they drove into green sundaymorning country away from the hot aluminum city and watched as the sky was set free and moved over them like a lake they had never known was there amazingly blue and with white breakers above them as they traveled clarence travers slowed the car and felt the cool wind move over his face with the smell of cut grass he reached over to grasp his wifes hand and glanced at his son and daughter in the backseat not fighting at least for this moment as the car moved through one quiet beauty after another in what might be a sunday so lush and green it would never end thank god were doing this said cecelia travers its been a million years since we got away he felt her hand hug his and then relax completely when i think of all those ladies dropping dead from the heat at the cocktail parry this afternoon welt well indeed said clarence travers onward he pressed the gas pedal and they moved faster their progress out of the city had been mildly hysterical with cars shrieking and shoving them toward islands of wilderness praying for picnics that might not be found seeing that he had put the car in the fast lane he slowed to gradually move himself and his family through the banshee traffic until they were idling along at an almost reasonable fifty miles an hour the scents of flowers and trees that blew in the window made his move worthwhile he laughed at nothing at all and said sometimes when i get this far out i think lets just keep driving never go back to the damned city lets drive a hundred miles shouted his son a thousand cried his daughter a thousand said clarence travers but one slow mile at a time and then said softly hey and as suddenly as if they had dreamed it up the lost highway came into view wonderful said mr clarence travers what asked the children look said clarence travers leaning over his wife pointing thats the old road the one they used a long time ago that said his wife its awfully small said his son well there werent many cars then they didnt need much it looks like a big snake said his daughter yeah the old roads used to twist and turn all right remember cecelia travers nodded the car had slowed and they gazed over at that narrow concrete strip with the green grass buckling it gently here or there and sprays of wildflowers nestling up close to either side and the morning sunlight coming down through the high elms and maples and oaks that led the way toward the forest i know it like the nose on my face said clarence travers how would you like to ride on it oh clarence now i mean it oh daddy could we all right well do it he said decisively we cant said cecelia travers its probably against the law it cant be safe but before his wife could finish he turned off the freeway and let all the swift cars rush on while he drove smiling at each bump down over a small ditch toward the old road clarence please well be arrested for going ten miles an hour on a highway nobody uses anymore lets not kick over any beehives its too nice a day ill buy you all soda pops if you behave they reached the old road see how simple now which way kids that way that way easy as pie and he let the car take them away on the old highway the great whitegray boa constrictor that lashed now slowly this way in green mossvelvet meadows looped over gentle hills and lowered itself majestically into caves of moistsmelling trees through the odor of cricks and spring mud and crystal water that rustled like sheets of cellophane over small stone falls they drove slow enough to see the waterspiders enigmatic etchings on quiet pools behind dams of last octobers leaves daddy what are those what the waterskaters no one has ever caught one you wait and wait and put your hand out and bang the spiders gone theyre the first things in life you cant grab onto the list gets bigger as you grow old so start small dont believe in them theyre not really there its fun thinking they are you have just stated a deep philosophical truth now drive on mr travers and obeying his own command with good humor he drove on and they came to a forest that had been like november all through the winter and now reluctantly was putting out green flags to welcome the season butterflies in great tosses of confetti leaped from the deeps of the forest to ramble drunkenly on the air their thousand torn shadows following over grass and water lets go back now said cecelia travers aw mom said the son and daughter why said clarence travers my god how many kids back in that damned hot town can say they drove on a road nobody else has used in years not one not one with a father brave enough to cross a little grass to take the old way right mrs travers lapsed into silence right there said clarence travers over that hill the highway turns left then right then left again an s curve and another s wait and see left right left an s curve the car purred another s just like you said look clarence travers pointed a hundred yards across the way from them the freeway suddenly appeared for a few yards before it vanished screaming behind stacks of playingcard billboards clarence travers stared fixedly at it and the grass between it and this shadowed path this silent place like the bottom of an old stream where tides used to come but came no more where the wind ran through nights making the old sound of far traffic you know something said the wife that freeway over there scares me can we drive home on this old road instead dad said the son i wish we could ive always been scared said the wife watching that other traffic roaring by gone before it arrived were all afraid said clarence travers but you pay your money and take your chance well his wife sighed damn get back on that dreadful thing not quite yet said clarence travers and drove to reach a small very small village all quite unexpected a settlement no more than a dozen white clapboard houses mossed under giant trees dreaming in a green tide of water and leafshadow with wind shaking the rocking chairs on weathered porches and dogs sleeping in the cool nap of grasscarpeting at noon and a small general store with a dirty red gas pump out front they drew up there and got out and stood unreal in the sudden lack of motion not quite accepting these houses lost in the wilderness the door to the general store squealed open and an old man stepped out blinked at them and said say did you folks just come down that old road clarence travers avoided his wifes accusing eyes yes sir no one on that road in twenty years we were out for a lark said mr travers and found a peacock he added a sparrow said his wife the freeway passed us by a mile over there if you want it said the old man when the new road opened this town just died on the vine we got nothing here now but people like me that is old looks like thered be places here to rent mister just walk in knock out the bats stomp the spiders and any place is yours for thirty bucks a month i own the whole town oh were not really interested said cecelia travers didnt think you would be said the old man too far out from the city too far off the freeway and that dirt road there slops over when it rains all muck and mud and heck its against the law to use that path not that they ever patrol it the old man snorted shaking his head and not that ill turn you in but it gave me a nice start just now to see you coming down that rut j had to give a quick look at my calendar by god and make sure it wasnt lord i remember thought clarence travers this is fox hill a thousand people lived here i was a kid we passed through on summer nights we used to stop here late late and me sleeping in the backseat in the moonlight my grandmother and grandfather in back with me its nice to sleep in a car driving late and the road all white watching the stars turn as you take the curves listening to the grownups voices underwater remote talking talking laughing murmuring whispering my father driving so stolid just to be driving in the summer dark up along the lake to the dunes where the poison ivy grew out on the lonely beach and the wind stayed all the time and never went away and us driving by that lonely graveyard place of sand and moonlight and poison ivy and the waves tumbling in like dusty ash on the shore the lake pounding like a locomotive on the sand coming and going and me crumpled down and smelling grandmothers windcooled coat and the voices comforting and blanketing me with their solidity and their alwayswillbehere sounds that would go on forever myself always young and us always riding on a summer night in our old kissel with the side flaps down and stopping here at nine or ten for pistachio and tuttifrutti ice cream that tasted faintly beautifully of gasoline all of us licking and biting the cones and smelling the gasoline and driving on sleepy and snug toward home green town thirty years ago he caught himself and said about these houses would it be much trouble fixing them up he squinted at the old man well yes and no most of em over fifty years old lots of dust you could buy one off me for ten thousand a real bargain now youll admit if you were an artist now a painter or something like that i write copy in an advertising firm write stories too no doubt well now you get a writer out here quiet no neighbors youd do lots of writing cecelia travers stood silently between the old man and her husband clarence travers did not look at her but looked at the cinders around the porch of the general store i imagine i could work here sure said the old man ive often thought said mr travers its time we got away from the city and took it a little easy sure said the old man mrs travers said nothing but searched in her purse and took out a minor would you like some drinks asked clarence travers with exaggerated concern three orange crushes make it four he told the old man the old man moved inside the store which smelled of nails and crackers and dust when the old man was gone mr travers turned to his wife and his eyes were shining weve always wanted to do it lets do what she said move out here snap decision why not why weve promised ourselves every year get away from the noise the confusion so the kidsd have a place to play and good grief the wife cried the old man moved inside the store coughing ridiculous she lowered her voice weve got the apartment paid up youve got a fine job the kids have school with friends i belong to some fine clubs and weve just spent a bundle redecorating we listen he said as if she were really listening none of thats important out here we can breathe back in town hell you complain just to have something to complain about your clubs cant be that important its not clubs its friends how many would care if we dropped dead tomorrow he said if i got hit in that traffic how many thousand cars would run over me before one stopped to see if i was a man or dog left in the road your job she started to say my god ten years ago we said in two more years well have enough money to quit and write my novel but each year weve said next year and next year and next year weve had fun havent we sure subways are fun buses are fun martinis and drunken friends are fun advertising yeah but ive used all the fun there is i want to write about what ive seen now and theres no better place than this look at that house over there cant you just see me in the front window banging the hell out of my typewriter stop hyperventilating hyperventilate god id jump for joy to quit ive gone as far as i can go come on cecelia lets get back some of the spunk in our marriage take a chance the children wed love it here said the son i think said the daughter im not getting any younger said clarence travers nor am i she said touching his arm but we cant play hopscotch now when the children leave yes well think about it children hopscotch my god ill take my typewriter to the grave it wont be long we the shop door squealed open again and whether the old man had been standing in the screen shadow for the last minute there was no telling it did not show in his face he stepped out with four lukewarm bottles of orange crush in his rustspotted hands here you are he said clarence and cecelia travers turned to stare at him as if he were a stranger come out to bring them drinks they smiled and took the bottles the four of them stood drinking the soda pop in the warm sunlight the summer wind blew through the grottoes of trees in the old shady town it was like being in a great green church a cathedral the trees so high that the people and cottages were lost far down below all night long you would imagine those trees rustling their leaves like an ocean on an unending shore god thought clarence travers you could really sleep here the sleep of the dead and the peacefillofheart he finished his drink and his wife half finished hers and gave it to the children to argue over inch by compared inch the old man stood silent embarrassed by the thing he may have stirred up among them well if youre ever out this way drop in he said clarence travers reached for his wallet no no said the old man its on the house thank you thank you very much a pleasure they climbed back into their car if you want to get to the freeway said the old man peering through the front window into the cookedupholstery smell of the car just take your old dirt road back dont rush or youll break an axle clarence travers looked straight ahead at the radiator fixture on the car front and started the motor goodbye said the old man goodbye the children yelled and waved the car moved away through the town did you hear what the old man said asked the wife what did you hear him say which way to the freeway i heard he drove through the cool shady town staring at the porches and the windows with the colored glass fringing them if you looked from the inside of those windows out people had differentcolored faces for each pane you looked through they were chinese if you looked through one indian through another pink green violet burgundy wine chartreuse the candy colors the lemonlime cool colors the water colors of the windows looking out on lawns and trees and this car slowly driving past yes i heard him said clarence travers they left the town behind and took the dirt road to the freeway they waited their chance saw an interval between floods of cars hurtling by swerved out into the stream and at fifty miles an hour were soon hurtling toward the city thats better said cecelia travers brightly she did not look over at her husband now i know where we are billboards flashed by a mortuary a pie crust a cereal a garage a hotel a hotel in the tar pits of the city where one day is the pitiless glare of the noon sun thought mr travers all of the great erectorset buildings like prehistoric dinosaurs will sink down into the bubbling tarlava and be encased bone by bone for future civilizations and in the stomachs of the electric lizards inside the iron dinosaurs the probing scientists of ad one million will find the little ivory bones the thinly articulated skeletons of advertising executives and clubwomen and children mr travers felt his eyes flinch watering and the scientists will say so this is what the iron cities fed on is it and give the bones a kick so this is what kept the iron stomachs full eh poor things they never had a chance probably kept by the iron monsters who needed them in order to survive who needed them for breakfast lunch and dinner aphids in a way aphids kept in a great metal cage look daddy look look before its too late the children pointed yelling cecelia travers did not look only the children saw it the old highway two hundred yards away at their left sprang back into sight for an instant wandered aimlessly through field meadow and stream gentle and cool and quiet mr travers swung his head sharply to see but in that instant it was gone billboards trees hills rushed it away a thousand cars honking shrieking shouldered them and bore clarence and cecelia travers and their captive children stunned and silent down the concourse onward ever onward into a city that had not seen them leave and did not look to see them return lets see if this car will do sixty or sixtyfive said clarence travers it could and did take haste to live an afterword when i was eight years old in an incredible event occurred on the back wall outside the academy motion picture theater in waukegan illinois an advertising broadside some thirty feet long and twenty feet high dramatized blackstone the magician in half a dozen miraculous poses sawing a lady in half tied to an arabian cannon that exploded taking him with it dancing a live handkerchief in midair causing a birdcage with a live canary to vanish between his fingers causing an elephant to well you get the idea i must have stood there for hours frozen with awe i knew then that someday i must become a magician thats what happened didnt it im not a science fiction fantasy magicrealism writer of fairy tales and surrealist poems quicker than the eye may well be the best title i have ever conjured for a new collection i pretend to do one thing cause you to blink and in the instant seize twenty bright silks out of a bottomless hat how does he do that may well be asked i really cant say i dont write these stories they write me which causes me to live with a boundless enthusiasm for writing and life that some misinterpret as optimism nonsense i am merely a practitioner of optimal behavior which means behave yourself listen to your muses get your work done and enjoy the sense that you just might live forever i dont have to wait for inspiration it jolts me every morning just before dawn when i would prefer to sleep in the damned stuff speaks between my ears with my theater of morning voices yes yes i know that sounds awfully artsy and no no i am not preaching some sort of psychic summons the voices exist because i stashed them there every day for a lifetime by reading writing and living they accumulated and began to speak soon after high school in other words i do not greet each day with a glad cry but am forced out of bed by these whispering nags drag myself to the typewriter and am soon awake and alive as the notionfancyconcept quits my ears runs down my elbows and out my fingers two hours later a new story is done that all night hid asleep behind my medulla oblongata that dont you agree is not optimism its behavior optimal i dare not oppose these morning voices if i did they would ransack my conscience all day besides i am as out of control as a car off a cliff what began as a numbed frenzy before breakfast ends with elation at noon lunch how did i find these metaphors let me count the ways you discover your wife is pregnant with your first child soon to be born so you name the embryonic presence sascha and converse with this increasingly bright fetus that evolves into a story that you love but no one wants so here it is you wonder whatever happened to dorian grays portrait your second thoughts grow to an outsize horror by nightfall you upchuck this hairball into your typewriter some of these stories happened to me quicker than the eye was part of a magic show i attended where with dismay i saw someone much like myself being made a fool of onstage no news or what killed the dog was a victrola record i played all day every day when i was five until the neighbors offered to break me or the record choose that woman on the lawn was first a poem that then turned into a story about my mother as a young and needful woman a topic we care to discuss only with euphemisms another fine mess resulted from my writing the laurel and hardy love affair there had to be a sequel because when i arrived in ireland forty years ago the irish times announced laurel and hardy one time only in person for the irish orphans olympia theater dublin i rushed to the theater and bought the last ticket front row center the curtain rose and there they were stan and ollie doing all their old sweet wondrous routines i sat with happy tears streaming down my face later i went backstage and stood by their dressing room door watching them greet friends i didnt introduce myself i just wanted to warm my hands and heart after twenty minutes of ambience bathing i slipped away thus another fine mess unterderseaboat doktor is an example of people not hearing themselves talk a writer friend at lunch some years back described his psychiatrist a former submarine captain in hitlers undersea fleet holy god i cried give me a pencil i scribbled a title and finished the tale that night my writer friend hated me for weeks last rites wrote itself because i am the greatest lover of other writers old or new who ever lived i have never been jealous of any writer i only wanted to write and dream like them that makes for an enormous list some of them firstclass ladies as well as writers first class willa cather jessamyn west katherine anne porter eudora weelty and long before her current fame edith wharton last rites shuttles in time to pay my respects to three of my heroes poe melville and a third writer nameless until the finale it crazed me to perceive that these giants died thinking they were to be buried unknown and unread i had to invent a time machine to celebrate them on their deathbeds some of the stories are selfevident at the end of the ninth year is the sort of quasiscientific factoid we all discuss a dozen times but neglect to write the other highway lies beside the main route heading north from los angeles it has all but vanished under grass bushes trees and avalanched soil here and there you can still bike it for some few hundred yards before it melts into the earth once more legato spontaneously combusted one afternoon when i heard a treeful of birds orchestrating berlioz and then albeniz if you know the history of paris during the s commune and haussmann who tore it down and built it back to the wonder it is now and if you have experienced some los angeles earthquakes you could guess the genesis of zaharoffrichter mark v during the last high shake two years ago i thought my god the damn fools built the city on the san andreas fault my next thought what if they built it that way on purpose two hours later the story was cooling on the windowsill thats not all but it should do my final advice to myself the boy magician grown old and you when your dawn theater sounds to clear your sinuses dont delay jump those voices may be gone before you hit the shower to align your wits speed is everything the mph dash to your machine is a sure cure for life rampant and death most real make haste to live oh god yes live and write with great haste
