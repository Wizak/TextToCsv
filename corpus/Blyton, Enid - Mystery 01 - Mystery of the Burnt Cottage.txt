mystery mystery of the burnt cottage blyton enid the five findouters and buster the dog the burning cottage it was at halfpast nine on a dark april night that all the excitement began the village of peterswood was perfectly quiet and peaceful except for a dog barking somewhere then suddenly to the west of the village a great light flared up larry daykin was just getting into bed when he saw it he had pulled back his curtains so that the daylight would wake him and he suddenly saw the flare to the west golly whats that he said he called to his sister daisy i say come here and look theres a funny flareup down in the village somewhere his sister came into the bedroom in her nightdress she looked out of the window its a fire she said it looks pretty big doesnt it i wonder what it is do you think its some ones house on fire wed better go and see said larry excited lets get dressed again mummy and daddy are out so they wont know anything about the fire come on hurry larry and daisy dressed quickly and then ran down the stairs and out into the dark garden as they went down the lane they passed another house and heard the sound of hurrying footsteps coming down the drive there its pip i bet said larry and shone his torch up the drive the light picked out a boy about his own age and with him a small girl of about eight hallo bets you coming too called daisy surprised i should have thought youd have been asleep larry called pip its a fire isnt it whose house is burning do you think will they send for the fireengine the house will be burnt down before the firemen come all the way from the next village said larry come on it looks as if its down haycock lane they all ran on together some of the villagers had seen the glare too and were running down the lane as well it was exciting its mr hicks house said a man sure as anything its his house they all poured down to the end of the lane the glare became higher and brighter its not the house cried larry its the cottage he works in in the garden his workroom golly there wont be much left of it there certainly wouldnt the place was old halftimbered and thatched and the dry straw of the roof was blazing strongly mr goon the village policeman was there directing men to throw water on the flames he saw the children and shouted at them clear orf you clear orf thats what he always says to children said bets ive never heard him say anything else it was not the least use throwing pails of water on the flames the policeman yelled for the chauffeur wheres mr thomas tell him to get out the hosepipe he uses to clean the car mr thomas has gone to fetch the master shouted a womans voice hes gone to the station to meet the london train it was mrs minns the cook speaking she was a fat comfortablelooking person who was in a very scared state now she filled pails of water from a tap her hands trembling its no use said one of the villagers cant stop this fire now its got too big a hold some ones phoned for the fireengine said another man but by the time it gets here the whole place will be gone well theres no fear of the house catching said the policeman winds in the opposite direction luckily my word what a shock for mr hick when he comes home the four children watched everything witii excitement its a shame too see such a nice little cottage go up in flames said larry i wish theyd let us do something throw water for instance a boy about the same size as larry ran up with a pail of water and threw it towards the flames but his aim was bad and some of it went over larry he shouted at the boy hey you i some of that went over me look what youre doing for goodness sake sorry old boy said the boy in a funny drawling sort of voice the flames shot up and lighted the whole garden well larry saw that the boy was plump welldressed and rather pleased with hihiself hes the boy who has come to live with his father and mother in the inn opposite said pip in a low voice to larry hes awful thinks he knows everything and has so much pocketmoney he doesnt know what to do with it the policeman saw the boy carrying the pail here you he yelled clear orf we dont want children getting in the way i am not a child said the boy indignantly cant you see im helping you clear orf said mr goon a dog suddenly appeared and barked round the policemans ankles in a most annoying way mr goon was angry he kicked out at the dog this your dog he called to the boy call him orf the boy took no notice but went to get another pail of water the dog had a wonderful time round mr goons trousered ankles clear orf said the policeman kicking out again larry and the others chuckled the dog was a nice little thing a black scottie very nimble on his short legs he belongs to that boy said pip hes a topping dog absolutely full of fun i wish he was mine a shower of sparks flew up into the air as part of the straw roof fell in there was a horrible smell of burning and smoke the children moved back a little there came the sound of a car down the lane a shout went up heres mr hick the car drew up in the drive by the house a man got out and ran down the garden to where the burning cottage stood mr hick sir sorry to say your workroom is almost destroyed said the policeman did our best to save it sir but the fire got too big a hold any idea what caused the fire sir how am i to know said mr hick impatiently ive only just got back from the london train why wasnt the fireengine sent for well sir you know its in the next town said mr goon and by the time we knew of the fire the flames were already shooting through the roof do you happen to know if you had a fire in the grate this morning sir yes i did said mr hick i was working here early this morning and i had kept the fire in all night i was burning wood and i dare say that after i left a spark flew out and set light to something it may have smouldered all afternoon without any one knowing wheres mrs minns my cook here sir said poor fat trembling mrs minns oh sir this is a terrible thing sir you never like me to go into your workcottage sir so i didnt go in or i might have seen that a fire was starting the door was locked said the policeman i tried it myself before the flames got round to it well there goes the last of your cottage sir there was a crash as the halftimbered walls fell in the flames rose high and every one stepped back for the heat was terrific then mr hick suddenly seemed to go mad he caught hold of the policemans arm and shook it hard my papers he said in a shaking voice my precious old documents they were in there get them out get them out now sir be reasonable said mr goon looking at the furnace not far from him no one can save anything at all they couldnt from the beginning my papers yelled mr hick and made a dart towards the burning workroom as if he meant to search in the flames two or three people pulled him back now sir now sir dont do anything silly said the policeman anxiously were they very valuable papers sir cant be replaced moaned mr hick they are worth thousands of pounds to me hope theyre insured sir said a man near by mr hick turned to him wildly yes yes theyre insured but money wont repay me for losing them bets did not know what being insured was larry told her quickly if you have anything valuable that you are afraid might be stolen or burnt you pay a small sum of money to an insurance company each year and then if it does happen to be destroyed the company will pay you the whole cost of your valuable belongings i see said bets she stared at mr hick he still seemed very upset indeed she thought he was a funny looking man he was tall and stooping and had a tuft of hair that stuck out in front he had a long nose and eyes hidden behind big spectacles bets didnt much like him clear all these people away said mr hick looking at the villagers and the children i dont want my garden trampled down all night long theres nothing any one can do now right sir said mr goon pleased at being able to clear orf so many people at once he began to walk towards the watching people clear orf he said nothing to be done now clear orf you children clear orf every one the flames of the cottage were burning low now the fire would burn itself outs and that would be the end the children suddenly felt sleepy after their excitement and their eyes smarted with the smoke pooh my clothes do smel of smoke said larry disgusted dime on lets get back home i wonder if mummy and daddy are back yet larry and daisy walked up the lane with pip and bets behind them whistlings walked the boy with the dog he caught them up that was a real thrill wasnt it he said good thing no one was hurt i say what about meeting tomorrow having a game or something im all alone at that hotel opposite mr hicks garden my mother and father are out golfing all day well said larry who didnt particularly like the look of the boy well if we are anywhere about well pick you up right said the boy come on buster home boy the little seattle who had been circling round the childrens legs ran to the boy they disappeared into the darkness conceited fat creature said daisy speaking of the boy why should he think we want to know him i say lets all meet in your drive tomorrow pip and go down to see whats left of the cottage shall we right said pip turning in at his drive with bets come on bets i believe you are nearly asleep larry and daisy went on up the lane to their own home they yawned poor mr hick said daisy wasnt he upset about his precious old papers the five findouters and dog the next day larry and daisy went to see if pip and bets were anywhere about they could hear them playing in the garden and they shouted to them pip bets were here pip appeared followed by the much smaller bets panting behind him seen the burntup cottage this morning asked larry yes and i say what do you think they say somebody burnt it down on purpose that it wasnt an accident after all said pip excited on purpose said larry and daisy but whoever would do a thing like that dont know said pip i overheard somebody talking about it they said that the insurance people had been down already and some fire expert they brought with them said that petrol had been used to start up the fire theyve got some way of finding out these things you know golly said larry but who would do it somebody that didnt like mr hick i suppose yes said pip i bet old clearorf is excited to have a real crime to find out about but hes so stupid hell never find out a thing look theres that dog again said bets pointing to the little black scottie appearing in the garden he stood sturdily on his squat legs his ears cocked looking up at them as if to say mind me being here hallo buster said larry bending down and patting his knee to make the dog come to him youre a nice dog you are i wish you were mine daisy and i have never had a dog nor have i said pip here buster bone buster biscuit buster woof said buster in a surprisingly deep voice for such a small dog you must get him a bone and a biscuit said bets hes trusting you and believing you pip go and get them for him pip went off with the squat little scottie trotting beside him trustingly soon they were back buster carrying a bone and a big biscuit in his mouth he set them down on the ground and looked inquiringly at pip yes theyre for you old chap said pip hes not a bit of a greedy dog is he he waits to be told before he begins buster crunched up the bone and then swallowed the biscuit they seemed to fill him with joy and he began to caper round and about the children inviting them to chase him they all thought him a wonderful little dog its a pity he has such a silly fat sausage for a master said larry every one giggled the dogs young master did look rather sausagey and fat just as they were chuckling they heard the sound of footsteps and saw busters master coming to join them hallo he said i thought i heard you playing with buster buster what do you mean by running off like that come here sir buster bounced over to him in delight it was quite plain that he adored the plump boy who owned him heard the news asked the boy patting buster about some one having fired that workroom on purpose yes said larry pip told us do you believe it rather said the boy as a matter of fact i suspected it before any one else did fibber said larry at once knowing by the conceited tone of the boys voice that he hadnt suspected anything of the sort well look here said the boy ive been staying in the hotel opposite mr hicks garden and last evening i saw a tramp wandering about there i bet he did it the others stared at him why should he do it asked pip at last tramps dont go in and pour petrol over things and set them on fire just for fun well said the boy thinking hard this tramp may have had a spite against mr hick you cant tell mr hick hasnt got a very good name about here for being goodtempered he may have kicked the old tramp out of the place or something that very morning the others thought about this lets go into the summerhouse and talk said pip feeling excited this is a sort of mystery and it would be fun if we could help to solve it the boy with buster walked into the summerhouse too without being asked buster scrambled on to larrys knee larry looked pleased what time did you see the tramp asked pip about six oclock said the boy a dirty old fellow he was too in a torn mackintosh and a frightful old hat he was skulking along the hedge buster saw him and tore out barking did you notice if he had a tin of petrol in his hand asked larry no he hadnt said the boy hed got a stick of some sort thats all i say said daisy suddenly i say ive got an idea they all looked at her daisy was a great one for ideas and usually she had good ones whats the idea this time asked larry well be detectives said daisy well set ourselves to find out who burnt the cottage whats a detective asked eightyearold bets its somebody who solves a mystery said larry somebody who finds out who does a crime oh a findouter said bets id love to be that im sure i would make a very good findouter no youre too little said pip bets looked ready to cry we three older ones will be proper detectives said larry his eyes shining pip daisy and me the three great detectives cant i belong said the fat boy at once ive got plenty of brains the others looked at him doubtfully his brains didnt show in his face anyway well we dont know you said larry my name is frederick algernon trotteville said the boy what are your names mine is laurence daykin said larry and im thirteen mines margaret daykin and im twelve said daisy im philip hilton aged twelve and this is elizabeth my babysister said pip the boy stared at them youre none of you called by your names are you he said larry for laurence pip for philip daisy for margaret and bets for elizabeth im always called frederick for some reason this seemed funny to the others the boy spoke in a drawling affected kind of voice and somehow the name of frederick algernon trotteville just seemed to suit him f for frederick a for algernon t for trotteville said pip suddenly with a grin fat it describes you rather well frederick algernon trotteville looked rather cross at first then he gave a grin i am rather fat arent i he said ive an awful appetite and i expect i eat too much your parents ought to have known better than to give you three names whose initials spelt fat said daisy poor old fatty frederick algernon sighed he knew quite well that from now on he would be fatty he had already been tubby and sausage at school now he would be fatty in the holidays he gazed at the little company of four friends can i belong to the detectiveclub he asked after all i did tell you about the tramp it isnt a club said larry its just us three older ones banding together to solve a mystery and me too cried bets oh do say i can too youre not to leave me out dont leave her out said fatty unexpectedly shes only little but she might be some use and i think buster ought to belong too he might be awfully good at smelling out hidden things what hidden things said larry oh i dont know said fatty vaguely you simply never know what you are going to find when you begin to solve a mystery oh lets all belong fatty and buster too please cried bets buster felt the excitement and began to whine a little pawing at larry with a small black foot the three bigger ones felt much more inclined to let fatty join them once they realized that buster could come too for busters sake they were willing to have fatty plump conceited and stupid buster could be a sort of bloodhound they felt certain that real detectives who solved all sorts of mysteries would have a bloodhound well said larry well all belong and try to solve the mystery of the burnt cottage were the five findouters and dog said bets every one laughed what a silly name said lany but all the same it stuck and for the rest of those holidays and for a very long time after the five findouters and dog used that name continually for thehiselves i know all about police and detectives said fatty id better be the head of us no you wont said larry i bet you dont know any more than the rest of us and dont think that were so stupid as not to see what a very good opinion youve got of yourself you might as well make up your mind straightaway that we shant believe half the tall stories you tell us as for being head shall be i always am thats right said pip larrys clever he shall be the head of the bold findouters all right said fatty ungraciously i suppose its four against one blow is that halfpast twelve yes it is i must go meet here this afternoon sharp at two said larry we will discuss the finding of clues then glues said bets not hearing the word properly oh that sounds exciting are glues sticky idiot said pip what use you are going to be in the findouters i simply cant imagines at two oclock sharp the five findouters and dog met together in pips big garden pip was waiting for them and he led them to the old summerhouse this had better be our headquarters he said we shall keep wanting to meet and discuss things i expect its a good place for that because its at the bottom of the garden and nobody can overhear us they all sat down on the wooden bench that ran round the old summerhouse buster jumped up on to larrys knees larry liked that fatty didnt seem to mind now said larry as im the head of us id better start things going ill just go over what we all know and then well discuss what we should do i do think this is exciting said bets who was very much enjoying being one of the big ones dont interrupt bets said pip bets made her face solemn and sat still and straight well we all know that mr hicks cottage workroom which stands at the end of his garden was burnt down last night said larry mr hick was not there till the end because his chauffeur had gone to meet him off the london train the insurance people say that petrol was used to start the fire so some one must have done it on purpose the findouters have made up their minds that they will find out who has done this crime is that right quite right and very well put said pip at once buster wagged his tail hard fatty opened his mouth and began to speak in his high affected voice well i suggest that the first thing we do is to but larry interrupted him at once im doing the talking fatty not you he said shut up fatty shut up but he didnt look at all pleased about it he put on a bored expression and rattled the money in his pocket now what we must do to find out who did the crime is to discover who if anyone was near the workroom or in the garden that evening said larry fatty tells us he saw a tramp well we must find that tramp and somehow try to discover if he had anything to do with the fire theres mrs minus the cook too we must find out about her oughtnt we to find out if anyone had a spite against mr hick put in daisy people dont go burning down cottages just for fun it must have been done to pay mr hick out for something dont you think thats a very good point daisy said larry thats one of the things we will have to discover who had a spite against mr hick i should think about a hundred people had said pip our gardener said that hes got a very bad temper and nobody likes him well if we could find out if anyone with a spite was in the garden yesterday evening weve as good as got the man said larry also we must find clues put in fatty who could not be quiet any longer glues said bets joyfully she loved the sound of that word what are glues bets you really are a baby said pip its not glues its clues well what are clues asked bets clues are things that help us to find out what we want to know said larry for instance in a detective story i was reading the otter day a thief dropped a cigarette end in the shop he was burgling and when the police picked it up they found it was an unusual kind of cigarette they went round trying to find out who smoked that kind and when at last they found out they had got the thief so the cigarette end was a clue i see said bets i shall find heaps of glues i mean clues i shall love that we must all keep our eyes and ears open for clues of any sort said larry now for instance we might find footprint clues you know footprints leading to the cottage made by the criminal fatty laughed scornfully the others looked at mm whats the joke asked larry coldly oh nothing said fatty it just made me laugh a bit when i thought of you hunting for footprints in mr hicks garden there cant be less than about a million i should think with all the people who were there watching the fire last night larry went red he glared at fattys round face and fatty grinned back the man who started the fire might have been hiding in the hedge or somewhere wailing for his chance said larry nobody went into the hedge last night we might find footprints there mightnt we in the ditch where its muddy yes we might said fatty but its no good looking for footprints leading to the cottage mine are there and yours and old clearorfs and a hundred others i vote we dont let clearorf know we are solving the mystery said pip its his mystery said daisy hes as pleased as a dog with two tails because hes got a real crime to solve well well keep out of clearorf s way said larry wont he look silly when we tell him who really did do it because im sure we shall find out you know if we all work together and try hard what shall we do for a beginning asked pip who was longing to do something we must look for clues we must find out more about the tramp in the torn mackintosh and old hat that fatty saw said larry we must find out if anyone has a spite against mr hick we must find out if anyone had the chance of getting into the workroom that day to fire it it wouldnt be a bad idea to talk to mrs minns the cook said daisy she would know if anyone had been about that day and hasnt mr hick got another manservant besides his chauffeur yes hes got a valet but i dont know his name said larry well find out about him too golly weve got a lot to do lets all go and look for glues first said bets who quite thought she would find all kinds of things round and about the burnt cottage which would tell at once who the wrongdoer might be right said larry who rather wanted to hunt for clues hihiself now listen we may be turned off if anyone sees us poking about at the bottom of mr hicks garden so i shall drop a shilling somewhere and if we are questioned i shall say ive dropped a shilling and then theyll think we are looking for it itll be quite true i shall drop a shilling all right said pip getting up come on lets go now and after that i should think the next thing to do is for one of us to go and have a talk with mrs minns i bet shell be glad enough to jabber about everything we might learn a lot of useful things from her buster leapt down from larrys knee his tail wagging i believe he understood every word said bets hes just as keen to look for glues as we are you and your glues said larry laughing come on findouters this is going to be exciting clues and clearorf the five children and buster made their way down the drive and into the lane they passed mr hicks house and went on down the winding lane until they came to where the cottage had been burnt down there was a tiny wooden gate that opened on to an overgrown path leading to the cottage the children planned to go down that because then they hoped nobody would see them there was a horrid smell of smoke and burning still on the air it was a still april day very sunny and warm celandines lay in golden sheets everywhere the children opened the wooden gate and went up the overgrown path there stood what was left of the workroom a ruined blackened heap it had been a very small cottage once tworoomed but the dividing wall had been taken down by mr hick and then there had been one big room suitable for him to work in now said larry halfwhispering weve got to look about and see if we can find anything to help us it was plainly no use to look about where all the watchers had been the night before the garden was completely trampled down just there and the crisscross of footprints was everywhere the children separated and very solemnly began to hunt about alongside the overgrown path to the cottage and in the tall hedges that overhung the ditches at the bottom of the garden buster looked too but as he had a firm idea that every one was hunting for rabbits he put his nose down each rabbit hole and scraped violently and hopefully it always seemed to him a great pity that rabbits didnt make their holes big enough for dogs how easy then to chase a scampering bunny look at buster hunting for clues said pip with a giggle the children looked for footprints there were none on the path which was made of cinders and showed no footmarks at all of course they looked about in the celandines that grew in their hundreds beside the path but there was nothing to be seen there either pip wandered off to a ditch over which hung a drooping hedge of bramble and wild rose and there he found something he gave a low and excited call to the others here i say come here ive found something at once everyone crowded over to him buster too his nose quivering what is it said larry pip pointed into the muddy ditch beside him nettles grew there and they were trampled down it was plain that someone had stood there in the ditch and the only reason for standing in nettles in a muddy ditch was to hide but thats not all said pip excited look heres where the person came in and went out he pointed to the hedge behind and the children saw a gap there with broken and bent sprays and twigs showing where some one had forced his way in and out oooh said daisy her eyes very wide is this a clue larry a very big one said larry pleased pip have you seen any footprints pip shook his head the man who hid here seemed to tread on the nettles all the time he said look you can see where he went keeping in the ditch see where the nettles are broken down the children cautiously followed the brokendown patches of nettles the ditch curved round to the back of the cottage but there unfortunately so many people had trampled the night before that it was impossible to pick out any footsteps and say those are the mans well look here although we cant find any footsteps in the garden that belong to the hiding man we might be able to find some on the other side of the hedge said fatty what about us all squeezing through that gap where the man got in and out and seeing if we can spy anything the other side they all scrambled through the hole in the hedge fatty was the last his eye caught sight of something as he squeezed through it was a bit of grey flannel caught oa a thorn he gave a low whistle and clutched at larry who was just in front of him he pointed to the scrap of flannel the man tore his coat as he got through this gap he saidsee that my word we are getting on we know that he wore a grey flannel suit now larry carefully took off the scrap of grey rag from the thorn he put it into a matchbox wishing that he and not fatty had noticed it good for you he said yes that may be a veiy valuable clue has fatty found a glue asked bets in excitement every one crowded round to hear what fatty had discovered larry opened the matchbox and showed the bit of grey flannel now weve only got to find some one who wears a suit of grey flannel a bit torn somewhere and weve got the man said daisy pleased i think were much cleverer than clearorf said pip ive got awfully sharp eyes you know said fatty feeling tremendously pleased with hihiself fancy no one but me saw that i really have got brains shut up said larry it was just chance thats all that you saw it he put the scrap back into his matchbox every one felt a bit excited i like being a findouter said bets happily well i dont know why said pip you havent found out anything yet i found the place where the man hid and fatty found a bit of his coat you havent found a thing it was larry who found the footprint he found it quite by accident the gap in the hedge led to a grassy field where it was impossible to see any prints at all but the farmer had been along and taken a few squares of turf from a certain part and at one side near the edge was a distinct footprint its the farmers i expect said pip when larry showed it to him no theres the farmers print said larry pointing to a big hobnailed print which appeared up and down the bare patch this is a smaller print altogether i shouldnt think its more than size eight and the farmers footprint looks like size twelve its enormous i think this must be the print of the man we are looking for lets see if we can find another the children hunted about nothing could be seen on the grass of course so they went to the edges of the field and there daisy found three or four more footprints some on each side of the stile that led out of the field into a lane beyond are these the same prints she called the others came running they looked hard larry nodded his head i believe they are he said look these shoes have rubber soles with crisscross marking on them pip run back to that other print and see if the marking is the same will you pip tore over to the patch from which the farmer had removed the turf yes the crisscross marking showed up quite clearly in the print it was the same shoe no doubt about that yes he yelled its the same the others were thrilled they really were getting on well said larry looking down the lane im afraid its not much good going any farther because the surface of the lane is hard and wont show anything but weve found out what we wanted to know weve found out that a man hid in the hedge for some reason and we know that he wore shoes of a certain shape and size with rubber soles that had crisscross markings not bad for a days work ill make a drawing of the prints said fatty ill measure the exact size and make an exact copy of the marks then weve only got to find the shoes and weve got the man we know what sort of shoes he wore and what kind of suit said larry thinking of the scrap of grey cloth in his matchbox i bet old clearorf wont have noticed anything at all id better go back to the hotel and get some paper to copy the footprints said fatty importantly its a good thing i can draw so well i won first prize last term for art what art said larry the art of boasting or the art of eating too much arent you clever said fatty crossly who did not at all like this sort of teasing yes he is clever said daisy but he doesnt boast about his brains as you do frederick algernon trotte ville lets go back to the burnt cottage and see if theres any other clue to be found there said pip seeing that a quarrel was about to flare up yes said bets im the only one that hasnt found a glue and i do want to she looked so sad about this that fatty hastened to comfort her well buster hasnt found anything either he said hes looked hard but he hasnt discovered a single thing dont worry bets i expect you will soon find something marvellous they all went back to the gap in the hedge and squeezed through fatty went off to the little hotel opposite the garden to get a piece of paper and a pencil the others stood and stared at the ruined cottage what are you doing here suddenly said a rough voice clear orf golly its old clearorf whispered larry look for my shilling all of you the four children began to hunt around pretending to be looking for something did you hear what i said growled the policeman what are you looking for my shilling said larry oh i suppose you dropped it when you came round interfering last night said mr goon i dont know what children are coming to nowadays always turning up and messing about and hindering others and being a general nuisance you clear orf ah my shilling said larry suddenly pouncing on his shilling which when he had arrived he had carefully dropped beside a patch of celandines all right mr goon well go ive got my shilling now well clear orf then growled the policeman ive got work to do here serious work and i dont want children messing about either are you looking for glues asked bets and imme diately got such a nudge from pip that she almost fell over luckily clearorf took no notice of this remark he hustled the children out of the gate and up the lane and dont you come messing about here again he said messing about said larry indignantly as they all went off up the lane thats all he thinks children do mess about if he knew what wed discovered this morning hed go green in the face would he really said bets interested id like to see him you nearly made me go green in the face when you asked old clearorf if he was looking for clues said pip crossly i thought the very next minute youd say we had been looking for some and found them too thats the worst of having a baby like you in the findouters i would not have said wed found anything said bets almost in tears oh look theres fatty wed better warn him that clearorf is down there they stopped fatty and warned him he decided to go down and do his measuring and copying later on he didnt at all like clearorf neither did buster its teatime anyway said larry looking at his watch meet tomorrow morning at ten oclock in pips summerhouse weve done awfully well today ill write up notes about all our clues this is really getting very exciting fatty and larry learn a few things at ten oclock the next morning the five children and buster were once again in the old summerhouse fatty looked important he produced an enormous sheet of paper on which he had drawn the right and left footprint lifesize with all its crisscross markings on the rubber sole it was really very good the others stared at it not bad is it said fatty swelling up with importance and as usual making a impression on the others by boasting didnt i tell you i was good at drawing larry nudged pip and whispered in his ear pull his leg a bit he said pip grinned and wondered what larry was going to do larry took the drawing and looked at it solemnly quite good except that i think youve got the tail a bit wrong he said pip joined in at once well i think the ears are the wrong shape too he said at least the one on the right is fatty gaped and looked at his drawing to make sure it was the right one yes it was a copy of the footprints all right then what were larry and pip talking about of course they say that hands are the most difficult things to draw said larry looking at the drawing carefully again his head on one side now i think fatty ought to learn a bit more about hands daisy tried to hide a giggle bets was most amazed and looked at the drawing trying to discover the tail ears and hands that larry and pip were so unaccountably chatting about fatty went purple with rage i suppose you think youre being funny again he said snatching the drawing out of larrys hand you know quite well this is a copy of the footprints golly so thats what it is said pip in an amazed voice of course larry how could we have thought they were anything else daisy went off into a squeal of laughter fatty folded up the paper and looked thoroughly offended buster jumped up on to his knees and licked his masters nose bets put everything right in her simple manner well she said astonished it was all a joke wasnt it larry i looked at that drawing and i could quite well see it was a really marvellous copy of those footprints we saw i couldnt imagine what you and pip were talking about fatty i wish i could draw as well as you can fatty had got up to go but now he sat down again the others grinned it was a shame to tease poor old fatty but really he did have such a very good opinion of hihiself ive just shortly written down a few notes about yesterday said larry drawing a small notebook out of his pocket he opened it and read quickly the list of clues they already had he held out his hand for fattys drawing i think it had better go with the notes he said ill keep both the notes and the drawings and the scrap of grey cloth somewhere carefully together because they may soon become important where shall we keep them theres a loose board just behind you in the wall of the summerhouse said pip eagerly i used to hide things there when i was little like bets it would be a fine place to put anything now no one would ever think of looking there he showed the others the loose board buster was most interested in it stood up on the bench and scraped hard at it he thinks theres a rabbit behind it said bets the notebook the matchbox with the grey rag and fattys drawing were carefully put behind the loose board which was then dragged into place again all the children felt pleased to have a hideyhole like that now what are our plans for today said pip we must get on with the solving of the mystery you know we dont want the police to find out everything before we do well one or more of us must interview mrs minns the cook said larry he saw that bets did not understand what interviewing was that means we must go and see what the cook has to say about the matter he explained bets nodded i could do that she said you said pip scornfully youd tell her right out all that we had done and found and everything you cant even keep the very smallest secret i dont tell secrets now said bets you know i dont i havent told a single secret since i was six years old shut up you two said larry i think daisy and pip might go and see mrs minns daisy is good at that sort of thing and pip can keep a look out to see that clearorf or mr hick dont come along and guess what daisy is doing what shall i do larry asked fatty quite humbly for once in a way you and i could go and talk to the chauffeur said larry he might let out something that would be useful to us he usually washes down the car in the morn ing what about me said bets in dismay arent i to do anything im a findouter too theres nothing you can do said larry bets looked very miserable fatty was sorry for her we shant want buster with us he said do you think you could take him for a walk over the fields he just loves a good rabbitty walk oh yes i could do that said bets brightening up at once i should like that and you never know i might find a glue on the way everyone laughed bets simply could not remember the way to pronounce that word yes you go and find a really important glue said larry so bets set off with buster at her heels she went down the lane towards the fields and the others heard her telling buster that he could look for rabbits and she would look for glues now then to work said larry getting up daisy you and pip go down to mrs minns what excuse shall we give for going to see her asked daisy oh you must think of something yourself said larry use your brains thats what detectives do pip will think of something if you cant better not all go down the lane together said pip you and fatty go first and see if you can find the chauffeur at work and daisy and i will come a bit later larry and fatty went off they walked down the lane and came to mr hicks house which stood a good way back in its own drive the garage was at the side of the house a loud whistling came from that direction and the sound of water hes washing the car said larry in a low voice come on well pretend we want to see someone who doesnt live here and then ask if hed like us to help him the boys went down the drive together they soon came in sight of the garage and larry went up to the young man who was hosing the car morning he said does mrs thompson live here no said the young man this is mr hicks house oh said larry in a vexed tone then he stared at the car thats a fine car isnt it he said yes its a rolls royce said the chauffeur fine to drive shes very dirty today though ive got all my work cut out to get her clean before the master wants her this morning well help you said larry eagerly ill hose her for you i often do it for my father in less than a minute the two boys were at work helping the young chauffeur and the talk turned on to the fire funny business that fire said the chauffeur rubbing the bonnet of the car with a polishing cloth the master was properly upset about losing those valuable papers of his and now they say it was a putup job some one did it on purpose well peeks did say that it was a wonder no one had given mr hick a slap in the face for the way he treats everybody whos peeks said larry pricking up his ears peeks was his manservant sort of valet and secretary mixed said the chauffeur hes gone now went off the day of the fire why did he go asked fatty innocently got kicked out said the chauffeur mr hick gave him his money and he went my word there was a fine old quarrel between them too whatever about said larry well it seehis that mr hick found out that peeks sometimes wore his clothes said the chauffeur you see he and the master were much of a size and peeks used to fancy hihiself a bit ive seen him prance out in mr hicks dark blue suit and his blue tie with the red spots and his goldtopped stick too oh said fatty and i suppose when mr hick found that out he was angry and told peeks to go was peeks very upset you bet he was said the chauffeur he came out to me and the things he said about the master would make anybodys ears burn then off he went about eleven oclock his old mother lives in the next village and i guess she was surprised to see horace peeks marching in baggage and all at that time of the morning the two boys were each thinking the same thing it looks as if peeks burnt the cottage we must find peeks and see what he was doing that evening there came a roar from a window overhead thomas is that car done yet what are you jabbering about down there do i pay you for jabbering no i do not thats the master said thomas in a low tone youd better clear out thanks for your help the boys looked up at the window mr hick stood there a cup of tea or cocoa in his hand looking down furious ly mr hick and cup said larry with a giggle dear old goodtempered hiccup fatty exploded into a laugh well call him hiccup he said i say weve got some news this morning havent we i bet it was peeks larry i bet it was i wonder how daisy and pip are getting on said larry as they went down the drive i believe i can hear them chattering away somewhere i guess they wont have such exciting news as we have mrs minns does a lot of talking daisy and pip were getting on very well indeed as they had stood outside mr hicks garden debating what excuse they could make for going to the kitchen door they had heard a little mew daisy looked to see where the sound came from did you hear that she asked pip the mew came again both children looked up into a tree and there unable to get down or up was a small black and white kitten its got stuck said daisy pip can you climb up and get it pip could and did soon he was handing down the little creature to daisy and she cuddled it against her where does it belong she wondered probably to mrs minns the cook said pip promptly anyway it will make a marvellous excuse for going to the kitchen door and asking yes it will said daisy pleased so the two of them set off down the drive and went to the kitchen entrance which was on the opposite side of the house to the garage a girl of about sixteen was sweeping the yard and from the kitchen nearby there came a neverending voice and dont you leave any bits of paper flying around my yard either lily last time you swept that yard you left a broken bottle there and half a newspaper and goodness knows what else why your mother didnt teach you how to sweep and dust and bake i dont know women nowadays just leave their daughters to be taught by such as me thats got all their work cut out looking after a particular gentleman like mr hick without having to keep an eye on a lazy girl like you this was all said without a single pause the girl did not seem to be paying any attention at all but went on sweeping slowly round the yard the dust flying before her hallo said pip does this kitten belong here mrs minns shouted the girl heres some children with the kitten mrs minns appeared at the door she was a round fat woman short and panting with sleeves rolled up above her podgy elbows is this your kitten asked pip again and daisy held it out to show the cook now where did it get to this time said mrs minns taking it and squeezing it against her sweetie sweetie heres your kitten again why dont you look after it better a large black and white cat strolled out of the kitchen and looked inquiringly at the kitten the kitten mewed and tried to jump down take your kitten sweetie said mrs minns she put it down and it ran to its mother isnt it exactly like its mother said daisy shes got two more said mrs minns you come in and see them dear little sweets dogs i cant bear but give me a cat and kittens and im happy the two children went into the kitchen the big black and white cat had got into a basket and the children saw three black and white kittens there too all exactly alike oh can i stay and play with them a bit asked daisy thinking it would be a marvellous excuse to stop and talk to mrs minns so long as you dont get into my way said mrs minns dumping down a tin of flour on the table she was going to make pastry where do you live not far away just up the lane answered pip we saw the fire the other night that set mrs minns off at once she put her hands on her hips and nodded her head till her fat cheeks shook what a shock that was she said my word when i saw what was happening anyone could have knocked me down with a feather both the children felt certain that nothing short of a bar of iron would ever knock fat mrs minas over daisy stroked the kittens whilst the cook went on with her talk quite forgetting about the pastry i was sitting here in my kitchen treating myself to a cup of cocoa and telling my sister this that and the other she said i was tired with turning out the larders that day and glad enough to sit and rest my bones and suddenly my sister says to me maria she says el smell burning the children stared at her mrs minns was pleased to have such an interested audience i said to hannah thats my sister i said something burning thats not the soup catching in the saucepan surely and hannah says maria theres something burning terrible and then i looked out of the window and i saw something flaring up at the bottom of the garden what a shock for you said daisy well i says to my sister it looks as if the masters workroom is on fire glory be i says what a day this has been first mr peeks gets tie sack and walks out baggage and all then mr smellie comes along and he and the master go for one another hammer and tongs then that dirty old tramp comes and the master catches him stealing eggs from the henhouse and now if we havent got a fire the two children listened intently all this was news to them goodness there seemed to have been quite a lot of quarrels and upsets on the day of the fire pip asked who mr peeks was he was the masters manservant and secretary said mr minns stuckup piece of goods he was i never had much rime for him myself good thing he went i say and i shouldnt be surprised if he had something to do with that fire either but here lily had something to say mr peeks was far too much of a gentleman to do a thing like that she said clattering her broom into a comer if you ask me its old mr smellie the children could hardly believe that any one could be called by such a name is that his real name asked pip it surely is said mrs minns and a dirty neglected old fellow he is too what his housekeeper can be about i dont know she doesnt mend him up at all sends him out with holes in his socks and rents in his clothes and his hat wanting brushing hes a learned old gentleman too so they say and knows more about old books and things than almost any one in the kingdom why did he and mr hick quarrel asked pip goodness knows said mrs minns always quarrelling they are they both know a lot but they dont agree about what they know anyway old mr smellie he walks out of the house muttering and grumbling and bangs the door behind him so hard that my saucepans almost jump off the stove but as for him firing the cottage as lily says dont you believe a word of it its my belief he wouldnt know how to set light to a bonfire its that stuckup mr peeks whod be spiteful enough to pay mr hick back you mark my words he would not said lily who seemed determined to stick up for the valet hes a nice young man he is youve no right to say things like that mrs minns now look here my girl said the cook getting angry if you think you can talk like that to your elders and betters youre mistaken telling me ive no right to say this that and the other you just wait till you can scrub a floor properly and dust the tops of the pictures and see a cobweb when its staring you in the face before you begin to talk big to me i wasnt talking big said poor lily all i said was now dont you start all over again said mrs minns thumping on the table with the rollingpin as if she was hitting poor lily on the head with it you go and get me the dripping if you can find out where you put it yesterday and no more backchat from you if you please the children didnt want to hear about lilys faults or where she put the dripping they wanted to hear about the people that mr hick had quarrelled with and who might therefore have a spite against him it looked as if both mr peeks and mr smellie would have spites against him and what about the old tramp too was mr hick very angry with the tramp when he found him stealing the eggs asked pip angry you could hear him all over the house and the garden too said mrs minns thoroughly enjoying talking about everything i said to myself ah theres the master off again its a pity he doesnt use up some of his temper on that lazy girl lily lily appeared out of the larder looking sulky the children couldnt help feeling sorry for her the girl put the dripping down on the table with a bang any need to try and break the basin inquired mrs minns its a bad girl you are today a right down bad girl you go and wash the back steps madam that will keep you busy for a bit lily went out clanking a pail tell us about the tramp said pip what time did mr hick see mm stealing eggs oh sometime in the morning said mrs minns rolling out pastry with a heavy hand the old fellow came to my back door first whining for bread and meat and i sent him off i suppose he slipped round the garden to the henhouse and the master saw him there from the cottage window my word he went for him all right and said hed call the police in and the old tramp he went flying by my kitchen door as if a hundred dogs were after him perhaps he fired the cottage said pip but mrs minns would not have it that any one had fired the cottage but mr peeks he was a sly one she said hed come down into my kitchen at nights when every one was in bed and hed go to my larder and take out a meatpie or a few buns or anything hed a mind to well what i say is if some one can do that theyll set fire to a cottage too pip remembered with a very guilty feeling that once being terribly hungry he had slipped down to the school larder and eaten some biscuits he wondered if he was also capable of setting fire to a cottage but he felt sure he could never do that he didnt think that mrs minns was right there suddenly from somewhere in the house there came the sound of a furious flow of words mrs minns cocked her head up listened and nodded thats the master she said fallen over something i shouldnt wonder sweetie the big black and white cat suddenly flew into the kitchen her fur up and her tail swollen to twice its size mrs minns gave a cry of woe oh sweetie i did you get under his feet again poor lamb poor darling lamb the poor darling lamb retired under the table hissing the three kittens in the basket stiffened in alarm and hissed too mr hick appeared in the kitchen looking extremely angry mrs minns i have once more fallen over that horrible cat of yours how many more times am i to tell you to keep her under control i shall have her drowned sir the day you drown my cat i walk out said mrs minns laying down the rollingpin with a thump mr hick glared at the cook as if he would like to drown her as well as the cat why you want to keep such an ugly and vicious animal i cannot think he said and good heavens above are those kittens in that basket they are sir said mrs minns her voice rising high and good homes ive found for every single one of them when theyre old enough mr hick then saw the two children and appeared to be just as displeased to see them as he had been to see the kittens what are these children doing here he asked sharply you ought to know better mrs minus than to keep your kitchen full of tiresome children and wretched cats and kittens tell them to go he marched out of the door first setting down the empty cup and saucer he was carrying mrs minns glared after him for two pins id bum your precious cottage down if it wasnt already gone she called after mr hick when he was safely out of hearing sweetie rubbed against her skirt purring loudly she beat down and stroked her did the nasty man tramp on you she asked fondly did he say nasty things about the dear little kittens never you mind sweetie wed better be going said daisy afraid that mr hick might hear what mrs minns was saying and come back in a worse temper than ever thank you for all youve told us mrs minus it was most interesting mrs minns was pleased she presented pip and daisy with a ginger bun each they thanked her and went bubbling over with excitement weve learnt such a lot that its going to be difficult to sort it all out said pip it seehis as if at least three people might have done the crime and really if thats the kind of way that mr hick usually behaves i cant help feeling there must be about twenty people who would only be too glad to pay him back for something the tramp clearorf and fatty the four children met in the old summerhouse of excitement bets and buster were not yet back but they couldnt wait for them to come they had to tell their news we saw the chauffeur hes called thomas said larry he told us all about the valet called peeks he was chucked out on the day of the fire for wearing his masters clothes im sure he did the crime said fatty eagerly we must find out more about him he lives in the next village yes but listen said daisy it might be old mr smellie who said larry and fatty in astonishment mr smelliel yes said daisy with a giggle we thought it couldnt be a real name too when we heard it but it is mr hiccup and mr smellie said fatty unexpectedly what a lovely pair larry chuckled daisy and pip dont know about mr hick and cup he said he told them they laughed it isnt really very funny but it seehis as if it is said daisy at school things seem like that sometimes too we scream with laughter and afterwards it doesnt really seem funny at all but do let us tell you about mr smellie and the quarrel he had with mr hiccup she told larry and fatty all that mrs minns had said then pip told about the old tramp who had been caught stealing eggs and then daisy described how mr hick hihiself had come into the kitchen and rowed mrs minns for letting her cat get under his feet they had a proper quarrel said daisy and mrs minns actually called after mr hick and said she felt like burning down his cottage if it hadnt already been done golly said larry surprised it looks as if old mrs minns might have done it herself then if she felt like it today she might quite easily have felt like it two days ago and done it she had plenty of chance you know we have already found four suspects said fatty solemnly i mean we can quite properly suspect four persons of firing that cottage the old tramp mr smellie mr peeks and mrs minns we are getting on getting on said larry well i dont know about that we seem to find more and more people to suspect which makes it all more and more difficult i cant think how in the world were going to discover which it is we must find out the movements of the four suspects said fatty wisely for instance if we find out that mr smellie whoever he is spent the evening of the day before yesterday fifty miles away from here we can rule him out and if we find that horace peeks was at home with his mother all that evening we can rule him out and so on what we shall probably find is that all four people were messing about somewhere near the place said pip and how in the world are we going to trace that old tramp you know what tramps are they wander about for miles and nobody knows where they go or where they come from yes the tramps going to be difficult said daisy very difficult we cant rush all over the country looking for a tramp and if we did find him its going to be difficult to ask him if he set fire to the cottage we neednt do that silly said larry have you forgotten our clues what do you mean asked dasiy well weve only got to find out what size shoes he wears and if theyve got rubber soles crisscrossed with markings underneath and if he wears a grey flannel coat said larry he doesnt wear a grey flannel coat said fatty i told you he wore an old mackintosh the others were silent for a moment well he might have a grey flannel coat underneath said daisy he might have taken his mackintosh off for a moment the others thought this was rather feeble but they had no better suggestion time enough to worry about grey flannel coats and mackintoshes when weve found the tramp said pip that is going to be a problem i must say hark isnt that old buster barking said fatty suddenly i bet thats bets coming back yes shes calling to buster i say havent we got a lot of news for her the sound of bets running feet was heard up the drive and then down the garden path to the summerhouse the four big ones went to the door to welcome her buster shot up to them barking madly bets weve got such a lot of news called larry weve had a most exciting time cried daisy but bets didnt listen her eyes were shining brightly her cheeks were red with running and she could hardly get her words out she was so excited pip larry ivegotaglue oh ive got a glue what asked the other four together ive found the tramp panted the little girl do say hes the biggest glue weve found well hes really a suspect not a clue began larry but the others interrupted him bets are you sure youve found the tramp asked pip excitedly golly we thought that would be almost impossible where is he demanded fatty ready to go after him immediately how do you know its the tramp cried daisy well he was wearing a dirty old mackintosh and a terrible old hat with a hole in the crown said bets just like fatty said yes the hat did have a hole in the crown said fatty bets where is this fellow well i went for a walk with buster as you know said bets sinking down on the grass tired out with running hes a lovely dog to take for a walk because hes so interested ia everything well we went down the lane and into the fields and along by the river ever so far we came to a field where sheep and lambs were and there was a hayrick nearby buster barked a little as if he wanted to tell about it all too bets put her arm round him it was buster who found the tramp wasnt it darling you see i was walking along and suddenly buster went all stiff and the hairs rose up along the back of his neck and he growled urrrrrrr said buster obligingly he honestly understands every word doesnt he said bets well buster went all funny like that and then he began to walk stiffly towards the hayrick you know just as if he had bad rheumatism or something animals always walk like that when they are suspicious or frightened or angry said fatty grinning at bets go on dont be so longwinded i went with buster said bets as quietly as i could thinking there might be a cat or something the other side of the rick but it was the tramp golly said larry and pip whistled youre a very good findouter said fatty warmly i did so badly want to find out something said bets but i suppose really and truly it was buster who did the finding wasnt it well he wouldnt have if you hadnt taken him for a walk said larry what was the tramp doing he was asleep said bets fast asleep he didnt even wake when buster sniffed at his feet his feet said pip what sort of shoes did he have on did they have rubber soles bets looked dismayed oh i never thought of looking and i so easily could have seen couldnt i because he was fast asleep but i was so excited at finding him that i just never thought of looking at his shoes theres no time to be lost said pip jumping up he may still be fast asleep wed better go and have a look at mm and his shoes and his clothes fatty can tell us at once if hes the tramp he saw in mr hicks garden or not excited and rather solemn the five findouters and dog set off down the lane to the fields that ran beside the river they went fast in case the tramp had awakened and gone on his way it was so marvellous that bets should actually have found him they couldnt possibly risk losing him they came to the rick a gentle sound of snoring told them that the tramp was still there fatty picked up buster and crept round the rick without making a sound on the other side curled up well lay a tramp he was an old fellow with a stubbly grey beard shaggy grey eyebrows a red nose and long untidy hair that straggled from under a terrible old hat fatty took a look at him he tiptoed back to the others yes its the tramp all right he whispered thrilled but its going to be difficult to pull aside his mackintosh to see if hes got a grey coat underneath and hes got his feet sort of curled up underneath him we shall have to get right down on the ground to see what sort of sole his shoes have got underneath ill go and try said larry you others keep buster quiet here and watch out in case any one comes leaving the others on the far side of the rick larry crept round to the side where the tramp slept he sat down near him he put out his hand to pull aside the old mackintosh to see if the man wore grey underneath the trousers appearing below the coat were so old and dirty that it was quite impossible to tell what colour they had once been the tramp moved a little and larry took back his hand he decided to try and see the underneath of the mans shoes so he knelt down put his head to tie ground and did his best to squint at the tramps shoes the tramp suddenly opened his eyes he stared in the greatest astonishment at larry whats bitten you he suddenly said and larry almost jumped out of his skin think im the king of england i suppose kneeling in front of me with your head on the ground like that said the tramp get away i cant abide children nasty interfering little creatures he curled hihiself up again and shut his eyes larry waited for a second or two and was about to try squinting at the mans shoes again when he heard a low whistle from the other side of the rick that meant someone was coming well they would all have to wait till the passerby was gone larry crept round to join pip and the rest someone coming he asked yes old clearorf said fatty larry peeped round the rick the village policeman was coming up from the other direction along a path that did not go near the rick he would soon be gone but as he came along he suddenly caught sight of the old tramp sleeping by the rick the children drew back hurriedly as mr goon walked quietly and quickly over to the rick there was a ladder leaning against the rick and larry pushed bets and the others up as quickly as he could they would be less likely to be seen on top than below fortunately the rick had been cut well out when hay was taken to the various farmanimals and it was easy to balance on the cutout part the policeman crept up quietly the children peering over the rick saw him take out a notebook fatty gave lany such a nudge that the boy nearly fell look look what hes got down in his notebook hes got a drawing of that footprint we saw hes been cleverer than we thought clearorf tiptoed up to the tramp and tried his best to see what sort of shoes he had on he too did as lany had done and knelt down the better to see and the tramp opened his eyes his astonishment at seeing the policeman kneeling in front of him was enormous it was one thing to see a boy behaving like that but quite another thing to see a policeman the tramp leapt to his feet with a howl first its a boy bowing down to me and now its a bobby he said jamming his old hat down on his long grey hair whats it all about i want to see your shoes said clearorf well see them then look at them well laces and all said the tramp rapidly losing his temper i want to see the soles said the policeman stolidly are you a cobbler or a policeman asked the tramp well you show me the buttons on your shirt and ill show you the soles of my shoes the policeman began to breathe very heavily and his face got red he snapped his notebook shut youd better comealongame he said the tramp didnt think so he skipped out of the way and began to run across the field very nimbly indeed for an old fellow clearorf gave a roar and turned to run after him and at that moment fatty excited beyond words fell off the hayrick and landed with a thud on the ground below he gave such an agonized yell that the policeman stopped in amazement whats all thisere he said and glared at fatty then he caught sight of the other children peering anxiously down from the top of the rick afraid that fatty had broken all his bones he was most astonished you come on down he roared always children messing about you wait till the farmer catches you how long have you been there what do you mean spying like this fatty gave a frightful groan and the policeman torn between his desire to rash after the disappearing tramp and to pull fatty to his feet and shake him went up to him dont touch me i think ive broken my left leg and my right arm dislocated both my shoulders and broken my appendix said fatty who sincerely believed that he was practically killed bets gave a squeal of horror and jumped down to see what she could do to help poor fatty the others leapt down too and buster danced delightedly round clearorfs ankles the policeman kicked out at him clearorf he said dogs and children always messing about and getting in the way now that fellows gone and ive missed a chance of questioning him he waited to see if fatty was really hurt but except for a good shaking and some fine big bruises fatty was not hurt at all his fat had kept him from breaking any bones as soon as the policeman saw the others helping fatty up brushing him down and comforting him he took a look round to see if he could make out where the tramp hadgone but he was nowhere to be seen he turned to the five children now clearorf he said and dont let me see you hanging round again then with great dignity mr goon made his way heavily to the path and walked down it without turning his head once the children looked at each other we were getting on so well till clearorf came sighed daisy i wonder where that tramp went to im going home said fatty miserably i feel awful ill take you home said daisy you come too bets do you boys want to see if you can trace the tramp yes said larry might as well whilst weve got the chance i dont wonder fatty fell off the rick it was pretty exciting wasnt it fancy old clearorf having a drawing of that footprint in his notebook said pip thoughtfully hes smarter than i thought still weve got something he hasnt got a bit of grey flannel fatty daisy bets and buster went off together the other two set off in the direction the tramp had taken they meant to find him again if they could what must be done next larry and pip ran quickly in the direction the tramp had gone it seemed silly that although all the children had seen him and clearorf too nobody had managed to find out what kind of soles his shoes had there was no sign of the tramp at all the boys met a farm labourer and hailed him hie have you seen an old tramp going this way yes into that wood said the man and pointed to a small copse of trees in the distance the boys ran there and looked about among the trees and tangled undergrowth they smelt the smoke of a fire and their noses and eyes soon guided them to it by it on a fallen tree sat the dirty old tramp his hat of now showing his tangled straggly hair he was cooking something in a tin over the fire when he saw larry he scowled what you here again he said you get away what do you mean following me about like this i havent done nothing well said larry boldly you tried to steal eggs from mr hicks henhouse the other day we know that but thats nothing to do with us mr hick so thats his name said the old tramp sticking a skewer in whatever it was that he was cooking i didnt steal his eggs i didnt steal nothing at all im an honest old fellow i am and everybody will tell you the same well what were you doing hiding in the ditch at the bottom of his garden said larry the tramp looked astonished i never hid in no ditch he said i wasnt the one that did the hiding ho dear me no i could tell you something i could but im not going to you put that policeman after me didnt you no said larry he came along unexpectedly and went over to you he didnt know we were anywhere about well i dont believe you said the old tramp you set that bobby after me i know you did im not going to be mixed up in anything that dont concern me but there was funny goingson that night ho yes i should think there were the old fellow suddenly groaned and rubbed his right foot his big toe stuck out of the shoe which was too small for him he took the shoe off showing a sock that was practically all holes and rubbed his foot tenderly the boys looked at the shoe which the tramp had thrown carelessly to one side the sole was plainly to be seen it was of leather and so much worn that it could not possibly keep any damp out no rubber sole whispered larry to pip so it couldnt have been the tramp hiding in the ditch anyway i dont believe he knows a thing and look at the old coat hes got under the mack its green with age not grey what you whispering about said the tramp you get away cant i live in peace i dont do no harm to nobody i dont but children and bobbies they come after me like flies you leave me alone id be as merry as a blackbird if i had a pair of shoes that fitted me poor old feet you got a pair of shoes that would fit me what size do you take asked pip thinking that perhaps he could get an old pair of his fathers boots for the footsore old tramp but the tramp didnt know he had never bought a pair of shoes in his life well if i can get an old pair of my fathers boots ill bring them to you said pip or better still you come and get them i live in the red house in the lane not far from mr hicks house you come there tomorrow and ill perhaps have got some boots for you youll set that bobby after me again if i come back grumbled the tramp taking out something peculiar from the tin and beginning to eat it with his hands or that mr hick will well hed better be careful know a few things about mr hick and his household i do yes i heard him shouting at quite a few people that day besides me ho yes there was funny goings on there but im not mixed up in them i tell you larry looked at his watch it was getting late well have to go he said but you come along to pips house tomorrow and you can tell us anything you want to we shant give you away the boys left the old tramp and tore home to their dinner very late indeed their mothers were not pleased with them whatever have you been doing asked pips mother where have you been pip couldnt possibly tell her because the findouters and their doings were very secret i was with the others he said at last you werent pip said his mother bets and daisy have been here a long time and that fat boy too whatever his name is dont tell stories well i was with larry said pip bets saw that he was in difficulties and she tried to rescue mm by suddenly changing the subject fatty fell off a hayrick this morning she said it certainly changed the subject her mother stared at her in horror who did that fat boy did he hurt hihiself whatever were you doing on a hayrick pip was afraid that bets was going to say why they were all on the rick so he changed the subject quickly too mummy has daddy got a very old pair of boots he doesnt want he asked innocently his mother looked at mm why she asked pip was not usually interested in his fathers old clothes well i happen to know some one who would be very glad of them indeed said pip why asked his mother again well you see his toes are sticking right out of his shoes explained pip trying to interest his mother in the matter whose toes asked his mother astonished pip stopped now he would have to bring in the tramp and that was part of the secret bother whatever they talked about seemed to lead back to something the findouters were doing its just a poor old tramp said bets pip glared at her a tramp said her mother surely you are not making friends with people like that pip no said pip desperately im not im only sorry for him thats all you always say mommy that we should be sorry for people not so welloff as ourselves and help them dont you well thats why i thought of giving him some old boots thats all i see said his mother and pip gave a sigh of relief well ill find out if there is an old pair of daddys boots and if there is you shall have them now do get on with your dinner after he had finished his very late meal pip escaped into the garden and went to find bets who was in the summerhouse bets was fatty all right he wasnt really hurt was he no hes got some lovely bruises though said bets the best ive ever seen i guess hell boast about them till were sick of hearing about bruises didnt he make a thump when he fell did you and larry find the tramp what happened well hes not the person who hid in the ditch nor the one whose coat got caught on the brambles said pip we saw both his shoes and his coat he heard all the quarrels that went on larry and i thought wed ask him a few questions tomorrow when he comes to get the boots i believe he could tell us quite a few things if he was certain we wouldnt put the police after him he may even have spotted who was hiding in the ditch oooh said bets thrilled oh pip wasnt it funny when the tramp woke and saw larry kneeling in front of him and after that old clearorf doing the same thing yes it was funny said pip grinning hallo theres fatty and buster fatty limped into the garden walking extremely stiffly he had tried to make up his mind whether to act very heroically and poohpooh his fall but limp to make the others sorry for him or whether to make out that he had hurt hihiself inside very badly and frighten them at the moment he was behaving heroically he smiled at bets and pip and sat down very gingerly do you hurt much asked bets sympathetically oh im all right said fatty in a very very brave voice a fall off a rick isnt much dont you worry about me the others stared at him in admiration do you want to see my bruises asked fatty ive seen them said bets but i dont mind seeing them again i like bruises best when they begin to go yellow really pip hasnt seen them have you pip pip was torn between wanting to see the bruises and not wanting fatly to boast and show them off fatty didnt wait for him to answer however he began to strip off various garments and display braises of many sizes and shapes they were certainly good ones ive never seen such beauties said pip unable to stop hihiself admiring them i never have bruises like that i suppose its being fat that makes them spread so wont you look lovely when you go yellowgreen thats one thing about me said fatty im a wonderful bruiser once when i ran into the goalpost at football i got a bruise just here that was exactly the shape of a churchbell it was most peculiar oh i wish id seen it said bets and another time said fatty some one hit me with a stick just here and the next morning the bruise was exactly like a snake head and all pip reached out for a stick ill give you another snake if you like he said just tell me where youd like it fatty was offended dont be mean he said well shut up about snakes and churchbells then said pip in disgust bets has only got to say oh how wonderful and you make up the tallest stories ive ever heard hallo here are larry and daisy fatty didnt like to say any more about his bruises though he was simply longing to show them to the others lany had been thinking a lot about everything whilst he had gobbled up his late dinner and he had his plans all ready he didnt even ask poor fatty how he felt after his fall but started off straightaway with his ideas look here he said ive been thinking about clearorf i dont like him knowing about those footprints we dont want him to solve this mystery before we do for all we know hes got his eye on peeks and mr smellie too as well as the tramp we must get in first it would be too awful if horrid old clearorf found out everything before we did it would agreed every one wholeheartedly buster wagged his tail we must see this manservant peeks said larry its most important i dont suspect that old tramp any more now that ive seen his shoes and coat anyway im certain that if he had fired the cottage he would have fled away out of the district as soon as ever he could as it is hes still about i dont believe he did it im much more inclined to think that peeks did it we must find out we must agreed every one again i shall question the tramp closely tomorrow said larry rather grandly i feel certain he can tell us plenty fatty do you think you and daisy could find out about peeks tomorrow ill stay here with pip and bets and question the tramp right said fatty and daisy joyfully if only they could get ahead of clearorf they simply must beat him lily comes into the story fatty really was too stiff to want to do anything more that day so larry pip and daisy left mm in the garden with bets and buster reading quietly they thought they would go down to mr hicks house and talk to mrs minns again we ought really to find out if mrs minns could have fired the cottage herself said larry i dont feel as if she did but you cant go by feelings if you are a detective also we must get horace peeks address well take some fish for sweetie the cat said daisy i think there was some left over that cook might let me have mrs miens will be awfully pleased to see us if we take a present for sweetie the cook gave her a fishhead wrapped up in paper buster smelt it and wanted to follow daisy but fatty held him firmly by the collar its no good him coming said daisy hed be sure to chase sweetie and then mrs minns would chase us they went down the lane together leave me to do the talking said larry daisy laughed dont you worry it will be mrs minns who does it she said they arrived at the kitchen door and looked inside lily was there writing a letter she looked as if she had been crying wheres mrs minns asked larry upstairs said lily shes in a bad temper i upset a jug of milk over her and she keeps on saying i did it on purpose were you here on the night of the fire asked larry lily shook her head where were you then asked larry didnt you see the fire i saw it when i came back from my evening off said lily never you mind where i was its got nothing to do with you i know said larry surprised at lilys violent tone what i cant understand is why didnt mrs minns or her sister smell the fire when it began heres mrs mirhiss sister now said lily looking up as a very fat woman with twinkling eyes under a big hat trimmed with flowers came up to the kitchen door she looked in and seemed surprised to see the children hallo mrs jones said lily sulkily mrs minns is upstairs changing her dress she wont be a minute mrs jones came in and sank into a rockingchair breathing heavily my its hot today she said who are all these children we live up the lane said pip weve brought a fishhead for sweetie where are all the kittens said daisy looking at the empty basket oh said lily i hope they havent gone out of the kitchen and upstairs mrs minns told me to keep the door shut perhaps the kittens are outside said larry shutting the door that led into the hall he didnt particularly want mr hick to hear the talking in the kitchen and come in oh theres sweetie the big black and white cat came into the kitchen her tail straight up in the air she smelt the fishhead and went to daisy daisy unwrapped it and put it into the cats dinnerbowl in a corner of the kitchen sweetie immediately took it out of the bowl and began to eat it on the floor was sweetie frightened of the fire the other night asked pip thinking it was about time to start on the subject she was kind of restless said mrs jones oh were you here said daisy pretending to be surprised goodness how was it you didnt know the cottage was burning then i did said mrs jones indignantly didnt i keep saying to maria maria theres something burning ive a very good nose but maria hasnt i kept sniffing round the kitchen and i even put my nose into the hall thinking there might be something burning there didnt mrs minns go and see if there was anything burning too asked larry ah maria didnt want to move that evening said mrs jones shed got her rheumatism back something cruel she was stuck real stuck what do you mean stuck asked larry with interest well she sat down in this rockingchair at teatime and she says to me hannah she says im stuck me rheumatisms got me again and i cant move so i says to her maria you just stay put ill get the tea and everything mr hick is out so theres no dinner to get ill just stay with you till your poor legs are better the children listened and each of them thought tie same thing if mrs minns was stuck in a chair all the evening with rheumatism then she couldnt have fired the cottage and didnt poor mrs minns get up at all out of the rockingchair asked daisy not till you really knew there was a fire i mean no maria just stayed put said mrs jones it wasnt till me nose told me there really was something burning terrible that maria got up i went to the kitchendoor and sniffed and then i went out into the garden and i saw the flare down at the bottom there i shouted out theres a fire maria and she turned as white as a sheet come on maria i says weve got to do something but poor maria she cant get out of her chair shes so stuck the children drank all this in it certainly could have been nothing to do with mrs minns if she had been so stuck with rheumatism she wouldnt have been likely to rush around setting fire to cottages and anyway her sister was with her all the time it was quite plainly nothing to do with mrs minns that was another suspect crossed off mrs minns opened the kitchen door and came in looking angry she had been upstairs to take off her milkdrenched dress she glared at lily and then looked in surprise at the three children well maria said mrs jones hows the rheumatics good afternoon mrs minns said daisy we came to bring a fishhead for sweetie mrs minns beamed she was always touched when any one did anything for her precious cat thats nice of you she said my rheumatisms better she said to her sister though what it will be like after being drenched with milk i dont know really things are coming to a pretty pass when that girl lily throws milk all over me i didnt do it on purpose said lily sulkily can i go to the post with this letter no that you cant said mrs minns you fust get the tea ready for mr hick go on now stop your letterwriting and get a bit of work done for a change i want to catch the post said lily looking ready to cry well you wont said mrs minns unkindly lily started to cry and the children felt sorry for her she got up and began to get out cups and saucers the children wondered how to mention horace peeks they wanted to get his address so that they might go and see him has mr hick got a new manservant yet asked larry at last hes been seeing some today said mrs minns sinking into an armchair which creaked dolefully beneath her weight i only hope he gets one that doesnt put on airs and graces like mr peeks thats all does mr peeks live near here asked pip innocently yes said mrs minns let me see now where does he live oh my memory it gets worse every day there came a most unwelcome interruption just as it seemed that mrs minns was on the point of remembermg horace peekss address the kitchen door shot open and three kittens flew through the air landing on the floor with mews and hisses every one looked round in amazement mr hick stood at the door his front tuft of hair bristling like a parrots crest those kittens were in my study he shouted are my orders never to be obeyed unless they are out of the house by this evening il drown the lot he was about to bang the door when he caught sight of the three children he advanced into the kitchen and pointed a finger at them didnt i turn you out before how dare you come here again larry pip and daisy got up and fled they were not cowards but really mr hick was so very fierce that it honestly seemed as if he might throw them out just as he had flung the kittens into the kitchen they ran up the drive but halfway to the gate larry stopped wait till old hiccup has gone out of the kitchen he said we simply must get horace peekss address we cant do anything about him till we know where he is they waited for a minute or two and then went back very cautiously to the kitchen mrs minns was talking to her sister and lily was still clattering about with the teathings the children put their heads round the door what do you want now asked mrs minns goodnaturedly my word you ran away like frightened mice made me laugh to see you you were just trying to think of horace peekss address when mr hick came in said larry was i now said mrs minns well it came into my mind in a flash like and now its gone again let me seeletme see she was thinking hard and the children were waiting breathlessly when the sound of heavy footsteps came up to the kitchen door and a loud knock was heard mrs minns went to the door the children saw that it was mr goon the policeman they never seemed to be able to get away from old clearorf morning mam said clearorf to mrs minns and he took out his large black notebook about this here fire i think youve given me all the information i require but id just like to ask you a few questions about that fellow peeks the children frowned at one another so clearorf was after peeks too do you know his address asked clearorf looking at mrs minns out of his bulging paleblue eyes well said mrs minns if that isnt a peculiar thing mr goon i was just trying to think of his address at the very moment you knocked these children wanted to know it what children said clearorf in surprise he put his head in at the door and saw larry daisy and pip you again he said in disgust clear orf you kids are always popping up youre a regular nuisance what do you want peekss address for just nosey i suppose the children said nothing mr goon pointed backwards with his thumb go home i he said ive private business to do here clear orf there was nothing for it but to clear orf and the children did so running up the drive to the gate they were very angry just as mrs minns was thinking of the address said larry i hope she doesnt think of it and tell clearorf said pip gloomily if she does clearorf will go over and see peeks before we do blow said daisy they all felt very disheartened they were just going out of the gate when they heard a low whistle from the bushes nearby they turned back to see who it was lily appeared a letter in her hand she looked frightened but determined will you post this letter for me she asked its to mr peeks to warn him that people are saying he started the fire but he didnt he didnt i know he didnt you post the letter will you there was a shout from the kitchen lily where are you lily disappeared at once the children ran out of the gate excited and surprised they stopped behind a hedge when they had gone a little way and examined lilys envelope it had no stamp on the girl had forgotten it in her hurry golly said larry here weve been all the afternoon trying to get horace peeks address and couldnt and now suddenly its just been presented to us given into our hands what a bit of luck said daisy thrilled i am pleased the thing is do we want peeks to be warned said larry you see if he is warned beforehand that people are suspecting him he might run away then we shouldnt solve the mystery they all stared at one another then pip had an idea i know well go and find peeks after tea today instead of wailing for tomorrow well see him and try to make up our minds if he did it or not if we think he didnt do it well give him lilys letter good idea said the others pleased after all we cant post a letter without a stamp but we can deliver it by hand they looked at the address mr h peeks ivy cottage wilmer green well go on our bikes said larry come on we must tell the others interviewing mr horace peeks the three of them went back to fatty and bets buster greeted them uproariously hallo said fatty how did you get on awfully badly at first said larry and then right at the end we had a slice of good luck he told bets and fatty about the afternoon and they listened with the greatest interest they all examined peeks address and were thrilled so now pip and daisy and i are going on our bikes to wilmer green said larry its only about five miles at least well have tea first and then go i want to go too said bets at once id like to go but i believe im too stiff said fatty you stay with bets said pip we dont want to appear in a crowd it might put peeks on his guard you keep leaving me out said bets sadly no we dont said larry do you really want a job well find out mr smellies address see fatty will help you it may be in the telephone book or somebody may know it we shall want his address tomorrow because we must go and see him too all the suspects must be interviewed two of them are crossed off now said pip mrs minns didnt do it and im sure the tramp didnt either that only leaves mr smellie and mr peeks i do wish we could find some one wearing rubbersoled shoes with those markings it would be such a help ill find out mr smellies address said bets joyfully pleased at having something real to do ill bring the telephone book out here to fatty the teabell rang the children ran indoors to wash and were soon sitting down eating bread and butter and jam larry and daisy stayed to tea but fatty had to go back to the hotel as his mother was expecting him after tea fatty came back and joined bets larry and pip and daisy got out bicycles and cycled off they knew the way to wilmer green quite well what excuse shall we make for asking to see horace peeks said larry as they cycled quickly along nobody could think of a good excuse then pip had an idea lets go to the house and just ask for a drink of water he said if peekss mother is there i expect shell talk nineteen to the dozen and we may find out what we want to know which is where was horace peeks on the evening of the lire if his mother says he was at home with her all the evening we can cross him off good idea said larry and ill tell you what ill do too just before we get to the house ill let the air out of my front tyre see and pumping up the bike will make a further excuse for staying and talking right said pip i do think we are getting clever after some hard cycling they came to the village of wilmer green it was a pretty place with a duckpond on which many white ducks were swimming the children got off their bicycles and began to look for ivy cottage they asked a little girl where it was and she pointed it out to them it was well set back from the road and backed on to a wood the children rode to it dismounted and went into the old wooden gate larry had already let the air out of his front tyre and it was almost flat ill ask for the water said daisy they went up to the door which was halfopen there was the sound of an iron going thump thump thump daisy knocked on the door whos there said a sharp voice please could we have a drink of water asked daisy come in and get it said the voice daisy opened the door wide and went in she saw a sharpfaced old lady ironing a shirt she nodded her head towards a tap over a sink waters there she said cups on the shelf behind the two boys came in whilst daisy was running the water good evening they said politely thank you so much for letting us have some water weve cycled quite a way and were awfully hot said larry the old lady looked at him approvingly he was a goodlooking boy and had beautiful manners when he liked where have you come from she asked thumping with her iron from peterswood said larry i dont expect you know it do you that i do said the old lady my son was in service there with a mr hick oh how funny said daisy sipping the cup of water we were down in mr hicks garden the other night when there was a fire a fire said the old woman startled what fire i hadnt heard anything of that not mr hicks house surely no only his cottage workroom said pip no one was hurt but surely your son would have told you about it wouldnt he didnt he see it when was the fire asked the old lady pip told her mrs peeks stopped ironing and thought well now that was the day horace came home she said thats why he didnt know anything about it hed had a quarrel with mr hick and he gave notice he got here in the afternoon and gave me a real start then he must have missed the fire said pip i expect he was with you all the evening wasnt he no he wasnt said mrs peeks he went out after tea on his bike and i didnt see him again til it was dark i didnt ask him where he went im not one for poking or prying i expect he was down at the pig and whistle playing darts hes a rare one for darts is our horace the children exchanged glances so horace disappeared after tea and didnt come back till dark that seemed very suspicious indeed very suspicious where was he that evening it would have been so easy to slip back to peterswood on his bike hide in the ditch and set fire to the cottage when no one was about and then cycle back unseen in the darkness larry wondered what sort of shoes horace wore he looked round the kitchen there was a pair of shoes waiting to be cleaned in a corner they were about the size of the footprint but they didnt have rubber soles perhaps peeks was wearing them now the children wished he would come in i must just go and pump up my front tyre said larry getting up i wont be a minute but although he left the other two quite five minutes to talk there didnt seem anything more to be found out didnt find out anything else said pip in a low voice hallo whos this do you think it is horace they saw a weedylooking young man coming in at the gate he had an untidy lock of hair that hung over his forehead a weak chin and rather bulging blue eyes a little like mr goons he wore a grey flannel coat all the children noticed this immediately daisys heart began to beat fast could they have found the right person at last what you doing here asked horace peeks we came to ask for a drink of water said larry wondering if he could possibly edge round horace to see if there was a tear in his grey coat anywhere and we found out that we come from the same place that you lived in only a little while ago said daisy brightly we live at peterswood thats where i worked said horace do you know that badtempered old mr hick i worked for him but nothing was ever right nasty old man we dont like him very much ourselves said pip did you know there was a fire at his place the day you left how do you know what day i left asked mr peeks astonished oh we just mentioned the fire to your mother and she said it must have been the day you left because you didnt know anything about it said pip well all i can say is that mr hick deserved to have his whole place burnt down the mean stingy badtempered old fish said horace id like to have seen it the children looked at him wondering if he was pretending or not werent you there then asked daisy in an innocent voice never you mind where i was said peeks he looked round at larry who was edging all round him to see if he could spot a tear in the grey flannel coat that horace was wearing what are you doing he asked sniffing round me like a dog stop it youve got a spot on your coat said larry making up the first excuse he could think of ill rub it off he pulled out his handkerchief and with it came the letter that lily had given to him to give to horace peeks it fell to the ground address side upwards horace bent to pick it up and stared in the utmost astonishment at his own name on the envelope he turned to larry whats this he said larry could have kicked hihiself for his carelessness oh its for you he said lily asked us to post it to you but as we were coming over here we thought we might as well deliver it by hand horace peeks looked as if he was going to ask some awkward questions and larry thought it was about time to go he wheeled his bicycle to the gate well goodbye he said ill tell lily youve got her letter the three of them mounted their bicycles and rode off horace shouted after them hie you come back a minute but they didnt go back their minds were in a whirl they rode for about a mile and a half and then larry jumped off his bicycle and went to sit on a gate come on he called to the others well just talk a bit and see what we think they sat in a row on the gate looking very serious i was an idiot to drag that letter out of my pocket like that said larry looking ashamed of hihiself but pehaps it was as well i suppose letters ought to be delivered oughtnt they do you think horace started the fire it looks rather like it said daisy thoughtfully he had a spite against mr hick that very day and his mother doesnt know where he was that night you didnt notice if his shoes had rubber crisscrossed soles did you larry and was his grey flannel coat torn in any way i couldnt see his shoesoles and as far as i could see his coat wasnt torn at all said larry anyway that letter will warn him now and hell be on his guard they talked for a little while wondering what to do about peeks they decided that they would set him aside for a while and see what mr smellie was like it seemed to rest now between horace peeks and mr smellie it was no good deciding about peeks until they had also seen smellie they mounted their bicycles again and set off they freewheeled down a hill and round a corner larry went into some one with a crash he fell off and so did the other person larry sat up and stared apologetically at the man in the road to his horror it was old clearorf what you again yelled mr goon in a most threatening voice larry hurriedly got up the other two were farther down the road laughing what you doing yelled mr goon as larry stood his bicycle upright ready to mount again im clearing orf shouted larry cant you see im clearing orf and the three of them rode giggling down the hill pausing to wonder every now and again if old clearorf was on his way to see horace peeks well horace was now warned by lilys letter so mr goon wouldnt get much out of him that was certain the tramp turns up again it was seven oclock when the three of them rode up pips drive bets was getting worried because her bedtime was coming very near and she couldnt bear to think that she would have to go before she heard the news that larry daisy and pip might be bringing she jumped for joy when she heard their bicycle bells jangling as they rode at top speed up the drive it was such a lovely evening that she fatty and buster were still in the garden fatty had examined his bruises again and was pleased to see that they were now a marvellous redpurple although they hurt him he couldnt help being very proud of them what news what news yelled bets as the three travellers returned plenty cried larry half a tick lets put our bikes away soon all five and buster were sitting in the summerhouse talking fattys eyes nearly dropped out of his head when he heard how larry had dragged the letter out of his pocket and dropped it by accident at horace peekss feet but clearorfs on the trail all right said pip we met him as we were going home larry knocked him off his bike going round the corner clearorf must be brighter than we think hes a little way behind us thats all well wed better get on mr smellies track as soon as possible tomorrow said fatty bets and i have got his address good for you said larry where does he live it was in the telephone book said bets it was very easy to find because there was only one mr smellie he lives at willowdene jeffreys lane why thats just at the back of our garden said larry in surprise isnt it daisy willowdene backs on to half our garden i never knew who lived there because weve never once seen any one in the garden except an old woman that would be miss miggle the housekeeper said fatty how do you know asked daisy in surprise oh bets and i have been very good findouters today said fatty with a grin we asked your gardener where willowdene was and he knew it because his brother works there and he told us about miss miggle and how difficult she finds it to keep old mr smellie clean and make him have his meals and remember to put his mack on when it rains and so on whats the matter with him then said larry is he mad or silly or something oh no hes a something ologist said bets he studies old old paper and documents and knows more about them than any one else he doesnt care about anything but old writings the gardener says hes got some very very valuable ones hihiself well as he conveniently lives so near us perhaps larry and i could interview him tomorrow said daisy very much looking forward to a bit more findouting as bets kept calling it i think were getting rather good at interviewing i bet were better than old clearorf any suspect would know at once that mr goon was after him and would be careful what he said but people talk to children without thinking anything about it larry got his notes out from behind the loose board in the summerhouse we must add a bit to them he said and began to write pip got out the matchbox and opened it he wanted to see if the bit of grey flannel was at all ike the grey coat that horace peeks had worn it did look rather like it still larry couldnt see any torn bit said pip and i had a good look at his trousers too but i couldnt see any tear in them the children stared at the grey flannel pip put it back into the box he unfolded fattys beautiful drawing of the footprints and grinned as he remembered the tail ears and hands that he and larry had so solemnly talked about when they first looked at the footprints in the drawing you know its not half a bad drawing said pip fatty brightened up very much but he was wise enough not to say a word this time i shall learn these crisscross markings by heart so that if ever i come across them at any time i shall know them at once ill learn them too said bets and she stared seriously at the drawing she felt quite certain that if ever she spotted a footprint anywhere in the mud with those special markings she would know them immediately ive finished my notes said larry i cant say that our clues have helped us at all we must really find out if peeks wears rubbersoled shoes and we mustnt forget to look at mr smellies either but they may not be wearing them objected fatty they might have them in the cupboard or in their bedroom perhaps we could peep into mr smellies boot cupboard said larry who hadnt the faintest idea how he would set about doing such a thing listen there are four suspects one was mrs minns but as she had rheumatism all the evening of the fire and was stuck fast in her chair according to her sister she couldnt have started the fire so that leaves three suspects the tramp was another suspect but as he does not wear rubbersoled shoes or a grey coat and did not get away quickly as we might have expected him to we can practically rule him out too so that leaves two suspects i think it was horace peeks said pip why shouldnt he tell us where he was on the evening of the fire thats very suspicious well if mr smellie can tell us where he was that will only leave horace peeks said larry then we will really pay all our attention to him find out what his shoes are like and if he has a grey coat indoors with a tear and what he was doing on that evening and everything then what do we do asked bets go and tell the police what tell old clearorf and have him taking all the credit and praise to hihiself cried larry i should think not we ought to go to the inspector of police hihiself inspector jenks hes head of all the police in this district daddy knows him quite well hes a very very clever man and he lives in the next town i should be frightened of him said bets im even a bit frightened of clearorf pooh frightened of that old stickinthemud with his froggy eyes said fatty you want to be like larry sail down a hill on your bike and knock him off crash round the corner every one laughed then a bell rang and the five got up with buster running round their legs fatty said good night and went to have dinner with his father and mother at the hotel larry and daisy got their bicycles and rode home pip went in to supper and bets went off to bed buster went with fatty his young master retired to bed very early that night for he was still stiff and his bruises were painful buster had a good look at them when fatty undressed but didnt seem to think much of them tomorrow that old tramp will come to get the boots mummy has looked out for him said pip to bets well ask him a few questions what questions asked bets well ask him straight out if he saw horace peeks in the ditch hiding said pip if he says yes that will be a great help to us none of the children slept very well that night for they were all excited over the happenings of the day bets dreamt of clearorf and woke with a squeal dreaming that he was putting her in prison for starting the fire fatty slept badly because of his bruises it didnt matter how he lay he seemed to lie on two or three it had been arranged that the next day pip and bets and fatty should stay in their garden on the look out for the tramp pip should question him carefully larry had told him what to ask have the boots out so that he can see them and want them badly said larry but dont let him have them till hes answered your questions no answers no boots see so the next day fatty and buster joined pip and bets and the four of them waited for the tramp to turn up the tramp did turn up he slipped slyly in at the back gate looking all round and about as if he thought some one was after him he still had on the terrible old shoes with toes sticking out of the upper parts pip saw him and gave a low call hallo come over here the tramp looked over to where pip was standing youre not setting that bobby after me he asked of course not said pip impatiently we dont like him any more than you do got the boots asked the tramp pip nodded the old fellow shambled over to mm and pip took him to the summerhouse there was a small wooden table there and the boots were on it the tramps eyes gleamed when he saw them good boots he said theyll fit me proper wait a minute said pip as the tramp put out his hand to take them wait a minute we want you to answer a few questions first please the tramp stared at him and looked sulky im not going to be mixed up in no trouble he said of course not said pip we shant split on you what you tell us we shall keep to ourselves what do you want to know asked the tramp did you see any one hiding in mr hicks garden on the evening of the fire asked fatty yes said the tramp i saw some one in the bushes bets pip and fatty felt quite breathless did you really see them asked pip course i see them said the tramp i see plenty of people in the garden that evening so i did where were you asked bets curiously thats none of your business said the tramp roughly i wasnt doing no harm probably watching the henhouse waiting for a chance of an egg or two even though old hiccup had chased him away thought pip quite correctly they all stared at the tramp and he stared back was the person who was hiding in the bushes a young man with a lock of hair falling over his forehead asked pip describing horace peeks did he have sort of bulgy eyes dont know about his eyes said the tramp but he had a lock of hair all right he was whispering to some one but i couldnt see who this was news horace peeks hiding in the bushes with somebody else were there two people concerned in the crime then it was a puzzle could horace peeks and mr smellie have planned the fire together the children didnt know what to think look here began pip but the tramp had had enough you give me them boots he said and he stretched out his hand for them im not saying no more be getting myself into trouble if i doat look out i dont want to be naked up in anything i dont im a very honest fellow he took the boots and put them on he would not say a word more he seehis to have gone dumb said pip they watched the tramp walk away in his new boots which were a little too big for him but otherwise very comfortable well the mystery is getting deeper said fatty now we seem to have two people hiding in the garden instead of one theres no doubt one was dear horace but who was the other perhaps larry and daisy will have some news for us when they come buster had growled nearly all the time the tramp had been in the summerhouse fatty had had to hold him tight or he would have flown at the dirty old fellow now he suddenly began to bark joyously its larry and daisy said bets oh good i wonder if theyve got any news mr smellieand a rubbersoled shoe larry and daisy had spent an exciting morning they had decided to interview old mr smellie as soon as possible and get it over they talked over the best way of tackling him we cant very well go and ask for a drink of water or anything like that said daisy i simply cant imagine what excuse we can up for going to see him they both thought hard for some minutes thea larry looked up what about throwing our ball into mr smellies garden he said what good would that do asked daisy well silly we could go after it climb over the wall dont you see and hope that he will see us and ask what were doing said larry i see said daisy yes it seehis quite a good idea well do that so larry threw his ball high and it went over the trees and fell in the middle of the lawn next door the children ran down to the wall at the bottom in a moment or two they were over it and in the bushes at the end of mr smellies garden they went boldly out on to the lawn and began hunting for the ball they could see it quite well for it was in the edge of a rosebed on the lawn they called to one another as they hunted hoping that some one in the house would hear them and come to a window presently a window opened at the right side of the house and a man looked out his head was quite bald on top and he had a straggling beard that reached almost to the middle of his waistcoat he wore heavy hornrimmed glasses that made his eyes look very big what are you doing he called larry went and stood under the window and spoke extremely politely i hope you dont mind sir but our ball fell in your garden and were looking for it a gust of wind blew into the garden and flung daisys hair over her face it tugged at mr smellies beard and it rustled round the papers on the desk by him one of them rose into the air and flew straight out of the window mr smellie made a grab at it but didnt catch it it fell to the ground below ill get it for you sir said larry politely he picked up the paper and handed it back to the old man what a very queer paper he said it was thick and yellow and covered with curious writing it is parchment said mr smellie looking at larry out of shortsighted eyes this is very very old larry thought it would be a good idea to take a great interest in old papers oh sir he said is it really very old how old how very interesting mr smellie was pleased to have any one taking such a sudden interest i have much older ones he said i spend my time deciphering them reading them you know we learn a great deal of old history that way how marvellous said larry i suppose you couldnt show me any sir could you certainly my boy certainly said mr smellie positively beaming at larry come along in i think you will find that the garden door is open could my sister come too asked larry she would be very very interested i know dear me what unusual children thought mr smellie as he watched them going in at the garden door they were just wiping their feet when a little birdlike woman darted out of a room nearby and gazed at them fa surprise whatever are you doing here she said this is mr smellies house he doesnt allow any one inside hes just asked us in said larry politely we have wiped our feet very carefully just asked you in said miss miggle the housekeeper filled with astonishment but he never asks any one in except mr hick and since they quarreled even he hasnt been here but perhaps mr smellie has visited mr hick said larry still wiping his feet anxious to go on with the conversation no indeed he hasnt said miss miggle he told me that he wasnt going to visit any one who shouted at him in the disgusting way that mr hick did poor old gentleman he doesnt deserve to be shouted at hes very absentminded and a bit queer sometimes but theres no harm in him didnt he go down and see the fire when mr hicks workroom got burnt asked daisy miss miggle shook her head he went out for his usual walk that evening she said about six oclock but he came back before the the fire was discovered the children looked at one another so mr smellie had gone out that evening could he possibly have slipped down to mr hicks started the fire and come back again did you see the fire asked the housekeeper with interest but the children had no time to answer for mr smellie came out to see what they were doing they went with him into his study a most untidy room strewn with all kinds of papers its walls lined with books that reached right up to the ceiling gracious said daisy looking round doesnt any one ever tidy this room you can hardly walk without stepping on papers miss higgle is forbidden to tidy this room said mr smellie putting his glasses on firmly they had a habit of slipping down his nose which was rather small now let me show you these old old books written on rolls of paper in the year let me see now in the year er er i must look it up again i knew it quite well but that fellow hick always contradicts me and he muddles my mind so that i cant remember i expect your quarrel a day or two ago really upset you said daisy most sympathetically mr smellie took off his glasses polished them and put them back on his nose again yes he said yes i dont like quarrels hick is a most intelligent fellow but he gets very angry if i dont always agree with him now this document the children listened patiently not understanding a word of all the long speech that mr smellie was making he quite forgot that he was talking to children and he spoke as if larry and daisy were as learned as hihiself they began to feel very bored when he turned to get another sheaf of old papers larry whispered to daisy go and see if you can find any of his shoes in the cupboard outside in the hall daisy slipped out mr smellie didnt seem to notice that she was gone larry thought he would hardly notice if he larry went too daisy found the hall cupboard she opened the door and went inside it was full of boots shoes goloshes sticks and coats daisy hurriedly looked at the shoes she turned up each pair they seemed about the right size but they hadnt rubber soles then she turned up a pair that had rubber soles how marvellous perhaps they were the very ones she looked at the markings but for the life of her she couldnt quite remember the markings in the drawing of the footprint were they or were they not just like the ones she was looking at ill have to compare them thought the little girl at last i must take one shoe home with me and go down to see the footprint drawing we shall soon see if they are the right ones she stuffed a shoe up the front of her jersey it made a very funny lump but she couldnt think where else to hide the shoe she crept out of the hall cupboard straight into miss miggle miss miggle was tremendously astonished to see daisy coming out of the boot cupboard whatever are you doing she asked surely you are not playing hideandseek well not exactly said daisy who didnt quite know what to say miss miggle carried a tray of buns and milk into the study where mr smellie was still lecturing poor larry she put the tray down on the table daisy followed close behind her hoping that no one would notice the enormous lump up her jersey i thought the children would like to share your eleven oclock lunch with you sirs said miss miggle she turned to look at daisy gracious child is that your hanky up the front of your jersey what a place to keep it larry glanced at his sister and was amazed to see the curious lump behind her jersey i keep all kinds of things up my jerseyfront said daisy hoping that no one would ask her to show what she had nobody did larry was just about to but stopped hihiself in time on seeing that the lump was decidedly the shape of a shoe the children had milk and buns but mr smellie did not touch his miss miggle kept at his elbow trying to stop him talking and to make him eat and drink you have your milk now sir she kept saying you didnt have your breakfast you know she turned to the children ever since the night of the fire poor mr smellie has been terribly upset havent you sir well the loss of those unique and quite irreplaceable documents in the fire gave me a shock said mr smellie worth thousands of pounds they were oh i know hick was insured and will get his money back all right but that isnt the point the documents were of the greatest imaginable value did you quarrel about those that morning asked daisy oh no you see hick said these documents here that ive just been showing you were written by a man called ulinus said mr smellie earnestly and i know perfectly well that they were written by three different people i could not make mr hick see reason he flew into a terrible temper and practically turned me out of the house in fact he really frightened me he frightened me so much that i left my documents behind poor mr smellie said daisy i suppose you didnt know anything about the fire till the morning not a thing said mr smellie didnt you go near mr hicks house when you went for your evening walk asked larry if you had you might have seen the fire starling mr smellie looked up startled his glasses fell right off his nose he picked them up with a trembling hand and put them on again miss miggle put a hand on his arm now now she said you just drink up your milk sir youre not yourself this last day or two you told me you didnt know where you went that evening you just wandered about yes said mr smellie sitting down heavily in a chair thats what i did didnt i miggle i just wandered about i cant always remember what i do can i no you cant sir said kind miss higgle patting mr smellies shoulder the quarrel and the fire have properly upset you dont you worry sir she turned to the children and spoke in a low voice youd better go hes got hihiself a bit upset the children nodded and slipped out they went into the garden ran down to the bottom and climbed over the wall funny isnt it said daisy why did he act so strangely when we began to ask him what he did the evening of the fire do you suppose he did start it and has forgotten all about it or remembers it and is frightened or what its a puzzle said larry he seehis too gentle a man to do anything so awful as burn a cottage down but he might be fierce in some queer way what have you got under your jersey daisy a rubbersoled shoe with funny markings said daisy bringing it out do you think it is like the footprint it looks as if it might be said larry getting excited lets go straight to the others and compare it with the drawing come on i can hardly wait a surprising talk with lily larry and daisy rushed up to the others they stared at the shoe in her hand in excitement daisy oh daisy have you found the rubbersoled shoes that belong to the man who burnt the cottage asked fatty i think so said daisy importantly you see larry and i went to see mr smellie as we had planned to do and whilst he was talking to larry i slipped away and looked in his hall cupboard where shoes and things are kept and among the shoes i found one pair that had rubber soles and im almost certain the markings are the same as in those footprints we saw the children crowded round to look it certainly looks very like the right shoe said pip it is said fatty i ought to know because i drew the prints well i dont think it is said bets unexpectedly the squares on the crisscross pattern arent quite so big im sare theyre not as if you could tell said pip scornfully i think weve got the right shoe and well prove it get the drawing out of the summerhouse fatty fatty went to get it he took it from behind the loose board and brought it out to the others they unfolded it fueling very thrilled they all gazed at the drawing and then at the underneath of mr smellies shoe they looked very very hard indeed and then they sighed in disappointment bets is right said fatty the squares in the pattern of ilie rubber sole are not quite so big as in my drawing and i know my drawing is quite correct because i measured everything carefully im awfully good at things like that i never make shut up said larry who always felt cross when faty began his boasting bets as you say is quite right good for you young bets bets glowed with pleasure she really had learnt that drawing off by heart as she had said she would but she was as disappointed as the others that daisy had not found the right shoe after all its awfully difficult being a findouter isnt it said bets we keep finding out things that arent much help or that make everything even more difficult pip tell larry and daisy what the tramp said oh yes you must hear about that said pip and he began to tell larry and daisy what had happened with the tramp so now you see its a bigger puzzle than ever finished pip the tramp saw peeks all right hiding in the bushes but he heard him whispering to some one else was it old mr smellie do you think you say that he went out for a walk that evening and we know that peeks was out at that time too do you suppose they planned the fire together they might have said larry thoughtfully they must have known one another and they might have got together that day and made up their minds to punish old hiccup for his unkindness however can we find out perhaps we had better see mr smellie again said daisy anyway we must put back his shoe somehow we cant keep it any one seen clearorf today nobody had and nobody wanted to the children talked over what they were to do next at the moment everything seemed rather muddled and difficult although they had ruled out mrs minns and the tramp from their list of suspects it seemed impossible to know whether peeks or smellie or both had really done the crime it wouldnt be a bad idea to go and see lily said fatty suddenly she might tell us a few things about horace peeks after all she wrote him a letter to warn him she might know more than we think but lily wasnt there that evening said daisy it was her evening off she said so well how are we to know she didnt go back to hiccups and hide in the garden said fatty it seehis as if half the village was hiding in that garden on the evening of the fire said larry the old tramp was there and we think smellie was and we know peeks was and now you say perhaps lily was too i know its really funny to think how full hiccups garden was that evening grinned fatty well dont you think it would be a good thing to go and see lily i dont suspect her of anything but it would be just as well to see if she can tell us anything to help us yes its quite a good idea said larry blow theres your dinnerbell pip well have to leave thiags till this afternoon well all go down and see lily well take something for the cat and kittens again and what about mr smellies shoe when shall we take that back wed better take it back this evening said daisy you take it back larry when its dark you may find the garden door open and you can just slip in and put the shoe back right said larry and he got up to go well be back after lunch findouters by the way how are your bruises fatty fine said fatty proudly ill show you them cant stop now said larry ill see them this afternoon so long ones going yellow already said fatty but larry and daisy were gone pip and bets were running to the house afraid of getting into trouble if they waited any longer fatty went off with buster hoping that the others wouldnt forget about his bruises in the afternoon they all met together again at halfpast two daisy had stopped at the fishmongers and bought some fish for the cats it smelt very strong and buster kept worrying her to undo the paper nobody asked fatty about his braises he was offended and sat gloomily whilst the others discussed what to say to lily bets noticed his face and was surprised whats the matter fatty she asked are you ill no said fatty just a bit stiff thats all daisy took a look at him and gave a little squeal of laughter oh poor fatty we said wed look at his bruises and we havent every one laughed fattys an awful baby said larry cheer up fatone show us your bruises and let us admire every one of them big medium and small theyre not worth mentioning said fatty stiffly come on lets get going wed better get off quickly or it will be teatime before weve finished talking well see his bruises at teatime whispered daisy to larry hes gone all sulky now so they set off down the lane to find lily they felt certain they would not be caught by hiccup this time because pip had seen him go by in his car not long before one or two of us must talk to mrs minns said larry and the others had better try and get lily out into the garden and talk to her well see how things go but as it happened everything was very easy mrs minns was out and there was no one in the kitchen but lily she was pleased to see the children and buster ill just put sweetie and the kittens out in the hall and shut the door she said then that little dog can come in i like dogs whats his name buster i thats a nice name for a dog buster buster would you like a bone soon the cat and kittens were safely out of the way and buster was gnawing a bone on the floor lily got out some chocolate from a drawer and handed it round the children liked her she seemed much more cheerful without mrs minns to shout at her we gave that note to horace peeks said larry we found him all right yes i got a letter from him today said lily she looked rather sad suddenly that nasty mr goon went up and saw mm and said all kinds of horrible things to mm horace is that worried he doesnt know what to do did mr goon think he had started the fire then asked daisy yes said lily a good many people are saying that but it isnt true how do you know asked fatty well i do know said lily but you werent here said larry if you werent here you cant possibly know who did or didnt start the fire it might have been horace for all you know now dont you say a word if i tem you something will you said lily suddenly promise say honour bright ill not tell a soul the five children recited the seven words very solemnly and lily looked relieved well then she said ill tell you how i know it wasnt horace that did it i know because i met him at five oclock that day and was with him till i got in here at tea oclock which is my time for being in the five children stared at her this was indeed news but why didnt you tell every one that asked larry at last if you said that no one would say that horace burnt down the cottage lilys eyes filled with tears well you see she said my mother says im too young to say ill marry any one but horace peeks he loves me and i love him my father said hed thrash me if he caught me walking out with horace and mrs minns said shed tell my father if ever she caught me speaking a word to him so i didnt dare to go out to the pictures with him or even to talk to him in the house poor lily said daisy so when you heard every one talking against him you were very upset and wrote to warn him yes said lily and you see if i tell that i was out with him that night my father will punish me and maybe mrs minns will send me off so ill lose my job and horace cant say he was with me because he knows it will be hard for me if he does where did you go asked fatty i went on my bicycle halfway to wilmer green said lily we met at his sisters there and had tea together and a bite of supper we told his sister all about how poor horace had lost his fob that day and she said maybe her husband would give mm some work till he could find another job fatty remembered that the tramp had seen horace peeks in the garden that evening and he looked sharply at lily could she be telling all the truth are you sure that horace didnt come here at all that night he said the others knew why he said it they too remembered that the tramp had said he had seen horace peeks no no cried lily raising her voice in fright she twisted her handkercmef round and round in her hands and stared at the children horace wasnt anywhere near here i tell you we met at his sisters you can ask her shell tell you larry felt certain that lily was frightened and was not telling the truth he decided to be bold lily he said in a very solemn voice somebody saw horace in the garden that evening lily stared at larry with wide horrified eyes no she said they couldnt have seen him they couldnt well they did said larry lily stared at him for a moment and then began to sob who could have seen him she said mrs minns and her sister were here in the kitchen mr hick and the chauffeur were out there wasnt any one about i know there wasnt how do you know if you werent here asked larry well said lily swallowing a sob well ill tell you i was here now dont you forget youve said honour bright you wont tell a soul you see this is what happened i rode off to meet horace and when i met him he told me hed left some of his things at mr hicks and he wanted them but he didnt dare to go and ask mr hick for them so i said to him well horace i said mr hicks out and why dont you come along and get them now before he comes back the children listened breathlessly they were getting the truth at last lily went on twisting her handkerchief round and round all the time so when wed had a cup of tea we rode off here and we left our bikes behind the hedge up the lane nobody saw us we walked down behind the hedge till we got to mr hicks then we both slipped into lie bushes and waited a bit to see if any one was about the children nodded the tramp had said that he had heard peeks whispering to some one and that some one must have been lily i soon found out that mrs mirhis had got her sister talking to her went on lily and i knew theyd sit there for ages i said to horace that id get his things for him if he liked but he wanted to get them hihiself sol kept watch whilst he slipped into the house by an open window got his things and came out into the bushes again then we went off on our bikes without seeing a soul and horace didnt slip down the garden to the workroom asked larry lily looked indignant that he didnt she said for one thing id have seen him for another thing he wasnt gone more than three minutes and for another thing my horace wouldnt do a thing like that well that lets horace out said larry saying aloud what every one else was thinking he couldnt have done it im glad you told us all this lily golly i do wonder who did it then it only leaves mr smellie said bets without thinking betss words had an astonishing result lily let out a squeal and stared at bets as if she couldnt believe her ears she opened and shut her mouth like a fish and didnt seem able to say a word whatevers the matter asked larry in surprise what did she say that for asked lily almost in a whisper how does she know that mr smellie was here that night now it was the childrens turn to look surprised well and larry we dont know for certain we only just wondered but why are you so astonished lily what do you know about it anyway you didnt see mr smellie did you you said that no one saw you aad horace thats right said lily but horace saw some one when he got in through the window and went upstairs to get his things he saw some one creeping in through the garden door and it was mr smellie golly said larry and pip they all stared at one an other so mr smellie did go down here that night said larry no wonder he was so startled when you asked him if he went anywhere near mr hicks on the evening of the fire said daisy he did it said bets triumphantly now we know h e did it hes a wicked old man do you think he did it fatty asked lily she looked puzzled and perplexed dont know she said hes a nice quiet old gentleman think and always had a kind word for me its not like him to do such a violent thing as set something on fire but what i do know is it wasnt horace no it doesnt look as if it could have been horace agreed larry i see now why you didnt say anything before lily you were afraid well we shant teil any one it seehis to me that we must now turn more of our attention to mr smellie no doubt about that said fatty well weve certainly found out a few things this afternoon clearorf turns up at an awkward moment the children stayed talking to lily for a little while and then as it was getting near teatime they had to go the girl was relieved to have told somebody of her troubles and she saw them off after they had once more promised to keep to thehiselves all that she had told them they were all having tea at pips which was nice because they could talk everything over they were very excited indeed things are moving said pip rubbing his hands together they certainly are moving i dont believe horace peeks had anything to do with it at all not a thing i think it was mr smellie look how scared he was when you and daisy spoke to him about his walk that evening why should he be scared if he hadnt done anything wrong and we know his shoes are the right size even if the rubbersoles dont match the drawing said daisy maybe he has got a pair that do match said fatty but hes hidden them somewhere in case he did leave footprints behind he might have thought of that yes thats so said larry if only we could find some one with a torn grey flannel suit that really would settle matters we really ought to search and see if we can find those shoes said daisy i should think they are in his study somewhere you know he told us that miss miggie isnt allowed to tidy up in there he could easily pop them into a cupboard there or behind those rows of books or somewhere daisy thats a clever idea of yours said larry pleased i believe youre right shall i creep in tonight and have a hunt are we allowed to get into peoples houses and hunt for their shoes said pip doubtfully well we cant ask anybody that said larry well just have to do it were not doing anything wrong were only trying to find out something i know but grownups are funny said pip im sure most of them wouldnt like children creeping about their houses looking for clues well i dont see what else to do said larry i really dont anyway silly weve got to put back the shoe that daisy took havent we yes agreed pip that certainly must be done dont get caught thats all i shant said larry sh here comes your mother pip talk about something else pips mother asked fatty how he was after his fall fatty was delighted because the others had quite forgotten to ask about his bruises again thank you im all right he said but my bruises are rather extraordinary ive got one the shape of a dogs head rather like busters head really really said pips mother astonished do let me seek fatty spent a wonderful five minutes showing all his braises one after another especially the one shaped like a dogs head it was difficult to see how he made out that it was shaped like one but pips mother seemed most interested the children scowled how annoying grownups were here they had been trying to stop fatty from continually showing off and boasting and now pips mother was making him ten times worse in a few minutes fatty was telling her all about the braise he had had once that was shaped like a churchbell and the other that looked like a snake im a really marvellous bruiser he said i shall be a wonderful sight tomorrow when im in the yellow stage come on whispered larry to pip i cant stick this this is fatty at his worst leaving fatty talking eagerly to pips mother the four children crept off buster stayed with fatty wagging his tail he really seemed as much interested in his young masters bruises as the grownup lets go for a bikeride and leave old fatty to hihiself said pip in disgust i cant bear him when he gets like this so the four of them went for a bikeride and fatty was surprised and hurt to find that he was all alone in the garden when pips mother left him he couldnt think why the others had gone and he spent a miserable hour by hihiself thinking how unkind they were when they came back he greeted them with a volley of complaints you are mean why did you go off like that is that the way to behave pip when people come to tea with you youre horrid well we thought youd probably be about an hour boasting to pips mother said larry dont look so fierce fatty you shouldnt be such an idiot going off like that finding clues and things without me said fatty angrily arent i a findouter too what have you been doing seeing horace peeks or lily again you are mean we didnt see any one said bets feeling sorry for fatty she had so often been left out of things because she was younger than the others and she knew how horrid it was to feel leftout we only went for a bikeride but fatty was really offended and hurt i dont think i want to belong to the findouters any more he said ill take my drawing of the footprints and go i can see you dont want me come on buster nobody wanted buster to leave the findouters and they didnt really want fatty to either he wasnt so bad once you got used to him daisy went after him come back silly she said we do want you we want to discuss what to do tonight about mr smellies shoes you come and say what we ought to do too i want to go into mr smellies house and keep guard for larry whilst he is hunting for the shoes we think mr smellie has hidden but he wont let me fatty went back to the others still looking rather sulky larry i do wish youd let me creep into mr smellies house with you said daisy fatty dont you think i really ought to keep guard for him no i dont said fatty i think a boy ought to go with larry ill go larry you shall do the hunting and ill watch out that nobody discovers you no ill go said pip at once you wouldnt be able to slip out without being seen said larry fatty could his parents dont seem to bother about him much all right fatty you come and help me then i thought id wait till about halfpast nine and then scout about and see if old smellie is still in his study its no use trying anything till hes gone to bed he may be one of these people that stays up until about three oclock in the morning of course well have to see well ill be along about halfpast nine said fatty wheres the shoe in the summerhouse ill bring it with me in case your mother wants to know where you got it from itll be dark then and no one will see what im carrying fatty cheered up very much when he found that there was something really exciting he could join in he forgot his sulks and discussed where to meet larry i shall climb over the wall at the bottom of the garden said larry but you fatty had better go up the road in front of mr smelies house and go into the drive there and round to the back that way meet me somewhere at the back of the house see right said fatty ill hoot like an owl to tell you when im there can you hoot said bets in surprise yes listen said fatty he put his two thumbs side by side frontways and cupped his hands together he blew carefully between his thumbs and at once a mournful quavering hoot just like an owls came from his closed hands it was marvellous oh you are clever fatty said bets in great admiration fatty blew again and an owls hoot sounded over the garden he really was very good at it simply wonderful said bets fatty opened his mouth to say that he could make much better bird and animal noises than that but caught a look in larrys eye that warned him in time to say nothing he shut his mouth again hurriedly well said larry thats settled then you meet me at halfpast nine behind mr smellies house and hoot like an owl to tell me youre there i shall probably be mding in the bushes somewhere waiting for you the children all felt excited as they went to bed that night at least fatty didnt go to bed though larry did but then larrys mother usually came to tuck mm up and say good night and fattys didnt so fatty felt quite safe as he sat fullydressed in his bedroom reading a book to make the time pass at ten past nine he switched off his light and put his nose outside his bedroom door there was no one about he slipped along the passage and down the stairs out of the garden door he went and into the hotel garden in half a minute he was in the lane and running up it with the shoe tucked under his coat at just before halfpast nine he came to mr smellies house and stopped outside the front gate the house was quite dark fatty walked up and down outside for a moment or two to make quite certain that there was no one about he didnt see some one standing quite still by one of the big trees that lined the road he walked down in front of the house once more making up his mind to go into the drive and then quite suddenly he felt a strong hand on his shoulder poor fatty almost jumped out of his skin oooh he said frightened and the shoe dropped from beneath his coat ho said a voice that fatty knew only too well ho a torch was flashed into his face and the voice said ho again this time more loudly it was clearorf s voice he had been standing quietly beside the tree and had been astonished to see fatty come up the lane and walk softly up and down in front of the house now he was even more astonished to find that it was one of them children he bent down and picked up the shoe he stared at it in the greatest astonishment whats this he said it looks like a shoe said fatty let me go youve no right to clutch me like that what are you doing with this shoe asked clearorf in an astonished voice wheres the other i dont exactly know said fatty truthfully the policeman shook him angrily none of your cheek he said he turned the shoe upside down and saw the rubbersole at once the same thought flashed across his mind as had flashed across daisys when she had first seen it the markings were like those on the footprint mr goon stared at the shoe in amazement he flashed his torch at fatty again where did you get this he asked whose is it fatty looked obstinate some one found it and gave it to me he said at last i shall keep it for the time being said mr goon now you just comealongame for a minute but fatty didnt mean to do that with a sudden quick twist he was out of clearorf s grasp and tearing up the lane as fast as he could go he went right to the top and then round and into the lane in which larrys house stood he slipped into larrys drive when he came to it and made his way to the bottom of the garden his heart beating loudly he shinned up to the top of the wall and dropped down he made his way cautiously to the back the house then he hooted like an owl oooooo ooooooooooooooo a fright for larry and fatty in another moment poor fatty almost jumped out of his skin again some one clutched his arm hard he had been expecting an answering whistle or hoot from somewhere about but he had not guessed that larry was behind the bush that he hihiself was standing by oooh said fatty startled sh came larrys voice in a whisper have you got the shoe no said fatty and explained quickly what had happened to it larry listened in dismay you are an idiot he said giving one of our best clues away to old clearorf like that hell know we are after the same ideas as he is now the shoe wasnt a clue argued fatty it was a mistake we thought it was a clue but it wasnt anyway clearorf s got it and i really couldnt help it he nearly got me too i only just managed to twist away what shall we do asked larry shall we go in and hunt now theres no light in the study old mr smellie must have gone to bed yes come on said fatty wheres the garden door they soon found it and to their great delight it was still unlocked as there was a light from the kitchen the two boys thought that miss miggle was still up they decided to be very cautious indeed they slipped in at the door larry led the way to the study where he and daisy had talked to mr smellie that day youd better stay on guard in the hall he said then if miss miggle or mr smellie do happen to come along you can warn me at once i shall open one of the windows of the study if i can do it without making a lot of noise then i can slip out of it if any one thinks of walking into the room larry went into the study he had a torch with him and he shone it round the untidy room there were papers everywhere papers and books on the desk papers and books on the floor and on the chairs there were books in the bookcases that lined the wall and books on the mantelpiece it was quite plain that mr smellie was a very learned man larry began to hunt for the shoes he hoped to find he pulled out a few books from each shelf in the bookcase and ran his hand behind but there was nothing there he looked under the piles of paper everywhere but he found no shoes fatty was outside in the hall keeping guard he saw the hallcupboard where daisy had found the shoe and he thought it would be a good idea to peep into it daisy might possibly have overlooked some shoes that might be the right one he slipped into the cupboard he was so very busy turning up the shoes and boots in the cupboard that he didnt hear some one slipping a latchkey into the front door he didnt hear some one coming into the hall and quietly closing the front door so he had no time at all to warn poor larry to escape he only heard mr smellie when the old man walked into the study and switched on the light it was too late to do anything then of course larry was caught with his head inside a cupboard not knowing that any one was in the room until the light was suddenly switched on he took his head out of the cupboard in horror he and mr smellie stared at one another larry in fright and mr srnellie in anger and amazement robber said mr smeffie angrily thief wicked boy ill lock you up and telephone to the police he pounced on larry and took hold of him with a surprisingly strong hand he shook the boy hard and larry gasped please sir he began please sir but mr smellie was not going to listen to anything his precious papers were all the world to him and the sight of somebody rummaging through them filled him with such fury that he was unable to listen to a word shaking larry hard and muttering all sorts of terrible threats he pushed the boy before him into the hall poor fatty overcome with shame at having failed to warn larry shivered in the hall cupboard outside not daring to show hihiself bad wicked boy he heard mr smellie say as he pushed poor larry up the stairs larry was protesting all the time but mr smeffie wouldnt listen to a word ill fetch the police in ill hand you over fatty trembled it was bad enough to be caught but it was even worse to think that poor larry might be handed over to that horrid old clearorf he heard mr smeffie take larry to a room upstairs and lock him in miss miggle amazed at the sudden noise came rushing into the hall to see what the matter was thieves and robbers cried mr smeffie thats what the matter is i came home just now walked into my study and there i found thieves and robbers after my papers miss miggle imagined that there must have been two or three men there and she gaped in astonishment where are the robbers she asked locked in the boxroom upstairs said mr smellie miss miggle stared at mr smellie in even greater surprise she couldnt believe that he had taken two or three men upstairs by hihiself and locked them into the boxroom she saw that mr smellie was trembling with excitement and shock now you just go and sit down quietly before you telephone the police she said soothingly youre all of a shake ill just bring you something to drink the robbers are safe enough upstairs for a bit mr smellie sank down on a chair in the hall his heart was thumping and he was breathing hard be all right in a minute he gasped ha got the best of the robbers miss miggle ran to the kitchen fatty listened breathlessly somehow he felt certain that old mr smellie bad gone back into the study he didnt know that he was sitting on a chair just at the foot of the stairs id better take this chance of rescuing poor larry thought fatty in desperation he opened the cupboard door and made a dart for the stairs mr smellie was most arnazed to see another boy appearing this time out of the hall cupboard he could hardly believe his eyes was his house alive with boys that night he made a grab at fatty fatty was startled and let out a yell he tried to run up the stairs and dragged mr smellis behind him for a few steps the old man had got his strength back again by now and filled with anger at the sight of what he thought was yet another thief he clung to stty like a limpet the boy went up a few more steps with mr smellie almost tearing the coat off his back then fatty stumbled and sat down heavily on a stair about halfway to the top of the flight mr smellie fell on top of mm almost squashing the boy flat owwow yelled poor fatty get off youre hurting me miss miggle dropped the glass she was holding and rushed into the hall what in the wide world could be going on was the whole house full of robbers she was just in time to see fatty wriggle out from under mr smellie and roll down the stairs to the bottom with many bumps and loud groans she saw at once that he was only a boy and she spoke to him severely whats the meaning of this how dare you come into some one elses house whats your name and where do you live fatty decided to be very upset and hurt miss miggle was a very kind soul and perhaps she would let him off if she thought he was nothing but a bad little boy out on an escapade so fatly lifted up his voice and howled larry heard him and wondered whatever could be happening he banged at the locked door adding to the noise and commotion miss miggle looked quite bewildered hes locked my friend into a room upstairs howled fatty i was just going up to rescue him when mr smellie caught me and pummelled me and threw me down the stairs oh im covered with bruises what my mother will say when she sees them i really dont know shell have mr smellie up for injuring a child shell call in the police now you cant possibly be bruised yet said miss miggle im sure such a kind old man as mr smellie wouldnt throw you down the stairs dont be a naughty little storyteller im not im not said fatty pretending to weep im covered with bruises look here and here and there and there oh fetch a doctor fetch a doctor to miss miggles extreme astonishment and to mr smellies horror the boy in the hall was really and truly covered with the most terrifying purple green and yellow bruises they stared at fatty as he showed them his curious markings it did not occur to either of them that the boy had had them for one or two days already mr smellie said miss miggle in a most reproachful tone just look at the poor child how could you knock a little boy about like that what his parents will say i really do not dare to think mr smellie was simply horrified when he thought that he had been the cause of fattys awful bruises he swallowed hard once or twice and stared at fatty better put something on the bruises he suggested at last ill do that whilst you phone for the police said miss miggle remembering the other robbers whom she still supposed were locked up in the boxroom above but mr smellie didnt seem to want to phone for the police now he looked a bit sheepish and said well miss miggle perhaps it would be better to ask the boys for an explanation of their curious behaviour in my house before i call in the police will you let my friend out please said fatty we didnt come here to rob you it was only a joke really lets call it quits shall we if you dont say anything to the police we wont tell our mothers and i wont show my bruises mr smellie cleared his throat miss miggle looked at him so the robbers and thieves were only two small boys she said dear dear why didnt you cae me i could have settled the matter without all this noise and commotion and throwing down the stairs i didnt throw him down the stairs said mr smellie going up to let larry out of the boxroom very soon larry was down in the hall with fatty and mr smellie took them both into his study miss miggle came in with some stuff to put on fattys bruises larry looked most astonished but didnt say a word dear dear i never in my life saw such dreadful braises on any child said miss miggle dabbing each bruise with the stuff from her bottle im a wonderful bruiser began fatty i once had a bruise shaped exactly like a churchbell what were you two boys doing in my house tonight said mr smellie sharply he didnt want to hear any history of bruises larry and fatty were silent they really didnt know what to say youll have to tell him that said miss miggle you didnt come in here for any good purpose ill be bound now be good boys and own up still the boys were silent mr smellie suddenly lost his temper unless you tell me what you came here for i will hand you over to the police he said well i dont know what theyll say when they see all my bruises said fatty ive an idea those bruises were made before tonight said mr smellie getting sharper and sharper i know what yellow means in a braise if miss miggle doesnt the boys said nothing name and addresses barked mr smellie getting out a pen ill see your parents as well as the police the idea of their fathers and mothers knowing that they had been caught wandering about some one elses house at night was much more alarming than having in the police larry suddenly surrendered we came to bring back a shoe we took this morning he said in a low voice both miss miggle and mr smellie stared as if they thought larry had gone mad a shoe said mr smellie at last why a shoe and why only one what are you talking about we were looking for a shoe that fitted a footprint said larry desperately this was even more puzzling to the two listeners mr smellie tapped his pen impatiently on his desk explain properly he said i give you one minute at the end of that time i telephone the police and also your parents if you havent given me a full and proper explanation of your most extraordinary conduct its no use said fatty to larry well have to tell him the real reason even if it does warn him and put him on his guard what are you talking about said miss miggle who was getting more and more astonished put me on my guard said mr smellie what do you mean really i began to think that you two boys are completely mad were not said larry sulkily but we happen to kaow something about you mr smellie we know that you were in mr hicks house on the evening of the fire the effect of these words was most astonishing mr smellie dropped his pen on the floor and sprang to his feet his glasses fell off his nose and his beard shook and quivered miss miggle looked immensely surprised you mere there werent you said larry somebody saw you they told us who told you spluttered mr smellie horace peeks saw you said larry he was in the house hihiself that evening getting some of his things before mr hick came back and he saw you how will you explain that to the police oh mr smellie sir what were you doing down there that evening cried poor miss miggle at once thinking that her employer might possibly have fired the cottage mr smellie sat down and put his glasses on his nose again miggle he said i see that you suspect me of firing mr hicks workroom how you can think such a thing after serving me all these years and knowing that i cannot even kill a fly i dont know well why did you go there then asked miss miggle youd better tell me sir ill look after you whatever youve done i dont need any looking after said mr smellie with some sharpness all i went down to mr hicks for was to get the papers i had forgotten to bring away with me after my quarrel with the fellow that morning i certainly went into his house but i did not go near the workroom i got my papers and here they are on the table i showed them to this boy and his sister this very morning surprises and shocks all three stared at mr smellie who was quite clearly speaking the truth golly said larry so thats why you went there didnt you hide in the ditch then no of course not said mr smellie i walked down the drive quite openly found the garden door open and went in and collected my papers then i walked out i bid nowhere unless you think that standing by the gate for a little while to make sure no one was about was hiding oh said larry this was terribly puzzling if what mr smeuie said was true then there were no suspects left at all but somebody must have done the deed and now will you kindly tell me what you took my shoe for asked mr smellie larry told him and then fatty told him who had now got the shoe mr smellie was annoyed that interfering policeman he said he has been up and down past my house goodness knows how many times today i suppose he has been suspecting me too now hes got my shoe i do think you boys deserve a good whipping well sir we are only trying to find out who started the fire said fatty he told mr smellie all they had done so far miss miggle listened in admiration and amazement she was divided between indignation that the boys should have suspected mr smellie so strongly and astonishment that they should have found so many clues and suspects well said mr smellie at last i think its about time you went home you two i can assure you that i had nothing whatever to do with the fire and have no idea who had i shouldnt think it would be horace peeks more likely the old tramp anyway my advice to you is to leave it to the police you children will never find out things like that the boys stood up sorry about your shoe sir said fatty so am i said mr smellie dryly its got my name inside so ive no doubt mr goon will be along here in the morning good night and try not to suspect me of any more fires thefts killings or anything of that sort will you i am really only a harmless elderly fellow interested in nothing but my old papers the boys left distinctly subdued they couldnt help thinking that mr smellie hadnt had anything to do with the firing of the cottage but then who had im tired said lany meet tomorrow at pips place your bruises came in useful fatty without them i dont believe wed have got free they looked fine didnt they said fatty cheerfully well good night weve had an adventurous evening havent we the other three were amazed and admiring when they heard all that had happened to lany and fatty but they were even more puzzled than amazed its a most extraordinary thing said pip thoughtfully we keep finding that all kinds of people were hiding in the garden that night and all of them were there for some definite reason even the tramp he was after eggs and yet we cant put our fingers on the real wrongdoer could the tramp have done it could horace have set fire to the cottage although he was only gone three minutes could mr smellie have done it horace says he saw him in the house getting his papers but its possible he might have fired the cottage after that yes but somehow i feel certain he didnt now said larry lets go down to hiccups garden and have a big think we may have missed something they all went down they saw lily hanging out the clothes and whistled to her with a quick look round to see that mrs minns was not about she ran to them lily where exactly did you and horace hide in the bushes asked larry were you in the ditch by the workroom oh no said lily and she pointed to some bushes by the drive we were there we never went near the ditch and old smellie says he only hid for a moment by the gate but someone hid in the ditch said fatty thoughtfully lets go there every one they went to the ditch the nettles were rising up again by this tame but it was still easy to see where they had been flattened by some one the children squeezed through the gap and went to look at the footprint on the space where the turf had been taken away it was still there but fainter now you know said daisy suddenly you know these footprints the one here and the ones round about the stile all point one way they are coming towards the house but not going away whoever hid in the ditch came across the fields to the house but there are no footprints at all to show that he went back that way he might have gone out of the front gate silly said fatty well i must say i feel defeated today our clues dont tell us anything now and all our suspects seem to be innocent i feel a bit tired of finding out things that lead us nowhere lets do something else today lets go for an allday picnic oooh yes said every one well go back for our bikes well go to buraham beeches and have a lovely time betss mother would not allow her to go because it was too far for an eightyearold to ride the little girl was very disappointed id rather bets didnt go for a picnic today anyway said her mother she looks a bit pale leave buster behind and let her go for a walk with him shell like that bets did love taking buster for walks tat it hardly made up for missing a picnic fatty was very sorry for her when she stood at the gate waving to them as they went off on their bikes ill bring you back heaps of primroses he called look after buster wont you buster wagged his tail he meant to look after bets not have bets look after mml he too felt sad when he saw the children going off without him but he knew that he could never run fast enough to keep up with bicycles it had been raining in the night and everywhere was muddy bets thought she had better put on her rubber boots she went to get them buster pattered after her on muddy paws its a pity you cant wear goloshes or something buster she said you get awfully muddy the two of them set off for a walk bets went down the lane to the river she chose a little path that ran alongside the river for some way and then turned back again across a field that led to the stile where the children had seen the exciting footprints a few days before bets danced along throwing sticks for buster and remembering not to throw stones for him to fetch because fatty said they broke his teeth she stooped down to pick up a stick and then stood still in the greatest astonishment there plainly to be seen on the muddy path in front of her was a line of footprints exactly like the ones the children had found by the stile bets by now knew the prints by heart for she had gazed at fattys drawings so often she felt absolutely certain that they were the same there was the rubber sole with its crisscross markings and the little squares with the blobs at each corner ooh look buster said bets at last she could feel her heart thumping with excitement buster came to look he sniffed at the footprints and then looked up at bets wagging his tail theyre the same prints arent they buster dear said bets and listen buster it only rained last night so some one must have walked along here since then and that some one is the person were after though we dont know who oh buster whats the best thing to do i do feel so excited dont you buster capered round the little girl as if he understood eveiy single word she said she stood for a moment or two looking down at the line of footprints well follow them buster she said thats what well do well follow them see i dont know how long it is since the person walked along here but its not very long anyway come on we may even catch up with the person who made the prints oh this is exciting the htde girl followed the footprints with buster he put his nose down to them and mowed them too though it was really the smell he was following not the marks thehiselves along the muddy path thef went and then crossed a road to the other side then up another footpath where they showed quite plainly and then into alaue here they were not so easy to follow but busters nose was most useful for he could follow the smell even where there was no footprint to be seen you really are very clever buster said bets in great admiration i wish my nose was like yours yes thats right thats another of the prints and heres another and another look theyre going to the stile so they were it was plain that the owner of the prints had crossed the stile and jumped down on to the field beyond bets grew more and more excited the prints are going the same way as the other prints did she said to buster look now buster dear use your nose well across this field because i cant see anything on the grass of course buster went across the field in a straight line his black nose held close to the ground he could smell exactly where the person had walked soon bets came to a bare muddy bit and there she saw a footprint clearly outlined you are going the right way buster she said keep your nose down hurry maybe we shall find the person if were quick i believe these footprints have only just been made the footprints did not lead to the gap in the hedge instead they led over another stile and up the lane that led to bets own house but at mr hicks gate the prints turned and went up mr hicks own drive bets was amazed so the man who fired the cottage had actually gone back to it today she wondered if he had gone to the front door or the back door she went up the muddy drive her face down watching the prints they went right to the front door just as she got there the door opened and mr hick appeared he seemed astonished to see bets well what are you doing here he asked oh mr hick gasped bets too excited to think that she might be giving away any of the findouters secrets im following these footprints and they go right to your door oh mr hick its most awfully important to know who made them has any one been to see you today mr hick looked surprised and he frowned at bets and buster i dont understand he said why is it so awfully important well if only i knew who made these footprints i should be able to tell the others who fired your cottage the other evening said bets importantly mr hick looked completely bewildered and he stared very hard indeed at bets youd better come in he said at last this is very extraordinary what is a child like you doing following footprints and how do you know anything about it come in no leave the dog outside let him come too said bets hell be very very good hell scratch your door down if you leave him outside so buster went in too and soon the three of them were sitting in mr hicks study which like mr smellies was littered with papers and books now said mr hick trying to speak in a pleasant voice which was very difficult for him now little girl you tell me why you followed those footprints and what you know about them it may be a help to me bets proud to have a grownup listening to her so closely poured out the whole story of the findouters and what they had done she told mr hick about the clues and the suspects and he listened without saying a single word buster made hihiself a perfect nuisance all the time he would keep going over to mr hick sniffing at him and trying to nibble his feet mr hick got most annoyed but buster wouldnt leave him alone in the end bets had to take him on her knee and keep him there when she had finished her story right up to that very morning she looked eagerly at mr hick now will you tell me who came here today she asked well said mr hick slowly as it happens two of your suspects came here mr smellie came to borrow a book and horace peeks came to ask me for a reference oh so it might be either of them said bets i do wonder which of them wore the rubbersoled shoes with those markings well anyway now we know for certain it was one of those two mr hick you wont tell a single soul what ive told you this morning will you certainly not said mr hick a lot of people seem to have been in my garden that day i went up to town didnt they wait till i get my fingers on the one who played that dirty trick on me and burnt all my valuable papers id better go now said bets she stood up and put buster down he immediately rushed to mr hick and began to sniff at his trousers in a way that mr hick thoroughly disliked he kicked buster away and the dog yelped oh dontl said bets dismayed you shouldnt kick a dog mr hick thats cruel you go now and take that dog with you said mr hick and my advice to you children is dont meddle in things that concern grownups leave the police to do thefindingout oh we must go on said bets after all we are the findouters she went up the drive with buster and saw the footprints once again one row went up the drive and one row went down how bets wished she knew whether the prints had been made by smellie or peeks she longed and longed for the others to come home she could hardly wait to tell them her news she wondered if they would mind her telling mr hick all that she had told him but after all it couldnt matter him knowing he would do all he could to help them bets was sure and he had faithfully promised not to tell any one at all the others came back after tea tired and happy after a lovely day at burnham beeches fatty presented bets with an enormous bunch of primroses bets could not wait for one moment to tell them her news she was simply bursting with it but just as she was in the middle of it there came a very nasty surprise up the garden appeared pips mother and with her was clearorf looking very smug and also very forbidding old clearorf said larry in a low voice whatever does he want it was soon quite clear what he had come for pips mother spoke to the children in a very stern voice children mr goon has come to me with a very extraordinary story of your doings in the last few days i can hardly believe what he says whats the matter asked pip scowling at clearorf pip dont scowl like that said his mother sharply apparently all of you have been interfering in matters that concern the police even bets i simply cannot understand it mr goon even tells me that you and frederick larry got into mr smellies house last night what will your mothers say and even little bets has been following footprints and imagining herself to be a detective who told mr goon that burst out bets nobody knows but me and mr hick mr hick rang me up and i have just been to see him said mr goon speaking with great dignity he told me all your goingson interfering little busybodies bets burst into loud sobs oh mr hick told me he wouldnt tell any one she wailed oh he did promise me faithfully hes a wicked wicked man hes broken his faithful promise i hate him bets behave yourself said her mother of course bets would go and give everything away said pip sulkily thats what comes of having her in the findouters little idiot she goes and tells everything to mr hick he rings up clearorf and now were all in the soup what are you muttering about pip said his mother who is clearorf mr goon said pip defiantly hes always telling us to clearorf ho said mr goon swelling hihiself out like an angry frog his blue eyes bulging fiercely ho didnt i always find you hanging about you kids regular pests you are now you just listen to me for a few minutes there was absolutely nothing to be done but listen to mr goon the five children stood there red and angry bets still sobbing only buster didnt seem to care but sniffed happily round clearorf who fended him off every now and again clearorf had a lot to say about nosey children and little nuisances and interfering with the law he ended up with a threat and if i come across any of you nosing about again or if mr hick reports you to me youll all get into very serious trouble he said ho yes very serious trouble you keep out of matters that dont concern you and as for you master laurence and miss daisy and you master frederick your parents are going to hear about this as well you mark my words youll be sorry you ever interefered with the law we didnt said pip desperately we only tried to help now no backchat said mr goon majestically children cant help in these things they only get into trouble very serious trouble and with that mr goon departed with pips mother a burly righteouslooking figure in dark blue very strange discoveries a storm of anger broke over poor bets when mr goon had gone idiot said pip going and blabbing everything out to old hiccup honestly youve ruined everything bets said daisy this is the end of the findouters said larry gloomily thats what comes of having a baby in it like bets everythings spoilt bets sobbed loudly fatty was sorry for her he actually put his arm round her and spoke kindly though he felt as impatient as the others at the breakup of their plans and hopes dont cry bets we all do silly things it was clever of you and buster to track those prints i must say and wouldnt i like to know which of those two peeks or smellie wore those shoes pips mother appeared again looking stern i hope you are feeling ashamed of yourselves she said i want you all to go down and apologize to mr hick for interfering in his concerns he is naturally very annoyed to think that you have been messing about each day in his garden we didnt do any harm said pip thats not the point said his mother you children simply cannot be allowed to go on to private property and into private houses without permission you will all go down immediately to mr hick and apologize do as i say at once the children set off together down the drive with buster at their heels they were all sulky and mutinous they hated having to apologize to some one they detested also they all felt that it was terribly mean of mr hick to have given bets away like that when he had solemnly promised not to hes a nasty piece of work said larry and every one agreed i dont care who fired his workroom said fatty im glad it was burnt down and his precious papers too you shouldnt say things like that said daisy though she felt much the same herself at that moment they arrived at the house and rang the bell bets pointed out the footprints and they all gazed at them with interest bets was right the prints were exactly like the ones in fattys drawing it was too bad that they had to give up the search for the criminal just as they had almost found the man mrs minns opened the door and was surprised to see the little company sweetie who was at her heels fled away with tail up in the air as soon as she saw buster i please will you tell mr hiccup er i mean mr hick that we want to see him said larry mrs minns looked even more surprised and was about to answer when a voice called from the study whos that mrs minns five children and a dog sir answered mrs minns they say they want to see you there was a pause bring them in said mr hicks voice and very solemnly the children and buster went into the study mr hick was there sitting in a big chair his legs crossed and his crest of hair looking rather alarming what have you come for he asked mother said we were all to apologize to you mr hick said pip and with one voice the children chanted in a most mournful tone we apologize mr hick hmmm said mr hick looking more amiable should think so indeed you said you wouldnt tell any one burst out bets you broke your promise mr hick didnt consider that promises made to children need be kept at all so he didnt feel guilty or say he was sorry he was about to say something when several aeroplanes passed over the garden rather low the noise made him jump and buster growled larry ran to the window he was extremely good at spotting any kind of aeroplane that flew overhead its those tempests again he cried ive only seen them twice over here look at their curious tailfins they were over here two or three days ago said mr ill hick with interest i saw them there were seven are there seven today larry counted them all the children looked out of the window except fatty he didnt look out of the window he looked at mr hick with a most bewildered expression on his face he opened his mouth as if to speak and then firmly closed it again but he still went onstaring at mr hick very deep in thought the tempests came over again roaring low lets go out and see them said larry we can see them better outofdoors goodbye mr hick goodbye and dont poke and pry again into matters that dont concern children said mr hick stiffly it was probably horace peeks that fired my workroom the police will soon make out a case against him he wore rubbersoled shoes this morning when he came to see me and there is no doubt that he made those prints up and down the drive oh said the children feeling very sorry for poor lily she would be terribly upset they knew only fatty said nothing but looked hard at mr hick again a curious expression on his face they all went out but the tempests were now gone again leaving a faint throbbing behind them well thats done said larry with relief how i hated apologizing to that mean fellow i suppose peeks did do it after all fire the cottage i mean fatty was very silent as they all walked down the lane towards the river they meant to go for a short walk before suppertime bets looked at fatty whats the matter she asked are your braises hurting you no id forgotten all about them said fatty i was thinking of something very very very queer what was it asked the others interested fatty stopped and pointed up into the sky you know those planes we saw he said the others nodded well said fatty they were tempests and they have only been over here twice once today and once on the evening of the day that the cottage was fired well what about it said larry impatiently nothing queer about that surely listen said fatty when we spoke about those tempests what did mr hick say he said that he saw them when they were over here two or three days ago and he counted them and there were seven which was quite correct what are you getting at asked pip frowning im getting at something queer said fatty where was mr hick on the evening that the fire was started on the london train said larry then how could he have seen and counted the tempests that flew over here said fatty there was a startled silence every one thought hard larry spoke first it is queer he said those planes have only been here twice every one spoke about them and if hiccup saw them that evening then he must have been here and yet his chauffeur met the london train and he walked off it said daisy he couldnt possibly have seen the planes if he was really on the train because at that time the train had hardly started out from london and so said fatty a note of triumph in his voice and so findouters we have yet another suspect mr hick hihiself oooh said bets amazed but he wouldnt fire his own cottage he might to get the insurance money on his valuable papers said fatty people do that sometimes i expect he sold the papers then set fire to the workroom and pretended the papers were burnt in order to get more money golly can it really be possible we cant tell any one said daisy i should think not said larry whatever in the world shall we do about it we must find out how it was that mr hick got on the london train that night said fatty look were near the railway line here the london trains always come by here and theres one due lets see what happens the children climbed on to the fence by the railway and sat there waiting soon they saw a cloud of smoke in the distance the train was coming it came roaring along but when it reached one portion of the line it slowed down and finally it stopped it always stops there said bets ive noticed that perhaps it gets water or something it was too far away to see why it had stopped anyway it soon started up again and puffed by the five children buster ran away behind a bush when it came he was afraid of the noise fatty was again thinking very deeply so was larry listen said fatty is it possible for any one at night to wait for the train just there and hop into an empty carriage do you think then at peterswood station if he had a season ticket people would never know he hadnt come all the way from london fatty i believe youre right said larry i was just thinking the very same thing myself i believe hiccup could have done it pretended to go to london slipped back hid in the ditch leaving those few footprints behind him fired the cottage slipped back to the railway line just there waited till the train stopped as it always does hopped into an empty carriage in the dark and then got out as cool as a cucumber to be met by his car and chauffeur at the station the more the children thought about this the more certain they felt that mr hick might have done it after all said bets a man that could break his faithful promise could do anything simply anything whatever is buster doing said fatty hearing some excited barks coming from the little dog some way back in the copse of trees behind them buster buster whats the matter found a rabbit buster yelped and then appeared dragging something black and muddy whatever has he got said bets every one looked to see its an old shoe said daisy laughing buster what do you want with an old shoe buster went to bets and laid the shoe down at her feet then he stood looking up at her as if he was telling her something wagging his tail hard bets picked up the shoe she turned it over look said bets the real proper shoe at last the one that made the footprints the others nearly fell off the fence in their excitement bets was perfectly right it was the shoe buster followed the footprints and knew their smell and when he smelt the shoes hidden over there he knew the smell again and thats why he brought them to me cried bets we had followed the prints together you see oh and now i know why he kept on and on sniffing round mr hicks shoes when i went to see him he could smell the same smell clever dog said fatty patting buster wheres the other shoe old fellow find it find it buster rushed off to a bush not far away and began to scrape violently beneath it soon he unearthed the other shoe and laid it at fattys feet the children picked it up well said fatty this is very queer i suppose old hiccup got the wind up after bets had told him she had followed the footprints and went out and buried the shoes in case the police should find them in his house or spot him wearing them and good old buster smelt them out clever good marvellous dog big bone for you tomorrow buster a great big bone and now whatever are we going to do about everything said larry going back to the path its no good telling the police were in disgrace and wouldnt be listened to its no good telling our parents were in enough trouble as it is lets go and sit down by the river and talk about it said pip come on well simply have to decide something things are getting very serious an unexpected friend the children made their way along the path that led to the river they found a sheltered place on the high bank of the river and sat down buster growled a little but sat down with them what are you growling for buster said bets dont you want to sit down buster growled again and then stopped the children began to talk its a queer thing said pip weve found the man who started the fire and weve got all the facts we know how he got on to the london train we know that his shoes fit the footprints we know that he was afraid and hid those shoes which weve found and we know why all the other suspects were down in the garden that evening we know everything and yet we cant do anything about it because mr goon would be sure to pretend that he found out everything yes its no good telling the police said fatty gloomily and its no good telling our parents either because they would just ring up mr goon isnt it perfectly sickening to think that weve solved the mystery and found out simply everything and we cant get the criminal punished horrid mr hick he ought to be punished dont you think it was mean the way he tried to lay the blame on poor old peeks when he thought we were getting to know too much yes agreed every one it was funny the way he gave hihiself away by mentioning those aeroplanes said lany it was really smart of fatty to spot that i think it certainly was said daisy warmly and the others nodded fatty swelled up at once well as ive told you be fore he said i really have got brains now at school shut up fatty said every one together and fatty subsided and shut up still feeling pleased however that the others admired him for spotting such a curious clue they all went on talking about the burnt cottage and the suspects and clues for a little while longer and then buster growled so fiercely and so long that every one was surprised and puzzled what is the matter with buster said bets has he got a tummyache or something do you think she had hardly finished saying these words when a large round face appeared above the rim of the high river bank it was a kindly face set with big intelligent eyes that had a real twinkle in them oh said every one startled pardon me said the face im afraid ive frightened you but you see i was sitting down here below the bank in my favourite corner fishing naturally i kept quiet because i didnt want to disturb the fish i couldnt help hearing what you were talking about it was most interesting most interesting if youll pardon my saying so buster barked so loudly that the children could hardly hear what the hidden person was saying he climbed up on to the bank beside them and they saw that he was a very big fellow burly and strong dressed in a tweed suit and enormous brown shoes the man sat down beside them and took out a bar of chocolate which he broke into bits and offered the children they couldnt help liking him did you hear everything we said asked bets it was really all a secret you know were the findouters the fine doubters said the man puzzled what do you doubt then every one giggled no the findddddouters said daisy sounding the letter d loudly at the end of find we find out things ah i see said the big man lighting a pipe buster was now quite friendly towards him and licked his hand the big man patted him what are you asked bets i havent seen you before well if you dont mind my saying so im a bit of a findouter myself said the man i have to solve mysteries too most interesting it is im sure you agree with me oh yes said every one i gather that you are in a spot of bother at the moment said the man puffing at his pipe you have solved your mystery but you cant make your discoveries known is that right yes said larry you see mr goon the policeman here doesnt like us and has complained to our parents about some things we did well i dare say some of them were pretty awful really but we did them in a good cause i mean we wanted to find out who burnt down mr hicks cottage and now that you have found out you have got to keep quiet about it said the man puffing away most annoying for you tell me more about it as i say im a bit of a findouter too in my way so i enjoy talking over a mystery as man to man if you see what i mean the children looked at the big burly fellow on the bank his keen eyes twinkled at them and his big hand patted buster larry looked round at the others i think we might as well tell him everything dont you said larry they nodded they all trusted the big fisherman and somehow knew that their secrets were safe with him so larry interrupted sometimes by daisy fatty and pip told the whole story of the findouters and what they had discovered the big man listened keenly sometimes putting in a question nodding his head every now and again smart boy you he said to fatty when larry came to the bit about how mr hick had given hihiself away by saying that he had seen the seven tempests on the evening of the fire fatty went red with pleasure and bets squeezed his hand the story was finished at last the big man knocked out his pipe and looked round an extremely good piece of work if i may say so he said beaming round i congratulate the five findouters and dog and i think i can help you a bit how asked larry well we must get hold of that tramp again said the big man from what you say he said to you he probably saw mr hick in the garden too hiding in the ditch and that would be valuable evidence and er certainly the police ought to know about all this oh said every one in dismay thinking of clearorf and how he would say that he hihiself had found out everything and we could never never find that tramp again said larry he may be miles and miles away ill find him for you all right promised the big man and old clearorf thats mr goon you know wont listen to a word we say im sure said fatty gloomily ill see that he does said the astonishing man getting up leave it to me call at your police station tomorrow at ten oclock will you ill be there and well finish up everything nicely he picked up his rod and put it over his shoulder a most interesting talk he said valuable to both of us as i hope you will agree he strode off in the evening twilight and the children watched him go ten oclock tomorrow at the police station said fatty feeling rather uncomfortable whatevers going to happen there and how is that man going to find the tramp nobody knew larry looked at his watch gave a yell and leapt to his feet i say its awfully late we shall get into a row come along quickly they hurried home with buster at their heels goodbye they called to one another ten oclock tomorrow at the police station dont be late the end of the mystery the next morning the five findouters and their dog arrived punctually at the police station with them they brought their clues as the big man had requested there was fattys drawing of the footprints the bit of grey cloth in the matchbox and the rubbersoled shoes that had been scraped up by buster you know the only clue that wasnt any use was the bit of grey flannel said larry opening the box we never found out whose coat it belonged to did we and yet it must belong to some one who went through that gap perhaps mr hick wore a grey suit that night if so he hasnt worn it since because hes always had on dark blue whenever weve seen him they went into the police station feeling a little awed mr goon was there without his helmet and also another policeman the children didnt know they stared at mr goon expecting him to rise up and say clearorfl but he didnt he told them to sit down in such polite tones that the children were overcome with astonishment they sat down buster went to inspect the policemans legs and clearorf didnt even kick out at him we were to meet some one here said fatty clearorf nodded hell be along in a minute he said as he spoke a small policecar drove up and the children looked round expecting to see their friend the big man but he wasnt in the car to their surprise there was some one else in it that they knew it was the old tramp he was muttering to hihiself and looking rather scared im an honest old fellow i am and nobody never said i wasnt ill tell anything i know course i will but i wont do nothing to get meself into trouble that i wont ive not done nothing wrong there was a plainclothes policeman in the car with him besides the driver bets was surprised when larry told her that the man in the dark grey suit was a policeman i thought they never never wore anything but their uniforhis she said then another car drove up driven by an extremely smartlooking man in blue uniform he wore a peaked cap and the other policemen saluted him smartly when he heaved hihiself out of the car the car was big but the man was big too the children gazed at him and bets gave a squeal its the fisherman its the man we saw yesterday hallo hallo there said the big man smiling weve found the tramp inspector said the plainclothes policeman to the big man the children looked at one another so their friend was an inspector of police golly an inspector is a very very highup policeman whispered pip to bets hes terribly clever look at old clearorf hes trembling like a jelly clearorf was not really trembling but it was plain that he was quite overcome by the visit of the inspector to his small police station his hands shook as he turned over the pages of his notebook the inspector beamed at the children nice to see you again if i may say so he said he spoke to clearorf making mr goon jump you are lucky to have five such smart children in your district goon he said clearorf opened and shut his mouth but said nothing he didnt want smart children in his district especially any that were smarter than he was but he couldnt very well say so to his inspector then the tramp was brought before the inspector and questioned he answered willingly enough once he had been assured that he would only do hihiself good not harm by answering truthfully the children listened intently tell us all the people you saw in mr hicks garden that night said the inspector well said the tramp there was meself hiding under a bush near the workroom not doing no harm to nobody just taking a rest like quite said the inspector then i saw that fellow who got the sack that moming said the tramp peeks his name was he was hiding in the bushes along with some one else i couldnt see but by the voice i reckoned it was a girl well i see him going into the house and out again through a window ah said the inspector then i see an old fellow said the tramp i heard him having a quarrel with mr hick that day name of smellie wasnt it yes well he came walking down the drive quietlike and he slipped into the house by a door just before peeks came out again go on said the inspector did you see any one else yes i did said the tramp i see mr hick hihiself every one listened breathlessly i was lying under that there bush said the tramp thinking that there was a lot of people in the garden that evening when i heard some one squeezing through the gap in the hedge not far from me i looked through the sprays of the bush and i saw it was mr hick hihiself he stood there in that ditch for a long time and then he went to a big clump of blackberries and fished up a tin out of the middle where it was hidden fatty gave a little whistle it was extraordinary to hear the tramp relating the whole story that they had so carefully pieced together that tin must have contained petrol then mr hick went to the little cottage nearby stayed there a while came out and locked the door and hid in the ditch again said the tramp i lay under my bush as still as a mouse after a time when it was really dark i heard mr hick getting out of the ditch and going down the lane towards the railway then i saw a light in the cottage and i guessed it was on fire and i went off mighty quick i didnt want to be found there and accused of firing it thank you said the inspector was there any one else at all that you saw not a soul said the tramp a very pretty plot said the inspector mr hick wants money he manages to pick a quarrel with a good many people that day so that if by chance the insurance company suspect foul play there are many people who have reason to fire his cottage out of spite he gets his chauffeur to take him to the station in the afternoon to catch the train to town he must have got out at the next station and walked back over the fields to his garden where he hid until he fired the cottage then he walked back to the railway waited at the place where the london train always halts for a minute and gets into an empty carriage unseen in the darkness he arrives at peterswood station is met by his chauffeur and driven home to be told that his workroom is on fire very pretty indeed and now i think we must ask mr hick a few questions said the plainclothes man that is so agreed the inspector he turned to the children we will let you know what happens he said and if i may say so i am very proud to have met the five findouters and dog i trust that we shall work together on other mysteries in the future i should be extremely grateful for your help and i am sure mr goon feels the same as i do mr goon didnt at all but he could do nothing but nod and try to smile he was angry to think that the five pests had actually solved the mystery before he had and that the inspector was praising them goodday goon said the inspector pleasantly walking out to his car goodday inspector jenks said poor clearorf can i give you children a lift inquired the inspector am i going your way he was for he was going to mr hick with the plainclothes man the children piled into the big car bursting with importance and hoping that every one in the village would see them riding with their friend the great inspector i suppose you couldnt possibly put in a word for us with our parents could you asked pip you see mr goon complained so bitterly of us if you spoke well of us it would be a great help it would be a pleasure beamed the inspector starting up his powerful car ill call in after ive interviewed mr hick he kept his word he called on pips mother later in the day and very much impressed her with his admiration for the findouters they are very smart children he said i am sure you will agree with me i am proud to know them the children crowded round him eagerly what about mr hick what did he say i questioned him closely and let him know that we knew everything and had got his shoes too said the inspector he denied it at first but when asked to explain how it was that he heard those aeroplanes coming over here at the time when he vowed he was in london he broke down and confessed everything so i am afraid mr hick will have to leave his comfortable house and spend some considerable time with the police he is even now on his way and poor mrs minns is in a most excited state i expect lily will be glad that horace isnt suspected any more said daisy and wed better go and tell mr smellie all about it too so that he will forgive us for getting into his house and taking his shoe will mr goon give him back his shoe inspector jenks it has already been done said the big man well i must be going i hope i shall see you again some day you did very well indeed with your dues and your list of suspects there was only one clue that wasnt any good said larry pulling out his matchbox with the bit of grey flannel in we never found any suspect with a grey flannel coat and a tiny bit torn out of it well if you dont mind my saying so i have an idea that i can explain that clue said the big inspector looking wise oh do tell us said bets the inspector pulled larry to him swung him round and showed the others a tiny tear in his grey flannel jacket just by the armpit at the back thats where your bit of grey cloth came from he said with a deep chuckle you all got through that gap in the hedge when you went to find footprints didnt you and larry must have caught hihiself a bit on a prickle and the boy behind him spotted the bit of grey rag on the twig and thought it was a clue good thing you didnt see that larrys coat was torn or you might have written him down as a suspect too the children laughed however was it that nobody noticed larrys coat was a bit torn said bets astonished well to think of all the things we found out and we didnt find that out goodbye said the inspector getting into his car thanks for your help its a very satisfactory ending as im sure you will agree with me rather said every one goodbye it was a bit of luck meeting you the car roared off up the lane the children turned back into the garden what an exciting week weve had said daisy i suppose now the findouters must come to an end because weve solved the mystery no said fatty well still be the five findouters and dog because you simply never know when another mystery will come along for us to solve well just wait till it comes they are waiting and one will come theres no doubt about that but of course that will be quite another story
