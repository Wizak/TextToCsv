 not enough hours in the day edgar million the daughters we dress to be princesses become tired mothers and wives maggie gee the burning book not enough hours in the day catherine cast her eye down the bulleted list on her iphone as she squeezed onto the crowded commuter train picked out a few emails she needed to send during the journey then wedged herself into a corner to do so her numerous to do lists could have stretched the length of britain but catherine porter did her best to keep on top of things she didnt always succeed but she tried when she was first prompted by one of her colleagues to start writing these dutiful lists of daily weekly and lifetime goals shed found them a helpful method to oversee the business of running the house the family whilst still fitting in a full forty hour working week and commute lately though the list had become a dark tome a shameful reminder of her inadequacies on almost every level it wasnt a to do list these days it was a charge sheet a breakdown of everything shed failed to complete work family social failing slowly drowning as she sat at her desk she felt disheveled somehow so she popped to the bathroom to try and fix this situation with a little lipstick and hair spray but it was a plaster on a gunshot wound she needed time to fix this and being time poor was a poverty she was all too familiar with you ready catherine a male voice called and looked up to see her manager jeremiah watching her with a quizzical expression what for she asked startled out of her reverie catherine thought jeremiah seemed to sigh supervision cath weve got one booked in he said grab your notebook and lets find a room an hour later chastened and guilty shed agreed to put some extra time in at home to try and clear her backlog and added some more items to her current to do list catherine listened to the house creaking and the central heating pipes groaning and clanking grinding to a halt for the day it was gone ten now kids bathed washed readto and almost asleep almost at peace the streetlights would soon start clicking off for the night and she was packing the dishwasher when she felt a fresh panic rise cold certain terror filling her guts about the bad thing shed forgotten shed missed the deadline for little kellys primary school application she knew she had oh god no shed been so busy but no after a frantic burst of email exploration she found there was a week left and exhaled deeply and set about finishing her days work you alright love ray called from the other room answering his own work emails on his ipad whilst watching new tricks on iplayer i thought wed missed the deadline on the school application but were okay she said would you nudge me tomorrow i need to finish it off sure he said with a grunt so long as i remember hubby was in bed by the time she packed her rewritten logs and laptop back into the pink work folder which lived in her large brown hessian shopping bag then poured herself a final glass of wine in an effort to wind down just a little she needed to go to bed but slumped in her chair too exhausted to move lacking the strength to even lift the wine glass to her lips she sat for a while drifting in and out of sleep listening to rays snores rattle the house before crawling up the cream carpeted stairs to lie awake next to her comatose partner when did they last have sex she pondered was sex just for holidays these days or the drunken conclusion to rare late nights out in guilford that was how it seemed on the odd night when they could forget the marital role they now inhabited as business partners negotiators constantly clarifying their roles and responsibilities for the coming week month year making sure they both did their share just to get by they were both so tired all the time she barely remembered her own name some days let alone instigate anything so tiring as lovemaking the darkness listened to her thoughts about her life and about the day to come remembering a girl whod once been on the edge of ruling the world beautiful clever funny a girl who could have been anything where did all that go the night asked catherine porter had no answer for the night the week had fled away from them as it always did friday at last she thought waking to the sound of children bickering about bathroom access the weekend the glorious if temporary relief from work at least how do people who work weekends cope she wondered then how do i cope even with my weekends still the weekend was nearly upon them in theory saturday and sunday provided much needed rest however since the house currently looked like the inside pocket of a homeless man she knew much of the weekend would be spent tidying up and trying to restore order to things shed watched a programme the other night about people who had children at risk of being taken into care in each home the social workers visited they drew attention to the general mess and untidiness in the house then told the parents who were all alcoholics drug users or some such that if they didnt tidy up and sort this all out the kids were at risk of being taken away catherine was very grateful social workers tended to restrict their judgements on tidiness to the homes of poor people because by the average saturday morning her house resembled one of these hovels a trail of chores not yet completed dishwasher doubling as a plate cupboard and dirty plates without a dishwasher to go into laying in desperate wont of attention upon the sticky sideboard next to a bag of rubbish which couldnt fit into the overflowing unemptied bin she hated it it stung her each time she saw it but something had to give still by sunday night after much tidying and arguing with partner and sprogs she knew it would look a little better not tidy by her late mothers standards but she wouldnt feel the need to try to hide her living room with her body from visitors knocking at her front door and social services would probably have given her the allclear at least until the end of the week loomed again still saturday tomorrow saturday morning should provide some solace saturday morning had gone badly shed found it all so hard lately mum used to help before but since shed gone or passed or whatever euphemism was fashionable these days there had been no respite midmorning she heard screaming then realised it was her issuing the frantic wail too tired to desperate to deal with it all catherine found herself locked in the downstairs bathroom weeping into a stained white or once white school tshirt clutching a box of jewellery mum had left her ray was knocking at the door you alright love he called then somewhere in the background she could hear the boy ray jnr sounding tearful and apologetic mum he cried im sorry so sorry mum you alright love ray snr repeated his voice muffled by the door she wanted to say yes after all it wasnt his fault this was so hard he did his share but she just let off another rocket launcher sob and told him to leave her alone she stared at the box then flipped open the lid there were a bunch of mums rings and necklaces inside the chains of the necklaces all entwined in a knotty twisted mess half an hour later shed been packed off into town with instructions to chill out for a bit her rare chill out afternoons normally consisted of mooching around secondhand shops and fashion boutiques she couldnt afford looking for knickknacks and bargains followed by a coffee and cake in a costa or a starbucks she watched the street go by through the steam of her hot coffee gangs of girls and boys milled about in the square outside primark and she half imagined a david attenboroughstyle commentary about the mating patterns of the english lower middle and working classes when she remembered shed packed the ball of necklaces in her bag to be untangled something useful to do with her time to assuage the slight guilt at escaping for a couple of hours mum had some nice necklaces she thought examining the pile not expensive but beautiful all the same mums favourite was also bound into the mess and catherine wondered for a moment how she could have let it get like that all caught up but then she recalled the way her mum had so quickly descended into baffled confusion at the end one day sane and straight the next it seemed that quick shed been a babbling mess who barely recognised her nothing had made much sense to her back then no real surprise she suppose so she began picking away and detangling until one by one she freed them all and had six necklaces laid out in neat military lines next to her bucket of coffee and her kindle she picked up her mums favourite again and examined it you always wore this one she said out loud to the necklace then held it close and caught a hint of her mothers favourite perfume and was suddenly transported for a moment a small girl again sitting on her mothers lap toying with the shiny metal trinket which nestled in her mothers cleavage she held it up to the light and looked at it afresh noting the resemblance to an acorn or a seed then enclosed it in her palm the pendant seemed to emit a warm buzz she never noticed almost as though there was a swarm of wasps within a ridiculous thought but although the buzz subsided to a quiet hum as she opened her hand she found it hard to shake the sense the object was alive she eyed the item more closely than in thirty years mums favourite necklace now hers she examined it closely it appeared to be made of brass with rigid bands of a white metal wrapped around it maybe silver or steel not platinum surely although it felt precious in her hand slivers of an unidentified gemstone possibly garnet decorating the surface this excavation of her mothers jewellery might make the rest of the weekend bearable so she popped it on and admired her reflection in the plate glass windows of the coffee shop it suited her cheered somewhat she propped her kindle up against her mug in the gloomy coffee house and scanned through the many book titles she had recently bought but which sat unread and unloved within the device like thoughts not yet borne she managed about three pages of the new bridget jones which she decides isnt as good as the first two before her attention is drawn back to the necklace which she removed again from her neck to scrutinise turning it over in her palm watching it sparkle and glint now she sees there are symbols in the design which shed never noticed a faint sun and moon and what appears to be a snowflake not only that she realised the pendant contained a mechanism which could be twisted to align different sections gingerly catherine twisted the locket away from the sun and onto the moon and experienced a swell of anticipation the thought that something big was going to take place something momentous nothing happened the moment passed she wondered for a moment why shed thought anything would but shed just had this strange sense silly me she thought she draped the necklace back around her neck and returned to her coffee then starts or begin to start a different book the new donna tartt drifting off into it before checking her watch and realising the time bugger she exclaimed startling an elderly diner remembering shed promised to bring in a curry for dinner on her way home as she hustles along the high street the world feels surprisingly still for a saturday the street is rammed yet slow and ponderous unhurried and she pauses to enjoy the relaxed movement of the people and traffic in the curryhouse she orders their usual then sits by the counter reading her book whilst the food is prepared becoming increasingly engaged with a narrative for the first time in ages when she glanced at her watch and notices shes been waiting for over half an hour for the food when she questions the delay the server gives her a curious look then answers in a slow almost patronising voice that her food is not quite ready yet and would she like a complimentary cobra beer whilst she waits this day gets better and better she thinks sipping her beer then returning to her book its almost an hour more before her food finally arrives and shes well over halfway into the book now when she pops the ereader back into her oversized bag and makes her way back to and turns the corner onto broughton road theres a lightness rising in her as she approaches home holding a carrier bag full of spicy and nonspicy curries peshwari naans and the free bag of poppadums ray smiled as he pulled open the door youre early he said speaking slowly done a ton of washing tidying cleaning and sorting even the boy helped a bit didnt think wed be stopping for dinner yet though its nearly oclock she told him tapping her watch reckon your watch has had it he said pointing to the kitchen clock and speaking agonisingly slowly now its only just gone halffive love ill set the table though she stared at him bewildered but then looked up and saw that the sky which would have been pitch black at eight was clear and blue she gawked at it dumbfounded did you have a nice afternoon he asked ignoring her silence and she told him she had and showed him her mums locket taking it off and demonstrating the way the intertwining parts twisted and turned thats nice he said not really looking as he cleared a pile of coats from the table and wiped an unidentified stain before saying sorry show me later ill look then she deposited the necklace on the side in the kitchen and helped him serve up the curry then moved on to strictly then casualty and falling asleep to match of the day a pleasant end to a pleasant day in the morning then the first thing she does it to look for the pendant but it was no longer where she left it but after a short search she finds it clenched in the fist of her sleeping daughter and gently prises it from her grasp and popped it back on before making herself breakfast tea and toast lightly browned heavily buttered and plastered with marmalade ray had done a ton of tidying yesterday she thought looking around the room he was a good fella always pitched in not like her old dad whod never lifted a hand to tidy in his life but still there was tons and tons more left to do washing ironing mopping and wiping neverending drudgery every sunday was the same you spent all day getting straight for the week ahead but never truly did and before you knew it you were into the week exhausted from the outset racing from here to there school runs clubs kids parties the grind of work and somewhere in between trying to keep it all straight until the inevitable collapse into chaos again by thursday or friday ray kept on at her to employ a cleaner they could afford it now they were both working he told her but she couldnt stand the idea of someone she didnt know or worse even someone they did know tidying their mess doing her job the thought of it somehow diminished her which was mad on so many levels since both her mum and nan had been cleaners at different stages in her childhood but she supposed their excessive cleanliness was the point naturally enough she measured herself against them and despite the fact she was a success on her own terms she shrunk in their disinfected shadows however shed made good progress today listening to some american podcasts on her phone and found to her surprise shed ironed and put all the laundry away by eleven without disturbance it was then she noticed her watch was out again damn it she thought as she stared at the alarm clock am according to the blank red glow shed only been up half an hour yet shed ironed and put away a weeks clothes since breakfast that just couldnt be right ray she called loudly and he appeared holding a puce cereal bowl and a blank expression whhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaatttttt he moved and spoke slowly and had a curious look in his eyes as though he were struggling to understand her she peered past him to the kids watching telly on the sofa statues kids she called they ignored her as was the wont with kids until at least the third try but even when she raised her voice and threatened to turn the set off their reactions were sluggish and slow time crept through the room with the haste and vigour of a sundial she had an idea stupid really she thought but unshakeable she held the locket aloft between her finger and thumb resetting the dials to what appeared to be their defaults there was a sudden rush of noise and activity in the room everything had been on mute until now it seemed ray asking if she were okay saying she seemed a bit hyper today and all of a sudden ray jr and kelly were fighting because her legs had been encroaching too far into the space which he clearly felt was his due experimentally she twisted the dial on the locket back again and the mute button or more accurately the pause was again pressed and once again ray and the kids seemed to be in slowmo she stared at them then at the locket and smiled as she understood the extra time which her mother had somehow bequeathed her part of her wanted to take the locket apart to see how it worked but she knew the temptation would be likely to leave her minus this wonderful new power oooh she thought ive got a super power i can slow time her trembling fingers fiddled with the dial again pushing it round as far as it would go and gazed at the as the world immobilised kids midfight i can freeze time ignoring the ridiculousness of this and lacking either scientific understanding or occultist belief she decided it wasnt helpful to question her amazing luck in the discovery of the locket and she sat next to the statue of fighting children to ponder her situation she felt so tired life was so nonstop even holidays were a chore this would change everything after a cup of filter coffee and a short nap she went back to stare at her silent still family peaceful as in sleep the shopping still needed to be done she thought and leaving time frozen she decided to pop to sainsburys to do the weekly shop pouring another coffee from the jug and writing her list out with the fountain pen she normally reserved for special occasions and letters to dad undecided yet whether she would pay for her shopping today she made her way out to the car and climbed in still wearing her pyjamas steering the car in and out of traffic which it seemed would be static until she decided it shouldnt be this was the most spontaneous thing she had done in eight years yet all she was doing was going shopping or shoplifting probably since although did have her purse she didnt fancy paying for her purchases whilst in her pjs she weaved in between shoppers still as piles of baked bean tins and picked up the usuals for the weekly shop packing it all into a trolley also stacked high with luxuries it felt like walking through a waxworks museum but without the eerie feeling the exhibits were going to murder you she even passed some of the mums from the school even perfect cassandra the superduper yummy mummy supreme perched as ever upon ridiculous inch heels a louis vuitton bag slung casually over her shoulder catherine stood and stared at her cassandra who somehow put all other mothers to shame and continually went on about bloody feminism and womans hour in the playground and how you could have it all if only you put the hours in perfect bloody cassandra so so easy for her annoying cow thought catherine enviously as she passed her making her way to the drinks aisle planning to pick up a case of beers for hubby and wine for herself no charge today shed decided stopping for a moment to gaze back at cassandras perfect physique almost as if shed never given birth to a single baby let alone mind three her body probably looked better now than at eighteen in the past she had tried to comfort herself with the thought that thin women like cassandra always seemed to age badly as they headed towards the change but this rose showed no signs of wilting she picked out a couple of bottles of really expensive red and white wines well beyond what shed normally pay and a very old bottle of whiskey for ray then finally the most expensive bottle of champagne she could find which she perched on top to the trolley making her way to the tills so she could lean over the girl on the counter and remove the security tags the girls cash drawer hung wide open and she looked down at all the notes and coins just sitting there as available to her as the food she was in the process of stealing but then she thought of the poor girl who would have to explain the impossible absence of the cash so she went on her way back to the car stopping only to deposit the expensive bottle of champagne in the bottom of cassandras bag underneath a copy of the idiot which she had purchased hopefully yesterday in the oxfam shop shed removed the security tag from it though didnt want her arrested it was her ridiculously confident state of mind she was looking to mess with a little not her legal status and she chuckled as she thought of dear cassie wondering if she had succumbed unknowingly to kleptomania back at home she decanted the shopping into the fridge had a peaceful lunch then checked her watch to discover it was nearly dinnertime by her timezone and she prepared herself a premium lasagne before checking the wash which she had pushed into the machine whilst making her toast earlier it hadnt finished yet this was obvious now she thought about it and she touched the machine tentatively wondering how she could manage the laundry with this new superpower as she touched the machine it buzzed into life freezing again as she removed her hand she went into the other room grabbed her kindle and sat up on top of the washing machine which again sparked into life as she read another hundred pages of the goldfinch in the space of three washes and a bottle of wine she found shed finished that book and started another but now she really did feel rather tired again the house was tidier than it had been in well forever and it was still only quarter past nine the kids clothes sat ironed and ready for the week and their lunch normally made in a rush in the morning before school lay in healthy repose in brand new tupperware lunch containers in the fridge ready for the morning with bottles of freshly juiced orange standing beside them she was ready for the week yet she still had the day ahead of her by their time her day had already been spent it was nearly bedtime and to restart the clock now would be exhausting so she decided to take a night to herself although it was of course still daytime she drew the heavy curtains in their room put on a movie on the ipad before sleeping until am cpt catherine porter time of the next morning at which point she realigned with ray and the kids and reset the dials and settled down for the perfect sunday roast dinner in the oven a walk in the park then back home to finish dinner and a movie with the kids before a bedtime story and sleep catherine was aglow thrilled by the day shed created for herself as she dropped back into normal life she noticed ray was still looking at her strangely seriously love you seem really hyper oh i am she said i am days passed months passed occasionally she wondered how the locket worked but not too much and some days she considered doing something really big and dramatic with it like robbing a bank but something about the idea seemed too substantial too real besides part of her worried she would draw attention to her little secret and get caught for some reason her new weekly shoplift never pressed the same guiltyconscience button in her psyche so she was happy to carry on as a bonus it left them with extra cash to pay for extra things for the kids school trips and the like which they may have had to refuse otherwise the other weakness she developed was an inability not to put something expensive into cassandras bag whenever she saw her and she noticed that over time the ohsocertain yummy mummy became considerably less so developing a hunted hawkish expression not quite so smug and considerably less certain of the ability to have it all presumably to keep finding it all in her handbag was chastening and over the years cassandra would find bottles of vodka posh chocolates expensive wine sausages perfume nappies deodorants and perfumes numerous sex aids and once in a while a bonsai tree or two once she borrowed cassies car keys and filled her boot with bananas it was strange she thought cassandra had stopped believing you could have it all at around the same point catherine had discovered she herself could thanks to her new double life it was now possible never to be late picking up the kids always ensure healthy and nutritious packed lunches were made and even if the kids forgot to take them she had time to pop them up to the school the days were a bit long sometimes but this was okay because whenever she got really exhausted she would just take a day out or have a really long sleep the power to freeze time was frightening some days and there was one day when she was called to the hospital to say goodbye to dad suddenly struck down by illness when she froze time for a whole month just staring at him too petrified to let him go be no more he was still alive briefly in his frozen state but she knew it wasnt enough and eventually had to relent to allow the tide to wash him away years passed sometimes her rhythms became a bit out of sync with the family and often she was accused of being a bit forgetful conversationally not remembering discussions from in their minds ten minutes previous but she decided she could live with this because on almost every other level she had become supermum able to do all achieve anything if ray noticed the change in her or was suspicious he never commented he regularly noted she seemed a bit hyper these days but on the whole just appeared pleased he didnt have to spend his weekends tidying up she even encouraged him to buy a season ticket for the footie so every other week he was off watching his team lose draw or scrape a win and despite the regular complaints about their uselessness he seemed happier for the experience she toyed with the idea of telling him or someone about the locket but something in the experience made her think that sharing the secret would somehow break the spell and damage whatever magic made the mechanism work so on she went with her lovely secret life in time the little kids grew into big kids and she surveyed them with pride as they became moreorless the sort of grownup people shed hoped for welleducated well balanced individuals with nice partners and decent lives leaving her and ray alone in a house which no longer needed quite so much tidying which was good because her hands ached these days feeling the beginning pangs of the arthritis which had plagued both her mother and grandmother in their later years ray and the doctors said it was very unusual in someone so young as was the fact she had experienced the change so early in her life but she knew the reason why by her reckoning she was roughly fiftynine now although she may have been a little older or younger she was a good fifteen years or so older than ray but in many respects her aging more quickly appeared to have made him age too becoming more fastidious than she remembered him more set in his ways and resistant to change off each week now to the football even away games and although she suggested occasionally that it might be nice for them to spend some time away together he always frowned and looked unhappy at the suggestion come on love he said after all these years were finally on a good run let me enjoy it so she let it go and suffered the lengthy absences until one day an absence lasted forever she discovered hed been having an onoff affair with one of the girls in the office for years and without excuse or a goodbye hed scarpered and she was being forced to sell the house so he could have half last she heard he was starting again early fifties and now with a new kid on the way this rankled but honestly shed spent so much time on her own over the years it hurt less than it might shed recently been retired from work on health grounds and met a nice fella a widow at the cinema previously shed been going on her own quite regularly and had kept meeting him also alone going in and out of the same films lately they started going together these days she rarely used the locket only if she were running really late or making a big family roast and mostly it sat locked in a pine chest of drawers in her bedroom hours in the day had long ceased to be something she had too few of more often her days stretched out empty and long until one day she sat opposite a gp who told her the stomach pains shed been experiencing lately were in fact latestage pancreatic cancer even with chemo she had a prognosis of around three months suddenly her days seemed very short she refused the chemo which shed been told would only have slowed the disease not have halted it and she spent as much time as she could with her kids and her grandkids hugs galore and never a frozen moment in the last days the pain grew unbearable the tablets theyd given her no longer masked the pain she stared at the locket and knew it was time after leaving notes of explanation to her daughter her son and her new man on her mantelpiece she took the short walk to the train station freezing time on arrival and walking towards romford along the tracks until she found what she needed a train in full flight she took her position on the righthand side of the train out of the line of sight of the driver and looked up at the beast stood like the unknown protester who stared up at the tank in tiananmen square certain of her fate surprised at the height of it and how the train towered over her the locket felt warm to the touch as she felt for the dials and restarted her day in this last moment she held a vision in her head of her daughter and her two grandchildren two little girls her son smart in a new suit and red silk tie on his way to his new job and she smiled as she passed from the world catherines daughter kelly sat at the end of mums bed midtwenties and looking harried and tired sorting through piles of clothes to go to the charity shop her brother putting things into thick edged cardboard boxes the sound of fighting children muffled by the floorboards and the thick red carpet they had to get the house cleared by tomorrow as work needed her back in the office if they were going to hold the job open for her she felt so tired it all seemed so hard hey said her brother holding the small plastic evidence bag returned by the police have you seen this he was holding up the locket mum always used to wear that when we were kids she was always fiddling with the damn thing she said smiling distant times visible in her eyes then she looked at her brother can i have it well im not going to wear it am i he said pulling a face slipping it over her neck she experienced the same buzz which her mother had experienced all those years ago and studied the dials more closely than when it had adorned mums neck i wonder she thought what would happen if i twist this dial over to here note on this version writing as they say is rewriting and the joy and curse of epublishing is that as i learn more about the craft of telling a story shownottell i can apply it to tales ive already published also something had bothered me for a while about the original premise for the story the finding of the pendant in a charity shop a little too abitary when in my mind the the gift or curse which she recieves was so obviously something to be passed from mother to daughter so there was something of a change there i hope if you ever read the original you enjoy and agree its an improvement thanks thanks for taking the time to read my story and i hope youll forgive the odd typo or grammatical error that slips through feel free to tell me about any you find via edgarmillion as much as i try to proofread everything i know i miss errors here and there and ill remove them if you tell me if you follow me at edgarmillion youll get announcements of any upcoming stories or other news along with occasional complaints about football finally if you liked this story id love a review if you have a mo
