to rachels cafe for coffee she knew them all well now one black coffee she said two with only milk and two with sugar too she gave them their coffees then she asked whats happening what are you finding our equipment shows that every day there are between twentyfive and seventyfive earthquakes nancy said what cried rachel harry laughed its ok he said nothing dangerous is happening there are always small earthquakes we can see them with our equipment but theyre not dangerous the next day terry and harry took the robot to the peak and sent it inside the old volcano the robots eyes sent pictures back to their equipment and back to the equipment in the hotel too the robot walked on suddenly it stopped oh no said terry he started to go after it be careful harry said terry climbed down into the old volcano he put his feet down carefully on the ground good it was hard he walked on back at the hotel everybody watched the robots pictures they didnt look at their other equipment terry found the robot and kicked it the robot started moving again ok terry come back now harry said on his radio terry didnt listen he followed the robot down inside the mountain back in the hotel nancy stood up she turned round oh no she said look at this equipment the others turned round a strong earthquake is happening she said paul called harry on the radio come back now he said what did you say asked harry i couldnt hear you i said come back now paul said earthquake but it was too late ten metres above terry a large rock broke away and fell on terry and the robot harry screamed into his radio terry terry but no answer came the rocks broke two of the robots eyes back in the hotel they couldnt see very well paul said harry whats happening get that helicopter up here now harry said he started to climb down into the volcano some more rocks fell near him there were rocks all round but where was terry then he saw the colours of terrys shirt he pulled some rocks away terry looked up at him and smiled theres something wrong with my leg he said harry looked the rocks broke terrys leg he said into the radio tell the helicopter man hutcherson to bring some help before long harry could hear the helicopter he spoke to hutcherson on the radio nearer nearer he called but now there was smoke coming out of the old volcano hutcherson was afraid im not coming any nearer than that he said you must harry said only fifteen more metres down down slowly the helicopter came nearer it pulled terry and harry inside and flew off down the mountain chapter eight the helicopter came down near the town look terry said to harry a lot of people are waiting for us were famous harry smiled but said nothing doctors took terry to hospital rachel pushed through the people and came up to harry are you

things in some bags ruth wanted to take everything this is my home she said all my things are here rachel wanted to cry lets go leave all that lets go up on the mountain above ruths house a river of red lava began to flow down the mountain fire suddenly caught on the trees the river of lava left everything dead behind it the lava came to ruths house it flowed round to the left and to the right it flowed round to the front of the house the cars stood there fire started to climb up the outside of the house harry looked out of the back window of the house and saw the lava then the lava broke the window and flowed into the house fire ate chairs tables everything harry and rachel pushed the children to the front door ruth followed with her bags rachel screamed look the cars red hot lava flowed under the cars lava flowed from the left and right into the lake theres only the lake harry said lets go they ran down to the lake and jumped into ruths small boat now well be ok graham said to lauren then they saw the fish hundreds of dead fish on the water harry tried to start the boats engine he couldnt do it ruth said i know this boat ill do it she started the boat and they moved out across the water they looked back at ruths house there was fire everywhere that was my home ruth said i always lived there everybody was very quiet one of the cars exploded wheres roughy the children thought this boat is slow harry said but itll get us there then he heard a different noise wheres that noise coming from he thought ah yes under the boat he looked down dont put your hands in the water he said why rachel asked the waters acid graham said the acid is eating into the boat will it get us there harry didnt answer chapter twelve soon the acid ate through into the boat acid water began to flow into the boat put your feet up out of the water harry said we only have a hundred metres to go then he heard a different noise much worse the engine is stopping he said he tried not to be afraid the acid ate into the engine there are only thirty or forty metres to go perhaps well get there the boat moved slowly on thirty metres twenty ten graham give me your coat harry said he put the coat round his hand and used his hand to move the boat in the water but the acid quickly ate through the coat and then the boat stopped only five metres to go harry said that tree is near perhaps i can get to it and pull us in he tried but he couldnt he tried again forget it harry ruth said you cant do it she looked down at the water i can stand here she said harry turned round ruth no he said but ruth started to get out of the boat harry moved to stop her but she pulled away she stood in the water and pushed the boat the acid ate at her legs rachel harry and the children jumped out of the boat on to the ground then ruth screamed she tried to walk to them but she fell on the ground dont come near she said the acid they sat and watched her die oh ruth rachel cried i love you ruth smiled up at her my son didnt know you rachel she said youre good i want you to be happy she looked at harry and closed her eyes she never spoke again rachel and the children cried the sky was thick with ash and gases harry rachel and the children walked down the mountain they were tired and wet with dirty black rain now they could see the town suddenly they heard a big noise to their right whats that asked rachel water trees rocks buildings all coming fast down the mountain harry said theyre going to hit the river the river through dantes peak in dantes peak paul dreyfus and the other scientists were at the radio harry can you hear me said paul harry we must leave now its too dangerous for us to stay sorry they put their equipment in their cars dreyfus drove the car with all the equipment and the others all went in the first car the first car got across the river dreyfus in the second car looked up the river was now much bigger than usual it was flowing fast and there were rocks and trees in it it flowed on to the road and carried his car away he only had time for one scream before he died harry found an old car luckily the engine started they got into it and began to drive small rocks hit the car large rocks hit the ground near them harry thought of marianne not again please he thought round the corner they came to a river of lava can we drive across that rachel asked i dont know harry said but we must try he drove as fast as he could at the lava a line of fire followed them across the lava suddenly lauren cried look theres roughy roughy waited for them across the lava how did she get here harry said look graham said more lava is coming up behind roughy we cant stop harry said roughy will have one try only they drove along slowly roughy ran up to the car rachel opened her door come on roughy she called jump the children screamed you can do it roughy roughy jumped rachel caught her and pulled her into the car the children threw their arms round the dog they laughed harry and rachel laughed too chapter thirteen they drove into dantes peak but it was not the same town fire and earthquakes did their worst here rachel said sadly it was a beautiful town i was happy to be the mayor they came to the river we cant get across that harry said and theres more lava coming what can we do rachel asked we must get under the ground harry said but how graham looked at him i

mountain goodbye harry said terry angrily nancy started to cry in the car harry rachel and the children heard the sounds of the explosion they were near the mine they looked up at the mountain something dark moved down the mountain very very fast hot ash and rocks harry said when it hits us were dead no mistakes now i have only one try the car engine screamed harry drove fast into the mouth of the mine behind them rocks fell thick and fast the lava couldnt get in but they couldnt get out is everybody ok asked harry when the car stopped he kicked out the front window of the car and helped the others out graham harry said can we get out of the mine no we cant graham said i know these mines we must wait but its ok my friends and i left some food and drink here come with me they followed
