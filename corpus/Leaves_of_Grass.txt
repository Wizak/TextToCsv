all so many uttering tongues and i perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing i wish i could translate the hints about the dead young men and women and the hints about old men and mothers and the offspring taken soon out of their laps what do you think has become of the young and old men and what do you think has become of the women and children they are alive and well somewhere the smallest sprout shows there is really no death and if ever there was it led forward life and does not wait at the end to arrest it and ceasd the moment life appeard all goes onward and outward nothing collapses and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier has any one supposed it lucky to be born i hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die and i know it i pass death with the dying and birth with the newwashd babe and am not containd between my hat and boots and peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good the earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth i am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and fathomless as myself they do not know how immortal but i know every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female for me those that have been boys and that love women for me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted for me the sweetheart and the old maid for me mothers and the mothers of mothers for me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears for me children and the begetters of children undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no and am around tenacious acquisitive tireless and cannot be shaken away the little one sleeps in its cradle i lift the gauze and look a long time and silently brush away flies with my hand the youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill i peeringly view them from the top the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom i witness the corpse with its dabbled hair i note where the pistol has fallen the blab of the pave tires of carts sluff of bootsoles talk of the promenaders the heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor the snowsleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snowballs the hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rousd mobs the flap of the curtaind litter a sick man inside borne to the hospital the meeting of enemies the sudden oath the blows and fall the excited crowd the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes what groans of overfed or halfstarvd who fall sunstruck or in fits what exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes what living and buried speech is always vibrating here what howls restraind by decorum arrests of criminals slights adulterous offers made acceptances rejections with convex lips i mind them or the show or resonance of them i come and i depart the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready the dried grass of the harvesttime loads the slowdrawn wagon the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged the armfuls are packd to the sagging mow i am there i help i came stretchd atop of the load i felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other i jump from the crossbeams and seize the clover and timothy and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night kindling a fire and broiling the freshkilld game falling asleep on the gatherd leaves with my dog and gun by my side the yankee clipper is under her skysails she cuts the sparkle and scud my eyes settle the land i bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck the boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopt for me i tuckd my trowserends in my boots and went and had a good time you should have been with us that day round the chowderkettle i saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west the bride was a red girl her father and his friends sat near crosslegged and dumbly smoking they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders on a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand she had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reachd to her feet the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile through the swung halfdoor of the kitchen i saw him limpsy and weak and went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him and brought water and filld a tub for his sweated body and bruisd feet and gave him a room that enterd from my own and gave him some coarse clean clothes and remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness and remember putting piasters on the galls of his neck and ankles he staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passd north i had him sit next me at table my firelock leand in the corner twentyeight young men bathe by the shore twentyeight young men and all so friendly twentyeight years of womanly life and all so lonesome she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank she hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window which of the young men does she like the best ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her where are you off to lady for i see you you splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room dancing and laughing along the beach came the twentyninth bather the rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them the beards of the young men glistend with wet it ran from their long hair little streams passd all over their bodies an unseen hand also passd over their bodies it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs the young men float on their backs their white bellies bulge to the sun they do not ask who seizes fast to them they do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch they do not think whom they souse with spray the butcherboy puts off his killingclothes or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market i loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and breakdown blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil each has his mainsledge they are all out there

overhand so sure they do not hasten each man hits in his place the negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses the block swags underneath on its tiedover chain the negro that drives the long dray of the stoneyard steady and tall he stands poisd on one leg on the stringpiece his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hipband his glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead the sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black of his polishd and perfect limbs i behold the picturesque giant and love him and i do not stop there i go with the team also in me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as forward sluing to niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing absorbing all to myself and for this song oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade what is that you express in your eyes it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life my tread scares the wooddrake and woodduck on my distant and daylong ramble they rise together they slowly circle around i believe in those wingd purposes and acknowledge red yellow white playing within me and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional and do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else and the in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me and the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night yahonk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation the pert may suppose it meaningless but i listening close find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky the sharphoofd moose of the north the cat on the housesill the chickadee the prairiedog the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats the brood of the turkeyhen and she with her halfspread wings i see in them and myself the same old law the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections they scorn the best i can do to relate them i am enamourd of growing outdoors of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls and the drivers of horses i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out what is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is me me going in for my chances spending for vast

all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms through me many long dumb voices voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves voices of the diseasd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs voices of cycles of preparation and accretion and of the threads that connect the stars and of wombs and of the fatherstuff and of the rights of them the others are down upon of the

with joy i cannot tell how my ankles bend nor whence the cause of my faintest wish nor the cause of the friendship i emit nor the cause of the friendship i take again that i walk up my stoop i pause to consider if it really be a morningglory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books to behold the daybreak the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows the air tastes good to my palate hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding scooting obliquely high and low something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs seas of bright juice suffuse heaven the earth by the sky staid with the daily close of their junction the heavd challenge from the east that moment over my head the mocking taunt see then whether you shall be master dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me if i could not now and always send sunrise out of me we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach with the twirl of my tongue i encompass worlds and volumes of worlds speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself it provokes me forever it says sarcastically walt you contain enough why dont you let it out then come now i will not be tantalized you conceive too much of articulation do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded waiting in gloom protected by frost the dirt receding before my prophetical screams i underlying causes to balance them at last my knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things happiness which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day my final merit i refuse you i refuse putting from me what i really am encompass worlds but never try to encompass me i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you writing and talk do not prove me i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic now i will do nothing but listen to accrue what i hear into this song to let sounds contribute toward it i hear bravuras of birds bustle of growing wheat gossip of flames clack of sticks cooking my meals i hear the sound i love the sound of the human voice i hear all sounds running together combined fused or following sounds of the city and sounds out of the city sounds of the day and night talkative young ones to those that like them the loud laugh of workpeople at their meals the angry base of disjointed friendship the faint tones of the sick the judge with hands tight to the desk his pallid lips pronouncing a deathsentence the heaveeyo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the refrain of the anchorlifters the ring of alarmbells the cry of fire the whirr of swiftstreaking engines and hosecarts with premonitory tinkles and colord lights the steamwhistle the solid roll of the train of approaching cars the slow march playd at the head of the association marching two and two they go to guard some corpse the flagtops are draped with black muslin i hear the violoncello tis the young mans hearts complaint i hear the keyd cornet it glides quickly in through my ears it shakes madsweet pangs through my belly and breast i hear the chorus it is a grand opera ah this indeed is music this suits me a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full i hear the traind soprano what work with hers is this the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possessd them it sails me i dab with bare feet they are lickd by the indolent waves i am cut by bitter and angry hail i lose my breath steepd amid honeyd morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death at length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles and that we call being to be in any form what is that round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither if nothing lay more developd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough mine is no callous shell i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me i merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy to touch my person to some one elses is about as much as i can stand is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity flames and ether making a rush for my veins treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip behaving licentious toward me taking no denial depriving me of my best as for a purpose unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasturefields immodestly sliding the fellowsenses away they bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me no consideration no regard for my draining strength or my anger fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me the sentries desert every other part of me they have left me helpless to a red marauder they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me i am given up by traitors i talk wildly i have lost my wits i and nobody else am the greatest traitor i went myself first to the headland my own hands carried me there you villain touch what are you doing my breath is tight in its throat unclench your floodgates you are too much for me blind loving wrestling touch sheathd hooded sharptoothd touch did it make you ache so leaving me parting trackd by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan rich showering rain and recompense richer afterward sprouts take and accumulate stand by the curb prolific and vital landscapes projected masculine fullsized and golden all truths wait in all things they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon the insignificant is as big to me as any what is less or more than a touch logic and sermons never convince the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul only what proves itself to every man and woman is so only what nobody denies is so a minute and a drop of me settle my brain i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman and a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other and they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific and until one and all shall delight us and we them i believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars and the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the egg of the wren and the treetoad is a chefdoeuvre for the highest and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery and the cow crunching with depressd head surpasses any statue and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels i find i incorporate gneiss coal longthreaded moss fruits grains esculent roots and am stuccod with quadrupeds and birds all over and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons but call any thing back again when i desire it in vain the speeding or shyness in vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach in vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powderd bones in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes in vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low in vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods in vain the razorbilld auk sails far north to labrador i follow quickly i ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff i think i could turn and live with animals they are so placid and selfcontaind i stand and look at them long and long they do not sweat and whine about their condition they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of owning things not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth so they show their relations to me and i accept them they bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their possession i wonder where they get those tokens did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them myself moving forward then and now and forever gathering and showing more always and with velocity infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers picking out here one that i love and now go with him on brotherly terms a gigantic beauty of a stallion fresh and responsive to my caresses head high in the forehead wide between the ears limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground eyes full of sparkling wickedness ears finely cut flexibly moving his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him his wellbuilt limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return i but use you a minute then i resign you stallion why do i need your paces when i myself outgallop them even as i stand or sit passing faster than you space and time now i see it is true what i guessd at what i guessd when i loafd on the grass what i guessd while i lay alone in my bed and again as i walkd the beach under the paling stars of the morning my ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in seagaps i skirt sierras my palms cover continents i am afoot with my vision by the citys quadrangular houses in log huts camping with lumbermen along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed weeding my onionpatch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips crossing savannas trailing in forests prospecting golddigging girdling the trees of a new purchase scorchd ankledeep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the shallow river where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the buck turns furiously at the hunter where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the otter is feeding on fish where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the beaver pats the mud with his paddleshaped tall over the growing sugar over the yellowflowerd cotton plant over the rice in its low moist field over the sharppeakd farm house with its scallopd scum and slender shoots from the gutters over the western persimmon over the longleavd corn over the delicate blueflower flax over the white and brown buckwheat a hummer and buzzer there with the rest over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze scaling mountains pulling

ironical license bulldances drinking laughter at the cidermill tasting the sweets of the brown mash sucking the juice through a straw at applepeelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find at

handsome pleasd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously pleasd with the tune of the choir of the whitewashd church pleasd with the earnest words of the sweating methodist preacher impressd seriously at the campmeeting looking in at the shopwindows of broadway the whole forenoon flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass wandering the same afternoon with my face turnd up to the clouds or down a lane or along the beach my right and left arms round the sides of two friends and i in the middle coming home with the silent and darkcheekd bushboy behind me he rides at the drape of the day far from the settlements studying the print of animals feet or the moccasin print by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient nigh the coffind corpse when all is still examining with a candle voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any hot toward one i hate ready in my madness to knife him solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while walking the old hills of judaea with the beautiful gentle god by my side speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the diameter of eighty thousand miles speeding with taild meteors throwing fireballs like the rest carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly storming enjoying planning loving cautioning backing and filling appearing and disappearing i tread day and night such roads i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product and look at quintillions ripend and look at quintillions green i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul my course runs below the soundings of plummets i help myself to material and immaterial no guard can shut me off no law prevent me i anchor my ship for a little while only my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me i go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a pikepointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue i ascend to the foretruck i take my place late at night in the crowsnest we sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them the scenery is plain in all directions the whitetopt mountains show in the distance i fling out my fancies toward them we are approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon to be engaged we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still feet and caution or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruind city the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe i am a free companion i bivouac by invading watchfires i turn the bridgroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips my voice is the wifes voice the screech by the rail of the stairs they fetch my mans body up dripping and drownd i understand the large hearts of heroes the courage of present times and all times how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship and death chasing it up and down the storm how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of days and faithful of nights and chalkd in large letters on a board be of good cheer we will not desert you how he followd with them and tackd with them three days and would not give it up how he saved the drifting company at last how the lank loosegownd women lookd when boated from the side of their prepared graves how the silent oldfaced infants and the lifted sick and the sharplippd unshaved men all this i swallow it tastes good i like it well it becomes mine i am the man i sufferd i was there the disdain and calmness of martyrs the mother of old condemnd for a witch burnt with dry wood her children gazing on the hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence blowing coverd with sweat the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderous buckshot and the bullets all these i feel or am i am the hounded slave i wince at the bite of the dogs hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen i clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinnd with the ooze of my skin i fall on the weeds and stones the riders spur their unwilling horses haul close taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whipstocks agonies are one of my changes of garments i do not ask the wounded person how he feels i myself become the wounded person my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe i am the mashd fireman with breastbone broken tumbling walls buried me in their debris heat and smoke i inspired i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels they have cleard the beams away they tenderly lift me forth i lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy white and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared of their firecaps the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches distant and dead resuscitate they show as the dial or move as the hands of me i am the clock myself i am an old artillerist i tell of my forts bombardment i am there again again the long roll of the drummers again the attacking cannon mortars again to my listening ears the cannon responsive i take part i see and hear the whole the cries curses roar the plaudits for wellaimd shots the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs the fall of grenades through the rent roof the fanshaped explosion the whizz of limbs heads stone wood iron high in the air again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves with his hand he gasps through the clot mind not me mind the entrenchments now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth i tell not the fall of alamo not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo the hundred and fifty are dumb yet at alamo tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men retreating they had formd in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies nine times their number was the price they took in advance their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone they treated for an honorable capitulation receivd writing and seal gave up their arms and marchd back prisoners of war they were the glory of the race of rangers matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters not a single one over thirty years of age the second firstday morning they were brought out in squads and massacred it was beautiful early summer the work commenced about five oclock and was over by eight none obeyd the command to kneel some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight a few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and dead lay together the maimd and mangled dug in the dirt the newcomers saw them there some halfkilld attempted to crawl away these were despatchd with bayonets or batterd with the blunts of muskets a youth not seventeen years old seizd his assassin till two more came to release him the three were all torn and coverd with the boys blood at eleven oclock began the burning of the bodies that is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men would you hear of an oldtime seafight would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars list to the yarn as my grandmothers father the sailor told it to me our foe was no sulk in his ship i tell you said he his was the surly english pluck and there is no tougher or truer and never was and never will be along the lowerd eve he came horribly raking us we closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touchd my captain lashd fast with his own hands we had receivd some eighteen pound shots under the water on our lowergundeck two large pieces had burst at the first fire killing all around and blowing up overhead fighting at sundown fighting at dark ten oclock at night the full moon well up our leaks on the gain and five feet of water reported the masteratarms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold to give them a chance for themselves the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust our frigate takes fire the other asks if we demand quarter if our colors are struck and the fighting done now i laugh content for i hear the voice of my little captain we have not struck he composedly cries we have just begun our part of the fighting only three guns are in use one is directed by the captain himself against the enemys mainmast two well servd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks the tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially the maintop they hold out bravely during the whole of the action not a moments cease the leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powdermagazine one of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking serene stands the little captain he is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low his eyes give more light to us than our battlelanterns toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us stretchd and still lies the midnight two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness our vessel riddled and slowly sinking preparations to pass to the one we have conquerd the captain on the quarterdeck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet near by the corpse of the child that servd in the cabin the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curld whiskers the flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below the husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars cut of cordage dangle of rigging slight shock of the soothe of waves black and impassive guns litter of powderparcels strong scent a few large stars overhead silent and mournful shining delicate sniffs of seabreeze smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore deathmessages given in charge to survivors the hiss of the surgeons knife the gnawing teeth of his saw wheeze cluck swash of falling blood short

barrd at night not a mutineer walks handcuffd to jail but i am handcuffd to him and walk by his side i am less the jolly one there and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips not a youngster is taken for larceny but i go up too and am tried and sentenced not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but i also lie at the last gasp my face is ashcolord my sinews gnarl away from me people retreat askers embody themselves in me and i am embodied in them i project my hat sit shamefaced and beg enough enough enough somehow i have been stunnd stand back give me a little time beyond my cuffd head slumbers dreams gaping i discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake that i could forget the mockers and insults that i could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers that i could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning i remember now i resume the overstaid fraction the grave of rock multiplies what has been

of the universe heard it and heard it of several thousand years it is middling well as far as it goes but is that all magnifying and applying come i outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters taking myself the exact dimensions of jehovah lithographing kronos zeus his son and hercules his grandson buying drafts of osiris isis belus brahma buddha in my portfolio placing manito loose allah on a leaf the crucifix engraved with odin and the hideousfaced mexitli and every idol and image taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more admitting they were alive and did the work of their days they bore mites as for unfledgd birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself bestowing them freely on each man and woman i see discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house putting higher claims for him there with his rolldup sleeves driving the mallet and chisel not objecting to special revelations considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation lads ahold of fireengines and hookandladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction their brawny limbs passing safe over charrd laths their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames by the mechanics wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts baggd out at their waists the snagtoothd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come selling all he possesses traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery what was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me and not filling the square rod then the bull and the bug never worshippd half enough dung and dirt more admirable than was dreamd the supernatural of no account myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes the day getting ready for me when i shall do as much good as the best and be as prodigious by my lifelumps becoming already a creator putting myself here and now to the ambushd womb of the shadows a call in the midst of the crowd my own voice orotund sweeping and final come my children come my boys and girls my women household and intimates now the performer launches his nerve he has passd his prelude on the reeds within easily written loosefingerd chords i feel the thrum of your climax and close my head slues round on my neck music rolls but not from the organ folks are around me but they are no household of mine ever the hard unsunk ground ever the eaters and drinkers ever the upward and downward sun ever the air and the ceaseless tides ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real ever the old inexplicable query ever that thornd thumb that breath of itches and thirsts ever the vexers hoot hoot till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death here and there with dimes on the eyes walking to feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning tickets buying taking selling but in to the feast never once going many sweating ploughing thrashing and then the chaff for payment receiving a few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming this is the city and i am one of the citizens whatever interests the rest interests me politics wars markets newspapers schools the mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factories stocks stores real estate and personal estate the little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and taild coats i am aware who they are they are positively not worms or fleas i acknowledge the duplicates of myself the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me what i do and say the same waits for them every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them i know perfectly well my own egotism know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less and would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself not words of routine this song of mine but abruptly to question to leap beyond yet nearer bring this printed and bound book but the printer and the printingoffice boy the welltaken photographs but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms the black ship maild with iron her mighty guns in her turrets but the pluck of the captain and engineers in the houses the dishes and fare and furniture but the host and hostess and the look out of their eyes the sky up there yet here or next door or across the way the saints and sages in history but you yourself sermons creeds theology but the fathomless human brain and what is reason and what is love and what is life i do not despise you priests all time the world over my faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern believing i shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks in the circle of obis helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist drinking mead from the skullcap to shastas and vedas admirant minding the koran walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knife beating the serpentskin drum accepting the gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing assuredly that he is divine to the mass kneeling or the puritans prayer rising or sitting patiently in a pew ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting deadlike till my spirit arouses me looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like man leaving charges before a journey downhearted doubters dull and excluded frivolous sullen moping angry affected disheartend atheistical i know every one of you i know the sea of torment doubt despair and unbelief how the flukes splash how they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers i take my place among you as much as among any the past is the push of you me all precisely the same and what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all precisely the same i do not know what is untried and afterward but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail each who passes is considerd each who stops is considerd not single one can it fall it cannot fall the young man who died and was buried nor the young woman who died and was put by his side nor the little child that peepd in at the door and then drew back and was never seen again nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with bitterness worse than gall nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder nor the numberless slaughterd and wreckd nor the brutish koboo calld the ordure of humanity nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them nor the present nor the least wisp that is known it is time to explain myself let us stand up what is known i strip away i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown the clock indicates the moment but what does eternity indicate we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them births have brought us richness and variety and other births will bring us richness and variety i do not call one greater and one smaller that which fills its period and place is equal to any were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister i am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation what have i to do with lamentation i am an acme of things accomplishd and i an encloser of things to be my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs on every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps all below duly traveld and still i mount and mount rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist and took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon long i was huggd close long and long immense have been the preparations for me faithful and friendly the arms that have helpd me cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings they sent influences to look after what was to hold me before i was born out of my mother generations guided me my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it for it the nebula cohered to an orb the long slow strata piled to rest it on vast vegetables gave it sustenance monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care all forces have been steadily employd to complete and delight me now on this spot i stand with my robust soul o span of youth everpushd elasticity o manhood balanced florid and full my lovers suffocate me crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night crying by day ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging and chirping over my head calling my name from flowerbeds vines tangled underbrush lighting on every moment of my life bussing my body with soft balsamic busses noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine old age superbly rising o welcome ineffable grace of dying days every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows after and out of itself and the dark hush promulges as much as any i open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding outward and outward and forever outward my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit and greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage if i you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would not avail the long run we should surely bring up again where we now stand and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do not hazard the span or make it impatient they are but parts any thing is but a part see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that count ever so much there is limitless time around that my rendezvous is appointed it is certain the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there i know i have the best of time and space and was never measured and never will be measured i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all my signs are a rainproof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair i have no chair no church no philosophy i lead no man to a dinnertable library exchange but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll my left hand hooking you round the waist my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road not i not any one else can travel that road for you you must travel it for yourself it is not far it is within reach perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land shoulder your duds dear son and i will mine and let us hasten forth wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go if you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip and in due time you shall repay the same service to me for after we start we never lie by again this day before dawn i ascended a hill and lookd at the crowded heaven and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we be filld and satisfied then and my spirit said no we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond you are also asking me questions and i hear you i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself sit a while dear son here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes i kiss you with a goodby kiss and open the gate for your egress hence long enough have you dreamd contemptible dreams now i wash the gum from your eyes you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore now i will you to be a bold swimmer to jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout and laughingly dash with your hair i am the teacher of athletes he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power but in his own right wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts firstrate to ride to fight to hit the bulls eye to sail a skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with smallpox over all latherers and those welltannd to those that keep out of the sun i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me i follow you whoever you are from the present hour my words itch at your ears till you understand them i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while i wait for a boat it is you talking just as much as myself i act as the tongue of you tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosend i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house and i swear i will never translate myself at all only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air if you would understand me go to the heights or watershore the nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves key the maul the oar the handsaw second my words no shutterd room or school can commune with me but roughs and little children better than they the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day the farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice in vessels that sail my words sail i go with fishermen and seamen and love them the soldier campd or upon the march is mine on the night ere the pending battle many seek me and i do not fail them on that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me my face rubs to the hunters face when he lies down alone in his blanket the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon the young mother and old mother comprehend me the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are they and all would resume what i have told them i have said that the soul is not more than the body and i have said that the body is not more than the soul and nothing not god is greater to one than ones self is and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeld universe and i say to any man or woman let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes and i say to mankind be not curious about god for i who am curious about each am not curious about god no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and about death i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself why should i wish to see god better than this day i see something of god each hour of the twentyfour and each moment then in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass i find letters from god dropt in the street and every one is signd by gods name and i leave them where they are for i know that wheresoeer i go others will punctually come for ever and ever and as to you death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to try to alarm me to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes i see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape and as to you corpse i think you are good manure but that does not offend me i smell the white roses sweetscented and growing i reach to the leafy lips i reach to the polishd breasts of melons and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven o suns o grass of graves o perpetual transfers and promotions if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight toss sparkles of day and dusk toss on the black stems that decay in the muck toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small there is that in me i do not know what it is but i know it is in me wrenchd and sweaty calm and cool then my body becomes i sleep i sleep long i do not know it it is without name it is a word unsaid it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol something it swings on more than the earth i swing on to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me perhaps i might tell more outlines i plead for my brothers and sisters do you see o my brothers and sisters it is not chaos or death it is form union plan it is eternal life it is happiness the past and present wilt i have filld them emptied them and proceed to fill my next fold of the future listener up there what have you to confide to me look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening talk honestly no one else hears you and i stay only a minute longer do i contradict myself very well then i contradict myself i am large i contain multitudes i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the doorslab who has done his

nevertheless and filter and fibre your blood failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged missing me one place search another i stop somewhere waiting for you book iv children of adam to the garden the world to the garden the world anew ascending potent mates daughters sons preluding the love the life of their bodies meaning and being curious here behold my resurrection after slumber the revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again amorous mature all beautiful to me all wondrous my limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them for reasons most wondrous existing i peer and penetrate still content with the present content with the past by my side or back of me eve following or in front and i following her just the same from pentup aching rivers from pentup aching rivers from that of myself without which i were nothing from what i am determind to make illustrious even if i stand sole among men from my own voice resonant singing the phallus singing the song of procreation singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown people singing the muscular urge and the blending singing the bedfellows song o resistless yearning o for any and each the body correlative attracting o for you whoever you are your correlative body o it more than all else you delighting from the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day from native moments from bashful pains singing them seeking something yet unfound though i have diligently sought it many a long year singing the true song of the soul fitful at random renascent with grossest nature or among animals of that of them and what goes with them my poems informing of the smell of apples and lemons of the pairing of birds of the wet of woods of the lapping of waves of the mad pushes of waves upon the land i them chanting the overture lightly sounding the strain anticipating the welcome nearness the sight of the perfect body the swimmer swimming naked in the bath or motionless on his back lying and floating the female form approaching i pensive loveflesh tremulous aching the divine list for myself or you or for any one making the face the limbs the index from head to foot and what it arouses the mystic deliria the madness amorous the utter abandonment hark close and still what i now whisper to you i love you o you entirely possess me o that you and i escape from the rest and go utterly off free and lawless two hawks in the air two fishes swimming in the sea not more lawless than we the furious storm through me careering i passionately trembling the oath of the inseparableness of two together of the woman that loves me and whom i love more than my life that oath swearing o i willingly stake all for you o let me be lost if it must be so o you and i what is it to us what the rest do or think what is all else to us only that we enjoy each other and exhaust each other if it must be so from the master the pilot i yield the vessel to the general commanding me commanding all from him permission taking from time the programme hastening i have loiterd too long as it is from sex from the warp and from the woof from privacy from frequent repinings alone from plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near from the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers through my hair and beard from the long sustaind kiss upon the mouth or bosom from the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk fainting with excess from what the divine husband knows from the work of fatherhood from exultation victory and relief from the bedfellows embrace in the night from the actpoems of eyes hands hips and bosoms from the cling of the trembling arm from the bending curve and the clinch from side by side the pliant coverlet offthrowing from the one so unwilling to have me leave and me just as unwilling to leave yet a moment o tender waiter and i return from the hour of shining stars and dropping dews from the night a moment i emerging flitting out celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for and you stalwart loins i sing the body electric i sing the body electric the armies of those i love engirth me and i engirth them they will not let me off till i go with them respond to them and discorrupt them and charge them full with the charge of the soul was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves and if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead and if the body does not do fully as much as the soul and if the body were not the soul what is the soul the love of the body of man or woman balks account the body itself balks account that of the male is perfect and that of the female is perfect the expression of the face balks account but the expression of a wellmade man appears not only in his face it is in his limbs and joints also it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists it is in his walk the carriage of his neck the flex of his waist and knees dress does not hide him the strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem perhaps more you linger to see his back and the back of his neck and shoulderside the sprawl and fulness of babes the bosoms and heads of women the folds of their dress their style as we pass in the street the contour of their shape downwards the swimmer naked in the swimmingbath seen as he swims through the transparent greenshine or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and from the heave of the water the bending forward and backward of rowers in rowboats the horseman in his saddle girls mothers housekeepers in all their performances the group of laborers seated at noontime with their open dinnerkettles and their wives waiting the female soothing a child the

them the fathers of sons this man was a wonderful vigor calmness beauty of person the shape of his head the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes the richness and breadth of his manners these i used to go and visit him to see he was wise also he was six feet tall he was over eighty years old his sons were massive clean bearded tanfaced handsome they and his daughters loved him all who saw him loved him they did not love him by allowance they loved him with personal love he drank water only the blood showd like scarlet through the clearbrown skin of his face he was a frequent gunner and fisher he saild his boat himself he had a fine one presented to him by a shipjoiner he had fowlingpieces presented to him by men that loved him when he went with his five sons and many grandsons to hunt or fish you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang you would wish long and long to be with him you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other i have perceivd that to be with those i like is enough to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough to be surrounded by beautiful curious breathing laughing flesh is enough to pass among them or touch any one or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment what is this then i do not ask any more delight i swim in it as in a sea there is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them and in the contact and odor of them that pleases the soul well all things please the soul but these please

hillside whitend with blossoms of the mountain ash the same late in autumn the hues of red yellow drab purple and light and dark green the rich coverlet of the grass animals and birds the private untrimmd bank the primitive apples the pebblestones beautiful dripping fragments the negligent list of one after another as i happen to call them to me or think of them the real poems what we call poems being merely pictures the poems of the privacy of the night and of men like me this poem drooping shy and unseen that i always carry and that all men carry know once for all avowd on purpose wherever are men like me are our lusty lurking masculine poems lovethoughts lovejuice loveodor loveyielding loveclimbers and the climbing sap arms and hands of love lips of love phallic thumb of love breasts of love bellies pressd and glued together with love earth of chaste love life that is only life after love the body of my love the body of the woman i love the body of the man the body of the earth soft forenoon airs that blow from the southwest the hairy wildbee that murmurs and hankers up and down that gripes the fullgrown ladyflower curves upon her with amorous firm legs takes his will of her and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied the wet of woods through the early hours two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other the smell of apples aromas from crushd sageplant mint birchbark the boys longings the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming the dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground the noformd stings that sights people objects sting me with the hubbd sting of myself stinging me as much as it ever can any one the sensitive orbic underlappd brothers that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are the curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves the limpid liquid within the young man the vexd corrosion so pensive and so painful the torment the irritable tide that will not be at rest the like of the same i feel the like of the same in others the young man that flushes and flushes and the young woman that flushes and flushes the young man that wakes deep at night the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him the mystic amorous night the strange halfwelcome pangs visions sweats the pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers the young man all colord red ashamed angry the souse upon me of my lover the sea as i lie willing and naked the merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them the walnuttrunk the walnuthusks and the ripening or ripend longround walnuts the continence of vegetables birds animals the consequent meanness of me should i skulk or find myself indecent while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent the great chastity of paternity to match the great chastity of maternity the oath of procreation i have sworn my adamic and fresh daughters the greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw till i saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when i am through the wholesome relief repose content and this bunch pluckd at random from myself it has done its work i toss it carelessly to fall where it may one hour to madness and joy one hour to madness and joy o furious o confine me not what is this that frees me so in storms what do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean o to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man o savage and tender achings i bequeath them to you my children i tell them to you for reasons o bridegroom and bride o to be yielded to you whoever you are and you to be yielded to me in defiance of the world o to return to paradise o bashful and feminine o to draw you to me to plant on you for the first time the lips of a determind man o the puzzle the thricetied knot the deep and dark pool all untied and illumind o to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last to be absolvd from previous ties and conventions i from mine and you from yours to find a new unthoughtof nonchalance with the best of nature to have the gag removd from ones mouth to have the feeling today or any day i am sufficient as i am o something unprovd something in a trance to escape utterly from others anchors and holds to drive free to love free to dash reckless and dangerous to court destruction with taunts with invitations to ascend to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me to rise thither with my inebriate soul to be lost if it must be so to feed the remainder of life with one hour of fulness and freedom with one brief hour of madness and joy out of the rolling ocean the crowd out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me whispering i love you before long i die i have traveld a long way merely to look on you to touch you for i could not die till i once lookd on you for i feard i might afterward lose you now we have met we have lookd we are safe return in peace to the ocean my love i too am part of that ocean my love we are not so much separated behold the great rondure the cohesion of all how perfect but as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us as for an hour carrying us diverse yet cannot carry us diverse forever be not impatient a little space know you i salute the air the ocean and the land every day at sundown for your dear sake my love ages and ages returning at intervals ages and ages returning at intervals undestroyd wandering immortal lusty phallic with the potent original loins perfectly sweet i chanter of adamic songs through the new garden the west the great cities calling deliriate thus prelude what is generated offering these offering myself bathing myself bathing my songs in sex offspring of my loins we two how long we were foold we two how long we were foold now transmuted we swiftly escape as nature escapes we are nature long have we been absent but now we return we become plants trunks foliage roots bark we are bedded in the ground we are rocks we are oaks we grow in the openings side by side we browse we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any we are two fishes swimming in the sea together we are what locust blossoms are we drop scent around lanes mornings and evenings we are also the coarse smut of beasts vegetables minerals we are two predatory hawks we soar above and look down we are two resplendent suns we it is who balance ourselves orbic and stellar we are as two comets we prowl fangd and fourfooted in the woods we spring on prey we are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead we are seas mingling we are two of those cheerful waves rolling over each other and interwetting each other we are what the atmosphere is transparent receptive pervious impervious we are snow rain cold darkness we are each product and influence of the globe we have circled and circled till we have arrived home again we two we have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy o hymen o hymenee o hymen o hymenee why do you tantalize me thus o why sting me for a swift moment only why can you not continue o why do you now cease is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would soon certainly kill me i am he that aches with love i am he that aches with amorous love does the earth gravitate does not all matter aching attract all matter so the body of me to all i meet or know native moments native moments when you come upon me ah you are here now give me now libidinous joys only give me the drench of my passions give me life coarse and rank today i go consort with natures darlings tonight too i am for those who believe in loose delights i share the midnight orgies of young men i dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers the echoes ring with our indecent calls i pick out some low person for my dearest friend he shall be lawless rude illiterate he shall be one condemnd by others for deeds done i will play a part no longer why should i exile myself from my companions o you shunnd persons i at least do not shun you i come forthwith in your midst i will be your poet i will be more to you than to any of the rest once i passd through a populous city once i passd through a populous city imprinting my brain for future use with its shows architecture customs traditions yet now of all that city i remember only a woman i casually met there who detaind me for love of me day by day and night by night we were together all else has long been forgotten by me i remember i say only that woman who passionately clung to me again we wander we love we separate again again she holds me by the hand i must not go i see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous i heard you solemnsweet pipes of the organ i heard you solemnsweet pipes of the organ as last sunday morn i passd the church winds of autumn as i walkd the woods at dusk i heard your longstretch d sighs up above so mournful i heard the perfect italian tenor singing at the opera i heard the soprano in the midst of the quartet singing heart of my love you too i heard murmuring low through one of the wrists around my head heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last night under my ear facing west from californias shores facing west from californias shores inquiring tireless seeking what is yet unfound i a child very old over waves towards the house of maternity the land of migrations look afar look off the shores of my western sea the circle almost circled for starting westward from hindustan from the vales of kashmere from asia from the north from the god the sage and the hero from the south from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands long having wanderd since round the earth having wanderd now i face home again very pleasd and joyous but where is what i started for so long ago and why is it yet unfound as adam early in the morning as adam early in the morning walking forth from the bower refreshd with sleep behold me where i pass hear my voice approach touch me touch the palm of your hand to my body as i pass be not afraid of my body book v calamus in paths untrodden in paths untrodden in the growth by margins of pondwaters escaped from the lite that exhibits itself from all the standards hitherto publishd from the pleasures profits conformities which too long i was offering to feed my soul clear to me now standards not yet publishd clear to me that my soul that the soul of the man i speak for rejoices in comrades here by myself away from the clank of the world tallying and talkd to here by tongues aromatic no longer abashd for in this secluded spot i can respond as i would not dare elsewhere strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself yet contains all the rest resolvd to sing no songs today but those of manly attachment projecting them along that substantial life bequeathing hence types of athletic love afternoon this delicious ninthmonth in my fortyfirst year i proceed for all who are or have been young men to tell the secret my nights and days to celebrate the need of comrades scented herbage of my breast scented herbage of my breast leaves from you i glean i write to be perused best afterwards tombleaves bodyleaves growing up above me above death perennial roots tall leaves o the winter shall not freeze you delicate leaves every year shall you bloom again out from where you retired you shall emerge again o i do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor but i believe a few will o slender leaves o blossoms of my blood i permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you o i do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves you are not happiness you are often more bitter than i can bear you burn and sting me yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots you make me think of death death is beautiful from you what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love o i think it is not for life i am chanting here my chant of lovers i think it must be for death for how calm how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers death or life i am then indifferent my soul declines to prefer i am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most indeed o death i think now these leaves mean precisely the same as you mean grow up taller sweet leaves that i may see grow up out of my breast spring away from the conceald heart there do not fold yourself so in your pinktinged roots timid leaves do not remain down there so ashamed herbage of my breast come i am determind to unbare this broad breast of mine i have long enough stifled and choked emblematic and capricious blades i leave you now you serve me not i will say what i have to say by itself i will sound myself and comrades only i will never again utter a call only their call i will raise with it immortal reverberations through the states i will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will through the states through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating give me your tone therefore o death that i may accord with it give me yourself for i see that you belong to me now above all and are folded inseparably together you love and death are nor will i allow you to balk me any more with what i was calling life for now it is conveyd to me that you are the purports essential that you hide in these shifting forms of life for reasons and that they are mainly for you that you beyond them come forth to remain the real reality that behind the mask of materials you patiently wait no matter how long that you will one day perhaps take control of all that you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance that maybe you are what it is all for but it does not last so very long but you will last very long whoever you are holding me now in hand whoever you are holding me now in hand without one thing all will be useless i give you fair warning before you attempt me further i am not what you supposed but far different who is he that would become my follower who would sign himself a candidate for my affections the way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive you would have to give up all else i alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting the whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandond therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further let go your hand from my shoulders put me down and depart on your way or else by stealth in some wood for trial or back of a rock in the open air for in any roofd room of a house i emerge not nor in company and in libraries i lie as one dumb a gawk or unborn or dead but just possibly with you on a high hill first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares or possibly with you sailing at sea or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island here to put your lips upon mine i permit you with the comrades longdwelling kiss or the new husbands kiss for i am the new husband and i am the comrade or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip carry me when you go forth over land or sea for thus merely touching you is enough is best and thus touching you would i silently sleep and be carried eternally but these leaves conning you con at peril for these leaves and me you will not understand they will elude you at first and still more afterward i will certainly elude you even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me behold already you see i have escaped from you for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book nor is it by reading it you will acquire it nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few prove victorious nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil perhaps more for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit that which i hinted at therefore release me and depart on your way for you o democracy come i will make the continent indissoluble i will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon i will make divine magnetic lands with the love of comrades with the lifelong love of comrades i will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of america and along the shores of the great lakes and all over the prairies i will make inseparable cities with their arms about each others necks by the love of comrades by the manly love of comrades for you these from me o democracy to serve you ma femme for you for you i am trilling these songs these i singing in spring these i singing in spring collect for lovers for who but i should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy and who but i should be the poet of comrades collecting i traverse the garden the world but soon i pass the gates now along the pondside now wading in a little fearing not the wet now by the postandrail fences where the old stones thrown there pickd from the fields have accumulated wildflowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and partly cover them beyond these i pass far far in the forest or sauntering later in summer before i think where i go solitary smelling the earthy smell stopping now and then in the silence alone i had thought yet soon a troop gathers around me some walk by my side and some behind and some embrace my arms or neck they the spirits of dear friends dead or alive thicker they come a great crowd and i in the middle collecting dispensing singing there i wander with them plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me here lilac with a branch of pine here out of my pocket some moss which i pulld off a liveoak in florida as it hung trailing down here some pinks and laurel leaves and a handful of sage and here what i now draw from the water wading in the pondside o here i last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns again never to separate from me and this o this shall henceforth be the token of comrades this calamusroot shall interchange it youths with each other let none render it back and twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut and stems of currants and plumblows and the aromatic cedar these i compassd around by a thick cloud of spirits wandering point to or touch as i pass or throw them loosely from me indicating to each one what he shall have giving something to each but what i drew from the water by the pondside that i reserve i will give of it but only to them that love as i myself am capable of loving not heaving from my ribbd breast only not heaving from my ribbd breast only not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself not in those longdrawn illsupprest sighs not in many an oath and promise broken not in my wilful and savage souls volition not in the subtle nourishment of the air not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only not in cries laughter defiancies thrown from me when alone far in the wilds not in husky pantings through clinchd teeth not in sounded and resounded words chattering words echoes dead words not in the murmurs of my dreams while i sleep nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you continually not there not in any or all of them o adhesiveness o pulse of my life need i that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs of the terrible doubt of appearances of the terrible doubt of appearances of the uncertainty after all that we may be deluded that maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all that maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only maybe the things i perceive the animals plants men hills shining and flowing waters the skies of day and night colors densities forms maybe these are as doubtless they are only apparitions and the real something has yet to be known how often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me how often i think neither i know nor any man knows aught of them maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seem as from my present point of view and might prove as of course they would nought of what they appear or nought anyhow from entirely changed points of view to me these and the like of these are curiously answerd by my lovers my dear friends when he whom i love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by the hand when the subtle air the impalpable the sense that words and reason hold not surround us and pervade us then i am charged with untold and untellable wisdom i am silent i require nothing further i cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond the grave but i walk or sit indifferent i am satisfied he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me the base of all metaphysics and now gentlemen a word i give to remain in your memories and minds as base and finale too for all metaphysics so to the students the old professor at the close of his crowded course having studied the new and antique the greek and germanic systems kant having studied and stated fichte and schelling and hegel stated the lore of plato and socrates greater than plato and greater than socrates sought and stated christ divine having studied long i see reminiscent today those greek and germanic systems see the philosophies all christian churches and tenets see yet underneath socrates clearly see and underneath christ the divine i see the dear love of man for his comrade the attraction of friend to friend of the wellmarried husband and wife of children and parents of city for city and land for land recorders ages hence recorders ages hence come i will take you down underneath this impassive exterior i will tell you what to say of me publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover the friend the lovers portrait of whom his friend his lover was fondest who was not proud of his songs but of the measureless ocean of love within him and freely pourd it forth who often walkd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends his lovers who pensive away from one he lovd often lay sleepless and dissatisfied at night who knew too well the sick sick dread lest the one he lovd might secretly be indifferent to him whose happiest days were far away through fields in woods on hills he and another wandering hand in hand they twain apart from other men who oft as he saunterd the streets curvd with his arm the shoulder of his friend while the arm of his friend rested upon him also when i heard at the close of the day when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been receivd with plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for me that followd and else when i carousd or when my plans were accomplishd still i was not happy but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health refreshd singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light when i wanderd alone over the beach and undressing bathed laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming o then i was happy o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food nourishd me more and the beautiful day passd well and the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came my friend and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night in the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me and his arm lay lightly around my breast and that night i was happy are you the new person drawn toward me are you the new person drawn toward me to begin with take warning i am surely far different from what you suppose do you suppose you will find in me your ideal do you think it so easy to have me become your lover do you think the friendship of me would be unalloyd satisfaction do you think i am trusty and faithful do you see no further than this facade this smooth and tolerant manner of me do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man have you no thought o dreamer that it may be all maya illusion roots and leaves themselves alone roots and leaves themselves alone are these scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pondside breastsorrel and pinks of love fingers that wind around tighter than vines gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the sun is risen breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the living sea to you o sailors frostmellowd berries and thirdmonth twigs offerd fresh to young persons wandering out in the fields when the

frequent and swift flash of eyes offering me love offering response to my own these repay me lovers continual lovers only repay me behold this swarthy face behold this swarthy face these gray eyes this beard the white wool unclipt upon my neck my brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm yet comes one a manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightly on the lips with robust love and i on the crossing of the street or on the ships deck give a kiss in return we observe that salute of american comrades land and sea we are those two natural and nonchalant persons i saw in louisiana a liveoak growing i saw in louisiana a liveoak growing all alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green and its look rude unbending lusty made me think of myself but i wonderd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near for i knew i could not and i broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and twined around it a little moss and brought it away and i have placed it in sight in my room it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends for i believe lately i think of little else than of them yet it remains to me a curious token it makes me think of manly love for all that and though the liveoak glistens there in louisiana solitary in a wide in a wide flat space uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near i know very well i could not to a stranger passing stranger you do not know how longingly i look upon you you must be he i was seeking or she i was seeking it comes to me as of a dream i have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you all is recalld as we flit by each other fluid affectionate chaste matured you grew up with me were a boy with me or a girl with me i ate with you and slept with you your body has become not yours only nor left my body mine only you give me the pleasure of your eyes face flesh as we pass you take of my beard breast hands in return i am not to speak to you i am to think of you when i sit alone or wake at night alone i am to wait i do not doubt i am to meet you again i am to see to it that i do not lose you this moment yearning and thoughtful this moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone it seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful it seems to me i can look over and behold them in germany italy france spain or far far away in china or in russia or talking other dialects and it seems to me if i could know those men i should become attached to them as i do to men in my own lands o i know we should be brethren and lovers i know i should be happy with them i hear it was charged against me i hear it was charged against me that i sought to destroy institutions but really i am neither for nor against institutions what indeed have i in common with them or what with the destruction of them only i will establish in the mannahatta and in every city of these states inland and seaboard and in the fields and woods and above every keel little or large that dents the water without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument the institution of the dear love of comrades the prairiegrass dividing the prairiegrass dividing its special odor breathing i demand of it the spiritual corresponding demand the most copious and close companionship of men demand the blades to rise of words acts beings those of the open atmosphere coarse sunlit fresh nutritious those that go their own gait erect stepping with freedom and command leading not following those with a neverquelld audacity those with sweet and lusty flesh clear of taint those that look carelessly in the faces of presidents and governors as to say who are you those of earthborn passion simple never constraind never obedient those of inland america when i persue the conquerd fame when i peruse the conquerd fame of heroes and the victories of mighty generals i do not envy the generals nor the president in his presidency nor the rich in his great house but when i hear of the brotherhood of lovers how it was with them how together through life through dangers odium unchanging long and long through youth and through middle and old age how unfaltering how affectionate and faithful they were then i am pensive i hastily walk away filld with the bitterest envy

behind me any wealthy bequest to found hospital or library nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for america nor literary success nor intellect nor book for the bookshelf but a few carols vibrating through the air i leave for comrades and lovers a glimpse a glimpse through an interstice caught of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a barroom around the stove late of a winter night and i unremarkd seated in a corner of a youth who loves me and whom i love silently approaching and seating himself near that he may hold me by the hand a long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and oath and smutty jest there we two content happy in being together speaking little perhaps not a word a leaf for hand in hand a leaf for hand in hand you natural persons old and young you on the mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of the mississippi you friendly boatmen and mechanics you roughs you twain and all processions moving along the streets i wish to infuse myself among you

something fierce in you eligible to burst forth for an athlete is enamourd of me and i of him but toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible to burst forth i dare not tell it in words not even in these songs i dreamd in a dream i dreamd in a dream i saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth i dreamd that was the new city of friends nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love it led the rest it was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city and in all their looks and words what think you i take my pen in hand what think you i take my pen in hand to record the battleship perfectmodeld majestic that i saw pass the offing today under full sail the splendors of the past day or the splendor of the night that envelops me or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me no but merely of two simple men i saw today on the pier in the midst of the crowd parting the parting of dear friends the one to remain hung on the others neck and passionately kissd him while the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms to the east and to the west to the east and to the west to the man of the seaside state and of pennsylvania to the kanadian of the north to the southerner i love these with perfect trust to depict you as myself the germs are in all men i believe the main purport of these states is to found a superb friendship exalte previously unknown because i perceive it waits and has been always waiting latent in all men sometimes with one i love sometimes with one i love i fill myself with rage for fear i effuse unreturnd love but now i think there is no unreturnd love the pay is certain one way or another i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not returnd yet out of that i have written these songs to a western boy many things to absorb i teach to help you become eleve of mine yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins if you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine fast anchord eternal o love fastanchord eternal o love o woman i love o bride o wife more resistless than i can tell the thought of you then separate as disembodied or another born ethereal the last athletic reality my consolation i ascend i float in the regions of your love o man o sharer of my roving life among the multitude among the men and women the multitude i perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs acknowledging none else not parent wife husband brother child any nearer than i am some are baffled but that one is not that one knows me ah lover and perfect equal i meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections and i when i meet you mean to discover you by the like in you o you whom i often and silently come o you whom i often and silently come where you are that i may be with you as i walk by your side or sit near or remain in the same room with you little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is playing within me that shadow my likeness that shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood chattering chaffering how often i find myself standing and looking at it where it flits how often i question and doubt whether that is really me but among my lovers and caroling these songs o i never doubt whether that is really me full of life now full of life now compact visible i forty years old the eightythird year of the states to one a century hence or any number of centuries hence to you yet unborn these seeking

receiving contemplating gently but with undeniable will divesting myself of the holds that would hold me i inhale great draughts of space the east and the west are mine and the north and the south are mine i am larger better than i thought i did not know i held so much goodness all seems beautiful to me can repeat over to men and women you have done such good to me i would do the same to you i will recruit for myself and you as i go i will scatter myself among men and women as i go i will toss a new gladness and roughness among them whoever denies me it shall not trouble me whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appeard it would not astonish me now i see the secret of the making of the best persons it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth here a great personal deed has room such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it here is the test of wisdom wisdom is not finally tested in schools wisdom cannot be passd from one having it to another not having it wisdom is of the soul is not susceptible of proof is its own proof applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things and the excellence of things something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul now i reexamine philosophies and religions they may prove well in lecturerooms yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents here is realization here is a man tallied he realizes here what he has in him the past the future majesty love if they are vacant of you you are vacant of them only the kernel of every object nourishes where is he who tears off the husks for you and me where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me here is adhesiveness it is not previously fashiond it is apropos do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers do you know the talk of those turning eyeballs here is the efflux of the soul the efflux of the soul comes from within through embowerd gates ever provoking questions these yearnings why are they these thoughts in the darkness why are they why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me i think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as i pass what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side what with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as i walk by and pause what gives me to be free to a womans and mans goodwill what gives them to be free to mine the efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness i think it pervades the open air waiting at all times now it flows unto us we are rightly charged here rises the fluid and attaching character the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old from it falls distilld the charm that mocks beauty and attainments toward it

city to which you were destind you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are calld by an irresistible call to depart you shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who

floodtide below me i see you face to face clouds of the west sun there half an hour high i see you also face to face crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes how curious you are to me on the ferryboats the hundreds and hundreds that cross returning home are more curious to me than you suppose and you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me and more in my meditations than you might suppose the impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day the simple compact welljoind scheme myself disintegrated every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme the similitudes of the past and those of the future the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings on the walk in the street and the passage over the river the current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away the others that are to follow me the ties between me and them the certainty of others the life love sight hearing of others others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore others will watch the run of the floodtide others will see the shipping of manhattan north and west and the heights of brooklyn to the south and east others will see the islands large and small fifty years hence others will see them as they cross the sun half an hour high a hundred years hence or ever so many hundred years hence others will see them will enjoy the sunset the pouringin of the floodtide the fallingback to the sea of the ebbtide it avails not time nor place distance avails not i am with you you men and women of a generation or ever so many generations hence just as you feel when you look on the river and sky so i felt just as any of you is one of a living crowd i was one of a crowd just as you are refreshd by the gladness of the river and the bright flow i was refreshd just as you stand and lean on the rail yet hurry with the swift current i stood yet was hurried just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thickstemmd pipes of steamboats i lookd i too many and many a time crossd the river of old watched the twelfthmonth seagulls saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings oscillating their bodies saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow saw the slowwheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams lookd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water lookd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward lookd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet lookd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving saw their approach saw aboard those that were near me saw the white sails of schooners and sloops saw the ships at anchor the sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars the round masts the swinging motion of the hulls the slender serpentine pennants the large and small steamers in motion the pilots in their pilothouses the white wake left by the passage the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels the flags of all nations the falling of them at sunset the scallopedged waves in the twilight the ladled cups the frolicsome crests and glistening the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks on the river the shadowy group the big steamtug closely flankd on each side by the barges the hayboat the belated lighter on the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets these and all else were to me the same as they are to you i loved well those cities loved well the stately and rapid river the men and women i saw were all near to me others the same others who look back on me because i lookd forward to them the time will come though i stop here today and tonight what is it then between us what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us whatever it is it avails not distance avails not and place avails not i too lived brooklyn of ample hills was mine i too walkd the streets of manhattan island and bathed in the waters around it i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me in the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me in my walks home late at night or as i lay in my bed they came upon me i too had been struck from the float forever held in solution i too had receivd identity by my body that i was i knew was of my body and what i should be i knew i should be of my body it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall the dark threw its patches down upon me also the best i had done seemd to me blank and suspicious my great thoughts as i supposed them were they not in reality meagre nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil i am he who knew what it was to be evil i too knitted the old knot of contrariety blabbd blushd resented lied stole grudgd had guile anger lust hot wishes i dared not speak was wayward vain greedy shallow sly cowardly malignant the wolf the snake the hog not wanting in me the cheating look the frivolous word the adulterous wish not wanting refusals hates postponements meanness laziness none of these wanting was one with the rest the days and haps of the rest was calld by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing felt their arms on my neck as i stood or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as i sat saw many i loved in the street or ferryboat or public assembly yet never told them a word lived the same life with the rest the same old laughing gnawing sleeping playd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress the same old role the role that is what we make it as great as we like or as small as we like or both great and small closer yet i approach you what thought you have of me now i had as much of you i laid in my stores in advance i considerd long and seriously of you before you were born who was to know what should come home to me who knows but i am enjoying this who knows for all the distance but i am as good as looking at you now for all you cannot see me ah what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than masthemmd manhattan river and sunset and scallopedgd waves of floodtide the seagulls oscillating their bodies the hayboat in the twilight and the belated lighter what gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand and with voices i love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face which fuses me into you now and pours my meaning into you we understand then do we not what i promisd without mentioning it have you not accepted what the study could not teach what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplishd is it not flow on river flow with the floodtide and ebb with the ebbtide frolic on crested and scallopedgd waves gorgeous clouds of the sunset drench with your splendor me or the men and women generations after me cross from shore to shore countless crowds of passengers stand up tall masts of mannahatta stand up beautiful hills of brooklyn throb baffled and curious brain throw out questions and answers suspend here and everywhere eternal float of solution gaze loving and thirsting eyes in the house or street or public assembly sound out voices of young men loudly and musically

answerer to the cities and farms i sing as they spread in the sunshine before me a young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother how shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother tell him to send me the signs and i stand before the young man face to face and take his right hand in my left hand and his left hand in my right hand and i answer for his brother and for men and i answer for him that answers for all and send these signs him all wait for him all yield up to his word is decisive and final him they accept in him lave in him perceive themselves as amid light him they immerse and he immerses them beautiful women the haughtiest nations laws the landscape people animals the profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean so tell i my mornings romanza all enjoyments and properties and money and whatever money will buy the best farms others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps the noblest and costliest cities others grading and building and he domiciles there nothing for any one but what is for him near and far are for him the ships in the offing the perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody he puts things in their attitudes he puts today out of himself with plasticity and love he places his own times reminiscences parents brothers and sisters associations employment politics so that the rest never shame them afterward nor assume to command them he is the answerer what can be answerd he answers and what cannot be answerd he shows how it cannot be answerd a man is a summons and challenge it is vain to skulk do you hear that mocking and laughter do you hear the ironical echoes books friendships philosophers priests action pleasure pride beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction he indicates the satisfaction and indicates them that beat up and down also whichever the sex whatever the season or place he may go freshly and gently and safely by day or by night he has the passkey of hearts to him the response of the prying of hands on the knobs his welcome is universal the flow of beauty is not more welcome or universal than he is the person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed every existence has its idiom every thing has an idiom and tongue he resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men and any man translates and any man translates himself also one part does not counteract another part he is the joiner he sees how they join he says indifferently and alike how are you friend to the president at his levee and he says goodday my brother to cudge that hoes in the sugarfield and both understand him and know that his speech is right he walks with perfect ease in the capitol he walks among the congress and one representative says to another here is our equal appearing and new then the mechanics take him for a mechanic and the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier and the sailors that he has followd the sea and the authors take him for an author and the artists for an artist and the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them no matter what the work is that he is the one to follow it or has followd it no matter what the nation that he might find his brothers and sisters there the english believe he comes of their english stock a jew to the jew he seems a russ to the russ usual and near removed from none whoever he looks at in the travelers coffeehouse claims him the italian or frenchman is sure the german is sure the spaniard is sure and the island cuban is sure the engineer the deckhand on the great lakes or on the mississippi or st lawrence or sacramento or hudson or paumanok sound claims him the gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood the insulter the prostitute the angry person the beggar see themselves in the ways of him he strangely transmutes them they are not vile any more they hardly know themselves they are so grown the indications and tally of time perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs time always without break indicates itself in parts what always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of singers and their words the words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark the maker of poems settles justice reality immortality his insight and power encircle things and the human race he is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race the singers do not beget only the poet begets the singers are welcomd understood appear often enough but rare has the day been likewise the spot of the birth of the maker of poems the answerer not every century nor every five centuries has containd such a day for all its names the singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names but the name of each of them is one of the singers the name of each is eyesinger earsinger headsinger sweetsinger nightsinger parlorsinger lovesinger weirdsinger or something else all this time and at all times wait the words of true poems the words of true poems do not merely please the true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty the greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and fathers the words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science divine instinct breadth of vision the law of reason health rudeness of body withdrawnness gayety suntan airsweetness such are some of the words of poems the sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems the answerer the builder geometer chemist anatomist phrenologist artist all these underlie the maker of poems the answerer the words of the true poems give you more than poems they give you to form for yourself poems religions politics war peace behavior histories essays daily life and every thing else they balance ranks colors races creeds and the sexes they do not seek beauty they are sought forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty longing fain lovesick they prepare for death yet are they not the finish but rather the outset they bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars to learn one of the meanings to launch off with absolute faith to sweep through the ceaseless rings and never be quiet again book x our old feuillage

wooden pegs in the oints of their pincers i go to all the places one after another and then row back to the shore there in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boild till their color becomes scarlet another time mackereltaking voracious mad for the hook near the surface they seem to fill the water for miles another time fishing for rockfish in chesapeake bay i one of the brownfaced crew another time trailing for bluefish off paumanok i stand with braced body my left foot is on the gunwale my right arm throws far out the coils of slender rope in sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs my companions o boating on the rivers the voyage down the st lawrence the superb scenery the steamers the ships sailing the thousand islands the occasional timberraft and the raftsmen with longreaching sweepoars the little huts on the rafts and the stream of smoke when they cook supper at evening o something pernicious and dread something far away from a puny and pious life something unproved something in a trance something escaped from the anchorage and driving free o to work in mines or forging iron foundry casting the foundry itself the rude high roof the ample and shadowd space the furnace the hot liquid pourd out and running o to resume the joys of the soldier to feel the presence of a brave commanding officer to feel his sympathy to behold his calmness to be warmd in the rays of his smile to go to battle to hear the bugles play and the drums beat to hear the crash of artillery to see the glittering of the bayonets and musketbarrels in the sun to see men fall and die and not complain to taste the savage taste of blood to be so devilish to gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy o the whalemans joys o i cruise my old cruise again i feel the ships motion under me i feel the atlantic breezes fanning me i hear the cry again sent down from the masthead there she blows again i spring up the rigging to look with the rest we descend wild with excitement i leap in the lowerd boat we row toward our prey where he lies we approach stealthy and silent i see the mountainous mass lethargic basking i see the harpooneer standing up i see the weapon dart from his vigorous arm o swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale settling running to windward tows me again i see him rise to breathe we row close again i see a lance driven through his side pressd deep turnd in the wound again we back off i see him settle again the life is leaving him fast as he rises he spouts blood i see him swim in circles narrower and narrower swiftly cutting the water i see him die he gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle and then falls flat and still in the bloody foam o the old manhood of me my noblest joy of all my children and grandchildren my white hair and beard my largeness calmness majesty out of the long stretch of my life o ripend joy of womanhood o happiness at last i am more than eighty years of age i am the most venerable mother how clear is my mind how all people draw nigh to me what attractions are these beyond any before what bloom more than the bloom of youth what beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me o the orators joys to inflate the chest to roll the thunder of the voice out from the ribs and throat to make the people rage weep hate desire with yourself to lead america to quell america with a great tongue o the joy of my soul leaning poisd on itself receiving identity through materials and loving them observing characters and absorbing them my soul vibrated back to me from them from sight hearing touch reason articulation comparison memory and the like the real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh my body done with materials my sight done with my material eyes proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes which finally see nor my material body which finally loves walks laughs shouts embraces procreates o the farmers joys ohioans illinoisians wisconsinese kanadians iowans kansians missourians oregonese joys to rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work to plough land in the fall for wintersown crops to plough land in the spring for maize to train orchards to graft the trees to gather apples in the fall o to bathe in the swimmingbath or in a good place along shore to splash the water to walk ankledeep or race naked along the shore o to realize space the plenteousness of all that there are no bounds to emerge and be of the sky of the sun and moon and flying clouds as one with them o the joy a manly selfhood to be servile to none to defer to none not to any tyrant known or unknown to walk with erect carriage a step springy and elastic to look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye to speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest to confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth knowist thou the excellent joys of youth joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face joy of the glad lightbeaming day joy of the widebreathd games joy of sweet music joy of the lighted ballroom and the dancers joy of the plenteous dinner strong carouse and drinking yet o my soul supreme knowist thou the joys of pensive thought joys of the free and lonesome heart the tender gloomy heart joys of the solitary walk the spirit bowd yet proud the suffering and the struggle the agonistic throes the ecstasies joys of the solemn musings day or night joys of the thought of death the great spheres time and space prophetic joys of better loftier loves ideals the divine wife the sweet eternal perfect comrade joys all thine own undying one joys worthy thee o soul o while i live to be the ruler of life not a slave to meet life as a powerful conqueror no fumes no ennui no more complaints or scornful criticisms to these proud laws of the air the water and the ground proving my interior soul impregnable and nothing exterior shall ever take command of me for not lifes joys alone i sing repeating the joy of death the beautiful touch of death soothing and benumbing a few moments for reasons myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burnd or renderd to powder or buried my real body doubtless left to me for other spheres my voided body nothing more to me returning to the purifications further offices eternal uses of the earth o to attract by more than attraction how it is i know not yet behold the something which obeys none of the rest it is offensive never defensive yet how magnetic it draws o to struggle against great odds to meet enemies undaunted to be entirely alone with them to find how much one can stand to look strife torture prison popular odium face to face to mount the scaffold to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance to be indeed a god o to sail to sea in a ship to leave this steady unendurable land to leave the tiresome sameness of the streets the sidewalks and the houses to leave you o you solid motionless land and entering a ship to sail and sail and sail o to have life henceforth a poem of new joys to dance clap hands exult shout skip leap roll on

hour the dancers dance the musicians play for them the show passes all does well enough of course all does very well till one flash of defiance a great city is that which has the greatest men and women if it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the whole world the place where a great city stands is not the place of stretchd wharves docks manufactures deposits of produce merely nor the place of ceaseless salutes of newcomers or the anchorlifters of the departing nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops selling goods from the rest of the earth nor the place of the best libraries and schools nor the place where money is plentiest nor the place of the most numerous population where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards where the city stands that is belovd by these and loves them in return and understands them where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds where thrift is in its place and prudence is in its place where the men and women think lightly of the laws where the slave ceases and the master of slaves ceases where the populace rise at once against the neverending audacity of elected persons where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript waves where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside authority where the citizen is always the head and ideal and president mayor governor and what not are agents for pay where children are taught to be laws to themselves and to depend on themselves where equanimity is illustrated in affairs where speculations on the soul are encouraged where women walk in public processions in the streets the same as the men where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men where the city of the faithfulest friends stands where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands where the city of the healthiest fathers stands where the city of the bestbodied mothers stands there the great city stands how beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed how the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a mans or womans look all

okeechobee i cross the hummockland or through pleasant openings or dense forests i see the parrots in the woods i see the papawtree and the blossoming titi again sailing in my coaster on deck i coast off georgia i coast up the carolinas i see where the liveoak is growing i see where the yellowpine the scented baytree the lemon and orange the cypress the graceful palmetto i pass rude seaheadlands and enter pamlico sound through an inlet and dart my vision inland o the cotton plant the growing fields of rice sugar hemp the cactus guarded with thorns the laureltree with large white flowers the range afar the richness and barrenness the old woods charged with mistletoe and trailing moss the piney odor and the gloom the awful natural stillness here in these dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun and the fugitive has his conceald hut o the strange fascination of these halfknown halfimpassable swamps infested by reptiles resounding with the bellow of the alligator the sad noises of the nightowl and the wildcat and the whirr of the rattlesnake the mockingbird the american mimic singing all the forenoon singing through the moonlit night the hummingbird the wild turkey the raccoon the opossum a kentucky cornfield the tall graceful longleavd corn slender flapping bright green with tassels with beautiful ears each wellsheathd in its husk o my heart o tender and fierce pangs i can stand them not i will depart o to be a virginian where i grew up o to be a carolinian o longings irrepressible o i will go back to old tennessee and never wander more mannahatta i was asking for something specific and perfect for my city whereupon lo upsprang the aboriginal name now i see what there is in a name a word liquid sane unruly musical selfsufficient i see that the word of my city is that word from of old because i see that word nested in nests of waterbays superb rich hemmd thick all around with sailships and steamships an island sixteen miles long solidfounded numberless crowded streets high growths of iron slender strong light splendidly uprising toward clear skies tides swift and ample wellloved by me toward sundown the flowing seacurrents the little islands larger adjoining islands the heights the villas the countless masts the white shoresteamers the lighters the ferryboats the black seasteamers wellmodeld the downtown streets the jobbers houses of business the houses of business of the shipmerchants and moneybrokers the riverstreets immigrants arriving fifteen or twenty thousand in a week the carts hauling goods the manly race of drivers of horses the brownfaced sailors the summer air the bright sun shining and the sailing clouds aloft the winter snows the sleighbells the broken ice in the river passing along up or down with the floodtide or ebbtide the mechanics of the city the masters wellformd beautifulfaced looking you straight in the eyes trottoirs throngd vehicles broadway the women the shops and shows a million people manners free and superb open voices hospitality the most courageous and friendly young men city of hurried and sparkling waters city of spires and masts city nested in bays my city all is truth o me man of slack faith so long standing aloof denying portions so long only aware today of compact alldiffused truth discovering today there is no lie or form of lie and can be none but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does this is curious and may not be realized immediately but it must be realized i feel in myself that i represent falsehoods equally with the rest and that the universe does where has faild a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth is it upon the ground or in water or fire or in the spirit of man or in the meat and blood meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself i see that there are really no liars or lies after all and that nothing fails its perfect return and that what

the earth restive confronts a new era perhaps a general divine war no one knows what will happen next such portents fill the days and nights years prophetical the space ahead as i walk as i vainly try to pierce it is full of phantoms unborn deeds things soon to be project their shapes around me this incredible rush and heat this strange ecstatic fever of dreams o years your dreams o years how they penetrate through me i know not whether i sleep or wake the performd america and europe grow dim retiring in shadow behind me the unperformd more gigantic than ever advance advance upon me ashes of soldiers ashes of soldiers south or north as i muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought the war resumes again to my sense your shapes and again the advance of the armies noiseless as mists and vapors from their graves in the trenches ascending from cemeteries all through virginia and tennessee from every point of the compass out of the countless graves in wafted clouds in myriads large or squads of twos or threes or single ones they come and silently gather round me now sound no note o trumpeters not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses with sabres drawn and glistening and carbines by their thighs ah my brave horsemen my handsome tanfaced horsemen what life what joy and pride with all the perils were yours nor you drummers neither at reveille at dawn nor the long roll alarming the camp nor even the muffled beat for burial nothing from you this time o drummers bearing my warlike drums but aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless the slain elate and alive again the dust and debris alive i chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers faces so pale with wondrous eyes very dear gather closer yet draw close but speak not phantoms of countless lost invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions follow me ever desert me not while i live sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living sweet are the musical voices sounding but sweet ah sweet are the dead with their silent eyes dearest comrades all is over and long gone but love is not over and what love o comrades perfume from battlefields rising up from the foetor arising perfume therefore my chant o love immortal love give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers shroud them embalm them cover them all over with tender pride perfume all make all wholesome make these ashes to nourish and blossom o love solve all fructify all with the last chemistry give me exhaustless make me a fountain that i exhale love from me wherever i go like a moist perennial dew for the ashes of all dead soldiers south or north thoughts of these years i sing how they pass and have passd through convulsd pains as through parturitions how america illustrates birth muscular youth the promise the sure fulfilment the absolute success despite of people illustrates evil as well as good the vehement struggle so fierce for unity in onesself how many hold despairingly yet to the models departed caste myths obedience compulsion and to infidelity how few see the arrived models the athletes the western states or see freedom or spirituality or hold any faith in results but i see the athletes and i see the results of the war glorious and inevitable and they again leading to other results how the great cities appear how the democratic masses turbulent willful as i love them how the whirl the contest the wrestle of evil with good the sounding and resounding keep on and on how society waits unformd and is for a while between things ended and things begun how america is the continent of glories and of the triumph of freedom and of the democracies and of the fruits of society and of all that is begun and how the states are complete in themselves and how all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves to lead onward and how these of mine and of the states will in their turn be convulsd and serve other parturitions and transitions and how all people sights combinations the democratic masses too serve and how every fact and war itself with all its horrors serves and how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death of seeds dropping into the ground of births of the steady concentration of america inland upward to impregnable and swarming places of what indiana kentucky arkansas and the rest are to be of what a few years will show there in nebraska colorado nevada and the rest or afar mounting the northern pacific to sitka or aliaska of what the feuillage of america is the preparation for and of what all sights north south east and west are of this union welded in blood of the solemn price paid of the unnamed lost ever present in my mind of the temporary use of materials for identitys sake of the present passing departing of the growth of completer men than any yet of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother the mississippi flows of mighty inland cities yet unsurveyd and unsuspected of the new and good names of the modern developments of inalienable homesteads of a free and original life there of simple diet and clean and sweet blood of litheness majestic faces clear eyes and perfect physique there of immense spiritual results future years far west each side of the anahuacs of these songs well understood there being made for that area of the native scorn of grossness and gain there o it lurks in me night and day what is gain after all to savageness and freedom song at sunset splendor of ended day floating and filling me hour prophetic hour resuming the past inflating my throat you divine average you earth and life till the last ray gleams i sing open mouth of my soul uttering gladness eyes of my soul seeing perfection natural life of me faithfully praising things corroborating forever the triumph of things illustrious every one illustrious what we name space sphere of unnumberd spirits illustrious the mystery of motion in all beings even the tiniest insect illustrious the attribute of speech the senses the body illustrious the passing light illustrious the pale reflection on the new moon in the western sky illustrious whatever i see or hear or touch to the last good in all in the satisfaction and aplomb of animals in the annual return of the seasons in the hilarity of youth in the strength and flush of manhood in the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age in the superb vistas of death wonderful to depart wonderful to be here the heart to jet the allalike and innocent blood to breathe the air how delicious to speak to walk to seize something by the hand to prepare for sleep for bed to look on my rosecolord flesh to be conscious of my body so satisfied so large to be this incredible god i am to have gone forth among other gods these men and women i love wonderful how i celebrate you and myself how my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around how the clouds pass silently overhead how the earth darts on and on and how the sun moon stars dart on and on how the water sports and sings surely it is alive how the trees rise and stand up with strong trunks with branches and leaves surely there is something more in each of the trees some living soul o amazement of things even the least particle o spirituality of things o strain musical flowing through ages and continents now reaching me and america i take your strong chords intersperse them and cheerfully pass them forward i too carol the sun usherd or at noon or as now setting i too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the growths of the earth i too have felt the resistless call of myself as i steamd down the mississippi as i wanderd over the prairies as i have lived as i have lookd through my windows my eyes as i went forth in the morning as i beheld the light breaking in the east as i bathed on the beach of the eastern sea and again on the beach of the western sea as i roamd the streets of inland chicago whatever streets i have roamd or cities or silent woods or even amid the sights of war wherever i have been i have charged myself with contentment and triumph i sing to the last the equalities modern or old i sing the endless finales of things i say nature continues glory continues i praise with electric voice for i do not see one imperfection in the universe and i do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe o setting sun though the time has come i still warble under you if none else does unmitigated adoration as at thy portals also death as at thy portals also death entering thy sovereign dim illimitable grounds to memories of my mother to the divine blending maternity to her buried and gone yet buried not gone not from me i see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still i sit by the form in the coffin i kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips the cheeks the closed eyes in the coffin to her the ideal woman practical spiritual of all of earth life love to me the best i grave a monumental line before i go amid these songs and set a tombstone here my legacy the business man the acquirer vast after assiduous years surveying results preparing for departure devises houses and lands to his children bequeaths stocks goods funds for a school or hospital leaves money to certain companions to buy tokens souvenirs of gems and gold but i my life surveying closing with nothing to show to devise from its idle years nor houses nor lands nor tokens of gems or gold for my friends yet certain remembrances of the war for you and after you and little souvenirs of camps and soldiers with my love i bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs pensive on her dead gazing pensive on her dead gazing i heard the mother of all desperate on the torn bodies on the forms covering the battlefields gazing as the last gun ceased but the scent of the powdersmoke lingerd as she calld to her earth with mournful voice while she stalkd absorb them well o my earth she cried i charge you lose not my sons lose not an atom and you streams absorb them well taking their dear blood and you local spots and you airs that swim above lightly impalpable and all you essences of soil and growth and you my rivers depths and you mountain sides and the woods where my dear childrens blood trickling reddend and you trees down in your roots to bequeath to all future trees my dead absorb or south or north my young mens bodies absorb and their precious precious blood which holding in trust for me faithfully back again give me many a year hence in unseen essence and odor of surface and grass centuries hence in blowing airs from the fields back again give me my darlings give my immortal heroes exhale me them centuries hence breathe me their breath let not an atom be lost o years and graves o air and soil o my dead an aroma sweet exhale them perennial sweet death years centuries hence camps of green nor alone those camps of white old comrades of the wars when as orderd forward after a long march footsore and weary soon as the light lessens we halt for the night some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack dropping asleep in our tracks others pitching the little tents and the fires lit up begin to sparkle outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark and a word provided for countersign careful for safety till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums we rise up refreshd the night and sleep passd over and resume our journey or proceed to battle lo the camps of the tents of green which the days of peace keep filling and the days of war keep filling with a mystic army is it too orderd forward is it too only halting awhile till night and sleep pass over now in those camps of green in their tents dotting the world in the parents children husbands wives in them in the old and young sleeping under the sunlight sleeping under the moonlight content and silent there at last behold the mighty bivouacfield and waitingcamp of all of the corps and generals all and the president over the corps and generals all and of each of us o soldiers and of each and all in the ranks we fought there without hatred we all all meet for presently o soldiers we too camp in our place in the bivouaccamps of green but we need not provide for outposts nor word for the countersign nor drummer to beat the morning drum the sobbing of the bells midnight sept the sobbing of the bells the sudden deathnews everywhere the slumberers rouse the rapport of the people full well they know that message in the darkness full well return respond within their breasts their brains the sad reverberations the passionate toll and clang city to city joining sounding passing those heartbeats of a nation in the night as they draw to a close as they draw to a close of what underlies the precedent songs of my aims in them of the seed i have sought to plant in them of joy sweet joy through many a year in them for them for them have i lived in them my work is done of many an aspiration fond of many a dream and plan through space and time fused in a chant and the flowing eternal identity to nature encompassing these encompassing god to the joyous electric all to the sense of death and accepting exulting in death in its turn the same as life the entrance of man to sing to compact you ye parted diverse lives to put rapport the mountains and rocks and streams and the winds of the north and the forests of oak and pine

america does what was promisd when through these states walk a hundred millions of superb persons when the rest part away for superb persons and contribute to them when breeds of the most perfect mothers denote america then to me and mine our due fruition i have pressd through in my own right i have sung the body and the soul war and peace have i sung and the songs of life and death and the

tasks i have set promulging to women certain whispers of myself bequeathing their affection me more clearly explaining to young men my problems offering no dallier i i the muscle of their brains trying so i pass a little time vocal visible contrary afterward a melodious echo passionately bent for death making me really undying the best of me then when no longer visible for toward that i have
