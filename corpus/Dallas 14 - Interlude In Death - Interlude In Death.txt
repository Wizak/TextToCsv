 chapter one the faces of murder were varied and complex some were as old as time and the furrows scoring them filled with the blood spilled by cain one brothers keeper was anothers executioner of course it had been rather elementary to close that particular case the list of suspects had been after all pretty limited but time had populated the earth until by the early spring of it so crawled with people that they spilled out from their native planet to jam manmade worlds and satellites the skill and ability to create their own worlds the sheer nerve to consider doing so hadnt stopped them from killing their brothers the method was sometimes more subtle often more vicious but people being people could just as easily fall back on ramming a sharpened stick through anothers heart over a nice patch of lettuce the centuries and mans nature had developed more than alternative ways to kill and a variety of victims and motives they had created the need and the means to punish the guilty the punishing of the guilty and the demand for justice for the innocent became perhaps had been since that first extreme case of sibling rivalry an art and a science these days murder got you more than a short trip to the land of nod it shut you up in a steel and concrete cage where youd have plenty of time to think about where you went wrong but getting the sinner where justice deemed he belonged was the trick it required a system and the system demanded its rules techniques manpower organizations and loopholes and the occasional seminar to educate and inform as far as lieutenant eve dallas was concerned shed rather face a horde of torkedout chemiheads than conduct a seminar on murder at least the chemiheads wouldnt embarrass you to death and as if it wasnt bad enough that shed been drafted to attend the interplanetary law enforcement and security conference as if it wasnt horrifying enough that her own commander had ordered her to give a seminar the whole ball of goddamn wax had to take shape offplanet couldnt hold the sucker in new york eve thought as she lay facedown on the hotel bed just couldnt find one spot on the whole fucking planet that could suit up nope just had to send a bunch of cops and techs out into space god she hated space travel and of all the places in the known universe the siteselection committee had to dump them on the olympus resort not only was she a cop out of her element but she was a cop out of her element giving a seminar in one of the conference rooms in one of the ridiculously plush hotels owned by her husband it was mortifying sneaky son of a bitch she thought and wondered if any of the muscles and bones in her body that had dissolved during landing on olympus had regenerated hed planned it hed worked it and now she was paying for it she had to socialize attend meetings she had to dear christ give a speech and in less than a week she would have to get back on that fancy flying death trap of roarkes and face the journey home since the idea of that made her stomach turn over she considered the benefits of living out the rest of her life on olympus how bad could it be the place had hotels and casinos and homes bars shops which meant it had people when you had people bless their mercenary hearts you had crime you had crime you needed cops she could trade in her new york police and security badge for an interplanetary law enforcement shield i could work for ile she muttered into the bedspread certainly on the other side of the room roarke finished studying a report on one of his other properties after a while you wouldnt think twice about zipping from planet to space station to satellite and youd look charming in one of those blueandwhite uniforms and kneehigh boots her little fantasy fizzed interplanetary meant after all interplanetary kiss my ass all right he walked over bent down and laid his lips on her butt then began working his way up her back unlike his wife he was energized by space travel if you think youre getting sex pal think again im doing a lot of thinking he indulged himself with the long lean length of her when he reached the nape of her neck he rubbed his lips just below the ends of her short disordered cap of hair and feeling her quick shiver grinned as he flipped her over then he frowned a little skimming a finger along the shallow dent in her chin youre a bit pale yet arent you her deepgoldenbrown eyes stared sulkily into his her mouth wide mobile twisted into a sneer when im on my feet again im going to punch you in that pretty face of yours i look forward to it meanwhile he reached down began unbuttoning her shirt pervert thank you lieutenant because she was his and it continuously delighted him he brushed a kiss over her torso then tugged off her boots stripped off her trousers and i hope well get to the perversion part of our program shortly but for now he picked her up and carried her out of the bedroom i think well try a little postflight restorative why do i have to be naked i like you naked he stepped into a bathroom no not a bathroom eve mused that was too ordinary a word for this oasis of sensual indulgence the tub was a lake deep blue and fed by gleaming silver tubes twined together in flower shapes rose trees heavy with saucersize white blooms flanked the marble stairs that led into a shower area where a waterfall already streamed gently down gleaming walls the tall cylinders of mood and drying tubes were surrounded by spills of flowers and foliage and she imagined that anyone using one of them would look like a statue in a garden a wall of glass offered a view of cloudless sky turned to gold by the tint of the privacy screen he set her down on the soft cushions of a sleep chair and walked to one of the curved counters that flowed around the walls he slid open a panel in the tiles and set a program on the control pad hidden behind it water began to spill into the tub the lights dimmed and music softly sobbing strings slid into the air im taking a bath she asked him eventually relax close your eyes but she didnt close her eyes it was too tempting just to watch him as he moved around the room adding something frothy to the bath pouring some pale gold liquid into a glass he was tall and had an innate sort of grace like a cat did she thought a big dangerous cat that only pretended to be tame when it suited his mood his hair was black and thick and longer than her own it spilled nearly to his shoulders and provided a perfect frame for a face that made her think of dark angels and doomed poets and ruthless warriors all at once when he looked at her with those hot and wildly blue eyes the love inside her could spread so fast and strong it hurt her heart to hold it he was hers she thought irelands former bad boy who had made his life his fortune his place by hook or well by crook drink this he liked to tend her she mused as she took the glass he offered she lost child hardass cop could never figure out if it irritated or thrilled her mostly she supposed it just baffled her what is it good he took it back from her sipped himself to prove it when she sampled it she found that he was right as usual he walked behind the chair the amusement on his face plain when he tipped her back and her gaze narrowed with suspicion close your eyes he repeated and slipped goggles over her face one minute he added lights bled in front of her closed lids deep blues warm reds in slow melting patterns she felt his hands slicked with something cool and fragrant knead her shoulders the knotted muscles of her neck her system jangled from the flight began to settle well this doesnt suck she murmured and let herself drift he took the glass from her hand as her body slipped into the tenminute restorative program hed selected hed told her one minute hed lied when she was relaxed he bent to kiss the top of her head then draped a silk sheet over her nerves he knew had worn her out added to them the stress and fatigue of coming off a difficult case and being shot directly into an offplanet assignment that she detested and it was no wonder her system was unsettled he left her sleeping and went out to see to a few minor details for the evening event hed just stepped back in when the timer of the program beeped softly and she stirred wow she blinked scooped at her hair when he set the goggles aside feel better feel great a little travel distress is easy enough to fix the bath should finish it off she glanced over saw that the tub was full heaped with bubbles that swayed gently in the current of the jets i just bet it will smiling she got up crossed the room to step down into the sunken pool and lowering herself neckdeep she let out a long sigh can i have that wine or whatever the hell it is sure obliging he carried it over set it on the wide lip behind her head thanks ive gotta say this is some she trailed off pressed her fingers to her temple eve headache he reached out concerned and found himself flipping into the water with her when he surfaced she was grinning and her hand was cupped possessively between his legs sucker she said pervert oh yeah let me show you how i finish off this little restorative program ace o o restored and smug she took a quick spin in the drying tube if she was going to live only a few more days before crashing into a stray meteor and being burned to a cinder by exploding rocket fuel on the flight back home she might as well make the best of it she snagged a robe wrapped herself in it and strolled back into the bedroom roarke already wearing trousers was scanning what looked like encoded symbols as they scrolled across the screen of the bedroom telelink her dress at least she assumed it was a dress was laid out on the bed she frowned at the sheer flow of bronze walked over to finger the material did i pack this no he didnt bother to glance back he could see her suspicious scowl clearly enough in his mind you packed several days worth of shirts and trousers summerset made some adjustments in your conference wardrobe summerset the name hissed like a snake between her lips roarkes majordomo was a major pain in her ass you let him paw through my clothes now i have to burn them though hed made considerable adjustments to her wardrobe in the past year there were in his opinion several items left that deserved burning he rarely paws were running a little behind he added the cocktail reception started ten minutes ago just an excuse for a bunch of cops to get shitfaced dont see why i have to get dressed up for it image darling eve youre a featured speaker and one of the events vips i hate that part its bad enough when i have to go to your deals you shouldnt be nervous about your seminar who said im nervous she snatched up the dress can you see through this thing his lips quirked not quite o o not quite was accurate she decided the getup felt thin as a cloud and that was good for comfort the flimsy layers of it barely shielded the essentials still as her fashion sense could be etched on a microchip with room to spare she had to figure roarke knew what he was doing at the sound of the mixed voices rolling out of the ballroom as they approached eve shook her head i bet half of them are already in the bag youre serving prime stuff in there arent you only the best for our hardworking civil servants knowing his woman roarke took her hand and pulled her through the open doorway the ballroom was huge and packed theyd come from all over the planet and its satellites police officials technicians expert consultants the brains and the brawn of law enforcement doesnt it make you nervous to be in the same room with what about four thousand cops she asked him on the contrary lieutenant he said laughingly i feel very safe some of these guys probably tried to put you away once upon a time so did you now he took her hand and before she could stop him kissed it look where it got you dallas officer delia peabody decked out in a short red dress instead of her standard starched uniform rushed up her dark bowl of hair had been fluffed and curled and eve noted the tall glass in her hand was already half empty peabody looks like you got here the transport was on time no problem roarke this place is seriously iced i cant believe im here i really appreciate you getting me in dallas she hadnt arranged it as a favor exactly if she was going to suffer through a seminar eve had figured her aide should suffer too but from the look of things peabody seemed to be bearing up i came in with feeney and his wife peabody went on and dr mira and her husband morris and dickhead and silas from security leward from anticrime theyre all around somewhere some of the other guys from central and the precincts nypsd is really well represented great she could expect to get ragged on about her speech for weeks were going to have a little reunion later in the moonscape lounge reunion we just saw each other yesterday onplanet peabodys lips slicked deep red threatened to pout this is different eve scowled at her aides fancy party dress youre telling me why dont i get you ladies a drink wine eve and peabody im having an awesome orgasm the drink i mean not you know personally amused roarke brushed a hand over her shoulder ill take care of it boy could he ever peabody muttered as he walked away button it eve scanned the room separating cops from spouses from techs from consultants she focused in on a large group gathered in the southeast corner of the ballroom whats the deal there thats the big wheel former commander douglas r skinner peabody gestured with her glass then took a long drink you ever meet him no heard about him plenty though hes a legend i havent gotten a look yet because theres been about a hundred people around him since i got here ive read most of his books the way he came through the urban wars kept his own turf secure he was wounded during the atlanta siege but held the line hes a real hero cops arent heroes peabody we just do the job chapter two eve wasnt interested in legends or heroes or retired cops who raked in enormous fees playing the lecture circuit or consulting she was interested in finishing her one drink putting in an appearance at the reception and only because her own commander had ordered her to do so then making herself scarce tomorrow she thought was soon enough to get down to work from the noise level of the crowd everyone else thought so too but it appeared the legend was interested in her she barely had the wineglass in her hand was just calculating the least annoying route around the room when someone tapped on her shoulder lieutenant dallas a thin man with dark hair cut so short it looked like sandpaper glued to his scalp nodded at her bryson hayes commander skinners personal adjutant the commander would very much like to meet you if youd come with me the commander she returned even as hayes started to turn away looks pretty occupied at the moment ill be around all week after one slow blink hayes simply stared at her the commander would like to meet you now lieutenant his schedule through the conference is very demanding go on peabody whispered it as she nudged eve with her elbow go on dallas wed be delighted to meet with commander skinner roarke solved the problem by setting his own drink aside then taking both eves and peabodys arms it earned him an adoringpuppy look from peabody and a narrow scowl from his wife before hayes could object or adjust roarke led both women across the ballroom youre just doing this to piss me off eve commented not entirely but i did enjoy pissing hayes off just a bit of politics lieutenant he gave her arm a friendly squeeze it never hurts to play them he slipped through the crowd smoothly and only smiled when hayes a muscle working in his jaw caught up in time to break a path through the last knot of people skinner was short his reputation was so large it surprised eve to note that he barely reached her shoulders she knew him to be seventy but hed kept himself in shape his face was lined but it didnt sag nor did his body hed allowed his hair to gray but not to thin and he wore it militarily trim his eyes under straight silver brows were a hard marble blue he held a short glass the amber liquid inside neat the heavy gold of his fiftyyear ring gleamed on his finger she took his measure in a matter of seconds as she noted he took hers lieutenant dallas commander skinner she accepted the hand he held out found it cool dry and more frail than shed expected my aide officer peabody his gaze stayed on eves face an extra beat then shifted to peabody his lips curved officer always a pleasure to meet one of our men or women in uniform thank you sir its an honor to meet you commander youre one of the reasons i joined the force im sure the nypsd is lucky to have you lieutenant id my husband eve interrupted roarke skinners expression didnt waver but it chilled yes i recognized roarke i spent some of my last decade on the job studying you im flattered i believe this is your wife roarke turned his attention to the woman beside skinner its a pleasure to meet you thank you her voice was the soft cream of the southern united states your olympus is a spectacular accomplishment im looking forward to seeing more of it while were here id be happy to arrange a tour transportation youre too kind she brushed a hand lightly over her husbands arm she was a striking woman she had to be close to her husband in age eve thought as their long marriage was part of skinners pristine rep but either superior dna or an excellent faceandbody team had kept her beauty youthful her hair was richly black and the gorgeous tone of her skin indicated mixed race she wore a sleek silver gown and starry diamonds as if shed been born to such things when she looked at eve it was with polite interest my husband admires your work lieutenant dallas and hes very exacting in his admiration roarke why dont we give these two cops a little time to talk shop thank you belle excuse us wont you officer skinner gestured toward a table guarded by a trio of blacksuited men lieutenant indulge me when they sat the men moved one step back bodyguards at a cop convention habit i wager you have your weapon and shield in your evening bag she acknowledged this with a little nod she would have preferred to wear them but the dress didnt allow for her choice of accessories whats this about commander belle was right i admire your work i was intrigued to find us on the same program you dont generally accept speaking engagements no i like the streets so did i its like a virus in the blood he leaned back nursed his drink the faint tremor in his hand surprised her but working the streets doesnt mean being on them necessarily someone has to command from a desk an office a war room a good cop a smart cop moves up the ranks as you have lieutenant a good cop a smart cop closes cases and locks up the bad guys he gave one short laugh you think thats enough for captains bars for a command star no the word naive never came up in any of the reports ive read on you why should you read reports on me i may be retired from active duty but im still a consultant i still have my finger in the pie he leaned forward again youve managed to work and close some very highprofile cases in the murder book lieutenant while i dont always approve of your methods the results are unarguable its rare for me to judge a female officer worthy of command excuse me back up female he lifted his hand in a gesture that told her hed had this discussion before and was vaguely weary of it i believe men and women have different primary functions man is the warrior the provider the defender woman is the procreator the nurturer there are numerous scientific theories that agree and certainly social and religious weight to add is that so eve said softly frankly ive never approved of women on the force or in certain areas of the civilian workplace theyre often a distraction and rarely fully committed to the job marriage and family soon as they should for women take priority commander skinner under the circumstances the most courteous thing i can think of to say is youre full of shit he laughed loud and long you live up to your reputation lieutenant your data also indicate that youre smart and that your badge isnt something you just pick up off the dresser every morning its what you are or were in any case we have that in common for fifty years i made a difference and my house was clean i did what had to be done then i did what came next i was full commander at the age of fortyfour would you like to be able to say the same she knew when she was being played and kept her face and tone neutral i havent thought about it if thats true you disappoint me if thats true start thinking do you know lieutenant how much closer you would be right now to a captaincy if you hadnt made some illadvised personal decisions really something began to burn inside her gut and how would you know the promotion potential of a homicide cop in new york ive made it my business to know his free hand balled into a fist tapped lightly rhythmically on the tabletop i have one regret one piece of unfinished business from my active duty one target i could never keep in my sights long enough to bring down between us we could ill get you those captain bars lieutenant you get me roarke she looked down at her wine slowly ran a fingertip around the rim commander you gave half a century of your life to the job you shed blood for it thats the single reason im not going to punch you in the face for that insult think carefully he said as eve got to her feet sentiment over duty is never a smart choice i intend to bring him down i wont hesitate to break you to do it riding on fury she leaned down very close and whispered in his ear try it youll find out im no fucking nurturer she stepped away only to have one of the bodyguards move into her path the commander he said isnt finished speaking with you im finished speaking with the commander his gaze shifted from her face briefly and he gave the faintest nod before he edged closer clamped a hand on her arm youll want to sit down lieutenant and wait until youve been dismissed move your hand move it now or im going to hurt you he only tightened his grip take your seat and wait for leave to go or youre going to be hurt she glanced back at skinner then into the guards face guess again she used a shortarm jab to break his nose then a quick snap kick to knock back the guard beside him as he surged forward by the time shed spun around planted she had her hand in her bag and on her weapon keep your dogs on a leash she said to skinner she scanned the faces of cops whod turned whod moved forward to see if there was trouble coming from another direction deciding against it she turned away and walked through the buzzing crowd she was nearly at the door when roarke fell in step beside her draped an arm around her shoulders you got blood on your dress darling yeah still steaming she glanced down at the small splatter its not mine i noticed i need to talk to you umhmm why dont we go upstairs see what the valet can do about that bloodstain you can talk before we come down to have a drink with your friends from central why the hell didnt you tell me you knew skinner roarke keyed in the code for the private elevator to the owners suite i dont know him he sure as hell knows you so i gathered he waited until they were inside the car before he pressed a kiss to her temple eve over the course of things ive had a great many cops looking in my direction hes still looking hes welcome to im a legitimate businessman practically a pillar redeemed by the love of a good woman dont make me hit you too she strode out of the elevator across the sumptuous living area of the suite and directly outside onto the terrace so she could finish steaming in fresh air the son of a bitch the son of a bitch wants me to help him bring you down rather rude roarke said mildly to broach the subject on such a short acquaintance and at a cocktail reception why did he think youd agree he dangled a captaincy in my face tells me he can get it for me otherwise im in the back of the line because of my poor personal choices meaning me amusement fled is that true are your chances for promotion bogged down because of us how the hell do i know still flying on the insult she rounded on him do you think i care about that you think making rank drives me no he walked to her ran his hands up and down her arms i know what drives you the dead drive you he leaned forward rested his lips on her brow he miscalculated it was a stupid and senseless thing for him to do he barely bothered to circle around much before he hit me with it bad strategy she continued poor approach he wants your ass roarke and bad enough to risk censure for attempted bribery if i report the conversation and anyone believes it why is that i dont know and what you didnt know he thought was always dangerous ill look into it in any case you certainly livened up the reception normally idve been more subtle just kneed that jerk in the balls for getting in my way but skinner had gone into this tango about how women shouldnt be on the job because theyre nurturers tagging the balls just seemed too girly at the time he laughed drew her closer i love you eve yeah yeah but she was smiling again when she wrapped her arms around him o o as a rule being crowded ass to ass at a table in a club where the entertainment included music that threatened the eardrums wasnt eves idea of a good time but when she was working off a good mad it paid to have friends around the table was jammed with new yorks finest her butt was squeezed between roarkes and feeneys the electronic detective division captain feeneys usually hangdog face was slack with amazement as he stared up at the stage on the other side of roarke dr mira elegant despite the surroundings sipped a brandy alexander and watched the entertainment a threepiece combo whose costumes were redwhiteandblue body paint doing wild trashrock riffs on american folk songs rounding out the table were morris the medical examiner and peabody wife shouldntve gone to bed feeney shook his head you have to see it to believe it hell of a show morris agreed his long dark braid was threaded through with silver rope and the lapels of his calflength jacket sparkled with the same sheen for a dead doctor eve thought he was a very snappy dresser but dallas here morris winked at her was quite some warmup act har har eve replied morris smiled serenely hotshot lieutenant decks legend of police lores bodyguards at law enforcement convention on luxury offplanet resort youve got to play that all the way out nice left jab feeney commented good followthrough on the kick skinners an asshole why do you say that feeney peabody demanded hes an icon who said icons cant be assholes he tossed back likes to make out like he put down the urban wars singlehanded goes around talking about them like it was all about duty and romance and patriotism what it was was about survival and it was ugly its typical for some whove been through combat to romanticize it mira put in nothing romantic about slitting throats or seeing fifth avenue littered with body parts well thats cheerful morris pushed feeneys fresh glass in front of him have another beer captain cops dont crow about doing the job feeney glugged down his beer they just do it ida been closer dallas ida helped you take down those spine crackers of his because the wine and his mood made her sentimental she jabbed him affectionately with her elbow you bet your ass we can go find them and beat them brainless you know round out the evenings entertainment roarke laid a hand on her back as one of his security people came to the table and leaned down to whisper in his ear humor vanished from his face as he nodded someone beat you to it he announced we have whats left of a body on the stairway between the eighteenth and nineteenth floors chapter three eve stood at the top of the stairwell the once pristine white walls were splattered with blood and gray matter a nasty trail of both smeared the stairs the body was sprawled on them faceup there was enough of his face and hair left for her to identify him as the man whose nose shed broken a few hours before looks like somebody was a lot more pissed off than i was your man got any sealit she asked roarke when roarke passed her the small can of sealant she coated her hands her shoes i could use a recorder peabody help hotel security keep the stairwells blocked off morris she tossed him the can with me roarke gave her his security guards lapel recorder stepped forward eve simply put a hand on his chest no civilians whether they own the hotel or not just wait why dont you clear feeney to confiscate the security disks for this sector of the hotel itll save time she didnt wait for an answer but headed down the steps to the body crouched didnt do this with fists she examined his face one side was nearly caved in the other largely untouched left arms crushed guy was lefthanded i made that at the reception they probably went for the left side first disabled him agreed dallas morris jerked his head in the direction of the seventeenth floor a thick metal bat coated with gore rested on a tread farther down the stairs that wouldve done the trick i can consult with the local me on the autopsy but prelim eyeballing tells me thats the weapon do you want me to dig up some evidence bags a couple of field kits she started to speak then hissed out a breath the smell of death was in her nostrils and it was too familiar not our territory weve got to go through station police goddamn it there are ways to get around that with your man owning the place maybe she poked a sealed finger in a blood pool nudged something metal and silver and she recognized the star worn on the epaulets of hotel security who would be stupid enough to beat a man to death in a hotel full of cops morris wondered she shook her head got to her feet lets get the ball rolling on this when she reached the top of the steps she scanned the hallway if shed been in new york she would now give the body a thorough examination establish time of death gather data and trace evidence from the scene shed call her crime scene unit the sweepers and send out a team to do doortodoors but she wasnt in new york has your security notified station police she asked roarke theyre on their way good fine well keep the area secure and offer any and all assistance deliberately she switched off her recorder i dont have any authority here technically i shouldnt have entered the crime scene area i had a previous altercation with the victim and that makes it stickier i own this hotel and i hold primary interest in this station i can request the assistance of any law enforcement agent yeah so weve got that clear she looked at him one of your security uniforms is missing a star its down there covered with body fluid if one of my people is responsible youll have my full cooperation in identifying and apprehending him she nodded again so weve got that clear too whats your security setup for this sector fullrange cameras corridors elevators and stairwells full soundproofing feeneys getting the disks hell have to hand them to station police when its homicide they have a maximum of seventytwo hours before theyre obliged to turn the investigation over to ile since ile has people onsite theyd be wise to turn it over now is that what you want its not a matter of what i want look its not my case he took a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped the blood smear from her hand isnt it then he turned as the chief of police stepped off the elevator eve hadnt been expecting a statuesque brunette in a tiny black dress with enough hair to stuff a mattress as she clipped down the hall on towering high heels eve heard morriss reverent opinion hubbahubba jeez try for dignity eve scolded the brunette stopped took a quick scan roarke she said in a voice that evoked images of hot desert nights chief lieutenant dallas nypsd dr morris nyc medical examiner yes darcia angelo chief of olympus police excuse my appearance i was at one of the welcome events im told we have a possible homicide verified homicide eve told her victims male caucasian thirtyfive to forty bludgeoned the weapon a metal bat was left on scene preliminary visual exam indicates hes been dead under two hours theres been a prelim exam darcia asked coldly yes well we wont quibble about that ill verify personally before my team gets here messy down there coolly eve handed over the can of sealit thanks darcia stepped out of her evening shoes eve couldnt fault her for it she did the same thing herself when she remembered when shed finished she handed the can back to eve darcia took a small recorder out of her purse clipped it where the fabric of her dress dipped to hug her breasts morris let out a long sigh as she walked into the stairwell where do you find them he asked roarke and how can i get one of my very own before eve could snarl at him feeney hurried down the hall got a snag with the disks he announced stairway cams were overridden for a fiftyminute period you got nothing but static there and static for two sixtysecond intervals on the twentiethfloor corridor somebody knew what they were doing he added its a complex system with a failsafe backup plan it took a pro with access with that time frame there had to be at least two people involved eve stated premeditated not impulse not crime of passion you got an id on the victim i can run a background check police chiefs on scene eve said flatly for a moment feeney looked blank oh right forgot we werent home sweet home the locals going to squeeze us out you werent darcia said as she came out of the stairwell ever in an official capacity in on the contrary roarke told her i requested the assistance of the lieutenant and her team irritation flickered across darcias face but she controlled it quickly as is your privilege lieutenant may i have a moment of your time without waiting for an answer darcia walked down the corridor arrogant territorial pushy eve glared at roarke you sure can pick them he only smiled as his wifes retreating back yes i certainly can look angelo you want to bust my balls over doing a visual youre wasting your time and mine eve tugged her lapel recorder free held it out i verified a homicide at the request of the property owner then i stepped back i dont want your job and i dont want your case i get my fill of walking through blood in new york darcia flipped her mane of glossy black hair four months ago i was busting illegal dealers in colombia risking my life on a daily basis and still barely able to pay the rent on a stinking little tworoom apartment in the current climate cops are not appreciated in my country i like my new job she opened her purse dropped eves recorder inside is that job in jeopardy if i refuse to hand over this case to my employers wife roarke doesnt fight my battles and he doesnt fire people because they might not agree with me good darcia nodded i worked illegals bunko robbery twelve years im a good cop homicide however is not my specialty i dont enjoy sharing but id appreciate any help you and your associates are willing to give in this matter fine so what was this dance about simply so you and i would both be aware it is my case you need to be aware that earlier tonight i punched the dead man in the face why darcia asked suspiciously he got in my way i see itll be interesting to find out if you and i can close this matter without getting in each others way two hours later for conveniences sake the two arms of the investigation gathered in roarkes onsite office the victim is identified as reginald weeks thirtyeight current residence is atlanta georgia earth married no children current employer douglas r skinner incorporated function personal security darcia finished inclined her head at eve crime scene examination of body shows massive trauma eve picked up the narrative cause of death most likely fractured skull the left side of the head and body were severely traumatized victim was lefthanded and this method of attack indicates foreknowledge security for the stairwell and the twentieth floor were tampered with prior to and during the act a metal bat has been taken into evidence and is presumed to be the murder weapon also taken into evidence a silverplated star stud identified as part of the hotel security teams uniform chief angelo background data so far retrieved on weeks show no criminal activity he had held his current employment for two years prior that he was employed by right arm a firm that handles personal security and security consults for members of the conservative party prior to that he was in the military border patrol for six years this tells us he knows how to follow orders eve continued he stepped up in my face tonight because skinner or one of skinners arms signaled him to do so he laid hands on me for the same reason hes trained and if he was good enough to last six years in the border patrol and land a job in right arm hes not the type of guy who would go into a soundproof stairwell with a stranger even under duress if hed been attacked in the corridor thered be a sign of it if they took him on the twentieth floor what the hell was he doing on the twentieth floor his room his security briefing room and skinners suite are all on twentysix couldve been meeting a woman feeney stretched out his legs conventionitis thats a point eve allowed all evidence points to this being a planned attack but a woman could have been used as a lure we need to verify or eliminate that you want to track it down feeney captain feeney may assist my officers in that area of investigation darcia merely lifted her eyebrows when eve turned to her if he is agreeable as i hope he will be to continuing to work with the hotel security team were a real agreeable group eve said with a wide wide smile excellent then you have no problem accompanying me to twentysix to inform the victims employer of his death not a one peabody my aide goes with me eve said before darcia could speak nonnegotiable peabody eve said again gesturing as she walked out of the room and left darcia assigning her officers to different tasks i want your recorder on when we talk to skinner yes sir if i get hung up i need you to wheedle an update out of the local me if you cant open him up tag morris and have him use the good buddy same field approach yes sir i want to find the uniform that star came from we need to check recyclers the valet outside cleaning sources get chummy with the home team i want to know the minute the sweepers and crime scene units reports are in im betting theres going to be traces of sealit on that bat and nobodys blood but the victims on the scene fucking ambush she grumbled and turned as darcia came out darcia said nothing until shed called for the elevator and stepped inside do you have a history with douglas skinner lieutenant no not until tonight my information is that he specifically called you to his table to speak with you privately you apparently had words of disagreement and when the victim attempted to prevent you from leaving the table you struck him would this be accurate it would what were those words of disagreement between you and douglas skinner am i a suspect in this case or a consultant youre a consultant and as such i would appreciate any and all data ill think about it eve stepped out on twentysix if you have nothing to hide im a cop eve reminded her that line doesnt work on me she rang the bell waited she watched the security light blink to green kept her face blank while she and her companions were scanned moments later skinner opened the door himself lieutenant its a bit late for paying calls its never too late for official calls chief angelo douglas skinner pardon the intrusion commander skinner darcias voice was low and respectful her face quietly sober we have some unfortunate news may we come in of course he stepped back he was dressed in the long white robe provided by the hotel and his face looked pale against it the large living area was dimly lit and fragrant from the bouquets of roses he ordered the lights up percent and gestured toward the sofa please ladies sit can i get you anything coffee perhaps were not here to chat where were you between twentytwo hundred and midnight i dont like your tone lieutenant please excuse us darcia stepped in smoothly its been a difficult night if i could ask you to verify your whereabouts as a formality my wife and i came up to our suite a bit after ten we retired early as i have a long busy day scheduled tomorrow whats happened weeks got his brains bashed in eve said weeks reggie skinner stared at eve those hard blue eyes widened darkened and seemed to draw a cast of gray over his skin as shock shifted into fury dead the boy is dead have you determined roarkes whereabouts or would you go so far as to cover up murder to protect him she attacked weeks only hours ago he pointed at eve an unprovoked and vicious assault on one of mine because i questioned her about her alliance with a criminal youre a disgrace to your badge one of us is eve agreed as skinner sank into a chair commander darcia stepped forward i know this is a shock for you i want to assure you that the olympus pd is actively pursuing all avenues of investigation for a moment he said nothing and the only sound was his quick labored breathing i dont know you chief angelo but i know who pays you i have no confidence in your investigation as long as its bankrolled by roarke now excuse me i have nothing more to say at this time i need to contact reggies wife and tell her shes a widow chapter four well that went well eve rolled her shoulders as she headed back to the elevator if one doesnt mind being accused of being a fool or a dirty cop eve punched the elevator button ever hear the one about sticks and stones in colombia i dont like that one obviously stewing darcia strode onto the elevator and i dont like your commander skinner hey hes not mine he implies roarke is my puppet master why does he assume that and why does he believe roarke is responsible for weekss death the quiet respectful woman was gone and in her place was a tougheyed cop with steel in her voice eve began to see how darcia angelo had risen through twelve years in colombia one reason is weeks annoyed me and since im just a procreating nurturing female it would be up to my warrior defender penisowning husband to follow through ah darcia sucked in her cheeks this is an attitude i recognize still splattering a mans brains is considerable overcompensation for such a minor infraction a very large leap of conclusion for the commander to make theres more might be i havent worked it out yet meanwhile skinner seemed awfully alert for someone whod already gone to bed and while the lights in the living area were on low when we walked in they were full on in the bedroom off to the right he didnt close the door all the way when he came out yes i noticed that suites set up along the same basic floor plan as the one im in second bedroom off to the left there was a light on in there too his wife had that door open a crack she was listening i didnt catch that darcia mused then glanced back when peabody muttered she missed it too eve said she hates that and if belle skinner was eavesdropping from the second bedroom she wasnt snuggled up with the commander in the master was she no connubial bliss which is interesting and no alibi what motive would skinner have for killing one of his own bodyguards something to think about i want to check some things out she stopped the elevator so both darcia and peabody could exit ill get back to you being willing to fall into step with darcia angelo didnt mean she couldnt make some lateral moves of her own if she was going to wade into a murder investigation off her own turf without her usual system and when her badge was little more than a fashion accessory she was going to make use of whatever tools were available there was one particular tool she knew to be very versatile and flexible she was married to him she found roarke as shed expected to at work on the bedroom computer hed removed his dinner jacket rolled up his sleeves there was a pot of coffee beside him what have you got she picked up his cup gulped down half his coffee nothing that links me or any of my business dealings with skinner i have some interests in atlanta naturally naturally communications electronics entertainment real estate of course he took the cup back from her idly rubbed her ass with his free hand and during one lovely interlude previous to my association with you a nicely profitable smuggling enterprise federal infractions infractions she repeated one could say nothing that bumped up against state or local authorities then youre missing something because its personal with him it doesnt make any sense otherwise youre not a major bad guy now youve hurt my feelings why does he latch on to you she demanded ignoring him fifty years a cop hed have seen it all and hed have lost plenty there are stone killers out there pedophiles sexual predators cannibals for christs sake so why are you stuck in his craw hes been retired from active what six years and seven seven then seven years and he approaches me with what could be considered a bribe or blackmail depending on your point of view to pressure me into rolling over on you it was arrogant and illconceived she thought it through as she paced i dont think he expected it to work i think he expected me to tell him to fuck off that way he could roll us into a ball together and shoot two for one he cant touch you or me for that matter he can make things hot by implicating us in a homicide and hes laying the groundwork he pushes my buttons in a public venue then gets one of his monkeys to get in my face altercation ensues a couple hours later monkey has his brains splattered all over the stairway of a roarke enterprises hotel and whats this why its a clue sherlock and a dandy one too a star stud from one of roarke securities uniforms floating in the victims blood not particularly subtle he doesnt have time to be subtle hes in a hurry she continued i dont know why but hes rushing things shove circumstantial evidence down the throat of the local authorities and theyve got to pursue the possibility that the irritated husband and suspected interplanetary hoodlum ordered one of his own monkeys to teach skinners a lesson you touched my wife now i have to kill you roarkes shrug was elegant and careless overdramatic overromanticized particularly since you punched him in the face before i could ride to the rescue in his narrow little world men are the hunters the defenders it plays when you look at it through his window its another miscalculation though because its not your style you want the hell beat out of someone you do it yourself he smiled at her fondly i like watching you do it even more darling she spared him a look standard testing on you any profile would kick the theory out of the park youre just not hardwired to pay somebody to kill or to get your dick in a twist because somebody hassles me we could have mira run you through a level one testing just to push that aside no thank you darling more coffee she grunted paced a bit more while he rose to go to the mini autochef for a fresh pot and cups its a sloppy frame thing is skinner believes youre capable and that if he dumps enough on the ile if and when they take over hell push you into an investigative process that will mess you up and me by association lieutenant the ile has investigated me in the past they dont worry me what does is that if it goes that far your reputation and career could take some bruises i wont tolerate that i think the commander and i should have a chat and what do you think hes counting on she demanded why disappoint him coffee cup in hand he sat on the arm of his chair ive compiled personal and professional data on skinner nothing seems particularly relevant to this but i havent studied his case files in depth yet eve set down the coffee hed just poured her with a little snap of china on wood case files you hacked into his case files are you a lunatic he gets wind of that youre up on charges and in lockup before your fancy lawyers can knot their fancy ties he wont get wind of it compuguard she broke off scowled at the bedroom unit compuguard monitored all etransmissions and programming onplanet or off though she was aware roarke had unregistered equipment at home the hotel system was a different matter are you telling me this units unregistered absolutely not his expression was innocent as a choirboys its duly registered and meets all legal requirements or did until a couple of hours ago you cant filter out compuguard in a few hours roarke sighed heavily shook his head first you hurt my feelings now you insult me i dont know why i put up with this abuse then he moved fast grabbing her up hauling her against him and crushing her mouth with a kiss so hot she wondered if her lips were smoking oh yes he released her picked up his coffee again thats why if that was supposed to distract me from the fact that youve illegally blocked compuguard and broken into official data it was a damn good try but the jokes on you i was going to ask you to dig up the data were you really lieutenant you never fail to surprise me they beat him until his bones were dust her tone was flat dull all cop they erased half his face and left the other half clean so id know as soon as i saw him the minute he stepped in front of me tonight he was dead i was the goddamn murder weapon she looked back at the computer so lets get to work o o they culled out cases during skinners last decade of active duty and crossreferenced with anything relating to them during the seven years of his retirement it overlapped the time before roarke had come to america from ireland but it seemed a logical place to start as the caseload was enormous they split it eve worked on the bedroom unit and roarke set up in the second bedroom by three eves temples were throbbing her stomach raw from caffeine intake and shed developed a new and reluctant admiration for commander skinner damn good cop she acknowledged thorough focused and up until his retirement he had apparently dedicated himself body and soul to the job how had it felt to step away from all that she wondered it had been his choice after all at sixtyfour retirement was an option not a requirement he could have easily put in another ten years on active he might have risen to commissioner instead hed put in his fifty and then used that as a springboard in a run for congress and had fallen hard on his face a half century of public service hadnt been enough to offset views so narrow even the most dugin of the conservative party had balked added to that his platform had swung unevenly from side to side he was an unwavering supporter of the gun ban something the conservatives tried to overturn at every opportunity yet he beat the drum to reinstate the death penalty which alienated the liberals from midroad to far left he wanted to dissolve legal and regulated prostitution and strike out all legal and tax benefits for cohabitating couples he preached about the sanctity of marriage as long as it was heterosexual but disavowed the government stipend for professional mothers motherhood the gospel according to skinner stated was a godgiven duty and payment in its own right his mixedvoice and muddled campaign had gone down in flames however much hed rebounded financially via lectures books and consults eve imagined he still bore the burns of that failure still she couldnt see how roarke tied into it rubbing her forehead she pushed away and got up to work out the kinks maybe she was overreacting did she want it to be personal for skinner because hed made it personal for her maybe roarke was no more than a symbol for skinner someone who had slipped and slid around the system that skinner himself had dedicated his life to she checked her wrist unit maybe shed catch some sleep go back to it fresh in the morning she would juggle the data first though so that when she looked at it again it would be in a new pattern whatever she was missing and her gut still told her she was missing something might float to the top computer extrapolate any and all references to roarke she yawned hugely shook her head to clear it in any and all files personal and professional under skinner commander douglas working list references chronologically first to last um give me official police records first followed by personal files understood working no reference to roarke under skinner commander douglas police records reference under skinner captain douglas only extrapolating personal files yeah well you keep saying that but eve whirled around stared at the monitor computer stop list any and all reference to roarke under skinner douglas any rank working first listed reference in skinner captain douglas case file c to roarke patrick aka ohara sean aka macneil thomas date stamped march twelve twentythirtysix subject roarke suspect in illegal weapons running illegal entry into united states grand theft auto and conspiracy to murder of police officers subject believed to have fled atlanta area and subsequently the country last known residence dublin ireland case file complete investigative data available do you wish full case file yes in hard copy working eve sat down again slowly as the computer hummed she thought twentythree years ago roarke would have been what twelve thirteen it wasnt roarke that was at the root of skinners obsession it was roarkes father o o at his own unit roarke ran through layers of skinners financials among the most clearcut motives for murder were greed revenge jealousy sex fear of disgrace and profit so hed follow the money first there was a possibility hed decided that skinner had invested in one of his companies or a competitors perhaps hed lost a substantial amount of money men had hated men for less and financially skinner had taken a beating during his run for congress it had left him nearly broke as well as humiliated roarke hmm he held up a finger to hold eve off as she came into the room communications he said i have an interest in the atlanta media sources and they were very unkind to skinner during his congressional attempt this would have weighed heavily against his chances of winning media network link is mine outright and they were downright vicious accurate but vicious added to that hes invested fairly heavily in corday electronics based in atlanta my own company has eroded their profits and customer base steadily for the last four years i really should finish them off with a takeover he added as an afterthought roarke yes he reached around absently to take her hand as he continued to scroll data it goes deeper than politics and stock options twentythree years ago illegal arms dealers set up a base in atlanta and skinner headed up the special unit formed to take them down they had a weasel on the inside and solid information but when they moved in it was a trap weasels turn both ways and we all know it she took a deep breath hoping she was telling it the way it should be told love twisted her up as often maybe more often than it smoothed things out for her thirteen cops were killed she continued six more wounded they were outgunned but despite it skinner broke the cartels back the cartel lost twentytwo men mostly soldiers and he bagged two of the top line that night that led to two more arrests in the next twelve months but he lost one he was never able to get his hands on one darling i mightve been precocious but at twelve id yet to run arms unless youre counting a few handhelds or homemade boomers sold in alleyways and i hadnt ventured beyond dublin city as for weaseling thats something ive never stooped to no she kept staring at his face not you and watched his eyes change darken and chill as it fell into place for him well then he said very softly son of a bitch chapter five as a boy roarke had been the favored recipient of his fathers fists and boots hed usually seen them coming and had avoided them when possible lived with them when it wasnt to his knowledge this was the first time the old man had sucker punched him from the grave still he sat calmly enough reading the hard copy of the reports eve had brought him he was a long way from the skinny battered boy who had run the dublin alleyways though he didnt care much for having to remind himself of it now this double cross went down a couple of months before my father ended up in the gutter with a knife in his throat apparently someone beat skinner to him he has that particular unsolved murder noted in his file here perhaps he arranged it i dont think so she wasnt quite sure how to approach roarke on the subject of his father and his boyhood he tended to walk away from his past whereas she well she tended to walk into the wall of her own past no matter how often how deliberately she changed directions why do you say that look eve it isnt the same for me as it is for you you neednt be careful he doesnt haunt me tell me why if my father slipped through skinners fingers in atlanta skinner wouldnt arrange to have his throat slit in dublin city first he was a cop not an assassin theres no record in the file that hed located his target in dublin theres correspondence with interpol with local irish authorities he was working on extradition procedures should his target show up on irish soil and would likely have gotten the paperwork and the warrant thats what hed have wanted she continued and rose to prowl the room hed want the bastard back on his own turf back where it went down and his men were killed hed want that facetoface he didnt get it she turned back if hed gotten it he couldve closed the book moved on and he wouldnt be compelled to go after you youre whats left of the single biggest personal and professional failure of his life he lost his men and the person responsible for their loss got away from him dead wouldnt be enough without arrest trial and sentencing no it wouldnt and here you are rich successful famous and married for christs sake to a cop i dont need mira to draw me a profile on this one skinner believes that perpetrators of certain crimes including any crime that results in the death of a police official should pay with their life after due process your father skipped out on that one youre here you pay then hes doomed to disappointment for a number of reasons one im a great deal smarter than my father was he rose went to her skimmed a finger down the dent in her chin and my cop is better than skinner ever hoped to be i have to take him down i have to fuck over fifty years of duty and take him down i know and would suffer for it roarke thought as skinner never would as skinner could never understand we need to sleep he said and pressed his lips to her brow o o she dreamed of dallas and the frigid filthy room in texas where her father had kept her she dreamed of cold and hunger and unspeakable fear the red light from the sex club across the street flashed into the room over her face and over his face as he struck her she dreamed of pain when she dreamed of her father the tearing of her young flesh as he forced himself into her the snapping of bone her own high thin scream when he broke her arm she dreamed of blood like roarkes her father had died by a knife but the one that had killed him had been gripped in her own eightyearold hand in the big soft bed in the plush suite she whimpered like a child beside her roarke gathered her close and held her until the dream died o o she was up and dressed by six the snappy jacket that had ended up in her suitcase fit well over her harness and weapon the weight of them made her feel more at home she used the bedroom link to contact peabody at least she assumed the lump under the heap of covers was peabody whaa wake up eve ordered i want your report in fifteen minutes who jesus peabody get up get dressed get here why dont i order up some breakfast roarke suggested when she broke transmission fine make it for a crowd im going to spread a little sunshine and wake everybody up she hesitated i trust my people roarke and i know how much i can tell them i dont know angelo he continued to read the morning stock reports onscreen she works for me so one way or the other does every third person in the known universe that tells me nothing what was your impression of her sharp smart solid and ambitious so was mine he said easily or she wouldnt be chief of police on olympus tell her what she needs to know my fathers unfortunate history doesnt trouble me will you talk to mira she kept her gaze level as he rose turned toward her i want to call her in i want a consult will you talk to her i dont need a therapist eve im not the one with nightmares he cursed softly ran a hand through his hair when her face went blank and still sorry bloody hell but my point is we each handle things as we handle them and you can push and nudge and find ways to smooth it over for me but i cant do that for you the temper in her voice alleviated a large slice of his guilt over mentioning her nightmare screen off he ordered and crossed to her took her face in his hands let me tell you what i once told mira not in a consult not in a session you saved me eve he watched her blink in absolute shock what you are what i feel for you what we are together saved me he kept his eyes on hers as he kissed her call your people ill contact darcia he was nearly out of the room before she found her voice roarke she never seemed to find the words as he did but these came easy we saved each other o o there was no way she could make the huge elegant parlor feel like one of the conference rooms in cop central especially when her team was gorging on cream pastries strawberries the size of golf balls and a couple of pigs worth of real bacon it just served to remind her how much she hated being off her own turf peabody update peabody had to jerk herself out of the image of the good angel on her shoulder sitting with her hands properly folded and the bad angel who was stuffing another cream bun in her greedy mouth ah sir autopsy was completed last night they let morris assist cause of death multiple trauma most specifically the skull fracture a lot of the injuries were postmortem hes booked on a panel this morning and has some sort of dead doctors seminar later today but morris will finesse copies of the reports for you early word is the tox screen was clear sweepers eve demanded sweepers reports werent complete as of ohsixhundred however what i dug up confirmed your beliefs sealit traces on the bat no blood or bodily fluid but the victims found on scene no uniform missing an epaulet star has been found to date angelos teams doing the run on recylers valets outside cleaning companies my information is the uniforms are coded with the individuals id number when we find the uniform well be able to trace the owner i want that uniform eve stated and when she turned to feeney the bad angel won peabody took another pastry had to be an inside job on the security cameras he said nobody gets access to control without retina and palm scans and code clearance the bypass was complicated and it was done slick twelve people were in the control sector during the prime period last night im running them all right we look for any connection to skinner any workrelated reprimands any sudden financial increase look twice if any of them were on the job before going into private security she took a disk off the table passed it to feeney run them with the names on here no problem but i work better when i know why im working those are the names of cops who went down in the line of duty in atlanta twentythree years ago it was skinners operation she took a deep breath roarkes father was his weasel and he turned a double cross when feeney only nodded eve let out a breath one of the names on there is thomas weeks father to reginald weeks our victim my guess is if skinner had one of his slain officers kids on his payroll hes got others follows if one was used to build a frame around roarke another would be feeney added she checked her wrist unit when the door buzzer sounded thatll be angelo i want you running those names feeney so im not giving them to her yet but im going to tell her and you the rest of it o o while eve was opening the door for darcia skinner opened his to roarke a moment of your time commander i have little to spare then we wont waste it roarke stepped inside lifted a brow at hayes the man stood just behind and to the right of skinner and had his hand inside his suit jacket if you thought i was a threat you shouldve had your man answer the door youre no threat to me then why dont we have that moment in private anything you say to me can be said in front of my personal assistant very well it wouldve been tidier and certainly more efficient if youd come after me directly instead of using lieutenant dallas and sacrificing one of your own men so you admit you had him killed i dont order death were alone skinner and im sure youve had these rooms secured against recording devices and surveillance cameras you want to take me on then do it but have the balls to leave my family out of it skinners lips peeled back over his teeth your father was a dickless coward and a pathetic drunk duly noted roarke walked to a chair sat there you see we already have a point of agreement on that particular matter first let me clarify that by family i meant my wife second i must tell you youre being too kind regarding patrick roarke he was a vicious smallminded bully and a petty criminal with delusions of grandeur i hated him with every breath i took so you see i resent quite strongly resent being expected to pay for his many sins ive plenty of my own so if you want to try to put my head on a platter just pick one well work from there do you think because you wear a tenthousanddollar suit i cant smell the gutter on you color began to flood skinners face but when hayes stepped forward skinner gestured him back with one sharp cut of the hand youre the same as he was worse because he didnt pretend to be anything other than the useless piece of garbage he was blood tells it may have once youve made a joke out of the law and now you hide behind a woman and a badge shes shamed slowly now roarke got to his feet you know nothing of her shes a miracle that i cant and wouldnt explain to the likes of you but i can promise you i hide behind nothing you stand there with fresh blood on your hands behind your shield of blind righteousness and your memories of old glory your mistake skinner was in trusting a man like my father to hold a bargain and mine it seems was thinking youd deal with me so heres a warning for you he broke off as hayes shifted fast as a rattler roarke drew a hand laser out of his pocket take your bloody hand out of your coat while you still have one youve no right no authority to carry and draw a weapon roarke stared at skinners furious face then grinned what weapon on your belly hayes hands behind your head do it he ordered when hayes shot skinner a look even on low these things give a nasty little jolt he lowered the sight to crotch level especially when they hit certain sensitive areas of the anatomy though his breathing was now labored skinner gestured toward hayes to the warning you step back from my wife step well and cleanly back or youll find the taste of me isnt to your liking will you have me beat to death in a stairwell youre a tedious man skinner roarke said with a sigh as he backed to the door flaming tedious id tell your men to have a care how they strut around and finger their weapons this is my place o o despite its size eve found the living area of the suite as stifling as a closed box if she were on a case like this in new york she would be on the streets cursing at traffic as she fought her way to the lab to harass the techs letting her mind shuffle possibilities as she warred with rapid cabs on the way to the morgue or back into central the sweepers would tremble when she called demanding a final report and the asses she would kick on her way through the investigation would be familiar this time around darcia angelo got to have all the fun peabody go down and record skinners keynote since hes playing the show must go on and giving it on schedule yes sir the morose tone had eve asking what i know why youre leaning toward him for this dallas i can see the angles but i just cant adjust the pattern for them hes a legend some cops go wrong because the pressure breaks them inside or because of the temptations or just because they were bent that way to begin with he never went wrong its an awful big leap to see him tossing aside everything hes stood for and killing one of his own to frame roarke for something that happened when roarke was a kid come up with a different theory ill listen if you cant do the job peabody tell me now youre on your own time here i can do the job her voice was as stiff as her shoulders as she started for the door i havent been on my own time since i met you eve set her teeth as the door slammed and was already formulating the dressingdown as she marched across the room mira stopped her with a word eve let her go you have to appreciate her position its difficult being caught between two of her heroes oh for christs sake sit before you wear a rut in this lovely floor youre in a difficult position as well the man you love the job that defines you and another man who you believe has crossed an indelible line i need you to tell me if he could have crossed that line i know what my gut tells me what the pattern of evidence indicates its not enough i have data on him most of its public domain but not all she waited a beat while mira simply continued to study her calm as a lake im not going to tell you how i accessed it im not going to ask you i already know quite a bit about douglas skinner he is a man devoted to justice his own vision of it one who has dedicated his life to what the badge stands for one who has risked his life to serve and protect very much like you that doesnt feel like much of a compliment right now there is a parting of the ways between you a very elemental one hes compelled has always been compelled to spread his vision of justice like some are compelled to spread their vision of faith you eve at your core stand for the victim he stands for his vision over time that vision has narrowed some can become victims of their own image until they become the image hes lost the cop inside the hype cleanly said peabodys view of him is held by a great many people a great many in law enforcement its not such a leap psychologically speaking for me to see him as becoming so obsessed by a mistake and the mistake was his own that cost the lives of men in his command that that failure becomes the hungry monkey on his back the man whos dead wasnt street scum he was a young employee one with a clean record with a wife the son of one of skinners dead thats the leap im having trouble with dr mira was the monkey so hungry that skinner could order the death of an innocent man just to feed it if he could justify it in his mind yes ends and means how worried are you about roarke he doesnt want me to worry about him eve answered i imagine hes much more comfortable when he can worry about you his father was abusive to him yeah hes told me pieces of it the old man knocked hell out of him drunk or sober eve dragged a hand through her hair walked back toward the window there was barely a hint of sky traffic how she wondered did people stand the quiet the stillness he had roarke running cons picking pockets then hed slap him around if he didnt bring home enough i take it his father wasnt much good at the rackets because they lived in a slum his mother i dont know he says he doesnt know either it doesnt seem to matter to him she turned back sat down across from mira can that be can it really not matter to him what his father did to him or that his mother left him to that he knows his father started him on the path of lets say circumventing the law that he has a predisposition for violence he learned how to channel it as you did he had a goal to get out to have means and power he accomplished that then he found you he understands where he came from and i imagine its part of his pride that he became the kind of man a woman like you would love and knowing his profile mira said with a smile i imagine hes determined to protect you and your career in this matter every bit as much as youre determined to protect him and his reputation i dont see how realization hit and eve was just getting to her feet when roarke walked in the door goddamn it goddamn it roarke you went after skinner chapter six good morning dr mira roarke closed the door behind him then walked over to take miras hand the move was as smooth as his voice and his voice smooth as cream can i get you some more tea no her lips twitched as she struggled to control a chuckle thanks but i really have to be going im leading a seminar right after the keynote session dont think you can use her as a shield i told you to stay away from skinner thats the second time someones accused me of hiding behind a woman today though his voice remained mild eve knew the edge was there its getting annoying you want annoying eve began youll have to forgive her roarke said to mira as he walked her to the door eve tends to become overexcited when i disobey shes worried about you mira said under her breath well shell have to get over it have a good session he nudged mira out the door closed it locked it turned the edge was visible now i dont need a fucking shield that was a figure of speech and dont change the subject you went at skinner after i told you to stay clear of him i dont take orders from you eve im not a lapdog youre a civilian she shot back and youre a consultant on someone elses case and your authority here in my bloody world is a courtesy she opened her mouth closed it hissed then she turned on her heel strode out through the terrace doors and kicked the railing several times feel better now yes because i imagined it was your stupid rockhard head she didnt look back but braced her hands on the railing and looked out over what was indeed one of roarkes worlds it was lavish and extravagant the slick spears of other hotels the tempting spreads of casinos theaters the glitter of restaurants were all perfectly placed there were fountains the silver ribbons of people glides and the lush spread of parks where trees and flowers grew in sumptuous profusion she heard the click of his lighter caught the scent of his obscenely expensive tobacco he rarely smoked these days she thought if youd told me it was important for you to have a facetoface with skinner id have gone with you im aware of that oh christ men look you dont need to hide behind me or anybody youre a tough badass son of a bitch with a really big penis and balls of titanium steel okay he cocked his head one minute im imagining throwing you off the balcony yes he nodded took a long drag on the cigarette thats indeed better if skinner took a couple of pops at your ego its because he knew it was a good target thats what cops do why dont you just tell me what happened he made it clear while hayes stood there with a hand inside his coat and on his weapon that my father was garbage and by association so am i and that it was long past time for my comeuppance so to speak did he say anything that led to him ordering weeks killed on the contrary he twice pointed the finger at me full of barely restrained fury and seething emotion you could almost believe he meant it i dont think hes well roarke continued and crushed out his cigarette temper put a very unhealthy color in his face strained his breathing ill have to take a pass through his medical records i want to take a pass at his wife angelo agreed after some minor complaints to set it up so we can doubleteam her later this afternoon meanwhile peabodys on skinner between us well track down the uniform and feeneys running names somebody on your security staff worked that bypass we find out who we link them back to skinner and get them into interview we change the complexion of this maybe put it away before ile comes in she glanced back toward the suite as the link beeped are we okay now we seem to be good maybe thats angelo with the setup for belle skinner she moved past roarke to the link rather than darcias exotic face feeneys droopy one blipped on screen might have something for you here zita vinter hotel security she was in control between twentyonethirty and twentythree hundred last night crossed her with your list popped to vinter detective carl atlanta cop under skinner line of duty during the botched bust vinters wife was pregnant with their second kid a son marshall born two months after his death older kid was five daughter zita bullseye what sector is she in now she didnt come in today didnt call in either according to her supervisor got her home address want me to ride with you she started to agree then looked back at roarke no i got it see what else you can find on her okay maybe you can tag peabody when the keynote craps over shes good at digging background details owe you one feeney let me have the address after shed ended transmission eve hooked her thumbs in her front pockets and looked at roarke you wouldnt know where athena boulevard might be would you i might be able to find it yes i bet she picked up her palmlink from the desk stuck it in her pocket im not riding in a limo to go interview a suspect its unprofessional bad enough im taking some civilian wearing a fancy suit with me then ill just have to come up with some alternate transportation while youre at it dig up your file on zita vinter security sector he drew out his palm pc as they started out always a pleasure to work with you lieutenant yeah yeah she stepped into the private elevator while he ordered something called a gf brought to a garage slot technically i should contact angelo and update her no reason you cant once were on the way no reason saves time this way thats your story darling and well stick to it vinter zita he began as she scowled at him twentyeight two years with atlanta psd then into private security she worked for one of my organizations in atlanta clean work record promoted to a level over two years ago she put in for the position here six months ago shes single lives alone lists her mother as next of kin her employment jackets clean when did you contract for this convention deal just over six months ago he said as they stepped off into the garage it was one of the incentives to have several of the facilities complete how much do you want to bet skinners kept in close contact with his dead detectives daughter over the years angelo finesses a warrant for vinters link records were going to find transmissions to and from atlanta and not just to her mother when he stopped put his pc away she stared what the hell is this roarke ran a hand over the sleek chrome tube of the jetbike alternate transportation it looked fast and it looked mean a powerful silver bullet on two silver wheels she continued to stare as roarke offered her a crash helmet safety first get a grip on yourself with all your toys i know damn well youve got something around here with four wheels and doors this is more fun he dropped the helmet onto her head and im forced to remind you that part of this little interlude was meant to be a bit of a holiday for us he took a second helmet put it on then tidily fastened hers this way you can be my biker bitch when she showed her teeth he only laughed and swung a leg nimbly over the tube and i mean that in the most flattering way possible why dont i pilot and you can be my biker bitch maybe later swearing she slid onto the bike behind him he glanced back at her as she adjusted her seat cupped her hands loosely at his hips hang on he told her he shot like a rocket out of the garage and her arms latched like chains around his waist lunatic she shouted as he blasted into traffic her heart flipped into her throat and stayed there while he swerved threaded streaked it wasnt that she minded speed she liked to go fast when she was manning the controls there was a blur of color as they careened around an island of exotic wildflowers a stream of motion when they rushed by a people glide loaded with vacationers grimly determined to face her death without blinking she stared at the snag of vehicular traffic dead ahead felt the boost of thrusters between her legs dont you she could only yip and try not to choke on her own tongue as he took the jetbike into a sharp climb wind screamed by her ears as they punched through the air shortcut he shouted back to her and there was laughter in his voice as he brought the bike down to the road again smooth as icing on cake he braked in front of a blindingly white building shut off all engines well then it doesnt come up to sex but its definitely in the top ten in the grand scheme he swung off removed his helmet do you know how many traffic violations you racked up in the last four minutes whos counting he pulled off her helmet then leaned down to bite her bottom lip eighteen she informed him pulling out her palm link to contact darcia angelo she scanned the building as she relayed a message to darcias voice mail clean almost brutally clean well constructed from the look of it tasteful and likely expensive what do you pay your security people a level they crossed the wide sidewalk to the buildings front entrance about twice what a new york police lieutenant brings in annually with a full benefit package of course what a racket she waited while they were scanned at the door and roarke coded in his master the requisite computer voice welcomed him and wished him a safe and healthy day the lobby was tidy and quiet really an extended foyer with straight lines and no fuss at the visitors panel eve identified herself and requested zita vinter im sorry dallas lieutenant eve ms vinter does not respond would you care to leave a message at this time no i dont care to leave a message at this time this is police business clear me into apartment sixb im sorry dallas lieutenant eve your credentials are not recognized on this station and do not allow this system to bypass standard privacy and security regulations how would you like me to bypass your circuits and stuff your motherboard up your warning verbal threats toward this system may result in arrest prosecution and monetary fines up to five thousand credits before eve could spit out a response roarke clamped a hand on her shoulder this is roarke he laid his hand on the palm plate id level a youre ordered to clear me and lieutenant dallas to all areas of this compound identification verified roarke and companion dallas eve are cleared lieutenant eve said between her teeth as roarke pulled her toward an elevator dont take it personally level six he ordered damn machine treated me like a civilian the insult of it was almost beyond her comprehension a civilian irritating isnt it he strolled off onto the sixth floor you enjoyed that didnt you that roarke and companion shit i did yes immensely he gestured sixb when she said nothing he rang the buzzer himself she didnt answer before shes not going to answer now no he dipped his hands lightly in his pockets technically i suppose you need to ask chief angelo to request a warrant for entry technically eve agreed i am however the owner of this building and the womans employer doesnt give you any right to enter her apartment without legal authority or permission he simply stood smiled waited do it eve told him welcome to my world roarke keyed in his master code then hummed when the lock light above the door remained red well well she appears to have added a few touches of her own blocked the master code im afraid thats a violation of her lease agreement eve felt the little twist in her gut and slipped her hand under her jacket to her weapon get in neither questioned that whatever methods had been taken he could get around them through them he took a small case of tools out of his pocket and removed the antiintruder panel on the scanner and identification plate clever girl shes added a number of tricky little paths here this will take a minute eve took out her link and called peabody track down angelo she ordered were at athena boulevard sixb she needs to get over here i want you with her yes sir what should i tell her to get here she dropped the link back in her pocket stepped back to roarke just as the lock lights went green move aside she ordered and drew her weapon ive been through a door with you before lieutenant he took the hand laser out of his pocket and ignored her snarl when she spotted it you prefer low as i recall since there wasnt any point in biting her tongue or slapping at him for carrying she did neither on my count she put a hand on the door prepared to shove it open wait he caught the faint hum and the sound sent his heart racing the panel lights flashed red as he yanked eve away from the door they went down in a heap his body covering hers she had that one breathless second to understand before the explosion blasted the door outward a line of flame shot into the air roaring across the hall where theyd been standing seconds before alarms screamed and she felt the floor beneath her tremble at a second explosion felt the blast of vicious heat all over her jesus jesus she struggled under him slapped violently at the smoldering shoulder of his jacket with her bare hands youre on fire here water spewed out of the ceiling as he sat up stripped off the jacket are you hurt no she shook her head shoved the hair soaked with the flood of the safety sprinklers out of her face ears are ringing some where are you burned her hands were racing over him as she pushed up to her knees im not the suits fucked is all here now were fine he glanced back at the scarred and smoldering hole that had been the doorway but im afraid im going to have to evict sixb though she doubted it was necessary eve kept her weapon out as she picked her way over still smoking chunks of wall and door smoke and wet clogged the air in the hall in the apartment but she could see at one glance that the explosion had been smaller than shed assumed and very contained a little paint and youre back in business the explosion was set to blow the door and whoever was outside it there were bits of broken crockery on the floor and a vase of flowers had fallen over spilling water into the rivers already formed by the sprinkler system the furniture was sodden the walls smeared with streaks from smoke and soot the hallway walls were a dead loss but otherwise the room was relatively undamaged ignoring the shouts and voices from outside the apartment he moved through it with eve zita was in bed her arms crossed serenely across her chest holstering her weapon eve walked to the bed used two fingers to check for the pulse in the womans throat shes dead chapter seven your definition of cooperation and teamwork apparently differs from mine lieutenant wet filthy and riding on a vicious headache eve strained while darcia completed her examination of the body i updated you no you left a terse message on my voice mail darcia straightened with her sealed hands she lifted the bottle of pills on the nightstand bagged them when you were apparently at the point of illegally entering this unit property owner or his representative has the right to enter a private home if there is reasonable cause to believe a life or lives may be in danger or that said property is threatened dont quote your regulations at me darcia snapped you cut me out eve opened her mouth then blew out a long breath okay i wouldnt say i cut you out but i did an end run around you in your place id be just as pissed off im used to being able to pursue a line on an investigation in my own way on my own time you are not primary on this case i want this body bagged and removed darcia ordered the uniforms flanking the bedroom doors probable cause of death voluntary selftermination wait a minute wait a minute wait eve ordered throwing out a hand to warn the uniforms back this isnt selftermination i see an unmarked body reclining in bed hair neatly brushed cosmetic enhancements unblemished i see on the bedside table a glass of white wine and a bottle of pills prescribed for use in painless gentle selftermination i have here she continued holding up another evidence bag containing a single sheet of paper a note clearly stating the subjects intention to end her own life due to her guilt about her part in the death of reginald weeks a death she states was ordered by roarke and for which she was paid fifty thousand in cash i see a satchel containing that precise amount of cash on the dresser roarke didnt order anyones murder perhaps not but i am accustomed to pursuing a line on an investigation in my own way on my own time she tossed eves words back at her commander skinner has lodged a complaint claiming that roarke threatened him this morning with words and a weapon security disks at the hotel verify that roarke entered the commanders suite and remained there for seven minutes fortythree seconds this incident is corroborated by one bryson hayes skinners personal assistant who was present at the time there was no point in kicking something again and pretending it was roarkes head skinners in this up to his armpits and if you let him deflect your focus onto roarke youre not as smart as i thought first things first youre standing over a homicide chief angelo the second one skinners responsible for darcia ordered her men away by pointing her finger explain to me how this is homicide and why i shouldnt have you taken to the first transport and removed from this station why i should not on the evidence at hand take roarke in for interview as a suspect in the murder of reginald weeks temper pumped into her voice now hot and sharp and let me make this clear your husbands money pays my salary it doesnt buy me eve kept her focus on darcia peabody as she waited for her aide to come to the room eve struggled with her own temper sir what do you see ah sir female late twenties medium build no sign of struggle or distress she broke off as eve took an evidence bag from darcia passed it over standard barb commonly used in selftermination prescription calls for four units all are missing date on the bottle is two weeks ago prescribed and filled in atlanta georgia eve nodded when she saw the flicker in darcias eyes then handed peabody the note apparently suicide note with signature computergenerated the statement therein is contradictory to other evidence very good peabody tell chief angelo how it contradicts well lieutenant most people dont have selftermination drugs tucked in their med cabinets unless youre suffering from an incurable and painful illness it takes several tests and legalities to access the drug darcia held up a hand all the more reason to have them around no sir maam darcia corrected with a smirk at eve in my country a female superior is addressed as maam yes maam it may be different in your country as to the process of accessing this sort of drug in the states you have to register if you havent that is if youre still alive within thirty days of filling the prescription youre on autorecall the drugs are confiscated and youre required to submit to psychiatric testing and evaluation but besides that it doesnt play keep going peabody eve told her the note claims she decided to off herself because she was guilty over events that took place last night but she already had the drug in her possession why and how you established time of death at ohfourhundred this morning so she got her payoff and the guilts awful close then the means to selfterminate just happen to be in her possession its way pat if you follow me she paused and when darcia nodded a goahead pulled in a breath and kept going added to that it doesnt follow that she would rig her apartment door to an explosive or set another in the surveillance area to destroy the security disks of the building added to that peabody continued obviously enjoying herself now roarkes profile is directly opposed to hiring out hits especially since dallas popped the guy which is one of the things he admires about her so when you add that all up it makes that note bogus and this unattended death becomes a probable homicide peabody eve dabbed an imaginary tear from her eye you do me proud darcia looked from one to the other her temper was still on the raw side which she could admit colored her logic or had perhaps officer peabody you could now explain how person or persons unknown gained access to this unit and persuaded this trained security expert to take termination drugs without her struggling well ill take over now eve patted her shoulder you dont want to blow your streak person or persons unknown were admitted to the unit by the victim most likely to pay her off or to give her the next stage of instructions the termination drugs were probably mixed into the wine person or persons unknown waited for her to slip into the first stage of the coma at which time she was carried in here laid out nice and pretty the note was generated the stage set when it was determined that victim was dead the explosives were rigged and person or persons unknown went on their merry way she sort of sees it peabody added helpfully not like a psychic or anything she just walks it through with the killer really mag okay peabody she was a tool eve continued no more no less the same as weeks was a tool she probably joined the force to honor her father and he used that just as hes using roarkes father to get to him they dont mean anything to him as people as flesh and blood theyre just steps and stages in his twentythreeyear war maybe not tools then darcia countered but soldiers to some generals they are just as dispensable excuse us officer peabody if you please yes maam sir i want an apology she saw eve wince and smiled yes i know itll hurt so i want one not for pursuing a line of investigation and so on for not trusting me ive known you less than twentyfour hours eve began then winced again all right shit i apologize for not trusting you and ill go one better for not respecting your authority accepted im going to have the body taken to the me as a probable homicide your aide is very well trained shes good eve agreed since peabody wasnt around to hear and get bigheaded about it and getting better i missed the date the significance and i shouldnt have i believe i would have seen these things once my annoyance with you had ebbed a bit but thats beside the point now i need to question roarke regarding his conversation with the commander this morning and regarding his association with zita vinter to keep my official records clean you are not included in this interview i would appreciate it however if youd remain and lead my team through the examination of the crime scene no problem ill keep this as brief as i can as i imagine both you and roarke would like to go back and get out of those damp dirty clothes she tugged the sleeve of eves jacket as she passed that used to be very attractive o o she was easier on me than idve been on her eve admitted as she rolled the stiffness out of her shoulders shed hit the floor under roarke harder than shed realized and figured she should take a look at the bruises after a long hot shower since roarkes response to her statement was little more than a grunt as they rode up to their suite she took his measure he could use some cleaning up himself she thought hed ditched the ruined jacket and the shirt beneath it had taken a beating she wondered if her face was as dirty as his as soon as we clean up she began as she stepped out of the elevator and into the parlor and that was as far as she got before she was pressed up against the elevator doors with his mouth ravaging hers half her brain seemed to slide out through her ears whoa what another few seconds with his hands gripping her shoulders and his eyes hot he looked down at her we wouldnt be here we are here thats right he jerked the jacket halfway down her arms savaged her neck thats damn right now lets prove it he stripped the jacket away ripped her shirt at the shoulder i want my hands on you yours on me they already were she tugged and tore at his ruined shirt and because her hands were busy used her teeth on him less than a foot inside the room they dragged each other to the floor she rolled with him fighting with the rest of his clothes then arching like a bridge when his mouth clamped over her breast need deep and primal gushed through her until she moaned his name it was always his name she wanted more more to give more to take her fingers dug into him hard muscle damp flesh the scent of smoke and death smothered under the scent of him so that it filled her with the fevered mix of love and lust that he brought to her he couldnt get enough it seemed he never could or would all of the hungers the appetites and desires hed known paled to nothing against the need he had for her for everything she was the strength of her physical and that uniquely tensile morality enraptured him challenged him to feel that strength tremble under him open for him merge with him was the wonder of his life her breathing was short shallow and he heard it catch release on a strangled gasp when he drove her over the first peak his own blood raged as he crushed his mouth to hers again and plunged inside her all heat and speed and desperation the sound of flesh slapping sliding against flesh mixed with the sound of ragged breathing she heard him murmuring something the language of his youth so rarely used slid exotically around her name the pressure of pleasure built outrageously inside her a glorious burn in the blood as he drove her past reason with deep hard thrusts she clung clung to the edge of it then his eyes were locked on hers wild and blue love all but swamped her come with me his voice was thick with ireland come with me now she held on and on watching those glorious eyes go blind held on and on while his body plunged in hers then she let go and went with him o o sex eve had discovered could when it was done right benefit body mind and spirit she hardly bitched at all about having to dress up to meet with belle skinner at a ladies tea her body felt loose and limber and while the dress roarke handed her didnt fit her image of cop the weapon she snugged on under the long fluid jacket made up for it are you intending to blast some of the other women over the watercress sandwiches and petit fours he asked you never know she looked at the gold earrings he held out shrugged then put them on while im swilling tea and browbeating belle skinner you can follow up on a hunch for me do some digging see if hayes was connected to any of the downed cops under skinners command during the botched bust something there too close for employer employee relations all right shoes she stared at the needlethin heels and flimsy straps is that what you call them how come guys dont have to wear death traps like those i ask myself that same question every day he took a long scan after shed put them on lieutenant you look amazing feel like an idiot how am i supposed to intimidate anyone dressed in this gear im sure youll manage ladies tea she grumbled on the way out i dont know why angelo cant just haul the woman in to her cop shop and deal dont forget your rubber hose and ministunner she smirked over her shoulder as she stepped onto the elevator bite me already did o o the tea was already under way when eve walked in women in flowy dresses and some jesus in hats milled about and gathered under arbors of pink roses or spilled out onto a terrace where a harpist plucked strings and sang in a quavery voice that instantly irritated eves nerves tiny crustless sandwiches and pink frosted cakes were arranged on clear glass platters shining silver pots steamed with tea that smelled to eve entirely too much like the roses at such times she wondered how women werent mortified to be women she tracked down peabody first and was more than slightly amazed to see her stalwart aide decked out in a swirly flowered dress and a broadbrimmed straw hat with trailing ribbons jeez peabody you look like a what is it milkmaid or something thanks dallas great shoes shut up run down mira i want her take on skinners wife the two of you hang close while angelo and i talk to her mrs skinners out on the terrace angelo just walked in wow shes got some great dna eve glanced back nodded to angelo the chief had chosen to wear cool white but rather than flowing the dress clung to every curve on the terrace eve told her how do you want to play it subtly lieutenant subtles my style eve lifted her brows i dont think so interview style darcia said and breezed onto the terrace she stopped poured tea then strolled to the table where belle was holding court lovely party mrs skinner i know we all want to thank you for hosting this event such a nice break from the seminars and panels its important to remember that were women not just wives mothers career professionals absolutely i wonder if lieutenant dallas and i might have a private word with you we wont take up much of your time she laid a hand on the shoulder of one of the women seated at the table subtle eve thought and effective as the woman rose to give darcia her chair i must tell you how much i enjoyed the commanders keynote this morning darcia began so inspiring it must be very difficult for him and you to deal with the convention after your tragic loss douglas and i both believe strongly in fulfilling our duties and responsibilities whatever our personal troubles poor reggie she pressed her lips together its horrible even being a cops wife for half a century you never get used to the shock of violent death how well did you know weeks eve asked loss and shock and sorrow arent connected only to personal knowledge lieutenant belles voice went cool but i knew him quite well actually douglas and i believe in forming strong and caring relationships with our employees likes angelo eve thought hates me okay then i guess being full of shock and sorrow is the reason you eavesdropped from your bedroom instead of coming out when we notified commander skinner that one of his security team had been murdered belles face went very blank and still i dont know what youre intimating im not intimating im saying it straight out you were in the spare room not the master with the commander i know you were awake because your light was on you heard us relay the information but despite this close personal relationship you didnt come out to express your shock and loss why is that mrs skinner dallas im sure mrs skinner has her reasons darcia put a light sting of censure in her voice then turned a sympathetic smile to belle im sorry mrs skinner the lieutenant is quite naturally on edge just now theres no need for you to apologize chief angelo i understand and sympathize to an extent lieutenant dallass desire to defend and protect her husband is that what youre doing eve tossed back how far would you go how many close personal relationships are you willing to sacrifice or didnt you have one with zita vinter zita belles shoulders jerked as if from a blow what does zita have to do with any of this you knew her shes our godchild of course i knew every ounce of color drained out of the lovely face so that the expertly applied enhancements stood out like paint on a doll whats happened shes dead eve said flatly murdered early this morning a few hours after weeks dead dead belle got shakily to her feet upending her teacup as she floundered for balance i cant i cant talk to you now want to go after her darcia asked when belle rushed from the terrace no lets give her time to stew shes scared now over what she knows and what she doesnt know she looked back at darcia we had a pretty good rhythm going there i thought so but i imagine playing the insensitive argumentative cop comes naturally to you just like breathing lets blow this tea party and go get a drink eve signaled to peabody and mira just us girls chapter eight in the bar in a wide plush booth eve brooded over a fizzy water shed have preferred the good hard kick of a zombie but she wanted a clear head more than the jolt youve got a smooth sympathetic style she said to darcia i think shell talk to you if you stay in that channel so do i dr mira here shes got the same deal youd be able to doubleteam her eve glanced toward mira who was sipping white wine she was shocked and shaken mira began first shell verify the information about the death of her godchild when she does grief will tangle with the shock so shell be even more vulnerable to the right questions presented in the right style youre a cold one dallas darcia said i like that about you id be very agreeable to interviewing belle skinner with dr mira if that suits the doctor im happy to help i imagine you intend to talk to skinner again eve with the chiefs permission dont start being polite now darcia told her youll ruin your image he wont want to talk to you she went on whatever his feelings toward you were before my impression is after his keynote hes wrapped you and roarke together he hates you both he brought us up at his keynote not by name but by intimation his inspiring rather cheerleadertype speech took a turn at the midway point he went into a tangent on cops who go bad who forget their primary duties in favor of personal comforts and gains gestures body language darcia shrugged it was clear he was talking about this place luxury palaces built on blood and greed i believe he said and you bedfellows of the wicked he got very worked up about it almost evangelical while there were some who appeared enthusiastic and supportive of that particular line of thought it seemed to me the bulk of the attendees were uncomfortable embarrassed or angry he wants to use his keynote to take slaps at me and roarke it doesnt worry me but eve noticed peabody staring down into her glass peabody i think hes sick she spoke quietly finally lifted her gaze physically mentally i dont think hes real stable it was hard to watch it happen this morning he started out sort of well eloquent then it just deteriorated into this rant ive admired him all my life it was hard to watch she repeated a lot of the cops who were there stiffened up you could almost feel layers of respect peeling away he talked about the murder some how a young promising man had become a victim of petty and soulless revenge how a killer could hide behind a badge instead of being brought to justice by one pretty pointed eve decided a lot of the terrestrial cops walked out then so hes probably a little shaky now himself ill take him eve said peabody you track down feeney see what other details you can dig out on the two victims and anyone else onsite whos connected with the bust in atlanta that fly with you chief angelo darcia polished off her wine it does o o eve detoured back to the suite first she wanted a few more details before questioning skinner again she never doubted roarke had already found them he was on the link when she got there talking to his head of hotel security restless eve wandered out onto the terrace and let her mind shuffle the facts the evidence the lines of possibilities two dead both victims fathers martyred cops and those connected to roarkes father and to skinner murdered in a world of roarkes making on a site filled with police officials it was so neat it was almost poetic a setup from the beginning it wasnt a crime of impulse but something craftily coldly planned weeks and vinter had both been sacrifices pawns placed and discarded for the greater game a chess game all right she decided black king against white and her gut told her skinner wouldnt be satisfied with a checkmate he wanted blood she turned as roarke stepped out in the end destroying you wont be enough hes setting you up step by step for execution a lot of weapons on this site he keeps the pressure on piles up the circumstantial so theres enough appearance that you might have ordered these hits all he needs is one soldier willing to take the fall im betting hayes for that one skinner doesnt have much time to pull it off no he doesnt roarke agreed i got into his medical records a year ago he was diagnosed with a rare disorder its complicated but the best i can interpret it sort of nibbles away at the brain treatment yes there are some procedures hes had two quietly at a private facility in zurich it slowed the process but in his case hes had complications a strain on the heart and lungs another attempt at correction would kill him he was given a year he has perhaps three months of that left and of that three months two at the outside where hell continue to be mobile and lucid hes made arrangements for selftermination thats rough eve slipped her hands into her pockets there was more she could see it in roarkes eyes something about the way he watched her now it plays into the rest this one events been stuck in his gut for decades he wants to clear his books before he checks out whatevers eating at his brain has probably made him more unstable more fanatic and less worried about the niceties he needs to see you go down before he does what else what is it i went down several more layers in his case file on the bust his followups his notes he believed hed tracked my father before hed slipped out of the country again skinner used some connections it was believed that my father headed west and spent a few days among some nefarious associates in texas in dallas eve her stomach clenched and her heart tripped for several beats its a big place it doesnt mean the timings right he walked to her ran his hands up and down her arms as if to warm them your father and mine petty criminals searching for the big score you were found in that dallas alley only a few days after skinner lost my fathers trail again youre saying they knew each other your father and mine im saying the circles too tidy to ignore i nearly didnt tell you he added resting his forehead on hers give me a minute she stepped away from him leaned out on the rail stared out over the resort but she was seeing that cold dirty room and herself huddled in the corner like an animal blood on her hands he had a deal going she said quietly some deal or other i think he wasnt drinking as much and it was worse for me when he wasnt good and drunk when he came back and he had some money well she took a deep breath well it plays out do you know what i think tell me i think sometimes fate cuts you a break like it says okay youve had enough of that crap so its time you fell into something nice see what you make out of it she turned back to him then were making something out of it whatever they were to us or to each other its what we are now that counts darling eve i adore you then youll do me a favor keep yourself scarce for the next couple of hours i dont want to give skinner any opportunities i need to talk to him and he wont talk if youre with me agreed with one condition you go wired he took a small jeweled pin from his pocket attached it to her lapel ill monitor from here its illegal to record without all parties knowledge and permission unless you have proper authorization is it really he kissed her thats what you get for bedding down with bad companions heard about that did you just as i heard that a large portion of your fellow cops walked out of the speech your reputation stands lieutenant i imagine your seminar tomorrow will be packed my shit i forgot im not thinking about it she muttered on the way out not thinking about it o o she slipped into the conference room where skinner was leading a seminar on tactics it was some relief to realize shed missed the lecture and had come in during the questionandanswer period there were a lot of long looks in her direction as she walked down the side of the room and found a seat halfway from the back she scoped out the setup skinner on stage at the podium hayes standing to his back and his right at attention two other personal security types on his other side excessive she thought and obviously so the message was that the location the situation posed personal jeopardy for skinner but he was taking precautions and doing his job very neat she raised her hand and was ignored five questions passed until she simply got to her feet and addressed him and as she rose she noted hayes slide a hand inside his jacket she knew every cop in the room caught the gesture the room went dead quiet commander skinner a position of command regularly requires you to send men into situations where loss of life civilian and departmental is a primary risk in such cases do you find it more beneficial to the operation to set personal feelings for your men aside or to use those feelings to select the team every man who picks up a badge does so acknowledging he will give his life if need be to serve and protect every commander must respect that acknowledgment personal feelings must be weighed in order to select the right man for the right situation this is a matter of experience and the accumulation through years and that experience of recognizing the best dynamic for each given op but personal feelings ie emotional attachments private connections friendships or animosities must never color the decision so as commander youd have no problem sacrificing a close personal friend or connection to the success of the op his color came up and the tremor she had noticed in his hand became more pronounced sacrificing lieutenant dallas a poor choice of words cops arent lambs being sent to slaughter not passive sacrifices to the greater good but active dedicated soldiers in the fight for justice soldiers are sacrificed in battle acceptable losses no loss is acceptable his bunched fist pounded the podium necessary but not acceptable every man who has fallen under my command weighs on me every child left without a father is my responsibility command requires this and that the commander be strong enough to bear the burden and does command in your opinion require restitution for those losses it does lieutenant there is no justice without payment for the children of the fallen and for the children of those who escaped the hand of justice in your opinion blood speaks to blood his voice began to rise and to tremble if you were more concerned with justice than with your own personal choices you wouldnt need to ask the question justice is my concern commander it appears we have different definitions of the term do you think your goddaughter was the best choice for this operation does her death weigh on you now or does it balance the other losses youre not fit to speak her name youve whored your badge youre a disgrace dont think your husbands money or threats will stop me from using all my influence to have that badge taken from you i dont stand behind roarke any more than he stands behind me she kept talking as hayes stepped forward and laid a hand on skinners shoulder i dont stand on yesterdays business two people are dead here and now thats my priority commander justice for them is my concern hayes stepped in front of skinner the seminar is over commander skinner thanks you for attending and regrets lieutenant dallass disruption of the questionandanswer period people shuffled rose eve saw skinner leaving flanked by the two guards ask me someone commented near her these seminars could use more fucking disruptions she made her way toward the front and came up toe to toe with hayes ive got two more questions for the commander i said the seminars over and sos your little show she felt the crowd milling around them some edging close enough to hear you see thats funny i thought i came in on the show does he run it hayes or do you commander skinner is a great man great men often need protection from whores a cop moved in poked hayes on the shoulder youre gonna want to watch the namecalling man thanks eve acknowledged him with a nod ive got it dont like play cops calling a badge a whore he stepped back but he hovered while youre protecting the great man eve continued you might want to remember that two of his frontline soldiers are in the morgue is that a threat lieutenant hell no its a fact hayes just like its a fact that both of them had fathers who died under skinners command what about your father furious color slashed across his cheekbones you know nothing of my father and you have no right to speak of him just giving you something to think about for some reason i get the feeling that im more interested in finding out who put those bodies in the morgue than you or your great man and because i am i will find out before this show breaks down and moves on that ones a promise chapter nine if she couldnt get to skinner eve thought shed get to skinners wife and if angelo and peabody hadnt softened and soothed enough that was too fucking bad damned if she was going to tiptoe around weepy women and dying men then have to turn the case over to the interplanetary boys it was her case and she meant to close it she knew that part of her anger and urgency stemmed from the information roarke had given her his father hers skinner and a team of dead cops skinner was right about one thing she thought as she headed for his suite blood spoke to blood the blood of the dead had always spoken to her her father and roarkes had both met a violent end that was all the justice she could offer to the badges lost so many years before but there were two bodies in cold boxes for those whatever theyd done she would stand she knocked waited impatiently it was darcia who opened the door and sent eve an apologetic little wince shes a mess darcia whispered miras patting her hand letting her cry over her goddaughter its a good foundation but we havent been able to build on it yet any objections to me giving the foundation a shake darcia studied her pursed her lips we can try it that way but i wouldnt shake too hard she shatters were back to square one with her with a nod eve stepped in mira was on the sofa with belle and was indeed holding her hand a teapot cups and countless tissues littered the table in front of them belle was weeping softly into a fresh one mrs skinner im sorry for your loss eve sat in a chair by the sofa leaned into the intimacy she kept her voice quiet sympathetic and waited until belle lifted swollen redrimmed eyes to hers how can you speak of her your husbands responsible my husband and i were nearly blown to bits by an explosive device on zita vinters apartment door a device set by her killer follow the dots who else had cause to kill zita thats what we want to find out she sabotaged the security cameras the night weeks was murdered i dont believe that belle balled the tissue into her fist zita would never be a party to murder she was a lovely young woman caring and capable and devoted to your husband why shouldnt she be belles voice rose as she got to her feet he stepped in when her father died gave her his time and attention helped with her education hed have done anything for her and she for him belles lips quivered and she sat again as if her legs quivered as well she would never be a party to murder he would never ask it of her maybe she didnt know maybe she was just asked to deal with the cameras and nothing else mrs skinner your husbands dying eve saw belle jerk shudder he doesnt have much time left and the loss of his men is preying on him as he prepares for death can you sit there and tell me his behavior over the last several months has been rational i wont discuss my husbands condition with you mrs skinner do you believe roarkes responsible for something his father did something this man did when roarke was a child three thousand miles away she watched tears swim into belles eyes again and leaned in pressed the man used to beat roarke half to death for sport do you know what it feels like to be hit with fists or a stick or whatever the hells handy and by the person whos supposed to take care of you by law by simple morality do you know what its like to be bloody and bruised and helpless to fight back no the tears spilled over no does that child have to pay for the viciousness of the man the sins of the fathers belle began then stopped no wearily she wiped her wet cheeks no lieutenant i dont believe that but i know what it has cost my husband what happened before what was lost i know how its haunted him this good good man this honorable man who has dedicated his life to his badge and everything it stands for he cant exorcise his ghosts by destroying the son of the man who made them you know that too he would never harm zita or reggie he loved them as if they were his own but she turned to mira again gripped her hands fiercely hes so ill in body mind spirit i dont know how to help him i dont know how long i can stand watching him die in stages im prepared to let him go because the pain sometimes its so horrible and he wont let me in he wont share the bed with me or his thoughts his fears its as if hes divorcing me bit by bit i cant stop it for some death is a solitary act mira said gently intimate and private its hard to love someone and stand aside while they take those steps alone he agreed to apply for selftermination for me belle sighed he doesnt believe in it he believes a man should stand up to whatever hes handed and see it through im afraid hes not thinking clearly any longer there are moments she steadied her breathing and looked back at eve there are rages swings of mood the medication may be partially responsible hes never shared the job with me to any great extent but i know that for months now perhaps longer roarke has been a kind of obsession to him as have you you chose the devil over duty she closed her eyes a moment im a cops wife lieutenant i believe in that duty and i see it all over you he would see it too if he werent so ill i swear to you he didnt kill reggie or zita but they may have been killed for him belle mira offered her another tissue you want to help your husband to ease his pain tell lieutenant dallas and chief angelo what you know what you feel no one knows your husbands heart and mind the way you do itll shatter him if he has to face this itll destroy him fathers and sons she said softly then buried her face in the tissue oh dear god hayes it clicked for eve like a link on a chain hayes didnt lose a father during the bust hes commander skinners son a single indiscretion tears choked belles voice when she lifted her head again during a bump in a young marriage and so much of it my fault my fault she repeated turning her pleading gaze to mira i was impatient and angry that so much of his time his energies went into his work id married a cop but i hadnt been willing to accept all that that meant all it meant to a man like douglas it isnt easy to share a marriage with duty mira poured more tea particularly when duty is what defines the partner you were young yes gratitude spilled into belles voice as she lifted her cup young and selfish and ive done everything in my power to make up for it since i loved him terribly and wanted all of him i couldnt have that so i pushed and prodded then i stepped away from him all or nothing well hes a proud man and i was stubborn we separated for six months and during that time he turned to someone else i cant blame him for it and she got pregnant eve prompted yes he never kept it from me he never lied or tried to hide it from me hes an honorable man her tone turned fierce when she looked at eve does hayes know of course of course he knows douglas would never shirk his responsibilities he provided financial support we worked out an arrangement with the woman and she agreed to raise the child and keep his paternity private there was no point no point at all in making the matter public and complicating douglass career shadowing his reputation so you paid for his indiscretion youre a hard woman arent you lieutenant no mistakes in your life no regrets plenty of them but a child a man might have some problem being considered a mistake a regret douglas has been nothing but kind and generous and responsible with bryson hes given him everything everything except his name eve thought how much would that matter did he give him orders to kill mrs skinner orders to frame roarke for murder absolutely not absolutely not but bryson is perhaps hes overly devoted to douglas in the past several months douglas has turned to him too often and perhaps when bryson was growing up douglas set standards that were too high too harsh for a young boy hayes would need to prove himself to his father yes brysons hard lieutenant hard and coldblooded youd understand that i think douglas hes ill and his moods his obsession with what happened all those years ago is eating at him as viciously as his illness does ive heard him rage as if theres something else inside him and during the rage he said something had to be done some payment made whatever the cost that there were times the law had to make room for blood justice death for death i heard him talking with bryson months ago about this place that roarke had built it on the bones of martyred cops that he would never rest until it and roarke were destroyed that if he died before he could avenge those who were lost his legacy to his son was that duty pick him up eve swung to darcia have your people pick hayes up already on it darcia answered as she switched on her communicator he doesnt know belle got slowly to her feet or hes not allowing himself to know douglas is convinced that roarkes responsible for whats happened here convinced himself that youre part of it lieutenant his mind isnt what it was hes dying by inches this will finish him have pity she thought of the dead and thought of the dying ask yourself what he would have done mrs skinner if he were standing in my place now dr mira will stay with you she headed out with darcia waited until they were well down the hall there should be a way to separate him from skinner before we bag him take him quietly darcia called for the elevator youre some ruthless hardass arent you dallas if skinner didnt give him a direct order theres no point in smearing him with hayes or making the arrest while hes around christ hes a dead man already she snapped when darcia said nothing whats the fucking point of dragging him into it and destroying half a century of service none i can request another interview with skinner draw him away far enough for you to make the collar youre giving up the collar darcia asked in a shocked voice as they stepped onto the elevator it was never mine the hell it wasnt but ill take it darcia added cheerfully howd you click to the relationship between skinner and hayes fathers the case is lousy with them you got one a father doesnt everyone depends on your point of view she stepped off the car on the main lobby level im going to round up peabody give you a chance to coordinate your team she checked her wrist unit fifteen minutes ought to well well look whos holding court in the lobby lounge darcia tracked studied the group crowded at two tables skinner looks to have recovered his composure the man likes an audience it probably pumps him up more than his meds we could play it this way we go over and i apologize for disrupting the seminar distract skinner get him talking you tell hayes youd like to have a word with him about weeks dont want to disturb skinner with routine questions and blah blah can you take him on your own darcia gave her a bland stare could you okay then lets do it quick and quiet they were halfway across the lobby when hayes spotted them two beats later he was running goddamn it goddamn it hes got cop instincts circle that way eve ordered then charged the crowd she vaulted the smooth gold rail that separated the lounge from the lobby people shouted spilled back glassware crashed as a table overturned she caught a glimpse of hayes as he swung through a door behind the bar she leaped the bar ignoring the curses of the servers and patrons bottles smashed and there was a sudden heady scent of topgrade liquor her weapon was in her hand when she hit the door with her shoulder the bar kitchen was full of noise a cook droid was sprawled on the floor in the narrow aisle its head jerking from the damage done by the fall she stumbled over it and the blast from hayess laser sang over her head rather than right herself she rolled and came up behind a stainlesssteel cabinet give it up hayes where are you going to go there are innocent people in here drop your weapon nobodys innocent he fired again and the line of heat scored across the floor and finished off the droid this isnt what your father wants he doesnt want more dead piling up at his feet theres no price too high for duty a shelf of dinnerware exploded beside her showering her with shards screw this she sent a line of fire over her head rolled to the left she came up weapon first and cursed again as she lost the target around a corner someone was screaming someone else was crying keeping low she set off in pursuit she turned toward the sound of another blast and saw a fire erupt in a pile of linens somebody take care of that she shouted and turned the next corner saw the exit door shit hed blasted the locks effectively sealing it in frustration she rammed it gave it a couple of solid kicks and didnt budge it an inch holstering her weapon she made her way back out the mess and smoke without much hope she ran through the lobby out the main doors to scan the streets by the time shed made it to the corner darcia was heading back lost him son of a bitch he had a block and a half on me darcia jammed her own weapon home id never have caught him on foot in these damn shoes ive got an apb out well net the bastard fucker smelled the collar furious with herself eve spun in a circle i didnt give him enough credit he knocked some people around in the bar kitchen offed a droid started a fire hes fast and smart and slick and hes goddamn mean on top of it well net him darcia repeated damn right we will chapter ten lieutenant eve winced turned and watched roarke walk toward her guess you heard we had a little incident i believe ill just see to some damage control humor cut through the anger on darcias face excuse me are you hurt roarke asked eve no but youve got a dead droid in the bar kitchen i didnt kill it in case youre wondering there was a little fire too but i didnt start it the ceiling damage thats on me and some of the you know breakage and stuff i see he studied the elegant facade of the hotel im sure the guests and the staff found it all very exciting the ones who dont sue me should enjoy telling the story to their friends and relations for quite some time since ill be contacting my attorneys to alert them to a number of civil suits heading our way perhaps youd take a moment to fill me in on why i have a dead droid a number of hysterical guests screaming staff and a little fire in the bar kitchen sure why dont we round up peabody and feeney then i can just run through it once no i think id like to know now lets just have a bit of a walk he took her arm i dont have time to make it he led her around the hotel through the side gardens the patio cafe wound through one of the pool areas and into a private elevator while he listened to her report so your intentions were to spare skinners feelings and reputation didnt work out but yeah to a point hayes made us first glance the minute she was in the suite she popped open a bottle of water glugged until that moment she hadnt realized the smoke had turned her throat into a raw desert of thirst shouldve figured it now hes in the wind and thats on me too he wont get off the station no he wont get off but he might take it in mind to do some damage while hes loose ill need to look at the maps and plats for the resort well do a computer analysis earmark the spots hed be most likely to go to ground ill take care of that i can do it faster he said before she could object you need a shower you smell of smoke she lifted her arm sniffed it yeah i guess i do since youre being so helpful tag peabody and feeney will you i want this manhunt coordinated o o too many places for him to hide an hour later eve scowled at the wall screens and the locations the computer had selected im wondering too if he had some sort of backup transpo in case this turned on him someone hes bribed to smuggle him offsite if he gets off this station he could go any fucking where i can work with angelo on running that angle down feeney said and some emaneuvering can bog down anything scheduled to leave the site for a good twentyfour hours good thinking keep in touch okay will do he headed out rattling a bag of almonds roarke knows the site best hell take me around to the specified locations well split them up with angelos team do i coordinate from here peabody asked not exactly i need you to work with mira make sure skinner and his wife stay put and report if hayes contacts them then theres this other thing yes sir peabody looked up from her memo book if we dont bag him tonight youll have to cover for me in the morning cover for you ive got the notes and whatever in here eve tossed her ppc into peabodys lap notes peabody stared at the little unit in horror your seminar oh no sir uhuh dallas im not giving your seminar just think of yourself as backup eve suggested roarke she walked to the door and through it leaving peabody sputtering just how much dont you want to give that seminar tomorrow roarke wondered i dont have to answer that until ive been given the revised miranda warning eve rolled her shoulders and would have sworn she felt weight spilling off them sometimes things just work out perfect dont they ask peabody that in the morning with a laugh she stepped into the elevator lets go hunting o o they hit every location even overlapping into angelos portion it was a long tedious and exacting process later she would think that the operation had given her a more complete view of the scope of roarkes pet project the hotels casinos theaters restaurants the shops and businesses the houses and buildings the beaches and parks the sheer sweep of the world hed created was more than shed imagined while impressive it made the job at hand next to impossible it was after three in the morning when she gave it up for the night and stumbled to bed well find him tomorrow his face is on every screen onsite the minute he tries to buy any supplies well tag him he has to sleep he has to eat so do you in bed roarke drew her against him turn it off lieutenant tomorrows soon enough he wont go far her voice thickened with sleep he needs to finish it and get his fathers praises legacies bloody legacies i spent my life running from mine i know roarke brushed the top of her head with his lips as she fell into sleep so have i this time it was he who dreamed as he rarely did of the alleyways of dublin of himself a young boy too thin with sharp eyes nimble fingers and fast feet a belly too often empty the smell of garbage gone over and whiskey gone stale and the cold of the rain that gleefully seeped into bone he saw himself in one of those alleyways staring down at his father who lay with that garbage gone over and smelled of that whiskey gone stale and smelled too of death the blood and the shit that spewed out of a man at his last moments the knife had still been in his throat and his eyes filmedover blue were open and staring back at the boy hed made he remembered quite clearly speaking well now you bastard someones done for ya and here i thought it would be me one day who had the pleasure of that without a qualm hed crouched and searched through the pockets for any coin or items that might be pawned or traded thered been nothing but then again there never had been much hed considered briefly taking the knife but hed liked the idea of it where it was too much to bother hed stood then at the age of twelve with bruises still fresh and aching from the last beating those dead hands had given him and hed spat and hed run o o he was up before she was as usual eve studied him as she grabbed her first cup of coffee it was barely seven am you look tired he continued to study the stock reports on one screen and the computer analysis of potential locations on another do i i suppose i couldve slept better when she crouched in front of him laid a hand on his thigh he looked at her and sighed she could read him well enough he thought his cop just as he could read her and her worry for him i wonder he began and i dont care to who did me the favor of sticking that knife in him someone i think who was part of the cartel hed have been paid you see and there was nothing in his pockets not a fucking punt or pence on him nor in the garbage hole we lived in so theyd have taken it whatever he hadnt already whored or drank or simply pissed away does it matter who not so very much no but it makes me wonder he nearly didnt say the rest but simply having her listen soothed him he had my face i forget that most times remember that ive made myself myself but christ i have the look of him she slid into his lap brushed her hands through his hair i dont think so and kissed him weve made each other in the end havent we darling eve two lost souls into one steady unit guess we have its good he stroked his cheek against hers and felt the fatigue wash away very good she held on another minute then drew back thats enough sloppy stuff ive got work to do when its done why dont we get really sloppy you and i i can get behind that she rose to contact darcia and get an update on the manhunt not a sign of him anywhere eve told roarke then began to pace feeney took care of transpo nothings left the station weve got him boxed in but its a big box with lots of angles i need skinner nobodys going to know him as well as skinner hayes is his son roarke reminded her do you think hed help you depends on how much cop is left in him come with me she said he needs to see us both he needs to deal with it o o he looked haggard eve thought his skin was gray and pasty how much was grief how much illness she didnt know the combination of the two she imagined would finish him but she noted hed put on a suit and he wore his precinct pin in the lapel he brushed aside with some impatience his wifes attempt to block eve stop fussing belle lieutenant his gaze skimmed over roarke but he couldnt make himself address the man i want you to know ive contacted my attorneys on hayess behalf i believe you and chief angelo have made a serious error in judgment no you dont commander youve been a cop too long i appreciate the difficulty of your position but hayes is the prime suspect in two murders in sabotage in a conspiracy to implicate roarke in those murders he injured bystanders while fleeing and caused considerable property damage he also fired his weapon at a police officer hes currently evading arrest theres an explanation yes i believe there is hes picked up his fathers banner commander and hes carrying it where i dont think you intended it to go you told me yesterday no losses are acceptable did you mean it the pursuit of justice often in the course of duty we he looked helplessly at his wife belle i never meant reggie zita have i killed them no no she went to him quickly wrapped her arms around him and he seemed to shrink into her its not your fault its not your doing if you want justice for them commander help me where would he go what would he do next i dont know do you think i havent agonized over it through the night he hasnt slept belle told her he wont take his pain medication he needs to rest i confided in him skinner continued i shared my thoughts my beliefs my anger i wanted him to carry on my mission not this way skinner sank into a chair not this way but i beat the path i cant deny that your father killed for sport for money for the hell of it he said to roarke he didnt even know the names of the people he murdered i look at you and see him you grew out of him i did roarke nodded and everything ive done since has been in spite of him you cant hate him as much as i can commander no matter how hard you try youll never reach my measure of it but i cant live on that hate and im damned if ill die on it will you ive used it to keep me alive these past months skinner looked down at his hands its ruined me my son is a thorough man hell have a back door someone inside wholl help him gain access to the hotel hell need it to finish what he started assassinate roarke no lieutenant payment would be dearer than that its you hell aim for he lifted a hand to a face that had gone clammy to take away what his target cherishes most when he hissed in pain eve stepped forward you need medical attention commander you need to be in the hospital no hospitals no health centers try to take him alive dallas i want him to get the help he needs you have to go belle stepped in he cant take any more of this ill send dr mira even as eve spoke skinner slumped in the chair hes unconscious roarke instinctively loosened skinners tie his breathings very shallow dont touch him let me belle jerked back as her eyes met roarkes she took a long deep breath im sorry could you help me please take him into his bedroom if youd call for dr mira lieutenant dallas id be grateful o o his bodys wearing down eve said once skinner was settled in the bedroom with mira in attendance maybe its better all around if he goes before we take hayes his body was already worn down roarke corrected but hes let go of his reason to live theres nothing to do but leave him to mira the computer didnt think hayes would come back to the hotel skinner does im going with skinner hayes wants me and he knows skinners on borrowed time so he has to move fast she checked her wrist unit looks like im going to give that damn seminar after all and make yourself a target with plenty of shield well coordinate your security people and angelos and pluck him like a goose if he tries for a hit here she started out pulling a borrowed communicator out of her pocket then drew her weapon as she saw hayes step out of the stairway door at the end of the corridor stop she pounded after him when he ducked back into the stairwell get to security eve shouted at roarke track him roarke shoved through the door ahead of her the weapon in his hand was illegal no you track him since cursing was a waste of time she raced down the stairs with him subject sighted she called through the communicator as they streaked down the stairs heading down southeast stairwell now between floors twentyone and twenty moving fast consider subject armed and dangerous she clicked the communicator off before she spoke to roarke dont kill him dont fire that thing unless theres no choice a blast hit the landing seconds before their feet such as now roarke commented but it was eve who fired leaning over the railing and turning the steps below into rubble caught in midstride hayes tried to swing back bolt for the door but his momentum skewed his balance he went down hard on the smoking broken steps and angelo shoved through the door weapon gripped in both hands trying to take my collar dallas all yours eve stepped down onto the weapon that had flown out of hayess hand two people dead for what she asked hayes was it worth it his mouth and his leg were bleeding he swiped at the blood on his chin while his eyes burned into hers no i shouldve been more direct i shouldve just blown you to hell right away and watched the bastard you fuck bleed over you that wouldve been worth everything knowing hed live with the kind of pain his father caused the commander couldve died at peace knowing id found his justice i wanted to give him more did you give weeks or vinter a choice eve demanded did you tell them they were going to die for the cause command isnt required to explain they honored their fathers as i honor mine theres no other choice you signaled weeks to move in on me and he didnt have a clue what it was going to cost him you had vinter sabotage the cameras and when she realized why you killed her they were necessary losses justice requires payment you were going to be my last gift to him you in a cage he said to roarke you in a coffin he smiled at eve when he said it why arent you giving your seminar lieutenant why the hell arent you where youre scheduled to be i had a conflict of she shot to her feet oh god peabody she charged through the door and out into the corridor what floor what floor this way roarke grabbed her hand pulled her toward the elevator down to four he said well head left second door on the right takes us behind the stage area explosives he likes explosives she dragged out her communicator again as she willed the elevator to hurry shes turned hers off son of a bitch any officer any officer clear conference room d immediately clear the area of all personnel possible explosive device alert explosive division clear that area now she was through the door and streaking to the left i sent her there was all she could think and i smirked about it oh god please there was a roaring in her ears that was either her own rush of blood the noise of the audience or the shouted orders to clear but she spotted peabody standing behind the podium and leaped the three steps on the side of the stage leaped again the minute her feet hit the ground and hitting her aide midbody shot them both into the air and into a bruised and tangled heap on the floor she sucked in her breath then lost it again as roarke landed on top of her the explosion rang in her ears sent the floor under her shaking she felt the mean heat of it spew over her like a wave that sent the three of them rolling in one ball toward the far edge of the stage debris rained over them some of it flaming dimly she heard running feet shouts and the sizzling hiss of a fire for the second time in two days she was drenched with the spray of overhead sprinklers are you all right roarke said in her ear yeah yeah peabody coughing eyes stinging with smoke eve eased back saw her aides pale face glassy eyes you okay think so she blinked cept youve got two heads dallas and one of thems roarkes its the prettiest and i think youve really gained some weight she smiled vaguely and passed out got herself a nice concussion eve decided then turned her head so her nose bumped roarkes you are pretty though now get the hell off me this is seriously undignified absolutely lieutenant while the medtechs tended to peabody and the explosives division cordoned off the scene eve sat outside the conference room and drank the coffee some unnamed and beloved soul had handed her she was soaked to the skin filthy had a few cuts a medley of bruises she figured her ears might stop ringing by christmas but all in all she felt just fine youre going to have a few repairs on this dump of yours she told roarke just cant take you anywhere can i she smiled then got to her feet as darcia approached hayes is in custody hes waived his right to attorney my opinion hell end up in a facility for violent offenders mental defectives hes not going to serve time in a standard cage hes warped if its any consolation he was very disappointed to hear you arent splattered all over whats left of that stage in there cant always get what you want hell of a way to skate out of giving a workshop though have to hand it to you whatever works sobering darcia turned we beat interplanetary deadline thanks i wont say anytime ill have a full report for your files by the end of the day she said to roarke i hope your next visit is less complicated she added it was an experience watching you in action chief angelo im confident olympus is in good hands count on it you know dallas you look like you could use a nice resort vacation she shot out that brilliant smile see you around shes got a smart mouth ive got to admire that im going to check on peabody she began then stopped when she saw mira coming toward her hes gone mira said simply he had time to say goodbye to his wife and to ask me to tell you that he was wrong blood doesnt always tell i witnessed the termination he left life with courage and dignity he asked me if you would stand in the way of his departmental service and burial what did you tell him i told him that blood doesnt always tell character does im going back to his wife now tell her im sorry for her loss and that law enforcement has lost one of its great heroes today mira leaned over to kiss eves cheek smiling when eve squirmed you have a good heart and clear vision roarke added when mira walked away clear vision to see through the dreck and the shadows to the core of the man nobody gets through life without fucking up he gave fifty years to the badge it wasnt all what it shouldve been but it was fifty years anyway she shook off sentiment ive got to check on peabody roarke took her hand kissed it well go check on peabody then well talk about that nice resort vacation in a pigs eye she thought she was going home as soon as humanly possible the streets of new york were resort enough for her
