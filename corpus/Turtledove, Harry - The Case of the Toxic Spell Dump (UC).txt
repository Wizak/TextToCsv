i i hate telephones for one thing they have a habit of waking you up at the most inconvenient times it was still dark outside when the one on my nightstand went off like a bomb i groaned and tried to turn off the alarm clock since it wasnt ringing it laughed at me the horrible racket from the phone kept right on what time is it anyhow i mumbled my mouth tasted like something youd spread on nasturtiums its the clock said still giggling the horological demon in there was supposed to be friendly not sappy id thought more than once about getting the controlling cantrip fixed but twentyfive crowns is twentyfive crowns on a government salary you leam to put up with things harry turtledove i picked up the receiver that was the cue for the noise elemental in the base of the phone to shut up which it did ma bells magic unlike that from a cheap dock company does exactly what its supposed to do no more no less fisher here i said hoping i didnt sound as far underwater as i felt hello david this is kelly back in dsfcc you could have fooled me after the imp in one phones mouthpiece relays words through the ether to the one in an other phones earpiece and the second imp passes them on to you they hardly sound as if they came from a real person let alone from anyone in particular thats the other reason i hate phones but the cursed things have sprouted like toadstools the past ten years ever since ectoplasmic doning let the phone company crank out legions of nearidentical speaker imps and since switching spells got sophisticated enough so you could reliably select the imp you wanted from among those legions they say the re going to have an answer to the voice problem real soon theyve been saying that since the day af ter phones were invented ill believe it when i hear it some things are even bigger than ma bell nondescript voice aside i was willing to believe his was charlie kelly hed probably just got to his desk at environmental perfection agency headquarters back in the district of st columba so of course hed picked up the phone threehour time difference they dont think that way in dsfcc the sun revolves around them not the other way round st ptolemy of alexandria has to be the patron of the place no matter what the church says all this flashed through my mind in as much of a hurry as i could muster at on a tuesday morning i dont think i missed a beat or not more than one anyhow before i said so what can i do for you this fine day charlie the insulating spell on the phone mouthpiece kept me from having to listen to my imp shouting crosscountry to his imp i waited for his answer we have reports that there might a problem in your neck of the woods worth an unoffi cial look or two case of the toxic spell dump whereabouts in my neck of the woods i asked patiently easterners who live in each others pockets have no feel for how spread out angels city really is the pause that followed was longer than conversations between phone imps would have required charlie had to be checking a map or a report or something at last he said ifs in a place called chatsworth thats just an angels city dis trict name isnt it he made it sound as if it were just around the comer from me it wasnt sighing i answered its up in st ferdinands valley charlie thats about forty maybe fifty miles from where i am right now oh he said in a small voice a fiftymile circle out from charlies office dragged in at least four provinces fifty miles for me wont even get me out of my barony unless i head straight south and then im only in the one next door i dont need to head south very often the barony of orange has its own eea investigators so whats going on in chatsworth i asked especially whats going on that you need to bounce me out of bed i am sony about that he said so calmly that i knew hed known what time it was out here before he called which meant it was urgent which meant i could start worrying which i did he went on we may have a problem with a dump in the hills up there i riffled through my mental files thatd be the devon shire dump wouldnt it yes thats the name he agreed eagerly too eagerly devonshires been giving angels city onandoff problems for years the trouble with magic is its not free all the good it produces is necessarily balanced by a like amount of evil yeah i know people have understood that since newtons day for every quality there is an equal and opposite counter quality and all the math that goes with the law but mostly its a lipservice understanding along the lines of as long as i dont shit in my yard who cares about next door that attitude worked fine or seemed to as long as next door meant the wide open spaces if byproducts of magic blighted a forest or poisoned a stream so what you just harry turtledove moved on to the next forest or stream a hundred years ago the confederated provinces seemed to stretch west forever but they dont i ought to know angels city of course sits on the coast of the peaceful ocean we dont have unlimited unspoiled land and water to exploit any more and as industrial magic has shown itself ever more capable of marvelous things its byproducts have turned ever more nox ious you wouldnt want them coming downstream at you believe me you wouldnt my job is to make sure they dont whats gone wrong with devonshire now i asked the answer i reaby wanted was nothing a lot of local industries dispose of waste at devonshire and some of the biggest ones are defense firms by the very nature of things the bypro ducts from their spells are more toxic than anybody elses charlie kelly said were not really sure theres anything wrong dave that was dose to what i wanted to hear but not dose enough he went on some of the local people he didnt say who have been complaining more than usual though they have any reason to i said local people always complain about toxic spell dumps they dont like the noise they dont like the spells they dont like the flies cant blame them too much for that would you want byproducts from dealings with beelzebub in your back yard most of the time as charlie said nothing is really wrong but every once in awhile thats what we want you to find out he told me okay i answered then something hed said a while before clicked in my head i hadnt been awake enough to pay attention to it tib now what do you mean you want me to take a quiet look around why shouldnt i go up there with flags flying and comets blaring a formal epa inspec tion is worth seeing two exorcists a thaumaturge shamans from the americas mongolia and africa the whole nine yards sometimes the incense is a toxic hazard all by itself because i want you to do it this way he sounded har assed ive been asked to handle this unofficially as long as i can why do you think im calling you at home unless and until you find something really out of line it would be best case of the toxic spell dump for everybody if you kept a low profile please dave okay charlie i owed charlie a couple and hes a pretty good fellow its politics isnt it i made it into a swear word whats not he let it go at that i didnt blame him he had a job he wanted to keep and telephone imps have ears just like anything else they can be tormented tricked or sometimes bribed into blabbing too much phone security systems have come a long way yeah but not all the devils are out of them yet i sighed can you at least tell me who doesnt want me snooping around then if anybody tries anything ill have some idea why just silence in my ear save for the light breathing of my phone imp i sighed again it was that land of morning okay charlie ill draw my own conclusions those conclusions made for one ugly drawing let me tell you after a last sigh for effect i said ill head up to the valley right away god willing i can get going before st james freeway turns impossible thanks david i appreciate it kelly said coming back to life now that i was doing what he wanted yeah sure i resigned myself to a long miserable day bye charlie i hung up the phone the imp went dor mant i wished i could have done the same i grabbed a quick cold shower either the salamander for the block of flats wasnt awake yet or somebody had turned it into a toad overnight a muddy cup of coffee and a not quite stale sweet roll feeling as near human as i was going to get at half past five i went out to the garage got on my carpet and headed for the freeway my building has access rules like any others i suppose anybody can use the flyway going out but to come in you have to make your entry talisman known to the watch demon or else have one of the residents propitiate him for you oth erwise you come down with quite a bump too outside the wab and the gate i rode west along the second boulevard dont ask me why its the second and not just second it just is about twenty feet off the ground traffic was moving pretty well harry turtledove actually even though we all still had our lanterns on so we could see one another in die predawn darkness the watcher who lets carpets onto st james freeway from a feeder road is of a different breed from your average buildings watch demon he holds the harder closed so many seconds at a time then opens it just long enough for one carpet to squeeze past nobodys ever figured out how to propitiate a watcher either oh if youre quick and stupid you may be able to squeeze in on somebody elses tail but if you try it heb note down the weave of your carpet and in a few days just like magic a traffic ticket shows up in your mailbox not many people are stupid twice the freeways need rules like that otherwise theyd be impossibly jammed as things were i got stuck no matter how early id left there was a bad accident a little north of the interdicted zone around the airport and somebodys car pet had flipped the damned fool well of course i dont actually know the state of his soul but no denying his foolish ness hadnt been wearing his safety belt either one set of paramedics was down on the ground with the fellow whod been thrown out they had a priest with them too so that didnt look good the other red cross carpet was parked right in the middle of the flight of way tending to vic tims who hadnt been thrown clear and making everyone detour around it people gawked as they slid by so they went even slower they always do that and i hate it after that i made pretty good time until i had to slow down again at the junction with st monicas freeway merg ing traffic in three dimensions is a scary business when you think about it commuters who do it every day dont think about it any more the rush thinned out once i got north ofwestwood andi pretty much sailed into st ferdinands valley i slid off the freeway and cruised around for a while getting closer to the devonshire dump by easy stages and looking for signs that might tell me whether charlie kelly had a right to be wor ried about it at first i didnt see any which gladdened my heart a cou ple of generations ago the valley was mostly farms and citrus case of the toxic spell dump groves then the trees went down and the houses went up now the valley has industry of its own if it didnt i wouldnt have had to worry about the toxic spell dump after all but in large measure its still a bedroom community for the rest of angels city lots of houses lots of kids lots of schools you dont care to think about anything nasty in a part of town like that before i went out to the dump itself i headed over to the monastery to do some homework the thomas brothers have chapter houses in cities all across the west more meticulous recordkeeping simply doesnt exist even if die valley looked normal i had a good chance of finding trouble simply by digging dirough die numbers diey enshrined on parchment ive heard die thomas brodiers have an unwritten rule diat no abbot ofdieirs can ever be named brodier thomas i dont know if diats so i do know die abbot at die valley chapter house was a bignosed armenian named brodier vahan wed met a few times before diough i didnt often work far enough north in angels city to need his help he bowed politely as he let me precede him into his office candlelight gleamed from his skull he was the bald est man id ever seen he didnt need to be tonsured he waved me to a comfortable chair dien sat down in his own hard one what can i do for you today inspector fisher he asked i was ready for diat td like to do some comparison work on births birth defects healings and exorcisms in die north west valley ten years ago and in die past year ah was all die abbot said when viewed against his hairless skull die big black caterpillars he used for eyebrows seemed even more alive dian diey might have odierwise they twitched now how big a radius around die devon shire dump would you like i sighed i should have expected it im jewish but i know enough to realize fools dont generally make it up to abbots grade i said this is unofficial and confidential you under stand he laughed at me i turned red maybe i was die fool harry turtledove telling an abbot about confidentiality he just said there are places you would need to be more concerned about that aspect than here inspector suppose so i mumbled can your data retrieval sys tem handle a fivemile radius the caterpillars drooped id offended him i thought you were going to ask for something difficult inspector he got up if youd be so kind as to follow me i followed we walked past a couple of rooms my eyes refused to see into i wasnt offended there are places in the temple in jerusalem and even in your ordinary synagogue where gentiles perceptions are excluded the same way all faiths have their mysteries i was just thankful die thomas brothers didnt reckon their records too holy for outsiders to view the scriptorium was underground a traditional construc tion left over from the days when anyone literate was assumed to be a black wizard and when books of any sort needed to be protected from the torches of the ignorant and the fearful but for its placement though the room was thoroughly modem with st elmos fire glowing smoothly over every cubicle and each of those cubicles with its own groundglass access screen as soon as brother vahan and i stepped into a cubicle the spirit of the scriptorium appeared in the ground glass the spirit wore spectacles i had to work to keep my face straight id never imagined folk on the other side could look bookish i turned to the abbot suppose id come in without you or someone else whos authorized to be here you wouldnt get any information out of our friend there brother vahan said you would get caught he sounded quietly confident i believed him the thomas brothers probably knew about as much about keeping docu ments secure as anyone not in government and what they didnt know rome did brother vahan spoke to the groundglass screen give this man unlimited access to our files and full aid for will four hours be enough case of the toxic spell dump should be plenty i answered tor four hours then the abbot said treat him in all ways as if he were one of our holy brethren that was as blanche a carte as he could give me i bowed my head in pro found appreciation he flipped a hand back and forth as if to say think nothing of it he could say that if he wanted to but we both knew i owed him a big one anything else he asked me i shook my head happy hunting then he said as he started out of the scriptorium til see you later the spirit manifesting itself in the access screen turned its nearsighted gaze on me how may i serve you child of adam given four hours of unlimited access to the files of the thomas brothers i told it the same thing id told brother vahan i want to go through births birth defects healings and exorcisms within a fivemile radius of the devonshire dump first for the year ending exactly ten years ago and then for the year ending today humans can handle approximate data with spirits you have to spell out every word and make sure youve crossed your ts and dotted your is i shall gather the data you require please waif the spirit said the screen went blank in the beginning was the word and word was with god and the word was cod yes i know thats brother vahans theology not mine its a lot older than christianity for that matter in old kingdom egypt the god ptah was seen as both the tongue of the primeval god atum and as the instru ment through which atum created the material world of course thought is the instrument through which we perceive and influence the other side without it wed be as blind to magic as any dumb animals but john and its variants in other creeds are also the basis of modem information theory because words partake of the divine they manifest themselves in the spiritual world as well as in our own properly directed ensorceled if you will spirits can gather read manipulate and move the essence of words without ever having to handle the physical harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump documents on which they appear if the greek and roman mages had loiown that trick their world could have been drowning in information just as we are now i didnt have to wait long as id expected brother vahan used only the best and most thoroughly trained spirits ghostly images of documents began flashing onto the access screen one after another records from ten years ago hold on i said after a few seconds the spirit appeared i obey your instructions child of adam it said as if daring me to deny it i know i know i told it the last thing i wanted was to get the heart of the access system mad at me i dont need to look at every individual report though let me have the numbers in each category for the two periods when i know what those are im examine specific documents that way ill be able to see forest and trees both the spirit looked out at me over the tops of its spectral spectacles you should have no difficulty in maintaining your mental view of both categories it said reprovingly thats easy for someone on the other side to say but i have the usual limits of flesh and blood i just stared back at the spirit if it kept acting uppity id sic brother vahan on it after a last sniff it said it shall be as you desire one by one the numbers came up on the screen the thomas brothers certainly did have a welldrilled scripto rium spirit the creature wrote so its figures ran the right way for me to read them it hardly needed to have bothered im so used to mirrorimage writing that i read it as well as the other land maybe learning hebrew helped get my eyes used to moving from right to left when the final figure faded from view i looked down at the notes id jotted births were up in the most recent year as opposed to ten years ago st ferdinands valley keeps fill ing up blocks of flats have replaced a lot of what used to be singlefamily homes we arent as crowded as new jorvik and i dont think we ever will be but angels city is losing the smalltown atmosphere it kept for a while even after it became a big city the rate of healings hadnt changed significantly over the past ten years spirit i said and waited until it appeared in the access screen then i played a hunch please break out for me by type the healings for both periods im interested m one moment it said when they came up the data werent dramatic i hadnt expected them to be not when the overall frequency had stayed pretty much constant but the increased incidence of elfshot within the pool of healings was suggestive elves tend to be drawn to areas with high concentrations of sor cery if the devonshire dump were as dean as it was supposed to be there shouldnt have been that many elves running around loose shooting their little arrows into people elfarrows arent like the ones cupid looses after all exorcisms were up too i asked the access spirit for sam ple reports for each period i wasnt after statistical elegance not yet just a feel for what was going on i got the impres sion that the spirits whod needed banishing this past year were a nastier bunch and did more damage before they were expelled than had been true in the earlier sample but the numbers that really leaped off the page at me were the birth defects between ten years ago and this past year the d almost tripled i whistled softly under my breath then called for the scriptorium spirit again when it reappeared i said may i please have a listing of birth defects by type for each of my two periods one moment the spirit said again the screen went blank then the spirit started writing on it the first set of data it gave me was for the earlier period things there looked pretty normal a few cases of second sight a changeling whose condition was diagnosed earlier enough to give her remediation and a good chance at living a nearly normal life nothing at all out of the ordinary when the birth defect information for the year just past came up on the ground glass i almost fell off my chair in that year alone the area around the devonshire dump had seen three vampires two lycanthropes and three cases of apsychia human babies born without any soul at all thats a truly dreadful defect one neither priests nor physicians can harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump do a thing about the poor kids grow up grow old die and the re gone forever makes me shudder just to think about it three cases of apsychia in one year in a circle with a five mile radius i shuddered again apsychia just doesnt happen except when something unhallowed is leaking into die environment you might not see three cases of apsychia in a year even in a place like eastern franlda where the toxic spells both sides flung around in the first sorcerous war still poison the ground after three quarters of a century i finished writing up my notes men told the spirit thank you youve been most helpful may i ask one more favor of you that depends on what it is of course i said quickly just this if anyone but brother vahan tries to leam what ive been doing here dont tell him her or it scriptorium spirits by their nature have veiy literal minds i wanted to make sure i covered both genders and both sides the spirit considered then nodded i would honor such a request from a monk of the thomas brothers and am instructed to treat you as one for the duration brother vahan specified let it be as you say then i didnt know how well the spirit would stand up under serious interrogation but i wasnt too worried about that shows how much i knew doesnt it i guess im naive but i thought the automatic anathema that falls on anyone who tampers with church property would be plenty to keep snoops at arms length im no christian but i wouldnt have wanted an organization with a twothousandyear track record of potent access to the other side down on me of course the veneration of mammon goes back a lot far ther than two thousand years i stopped by brother vahans office on the way out so i could thank him for his help too he looked up from what ever he was working on none of my business and said two words that bad he couldnt possibly have picked that up by magic along with the standard governmentissue charms i wear a set of my own made for me by a rabbi whos an expert in kabbalistics and other means of navigating on the other side so i knew i was shielded but abbots operate in this world too even if he couldnt read my mind he must have read my face pretty bad i said i hesitated before i went on but after all id just pulled the information from his files all the same i lowered my voice three soulless ones bom within that circle in the past year three his face went suddenly haggard as he made the sign of the cross then he nodded as if reminding himself yes there have been that many havent there i talked with the parents each time thatfs so hard knowing theyll never meet their loved ones in eternity but i hadnt realized they were all so dose to that accursed dump an abbot does not use words like accursed casually when he says them he means them i wasnt surprised he hadnt noticed the apsychia cluster around the dump that wasnt his job comforting bereaved families was a lot more impor tant for him but the thomas brothers collected the data i used to draw my own conclusions elfshot is up in the area too i said quietly it would be he got up from behind his desk set heavy hands on my shoulders go with god inspector fisher i think you will be about his business today i didnt even twit him about turning one into three as i might have if id come out of his scriptorium with better news blessings are blessings and were wisely advised to count them i said thank you brother vahan i just wish i thought he was the only power involved he didnt answer from which i inferred he agreed with me wishing i could have come to some other conclusion i went out to my carpet and headed over to the devonshire dump i drove around it a couple of times before i set down scout first then attack the army and the epa both drill that into you not that i learned much from my circumnavigations you think dump you think eyesore it wasnt like that from the outside it didnt look like anything in particular just a couple harry turtledove of square blocks with nothing built on them nothing at least tall enough to show over the fence and even that fence wasnt ugly ivy climbed trellises and spilled over inside if you wanted to you could probably climb those trel lises yourself jump right on down youd have to be crazy to try it though for one thing i was certain catchspells would grab you if you did for another the ornaments on the perimeter fence werent just there for decoration crosses magen davids crescents oriental ideograms i recognized but couldnt read a bronze alpha and omega a few kufic letters like the ones that lead off chapters of the quran things were being controlled in there things you wouldnt want to mess with they werent being controlled well enough though or babies around the dump wouldnt come into the world with out souls i dribbled a few drops of passover wine onto my spellchecker murmured the blessing that thanked the lord for the fruit of die vine the spellchecker duly noted all the apotropaic incanta tions on the wall and yes there were catchspells behind them but it didnt see anything else i shrugged i hadnt re ally expected it to its magical vocabulary wasnt that large besides if the sorcerous leakage from the dump was so obvi ous that anybody with a thirtycrown gadget from spells r us could spot it charlie kelly wouldnt have needed to send me out to look things over still youd like things to be easy just once there was a parking lot across the street from the entrance i set my carpet down there chanted the antitheft geas before i climbed off it i do that automatically angels city has had bigcity crime for a long time leave a carpet unwarned for even a few minutes and youre apt to find its walked with jesus i crossed in the crosswalk they still call it that here though in a melting pot like angels city it also has symbols to let jews and muslims hindus and parsees and buddhists and several different flavors of pagan get from one side of the street to the other in safety i dont know what youre supposed to do if youre a samoan who still worships tanaroa run like hell i suppose case of the toxic spell dump the entryway to the devonshire dump projected out several feet from the rest of the wall a guard in a neat blue denim uniform came out of a glassedin cage tipped his cap to me may i help you sir he asked politely but in a way that still managed to imply i had no legitimate business making him get off his duff and step outside i flashed my epa sigil at a toxic spell dump that effec tively turns me into st peter im the fellow with the power to bind and loose at least the guards eyes widened let me call mr sudalds for you inspector uh fisher sir he said and ducked back into his cell he grabbed the phone started talking into it waited for his ear imp to answer then replaced the handset in its cradle you can go in sir ill help you help me he did the gate was the land with the little wheel on the bottom that retracted in back of the fence he pushed it open behind it was a single symbolic strand of barbed wire with a placard whose message appeared in several languages and almost as many alphabets the english version read all hope abandon ye who unauthorized enter here dante always makes people sit up and take notice the guard moved the wire out of my way too behind it was a thin red line painted on the ground which went across the gap where the two sections of wall came out to form the entryway the guard picked up a little arched footbridge made of wood set it down so that one end was outside the red line the other inside he was very careful to make sure neither end touched the strip of paint that would have breached the dumps outer security containment and doubt less cost him his job no matter how many backup systems the place had go ahead sir he said tipping his cap again mr sudalds is expecting you please stay within the confines of the wires and the amber lines inside he grinned nervously i dont know why im telling you that you know more about it than i do youre doing what youre supposed to do i answered as i mounted the little footbridge too many people dont bother any more harry turtledove as soon as id got off the bridge the guard picked it up and put it back on his side the amber lines on the concrete and the barbed wire strung above them marked the safe path to the administrative office a low cinderblock building that looked like a citadel in both the military and sorcerous senses of the word i looked around as i walked the path i dont know what id expected blasted heath maybe but no just a couple of acres of weeds mostly brown now because nobodys spells have been able to bring much rain the past few years and yet for second or two the fence around the dump seemed very far away with a whole lot of nothing stretching the dirt and brush the same way youd use bread crumbs to make hamburger go farther astrologers babble about the nearly infinite distances between the stars i had the bad feeling i was looking at more infinity than i ever cared to meet plopped down there in the middle of chatsworth magic especially byproducts of magic can do things to space and time that the mathematicians are still trying to figure out then i looked again and everything seemed normal i hoped the wards the amber lines symbolized were as po tent as the ones the red line had continued by the data id taken from the thomas brothers chapter house even those werent as good as they should have been a stocky fellow in shirt tie and hard hat came out of the cinderblock building and up the path toward me he had his hand out and a professionally friendly smile plas tered across his face inspector fisher is it pleased to meet you im antanas sudakis my job title is sorcerous containment area manager call me tony im the guy who runs the dump we shook hands his grip showed controlled strength i was at least six inches taller than he i could look down on the top of his little helmet just the same i got the feeling he could break me in half if he decided to im a beanpole while he was built like somebody whod been a good high school linebacker and might have played college ball if only hed been taller case of the toxic spell dump he wasnt hostile now though why dont you come into my office inspector fisher call me dave i said thinking i ought to keep things friendly as long as i could okay dave come on with me and then you can let me know what this is all about all our inspection parchments are properly signed sealed blessed fumigated what have you i keep the originals on file in my desk i know you gov ernment folks are never satisfied with copies called up in the ground glass what sorcery summons sorcery may shift i said mak ing it sound as if i was quoting official epa policy and i was still i believed him if his parchmentwork wasnt in order he wouldnt brag about it besides if his parchmentwork wasnt in order hed have more to fret about than a surprise visit from an epa inspector hed be worrying about the wrath of god both from bosses who didnt pay him to screw up and maybe from on high too a lot of things in the dump were unholy in the worst way his office didnt feel like a citadel even if it had no win dows the diffuse glow of st elmos fire across the ceiling gave the room the cool even light of a cloudy day the air was cool to breathe too though st ferdinands valley which like the rest of angels city was essentially a desert before it got built up still has desertly weather sudakis noticed me visibly not toasting he grinned were on a circuit with one of the frozen water elemen tals up in greenland a section of tile here he pointed to the wall behind his desk touched the elemental once and now it keeps the place cool thanks to the law of contagion once in contact always in contact i quoted modem as next week a lot of buildings in angels city cool them selves by contagious contact with ice elementals that wasnt what i meant by modem the law of contagion may be the oldest magical principle known but regulating the effect so people feel comfortable not stuck on an ice floe themselves is a new process and an expensive one the people who made a profit off the dump didnt stint their employees i harry turtledove wondered how the leak had happened if they had money like this to throw around once his secretary had brought coffee for both of us sudalds settled back in his chair it creaked he said what can i do for you dave i gather this is an unofficial visit you havent shown me a warrant you havent served a subpoena you dont have a priest or an exorcist or even a lawyer with you so whats up youre right this is unofficial i sipped my coffee it was delicious nothing like the reconstituted stuff that makes a liar of the law of similarity td like to talk about your con tainment scheme here if you dont mind his air of affability turned to stone as abruptly as if hed gazed on a cockatrice by his expression hed sooner have had me ask him about a social disease were tight he said absolutely no question were tight maybe wed both better have priests and lawyers here i dont like unofficial visits that hit me where i live inspector fisher i wasnt dave any more you may not be as tight as you think i told him thats what im here to talk about talk is cheap he was hardnosed as a linebacker too i dont want talk i want evidence if you try and come here to say things like that to me elfshot around the dump is up a lot from ten years ago till now i said yes ive seen those numbers weve got a lot of new immigrants in the area too and they bring their troubles with them when they come to this country we have a case of jaguaranthropy if thats a word a couple of years ago try telling me that would have happened when all the neighbors sprang from northwest europe he was right about the neighborhood changing id gone past a couple of houses that had signs saying curandero tacked out front if you ask me curanderos are frauds who prey on the ignorant but nobody asked me a basic principle of magic is that if you believe in something itll be true for you ill tell you something i believed i believed that if the case of the toxic spell dump epa took devonshire dump to court just on the strength of an increase in elfshot around the area the lawyers sudalds people would throw at us would leave us so much nottoo lean ground beef i had no doubt tony sudalds believed it too so i hit him with something bigger and harder are you going to blame the immigrants for the three cases of apsy chia around here in the past year he didnt even blink coincidence he said flady one hand though tugged at the silver chain he wore around his neck out popped the ornament on the end of it id expected a crucifix but instead it was a polished piece of amber with something embedded inside a pretty piece and one that probably cost a pretty copper speaking off the record mr sudalds you know as well as i do that three soulless births in one area in one year isnt co incidence i answered its an epidemic he let the amber amulet slide back under his shirt i deny that off the record or on it his voice was so loud and ringing that i would have bet something was listening to every word we said ready to spit it back in case we did end up in court interesting i thought sudalds went on besides inspector think of it like this if i didnt think this place was safe why would i keep coming to work every day i raised what i hoped was a placating hand mr sudalds tony if i may im not repeat not claiming youre personally responsible for anything i want you to un derstand that but evidence of what may be a problem here has come to my attention and i wouldnt be doing my job if i ignored it okay he said nodding i can deal with that look maybe i can clear this up if i show you the containment scheme you find any holes in if dave i was dave again so i guess hed calmed down and i will personally shit in my hat and wear it backwards i swear it youre not under oath i said hastily if he turned out to be wrong i didnt want to leave him the choice of doing something disgusting or facing the wrath of the other side for not following through harry turtledove you heard me he got up from his desk went over to a file cabinet off to one side started pulling out folders here look he unrolled a parchment in front of me heres the outer perimeter youll have seen some of that heres what all really goes into it and heres the protection scheme for the complex were sitting in i was already pretty much convinced the outer perimeter of the dump was tight thats what the speuchecker had indicated anyhow and a cursory glance at the plans to keep the blockhouse safe told me sudalds didnt need to be afraid when he came to his job satan himself might have forced his way through those wards or possibly babylonian tiamat if her cult were still alive but the lesser powers would only get headaches if they tried now heres the underground setup sudalds stuck another parchment in front of my face you look this over dave you tell me if its not as tight as a vestals unlike the other two plans this one really did demand a careful onceover proper underground containment is the balders mistletoe of almost any toxic spell dump the ideal solution of course would be to float the dump on top of a pool of alkahest which would dissolve any evil that percolated through to it but alkahest is a quis custodiet ipsos custodes phenomenon being a universal solvent it dissolves everything it touches which would in short order include the dumping grounds themselves some of the wilder journal articles suggest using either lodestone levitation or sylphs of the air to raise the dump above the ground and to keep it separated from the alkahest below i think anybody whod try such a scheme ought to be made to live in the dump office lodelev is a purely physical process and like any physical process vulnerable to magical interference and sylphs of the air really are just as flighty as their reputation makes them out to be theyd get bored or playful or whatever and forget what they were supposed to be doing that wouldnt be good not where alkahest is involved they used it in the first sorcerous war but not in the sec ond its just too potent even as a weapon as it eats its way case of the toxic spell dump straight toward the center of the earth its liable to bring magma or ancient buried powers through the channel up iit cuts nobody even stockpiles it how could you so no alkahest under the devonshire dump instead the designers had put in the usual makeshifts blessings and rel ics and holy texts from every faith known to mankind and elaborate spells renewed twice a year to use the law of conta gion to extend their effect to the places where they werent actually buried it looks hke a good arrangement on parchment i said grudgingly i presume you rigidly adhere to the resanctification schedule i made it sound as if i assumed nothing of the sort tony sudalds set more parchments in front of me certi fication under canon law the ordnances of the baron of angels and national secular law i examined them they looked like what they were sup posed to be the dump management outfit might have forged the secular documents the worst the baron of angels can do is send you to jail the worst the secular power can do is leave you short a head but youd have to be pretty bold to forge a canon lawyers hand or seal the punishment for that land ofoffense could go on forever i shoved the pile of parchments back at sudalds now my tone of voice was different i have to admit i dont know what to tell you this really does look good on parchment but somethings not right hereabouts i know that too i told him about the rest of the birth defects id spotted the vampirism and lycanthropy he frowned youre not making that up not a word of it ill swear by adonai elohaynu if you like i am god knows an imperfect jew but youd have to be a lot more imperfect than i am to falsify that oath people who would risk their souls by falsely calling on the lord wont make it past the epa spiritual background checks and a good thing too if you ask me sudalds beefy face set in the frown as if it were made of quickdrying cement our attorneys will still maintain that the effects you cite are just a statistical quirk and have harry turtledove nothing to do with the devonshire dump its contents or its activities if we go to court well win probably i wanted to hit him the certain knowledge that hed murder me wasnt what stopped me getting in a good shot or two would have made that worthwhile far as im concerned people who hide its wrong behind ifs legal deserve whatever happens to them the only thing that held me back was knowing id bring discredit to the epa then sudalds pulled out that little amber charm again he licked a fingertip ran it over the smooth surface of the amulet and murmured something in a language i not only didnt know but didnt come close to recognizing then he put the amulet back and said now we can talk privately for a little while can we i had no reason to trust him every reason to think he was trying to trap me in an indiscretion the lawyers hed been throwing at me would have loved that but he said yeah and i think wed better too i dont like the numbers you laid out for me i dont like em at all this place is supposed to be safe its been safe ever since i took over here and i want it to keep on being safe thats what they pay me for after all why do you have to turn aside the listener if thats so i asked come to that i didnt know his outre httie ritual really had turned aside anything he said because the company basically just wants me to run this place so it makes them money i want to run it right all i could think was heu of a note when a man has to deafen the listener before he says he wants to do a proper job but hed convinced me too many top corporate manag ers hide dorsal fins under expensive imported suits if one of those types got wind of what sudalds had said let alone what hed done hed be out on the street with a big dusty foot print on his behind howd you get word there was trouble here anyhow he asked did you paw through the thomas brothers files hoping youd stumble over something you could use to curse us case of the toxic spell dump his bosses wouldnt have let him manage the dump if he was stupid i answered no as a matter of fact i didnt i got a call from the district ofsfc columba this morning tell ing me i ought to check things out so i did and now you know what i found thafs interesting he stuck out his chin howd charlie kelly know back there that something was up when you hadnt heard anything out here no he wasnt stupid at all not if he knew the fellow at the epa who was likeliest to give me orders his job is to hear things like that i answered suspicious again not all the ways sudalds might have learned about kelly were savory ones yeah sure sure but how if he was acting he could have given lessons he looked down at his wrist said some thing scatological thafs a safer way to work off your feelings than swearing or cursing my stinking watch says ifs day before yesterday must be eddy currents from the garbage outside you ought to wear something better than that cheap mechanical i said i touched the tail of the timekeeper that coiled round my wrist its a betterbehaved little demon than the one that sits on my nightstand at home it yawned stretched piped eleven fortytwo and went back to sleep sudalds scatologized again the listener will go back on duty any minute now i cant put it out two times running the magic doesnt work i hate doing it even once too much magic loose here as is thats why i dont wear a fancy watch like yours mechanicals are all right when one gets bollixed i just buy another one no need to wony about rites or any thing like that i shrugged it wasnt my business but i have as little to do with mechanicals as i can if the other side werent as real as this one they might be all right but as atheling the wise put it though most forces are also persons and mechanicals have no personalities of their own to withstand the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune to say nothing of outraged or sometimes just mischievous forces thats why youll never see lodestone levitation under an alkahest pool harry turtledove sometimes when im in the mood for utopian flights of fancy i think about how smoothly the world would run if all natural forces were as inanimate as the ones that let mechanicals operate wed never have to screen against megasalamanders launched on the wings of supersylphs to incinerate cities anywhere in the world neither of the sor cerous wars that devastated whole countries could have happened for that matter i wouldnt have had to worry about toxic spell dumps or the evergrowing pollution of the environment things would be simpler all around yeah i know ifs a dream from the gate of ivory without magic the world would probably have fanners maybe towns but surely not the great civilization we know can you imagine mass production without the law of similarity or any kind of communications network without the law of conta gion and medicine i shiver to think of it without ectoplasmic beings to see and reach inside the body how would medi cine be possible at all if you got sick youd bloody well die just like one of tony sudalds cheap watches when magic touched its works i pulled my mind back to business and asked him can you give me a list of the firms whose spells youre storing at this containment facility that was a question i could legiti mately ask him regardless of whether the listener was conscious he said inspector fisher in view of the unofficial nature of your visit i have to tell you no if you bring me a warrant i will of course cooperate to the degree required by civil and canon law he thought he was being heard again he tipped me a wink as he spoke such a list is a matter of public record i argued both because it was something i really wanted to have and because i still wasnt sure i could trust him and i will surrender it to properly constituted authority but only to such authority he said but it could also give competitors important information on the spells and charms we use at this facility limited access to magical secrets is one of the oldest principles of both canon and civil law case of the toxic spell dump he might have been playing it to the hilt for the sake of the listener but he had me and i knew it sophisticated magic has to be kept secret or else everyone starts using it and the originator gains no benefit from hard and often dan gerous research work people who want to socialize sorcery dont realize there wouldnt be much sorcery to socialize if they took away the incentive for devising new spells i shall return with that warrant mr sudalds i said formally he grinned and gave me a silent thumbsup the listener wouldnt notice so he was either really on my side or one fine con man will there be anything else inspector he asked i started to shake my head then changed my mind is there a safe spot in this building where i can look out at the whole dump sure is why dont you come with me sudalds looked happy for any excuse to get up from behind his desk my guess was that hed been promoted for outstanding work in the field he probably liked the money from his administra tive job but not a whole lot of other things about it our shoes rang on the spiral stairway that led to the roof of the cinderblock office steps and rail alike were cold iron a sensible precaution in a building surrounded by such nasty magic the trapdoor through which we climbed was also of iron heavily greased against the rains angels city wasnt seeing lately sudalds effortlessly pushed it out of the way here you are he said waving youre about as safe here as you are indoors topologically were still inside the same shielding system but it doesnt feel the same out in the open air does it no i admitted i felt exposed to i didnt know what i wondered if the air itself was bad somehow i imagined tiny demons i couldnt even see crawling down into my lungs and relieving themselves among my bronchial passages an unpleasant thought i scuttled it as fast as i could the dump still looked like a couple of acres of overgrown underwatered ground if it had been paved over it would have been a perfect used carpet lot i dont know what id harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump expected from a panoramic view maybe that i could spot boxes or barrels with corporate names on them i didnt see anything though the most interesting thing i did see was a little patch of ground about fifty yards from the office build ing that seemed to be moving of its own accord i pointed whafs over there tony sudalds eyes followed my finger oh that ifb be a while before decon does much with that area im afraid byproducts from a defense plant i can say that much those are flies you see stirring around oh i dropped the subject at once and completely id thought about the lord of the flies on the way over to the dump hes such a potent demon prince that even saying his name can be dangerous speak of the devil as everyone knows is not a joke and the same applies to his great cap tain the prince of the descending hierarchy i didnt care for the notion of the defense department dealing with beelzebub either i know the pentagram has the best wizards in the world but theyre only human leave out a single line by god misplace a single comma and youre liable to have hell on earth i looked back toward the place where id seen a whole lot of nothing when i was coming up the protected walk toward sudalds office from this angle it didnt look any different from the rest of the dump i thought about mentioning it to sudalds but didnt bother he probably saw enough weird things in the course of a week to last an ordi nary chap with an ordinary job a lifetime or two besides that thought gave rise to another how often do you run across synergistic reactions among the spells that get dumped here it does happen sometimes and sometimes its no fun at all when it does he rolled his eyes to show how big an understatement that was persian spells are particularly bad for that for some reason and theres a large persian commu nity here in the valley refugees from die latest secularist takeover most of them when their spiritual elements fused with some from a baghdad candymakers preservation charm of all the unlikely things i drew my own picture it wasnt pleasant shia and sunni magic are starkly different but aigue from the same prem ises that makes the minghngs worse when they happen as if papists and protestants used the same dump in ireland the confederation is a melting pot all right but sometimes the pot wants to melt down i didnt see anything else about which to question sudalds so i went back down the spiral stairs he followed pausing only to shut the trap door over our heads as we walked back to his office i said til be back with the war rant as soon as i can in the next couple of days anyhow whatever you say inspector fisher he winked again to show he was really on my side i wondered if he was he sounded very much like a man speaking for the listener when he said tm happy to cooperate informally with an informal investigation but i do need the formal parchment before i can exceed the scope of my instructions from man agement he went out to the entrance with me i craned my neck to see if the nothing reappeared as i passed the place where id seen it before for an instant i thought it did but when i blinked it was gone whats there sudalds asked when i turned my head nothing i said but i meant i guessed i meant it with a small n i laughed a little nervously a figleaf of my imagination you work here a while youll get those for sure he nod ded hard i wondered what all hed seen or maybe not seen since he started working here when we got out to the front gate the security guard again carefully placed the footbridge so it straddled die red line i felt like a free man as soon as i was on the outside of the dump site sudalds waved across from his side then went back to his citadel it wasnt until id crossed die crosswalk chanted die phrase diat unlocked die antitheft geas on my carpet and actually gotten into die air diat i remembered die vampires the werewolves the idds born widiout souls all die odier birth defects around die devonshire dump getting outside harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump the site didnt necessarily free you from it were that so i wouldnt have had to make this trip in the first place midday traffic was a lot thinner than the usual morning madness i was more than twice as far from my westwood office in the confederal building as i was when i left from my flat but i didnt need any more time to get there than i do on my normal commute i slid into my reserved parking space penalty for unauthorized use a hundred crowns or an extra year for your soul in purgatory or born judges discre tion if he thinks you wont rate purgatory hell just fine you then walked inside the elevator shaft smelt of almond oil at the bottom was a virgin parchment inscribed with the words gomert and kailoeth and the sigil of the demon khil who has con trol over some of die spirits of the air he can also cause earthquakes and so is a useful spirit to know in angels city the almond oil is part of the paste that summons him the other ingredients being olive oil dust from close by a coffin and the brain of a dunghill cock seventh floor i said and was lifted up as soon as i got into the office i called charlie kelly he listened while i told him what id found then said nice piece of work dave that confirms and amplifies the infor mation id already received go to work on that warrant right away i will i promised i know just the judge ill take the information over to qadi ruhollah hes about the strictest man in ac when it comes to environmental damage i chuckled tor that matter hes a rigorist on just about every thing maximum ruhollah we call him out here sounds like the fellow we need al right kelly said anything else i started to say no but had to think better of it there is one other thing as a matter of fact sudalds the dump manager wondered how youd heard something new might be wrong at his place when no one out here had a clue i couldnt give him an answer but it made me curious too as it had once or twice when hed called me at home the silence stretched longer than imp relay could account for by itself finally charlie said a bird told me you might say a little bird right i started to laugh charlie i stopped believing in that little bird about the same time i found out the stork only brings changelings however you want it he said thats all i can tell you and more than i ought to i thought about pushing some more but decided not to people back in dc are supposed to have good sources diey justify the fancy salaries that come out of your purse and mine by knowing whats going on all over the country and how to find out about it even if the people who are doing it dont want it found out but i was still moderately graveled that somebody a continent away had picked up on some thing i hadnt heard die first thing about right in my own backyard get the warrant dave charlie said well go from there depending on what we learn bight i said and hung up then i grabbed a sandwich and a cup of coffee at the litde cafeteria in the building they perfectly balanced virtue and vice they were lousy but cheap lousy or not my stomach stopped growling i made another phone call the phone on the other end must have yammered for quite a while because i listened to my imp drumming his fingers on the inside of the handset until at last i got an answer handofglory press judith adier speaking hi judy its dave oh hi dave i thought her voice went from business like to warm but with two phone imps between us i had a hard time being sure sorry i took so long to pick up there i was in the middle of a tough passage and i wanted to get to the end of a sentence so i could be sure i wouldnt miss even a single word when i went back to it dont apologize i said doing what you do you have to be careful handofglory press as youd guess from the name publishes grimoires of all sorts from simple ones on carpet maintenance up to the special secret sort with olivedrab harry turtledove covers judys their number one proofreader and copy editor shes the most intensely detailminded person i know and she needs to be an error in a grimoire on flying carpets might end you up in boston oregon instead of boston mass an error in a military magic manual might leave you dead or worse she said so whats up feel like going out to dinner with me tonight i asked i ran into something interesting today and i wouldnt mind hearing what you think of it knowing someone who can see not only forest and trees but also count leaves is wonderful being in love with her is even better sure she said meet at your place after work i ought to be able to get there before six youll probably beat me there then the way traffic on st james has been lately i told her sounds good theres a new hanese place a few blocks away that i want to try sounds good to me too you know how much i like hanese food see you tonight then now ill let you get back to what you were doing bye i went back to work too although my mind wasnt really on the main project that currently infested my desk a cou ple of days before a big carpet carrying fumigants had overturned in an accident spilling finely ground linseed psellium seed violet and wild parsley root aloes mace and storax because theyre materials used in conjurations i had to draft the environmental impact statement i could have just written no impact and let it go at that the fumigants were harmless in and of themselves and required combustion and ritual to become magically signifi cant a twoword report however would not have made my boss happy and might have given people outside the epa the idea that we didnt take seriously the job we were doing so instead i wasted taxpayers time and parchment writing five leaves that ended up saying no impact but did it in a bureaucratically acceptable way i do sometimes wonder why case of the toxic spell dump governmental agencies have to act like that but it seems as universal as the law of contagion suffused in virtue i dropped the draft of my statement on my boss desk for her changes then went down the slide out to my carpet and onto the freeway sure enough traffic was beastly especially down by the airport not only was everybody getting on and off there but the flight lanes for the big international carrier really cramp air space for local travelers judy was waiting for me when i got home as id thought she would be wed been seeing each other for about two and a half years then id gotten her a spare entry talisman and given her the unlocking word for my door pretty early in that time and shed done the same for me she greeted me with a pucker on her lips and a cold beer in her hand wonderful woman i told her which might have helped heat the loss a little she got a beer for herself too we sat down to drink them before we went out judys a big tall brunette with hazel eyes and a mass of wavy brown hair that falls halfway down her back she doesnt walk exactly when she moves its more like flowing she looked too feline ever to seem quite at home on my angular apartmenthouse furniture i enjoyed watching her all the same so what did you come across today she asked i finished my beer and said lets talk about it at the res taurant if i start explaining it now we wont get to the restaurant and then youll think i invited you over just to lure you into bed it is nice to know you occasionally have other things on your mind she admitted upending her own bottle lets go then we rode on my carpet the safety belts held us compan ionably close the restaurant parking lot had a sign with a big hanese dragon breathing ornately stylized fire and a blunt warning trespassers will be incinerated judith smiled when she saw it i didnt i live in a moderately tough part of town and i figured there was at least one chance in three the sign was no joke harry turtledove wonderful smells greeted us just inside the entrance the only trouble with hanese restaurants is that so much of what they serve is forbidden to those who observe the law sea cucumbers i can live without but ive heard so much about scallops and lobster that im always tempted to try them but how can a man whod break what he sees as gods law be trusted to uphold the laws of men i was good again so was judy whose job and whose life also took discipline still you cant really complain about hot and sour soup beef with black mushrooms crispy duck and crystalboiled chicken with spicy sauces everything was good too this was a place id visit again while judy and i ate i told her about the devonshire dump three cases of apsydua this year she said her eye brows went way up and stayed way up somethings badly wrong there i think so too and so does the dump administrator fel low named tony sudalds even though he wont say so where a listener can hear him i sipped my tea you deal with magic more intimately than i do maybe even more inti mately than sudakis intimately in a way different from his anyhow im glad youre worded it tells me im right to feel the same way you certainly are she nodded so vigorously her hair flew out in a cloud around her head then her eyes filled with tears just think of those poor babies i know id thought about them a lot i couldnt help it vampires and lycanthropes have their problems heaven knows but what hope is there for a kid with no soul none zero zip i drank more tea hoping it would cleanse my mind along with my palate no such luck then i told judy what charlie kelly had said about a bird telling him something might be amiss at the dump he wouldnt give me any details he wanted to be coy what do you suppose he meant a bird not a litde bird she waited for me to shake my head then started ticking off possibilities on her fingers first thing that occurs to me is something to do with quetzalcoatf case of the toxic spell dump you just made dinner worth putting on the expense account i said beaming i hadnt thought of that i felt stupid for not thinking of it too for no sooner had i spoken than a busboy stopped at the table to clear away some dirty dishes unlike our waiter he wasnt hanese he was stockier a litde darker and spoke his litde anglosaxon with a strong spainish accent a lot of the scutwork in angels city gets done by people from the south as sudalds had said more of them come here every year too times are so hard people so poor down in the empire that even scut work looks good to a lot of people angels city much of the confederations southwest used to belong to the empire of azteca the nobles some of them still plot revenge after a century and a half for that matter though most people in the empire speak spainish these days some of the old families there the ones that go back before the spaniards came go right on worshiping then own gods in secret even though they go to mass too quetzalcoau the feathered serpent is much the nicest of those gods believe me the old families crave the empires old borders too even if their own ancestors never ruled hereabouts they call our southwest azdan and dream its theirs the way immigration is headed in a couple of generations that may be true in all but name some people though might not want to wait so quetzalcoati judy asked what ideas have you had yourself think ing is hard work she didnt want to do it all herself for which i couldnt blame her i seized a big meaty mushroom on my chopsticks then said the peacock throne crossed my mind judy was chewing too she held up a finger swallowed then said yes i can see that especially since didnt you say you know some persian firms use that dump thats right sudalds told me so the peacock throne is the one which was wanned by the fundament of the shahan shah of persia until the secularists threw him out a few years ago st ferdinands valley has a large persian refugee com munity and if persians had been whispering in charlie harry turtledove kell s ear i wouldnt have any trouble getting a warrant from old maximum ruhollah either he was plus royal que ie roi if you know what i mean after the peacock throne the next possibility i thought of was the garuda bird project i went on aerospace and defense are siamese twins and a lot of defense outfits use the devonshire dump judy nodded slowly her eyes caught fire so did mine whenever i thought about the garuda bird up till now no ones ever found a sorcerous way to get us off earth and physically into space people have even talked about trying to do it with pure mechanicals though anybody whod fly a mechanical in a universe full of mystic forces is crazier than any three people i want to deal with but the garuda bird project links the ancient hindu bird with the most modern western spellcasting tech niques before long if everything goes as planned well try visiting the moon and the worlds in person not just by astral projection theres a goodsized hind community up in the valley too judy said thats true it was but i didnt know how much it meant angels city and its metropolitan area are so big they have goodsized communities from just about every nation on earth if god decided to build the tower of babel now hed put it right here the schools for instance have to try to teach lads who speak close to a hundred different languages and some towns have laws that signs have to be at least partly in the roman alphabet so police firefighters and exorcists can find the places in case of emergency i ate another mushroom then said any more ideas i didnt have any others until you mentioned the peacock throne judy said but that made me think of something else she didnt go on she didnt look as if she wanted to well i asked at last she looked around and lowered her voice before she spoke maybe she didnt want anybody but me hearing theres the peacock throne but theres also the peacock angel case of the toxic spell dump not everybody especially in this part of the world would have taken her meaning but while neither one of us is a sor cerer we both deal with the other side as much as a lot of people who make a good living at wizardry i felt a chill run up my back the peacock angel is a euphemism the persians use for satan judy i hope youre wrong i told her so do i she said believe me so do i i remembered the knot of stirring flies id seen in the dump beelzebub is very high up or low down depending on how you look at things in the infernal hierarchy and that nothing had i really seen it or was it just jitters at being in a literally spooky place if it was real what or who caused it those were interesting thoughts i didnt like any of them suddenly a little bit of nothing seemed to fall like a cloak over the warm comfortable restaurant i didnt want to be there any more i waved for the bill pulled money from my wallet to cover it and left in a hurry judy didnt argue even euphemisms can bring trouble in their wake my flat felt like a fortress against our gloom as soon as id locked the door and touched the mezuzah that warded it judy came into my arms we hugged hard just holding each other for a long time then she said why dont you bring me another bottle of beer when i got back from the icebox with it shed taken from her purse two small alabaster cups thin to the point oftrans lucency into each she poured a little powder from a vial she carried id once asked the ingredients of the cup of roots and shed told me gum of alexandria liquid alum and gar den crocus mixed with beer it was a contraceptive that dated back to the ancient egyptians i was convinced it worked not only had it never failed us how many ancient egyptians have you seen lately just to be safe though i also followed plin s advice and kept the testicles and blood of a dunghill cock under my bed unlike the old romans mine were sealed in glass so they wouldnt prove contraceptive merely by stinking prospective partners out of die bedroom harry turtledove if you ask me making love especially with someone you do love is the most sympathetic magic of au afterwards i asked judy do you want to stay the night i admit i had an ulterior motive shes different from most of the women ive known in that she often feels frisky in the morning but that night she shook her head td better not id have to take the cup of roots again if you wanted me and i dont want to drink beer and then steer a carpet through rushhour traffic okay i hope i gave in with good grace if you love somebody not least for having a good head on her shoulders youd better not get annoyed when she uses it she went into the bathroom came back and started to get dressed then stopped and looked over at me could we tiy again tonight tr is probably the operative word but i was off the bed like a shot and heading for the kitchen woman youll run me out of beer and make me go up with the window shade but youre nice to have around good she said a smile in her voice beer in hand i hur ried back toward the bedroom her nice sensible head was not the only reason i loved her no indeed ii judy did end up staying the night because she didnt feel like flying after two rounds of the cup of roots in case youre wondering how we did the second time its none of your business no hankypanky in the morning though we were both up early her to go back to her place and change before she headed for work me to to the parchmentwork id need to get a warrant from judge ruhollah after a fast breakfast i walked her out to her carpet as i said i dont live in the best neighborhood then went back to my own and headed for the criminal and magical courts building downtown the commute downtown wasnt too bad but parking in the heart of angels city is outrageously expensive even though they stack carpets up higher than youd see in a rug harry turtledove merchants bazaar i was almost as upset as if id had to pay with my own money not the epas you want to see every kind of human being any land of god ever made go the the criminal and magical courts building secular judges in black robes canon law judges in red ones bailiffs and constabulary and sheriffs looking more like soldiers than anything else defendants sometimes look ing guilty of everything in the world regardless of whether theyre only charged with flying a carpet too fast and others who from the outside might be candidates for sainthood witnesses doctors rabbis wizards if you like people watching you wont find better entertainment judge ruhollahs bailiff was a big swede named eric somethingorother i never can remember his last name though id dealt with him before he said im sorry inspector fisher but the judge wont be able to see you till about eleven somethings come up i sighed but what could i do about it i went over to the bank of pay phones across the hall from the courtrooms when i told the mouthpiece imp what number i wanted it suawked back fortyfive coppers please i pushed ange into the outstretched hand of the little pay phone demon which must be descended from mammon by way of the gadarene swine if id turned my back on it im sure it would have tried to pick my pocket after i called in at the office to say id be late i bought some coffee and cooled my heels in the cafeteria looking with one eye at the data id be giving the qadi and with the other at people going past two cups and another danish later i promised myself i wouldnt eat lunch it was a quarter to eleven i threw the parchments back into my briefcase and presented myself to eric again he picked up a phone spoke into it then nodded to me go on in i went how do i describe judge ruhollah if youre christian think of god the father when hes had a lousy eon i dont know how old ruhouah is not even to the nearest decade long white beard nose like a promontory case of the toxic spell dump eyes that have seen everything and disapproved of most of it if youre up before him and youre innocent youre all right but if youre even a little bit guilty youd better run for cover he glowered at me as i approached the bench had this been the first time id come before him idve been tempted to pack it in as a bad job either fall on my knees and pray for mercy not something maximum ruhollah handed out in big doses or else turn around and run for my life for whos not a little bit guilty of something but i knew he glowered most of the time anyhow so he didnt intimidate me much i began as etiquette prescribed may it please your honor though i knew it was just a polite phrase in his case i set forth the reasons the environmental perfection agency and i as its representative wanted to examine the records of the devonshire land management consortium you have supporting documents to show probable cause he asked he didnt have an old mans voice hed been in the confederation for close to forty years he was expelled from persia the last time the secularists there seized power for a while but hed never lost his accent i passed him the documents he put on reading glasses to inspect them just for a second he reminded me of die scriptorium spirit at the thomas brothers monastery before i could even think of smiling though his hard old face became so terrible that i wanted to look away i had a pretty good idea what hed come across and i was right he stabbed at the parchment with a forefinger shaking with fury it is an abomination before god the compassion ate the merciful he ground out the birthing of children without souls all should have the chance to be judged to delight with god the great in heaven or to eat offal and drink boiling water forever in hell this dump is causing the birth of soulless ones thats what were trying to leam your honor i answered finding out just who dumps there which is what the warrant seeks will help us determine that this cause is worthy and just judge ruhollah declared harry turtledove pursue it wherever it may lead he inked a quill and wrote out the warrant in his own hand signing it at the bottom in both our own alphabet and the arabic pothooks and squig gles hed grown up with i thanked him and got out of there in a hurry his wrath was frightening to behold as i went back to where my car pet was parked i skimmed through the document hed given me when i was finished i whistled softly under my breath if id wanted to i could have closed down the dev onshire dump with that warrant of course if id tried it the consortiums lawyers would have descended on me like a flock of vampires and gotten the whole thing thrown out i didnt want that so i planned on carrying out the strictly lim ited search id already had in mind bather to my own surprise i was virtuous enough to slap lunch i just headed straight for the valley the sooner i served the warrant the sooner i could i hoped start find ing answers thanks to a stupid publicity stunt i got stuck in traffic in hollywood if you ask me stunts by the side of the freeway ought to be illegal it goes slow enough without diem but no one of the light and magic companies was releasing a spectacular called st george and the dragon so nothing would do but to have one of their tame dragons roast a swordswinging stunt man right where everybody could stop and stare and ooh and ahh people who actually had to go someplace me for instance got stuck right along with the rubbernecking fools behind the stunt man in his flameretardant chain mail stood a blonde who wasnt wearing enough to retard flames the dragon was web trained he didnt breathe fire anywhere near her even so i wondered what she was doing there she wasnt the sort of maiden i pictured sfc george rescuing if theyd been making perseus and andromeda maybe but st george well thats hollywood for you i made good time after i finally put dragon stunt man and bimbo behind me i parked in the lot across from the devonshire dump id used the day before this time the case of the toxic spell dump security guard was on the phone before i got across the street he came out of his cage started wheeling back the gate mr sudalds is expecting you sir he said thanks i crossed the wooden footbridge went into the dump site sure enough tony sudalds was already on his way out to greet me i still wasnt sure whose side he was on but he brought a lot of energy to whichever one it was how may i be of assistance to you today inspector fisher he asked in a loud formal voice that said he knew what was coming i produced die parchment and did my best to speak in ringing tones myself mr sudalds i have in my possession and hereby serve you with this warrant of search issued by judge ruhollah authorizing me to examine certain records of your business let me see this warrant he said i passed it to him i thought his scrutiny would be purely pro forma but he read every word when he spoke again he didnt sound formal at all you do everything this parchment says you can do and youll break us to bits maybe id better call our legal team i held up a hasty hand i dont intend to do or seek any more than we talked about yesterday is that still agreeable to you light the candle or cast the spell mr sudalds lets go to my office he said after a pause tike the ones id been hearing from charlie kelly ill show you where the client lists are stored by the time i thought to look for the nothing i might have seen the day before i was already past the place on the walk where id noticed it i had more concrete things on my mind anyhow sudalds pulled open a file drawer here are clients who have used our facility in the past three years inspector fisher i started pulling out folders i will copy these parchments and return the originals to you as soon as possible mr sudalds we were both talking with half a mind for the lis tener in his office i asked does this list also include the spells and thaumaturgical byproducts each of die consortia and individuals stated were assigned for containment here harry turtledove no not all of them thafs a separate form you know he glanced down at the warrant he was still holding we didnt discuss those lists yesterday this thing he waved the warrant grves you the authority to go fishing until and unless our people try to quash it shall i make the phone call now i pointed to the amber amulet he wore it made a small lump under his shirt he nodded pulled it out went through his little ritual i wondered again what language he was using as soon as he nodded a second time i said look tony you know as well as i do that finding out whats in here will help us leam whafs leaking yeah but we didnt talk about it yesterday he looked stubborn i talked fast i know we didnt if you want to play all con sortiate you can lick me on this one for a while but how wib you feel when you read the next little story in the valley section of the tines about a kid whos going to vanish out of the universe forever some time in the next fifty or seventy or ninety years you fight dirty he said with a fierce scowl only if i have to i answered youre the one who told me you wanted to keep this site safe did you mean it or was it so much fairy gold he looked at his watch it must have been a new one because he didnt ask me what time it was after about a minute and a half he said very well inspector fisher i shall comply with your demand clearly we were out from under the rose more folders followed too many for me to cany having decided to be helpful tony was very helpful he got me a wheeled cart so i could trundle them down die path and out to my carpet i said i hope losing these wont inconven ience your operation i wouldnt give em to you if it did he said i have copies of everything the re magically made of course so they arent acceptable to you but theyll keep this place running until i get the originals back i didnt say that might be a while if we ended up going to case of the toxic spell dump court again to seek a closure order the parchments would be sequestered for months maybe for years if the dumps legal staff used all the appeals they were entitled to sudalds had to know that too but he seemed satisfied he could go on doing what he needed to do so i didnt push him he even trundled the cart out to the entrance for me when we got there a slight hitch developed the cart was too wide to go over the footbridge cant i just stand on one side of the line and you on the other i asked you can pass the documents out to me ifs not that simple sudakis said go on outside id show you i crossed the bridge stepped a couple of feet to one side of it sudalds made as if to pass me a folder i made as if to reach for it our hands came closer and closer to one another but wouldnt touch sudalds chuckled asymptotic zone you see the footbridge is insulated so it cleaves a path right on through we do take containment seriously dave so i notice even if anything was on the rampage in the dump that zone would go a long way toward keeping it inside where it belonged when i leaned toward sudalds above the footbridge he had no trouble passing me the files i turned to the security guard do you have twine i dont want these blowing away after i load them onto my carpet tlemme look he went back into his cage and came back out with not only a ball of twine but also a scissors i hadnt expected even that much cooperation so i was doubly glad to get it sudalds watched me tie parcels for a minute or two then said im going back to work now that youve officially taken these documents you understand im going to have to notify my superiors about what youve done yes of course i said decent of him to remind me though i thought he really might be on my side or at least not altogether on the side of his company i carted the documents across the street to my carpet i needed three trips like anybody i had storage pockets sewn on but the great pile of parchments overwhelmed them i dont know what i would have done if the guard hadnt had harry turtledove any twine sat on some of the folders and hung onto others i suppose until i flew by a sundries store where i could buy some for myself you see people doing that every day but ifs neither elegant nor what youd call safe back to my westwood office then when i got there i discovered the elevator shaft was out of order some idiot had managed to spill a cup of coffee on die words and sigil that controlled khil a mage stood in the shaft readying a new compact with the demon but readying didnt mean ready i had to haul my parchments up the fire stairs you wouldnt want to be in an elevator shaft when the controlling parchment bums would you slide back down and then climb the stairs again with the other half of my load i was not pleased with die world when i finally plopped die last parcel down by my desk i was even less pleased when i saw what lurked on that desk my report about die spilled fumigants all covered over widi red scribbles that meant i wasnt going to get to die documents id so laboriously lugged upstairs by quitting time i drought diey were a lot more important dian die report but my boss didnt see dungs diat way sometimes i wish i were triplets then i might keep my desk dean maybe the office access spirit appeared in die ground glass when i called it i held up die pages one by one so it saw all die changes dien said write me out a fresh version on parch ment if you please very well the spirit said grumpily it likes playing widi words but has die attitude diat actually dealing widi die material world and getting diem down in permanent form is somehow beneadi it it asked me shall i dien forget die version you had me memorize yesterday dont you dare i said and dien because it was literal minded i added a simple no my boss had die habit of making changes and dien going back and deciding shed radier have diings die first way after all yes i know ifs a female cliche but she really was a woman and she really was like diat judy now judy is more decisive dian ill ever be case of the toxic spell dump after die spirit promised it would indeed remember bodi versions of die report i waited for it to finish setting down die new one when diat finally wafted over to my desk i read it dirough to make sure all the alterations were accu rately transcribed dien set it in my boss inbasket for die next round of changes and dien it being about die time it was i went out to my carpet and headed home i took widi me die list of firms diat used die devon shire dump i left behind die forms diat showed what die d dumped diere diose would be more secure behind die offices wards dian the cheap ones my block of flats uses but i figured i could do some useful work at die kitchen table just grouping die firms by type that would also give me at last a start on knowing what sort of toxic spells were in diere after a dinner id radier not remember certainty nodi ing to compare to die lush hanese spread id enjoyed widi judy die night before i piled dishes in die sink gave die table a couple of haphazard wipes took out a sheet of parch ment and inked a pen dien buckled down to it the first dung diat hit me was just how many defense firms dumped at die devonshire site all die big aerospace consortia that have kept die angels city economy booming for decades used die place confederated voodoo its con voo diese days what widi die stupid and paranoid mania for clipping consortiate names into meaningless syllables whod waste time widi name magic against as diffuse an entity as a consortium north american aviation and levitation demondyne lold i wondered if byproducts from lolas fa mous cobold works were trying to triclde dirough die wards around die dumps some of diem might be very bad news indeed all die odier famous names along widi diem were a host of smaller outfits subcon tractors mosdy diat nobodys ever heard of except dieir modiers firms with names like bakhtiart precision burins portentous potions and essence extractions inc i looked at diat last one for a while trying to figure out in which square it belonged my transmogrifled list had evolved into a chart finally i stuck it in almost at random widi a name like harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump that it could have done just about anything another modem trend i despise along with the defense outfits were several of the holly wood light and magic companies when i thought about it that made sense hollywood has always been a magicinten sive business i wished i remembered which outfit had made the st george epic that had snarled traffic this morning i might have been tempted to try some name magic on it myself more because i knew it would be useless than for any other reason i was a little more surprised to find how many hospitals were on the list layfolk see only the benefits medicine brings they dont think much about the costs involved but healing bodies and especially working with diseased souls takes its toll on the environment like any hightech enterprise theres only one major carpet plant left in angels city the general movers looms in van nuys they dumped at devonshire too the gm plant wasnt high on my list of probable culprits though for one thing i had a solid notion of the kinds of spells it used for another its likely to close down in die next year or two too much competition from less expensive oriental rugs and what was i supposed to make of outfits called gall divided slow jinn fizz and red phoenix until i got back to the office to see what they were dumping i was as much in the dark about what they actually did as i was with essence extractions inc they sounded more interesting though i must say after a moment my eyes came back to red phoenix i underline the name just on the off chance the phoenix was a bird neither judy nor i had thought of the night before it would be worth checking out at any rate i started to call judy to tell her about it then remembered wednesday was her night for theoretical goetics shes only a couple of classes away from her masters initiation one day before too long i expect her to be writing grimoires instead of copyediting them having done as much on the list as i could do i tossed it back in my attache case read for a while and then got ready for bed through the thin wall of my flat i heard the fellow next door howling with laughter at whatever ethemet pro gram he was listening to one of these days soon i figured id break down and buy an ethemet set for myself theyre based on a variant of the cloning technique thats put telephones all over lately in the ethemet though they clone thousands of imps identical to a few masters whatever one of the masters hears each done repeats exactly provided youve chosen to rouse that par ticular imp from dormancy you can buy plugin imp modules that let you choose from up to eighty or a hundred different ethemet offerings at any one time more and more people all over the country are listening to the same shows admiring the same perform ers telling the same jokes unity isnt bad especially in a country as big as the confederation and i dont deny the advantages of being able to pass on news for instance quickly so why didnt i have an ethemet set of my own i guess the basic reason is that too much of what they spread is par don my latin crap not to put too fine a point on it id sooner think for myself than get my entertainment premasti cated go ahead call me oldfashioned when i got to the office the next morning the wizard was still working on the elevator shaft no i take it back more likely the wizard was working on the elevator shaft again what with everybodys budget being tight these days the government isnt enthusiastic about overtime i walked up to my office yes i know its good exercise it also wasted the shower id taken just before i left home and on my desk waiting for me just as id known it would be was my second draft of the report on the spilled load of fumigants i gave it a quick lookthrough not only had my boss changed about half of her revisions back to what i originally wrote shed added a whole new set something she didnt often do on a second pass and on the last page in green ink that looked as if it would be good for pacts with demons shed written please give me final copy this afternoon harry turtledove i felt like pounding my head on the desktop tliat cursed silly report which could have been and should have been two words long was going to keep me from getting any use ful work done that morning then the phone started yelling at me and the report turned into the least of my worries environmental perfection agency fisher speaking i said sounding as brisk and businesslike as i could before id had my second cup of coffee just as if i hadnt spoken my phone asked me you are inspector david fisher of the environmental perfection agency and i knew i was talking to a lawyer when i admitted it again the fellow on the other end said i am samuel dill of the firm of elworthy frazer and waite rep resenting the interests of the devonshire land management consortium i am given to understand that yesterday you absconded with certain proprietary documents of the afore said consortium even through two phone imps i could hear that capital c thud into place i could also hear mr dill building him self a case i said counselor please let me correct you right at the outset i did not abscond with any documents i did take certain parchments as i was authorized to do under a search warrant granted in confederal court yesterday inspector fisher that warrant was a farce which you must realize as well as i had you fully implemented all its provisions but i didnt i answered sharply and in case you have a listener on this call i make no such admission about the warrant it was duly issued in reaction to a perceived threat to the environment from the devonshire dump and surely you sir must admit examining dump records is not unrea sonable in light of evidence showing among other things increased birth defects in the community surrounding the dump i deny the land management consortium is in any way responsible for this statistical aberration dill replied as id known he would i pressed him do you deny the need to investigate the matter when he didnt answer right away i pressed case of the toxic spell dump harder do you deny that the epa has the authority to check records to evaluate possible safety hazards by now i ought to be old enough to know better than to expect straight answers from lawyers what i got instead was about a fiveminute speech no dill didnt deny our right to investigate but he did deny that the dump could possibly be responsible for anything even it sounded like the shadow the containment fence cast he also kept coming back to the scope of the warrant under which id conducted the search blast maximum ruhollah that warrant was the juristic equivalent of performing necromancy to get someone to tie your shoelaces for you i said counselor let me ask you again do you think my taking the documents i took was in any way exceptionable i got back another speech but what it boiled down to was no dill finished i want to put you on notice that the dev onshire land management consortium will not under any circumstances tolerate your use of that outrageous warrant to conduct fishing expeditions through our records i understand your concern i said which shut him up without conceding anything he finally got off the phone and i put the secondgeneration changes into that worthless hydraheaded report i was about halfway through letting the access spirit scan it when the phone yowled again i said something i hoped nobody noticed before i answered it turned out to be tony sudalds he said i just wanted to let you know my people arent too happy about my turning records over to you yesterday theyve made me aware of that already as a matter of fact i said and told him about the phone call from the consortiums lawyer i hope i havent gotten you into a pickle over this ill survive he said however much they want to they cant send me to perdition for obeying the law if you push that warrant too hard though things get more complicated than anybody really wants yeah i said still puzzled about where he was coming harry turtledove from the contemptuous way he dismissed higher manage ment made me guess hed worked his little charm with the amulet again but the message he delivered wasnt that dif ferent from dills id got somewhere pushing dill so i decided to push sudalds a little too you arent having any kind of trouble out there are you but sudalds didnt push perkunas no he exclaimed an oath i didnt recognize everythings fine here except for your ugly numbers believe me i dont like those any better than you do i said but theyre there and we need to find out why yeah okay he suddenly turned abrupt listen i gptta go bye he probably had done his little charm then and run out of time on it i pulled out my handbook qfcoetics and metapsych ics to see what it had to say about perkunas i found out he was a lithuanian thundergod was sudalds a lithuanian name i didnt know the lithuanians i read had been about the last european people to come to terms with christianity and a lot of them also remained on familiar terms with their old gods tony sudalds certainly sounded as if he was grunting i put the handbook back on the shelf anybody who uses it a lot develops shoulders like an olympiadic weighdifters if you hung two copies on opposite ends of a barbell you could sure train with em id just started my third stab at revising that blinking report when the phone went off again i thought hard about ordering the imp to answer that i wasnt there but integrity won a moment later i wished it hadnt inspector fisher pleased to make your acquaintance sir i am colleen pfeif fer of the legal staff of the demondyne consortium yes i said not wanting to give her any more rope than she had already inspector fisher i have been informed that you are investigating the sorcerous byproducts demondyne deposits in the devonshire containment area among others thats correct counselor may i ask who told you id expected calls from some of the consortia that dumped at devonshire id also expected nobodys lawyer case of the toxic spell dump would say anything so bald as that but i hadnt expected to get the first one by half past nine of the morning after i searched like any lawyer worth a prayer mistress pfeiffer was bet ter at asking questions than answering them she went on as if i hadnt spoken i want you to note two areas of concern of demondynes inspector fisher first as you must be aware byproduct information can be valuable to competi tors second much of our work is defenserelated some of the information you have in your possession might prove of great interest to foreign governments an appropriate secu rity regime is indicated by both these considerations thank you for expressing your concern counselor i said i have never had any reason to believe the epas secu rity precautions dont do the job the parchments to which you refer have not left my office i am relieved to hear that she said may i assume your policy will remain unchanged and make note of this for the rest of the legal staff and other consortium officials such an innocentsounding question to have so many teeth in it i answered cautiously you can assume ill do my best to keep your parchments safe and confidential im not in a position to make promises about where theyll be at any given moment your response is not altogether satisfactory she said too bad i thought out loud i said counselor im afraid its the best i can do given my own responsibilities and oaths let her make something of that my phone imp reproduced a sigh maybe i wasnt the only one who thought i was having a bad day colleen pfeif fer said i will transmit what you say inspector fisher thank you for your time id just reached for the fumigants report i still hadnt had the chance to let our access spirit finish looking at it when the phone yarped again i took in vain the names of several christian saints in whose intercession i dont believe then i lifted the handset it was after all part of my job even if i was growing ever more convinced i wasnt going to get around to any other parts today harry turtledove no youre wrong it wasnt another lawyer it was the owner of slow jinn fizz an excitable fellow named ramzan durani id noted that as one of the smaller companies that used the devonshire dump evidently it wasnt big enough to keep lawyers on staff just to sic them on people but the owner had the same concerns the woman from demondyne and the fellow from the devonshire land management consortium had had for some reason or other i began to suspect a trend then i found myself with another irate proprietor trying to scream in my ear this one a certain jorge vasquez who ran an outfit called chocolate weasel i tried to distract him by asking out of genuine curiosity i assure you just what chocolate weasel did but he was in no mood to be dis tracted he seemed sure every secret he had was about to be published in the dailies and put out over the ethemet calming him down getting him to believe his secrets could stay safe for all of me took another twenty minutes i still wanted to know why he called his business chocolate weasel and what sort of magic he did in connection with it but i didnt want to know bad enough to listen to him for twenty minutes more so i didnt ask i figured i could make a fair guess from the dump records anyhow when i got around to them if i ever got around to them that all began to look extremely unlikely just as i was about to let the spirit start moving with the report again someone came into my office i felt like screaming go away and let me work but it was my boss so i couldnt despite my grumblings beatrice cartwright isnt a bad person shes not even a bad boss most ways shes a black lady about my age maybe twentyfive pounds heavier than she ought to be she says forty pounds but she dreams of being built like a lightandmagic celeb which im afraid aint gonna happen shes usually good about keeping higherups off her troops backs but she cant do much when charlie kelly calls you at home at five in the morning david i need to talk with you she said i must have looked as harassed as i felt because she added hastily i case of the toxic spell dump hope it wont take up too much of your time even talking business her voice had a touch of gospel choir in it she never hit people over the head with her faith though i liked her for that i said bea ill have that fumigants report for you as soon as the bloody phone stops squawking at me for three min utes at a stretch i looked at it expecting it to go off on cue but it kept quiet never mind the report she sat down in the chair by my desk what i want to know is why ive gotten calls from lold and convoo and portentous products this morning all of them screaming for me to have you pulled away from the devonshire dump i didnt even know you were working on anything connected with the devonshire dump she gave me her moreinsonrowthaninanger look the one calcu lated to make even an eighthcircle sinner get the guilts moreinsorrowthaninanger disappeared when i explained how charlie had gone around her to call me real anger replaced it if shed been white shed have turned red she said i am sick to death of people playing these stupid games mr kelly will hear from me and that is a promise doesnt he have any idea what channels are for she took a deep breath and deliberately calmed down all right so thats how you got involved with the devonshire dump why are these people phoning me and screaming blue murder because something really is wrong there by now i could ratde off the numbers from the thomas brothers scriptorium in my sleep and because im trying to find out what and i think because the devonshire land man agement consortium honchos arent very happy about that it does seem so doesnt it bea thought for maybe half a minute i still am going to talk to mr charles kelly dont you doubt it for a minute but i would say that however you got this project david you are going to have to see it through i thought the same thing the minute i first saw those birth defect statistics up at the monastery i answered all right im glad we understand each other about that harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump then from now on though i expect to be kept fuby informed on what youre doing do i make myself clear i almost sprained my neck nodding even if she werent my boss bea wouldnt be a good person to argue with and she was dead right here i said i was going to tell you as soon as i got the chance monday morning staff meeting at the latest its just that i waved at the chaos eating my desk ive been busy i understand that youre supposed to be busy thats what they pay you for bea stood up to go then turned back for a parthian shot in spite of all this i do still want the revisions on that spilled fumigants report finished before you go home tonight she swept away long skirt trailing regally after her i groaned before i had the chance to let the access spirit finish scanning the secondary revisions and let us not for get the primary revisions about which bea had later changed her mind the phone yelled for attention again after judy and i went to synagogue friday night we flew back to my place ive already remarked that my orthodoxy is imperfect really observant jews wont use carpets or any other magic on the sabbath though some will have a sprite trained to do things for them that they arent allowed to do themselves a shabbas devil they call it but such fine scruples werent part of my upbringing so i dont feel sinful in behaving as i do judys attitude is close to mine otherwise she would have called me on the carpet instead of getting on one with me when we were settled with cold drinks in the front room she said so whafs the latest on the devonshire dump i took a sip of aqua vitae let it char its way down to my belly then my voice huslder than it had been before i explained how all the consortia that dumped at devonshire were so delighted to have their records examined how do they know their records are being examined judy as ive noted does not miss details she spotted this one well before i needed to point it out to her good question i said approvingly i wish i had a good answer the people whove been calling me though sound like theyve been rehearsing for a chorus my voice to put it charitably is less than operatic i burst into song anyhow it has come to my attention that i gave it about enough vibrato to fly a carpet through judy winced for which i didnt blame her she tossed back the rest of her drink then got out those two litde porce lain cups i would have been more flattered if i hadnt had the nagging suspicion she was trying to get me to shut up whatever her reasons though i was happy to let her use up some of my beer and not too long afterwards we were both pretty happy later she got up to use the toilet and the spare toothbrush in the nostrums cabinet then she came back to bed neither of us had to go to work in the morning except for saturday morning services wed have the day to ourselves i thought we were sound asleep half tangled up with each other as if wed been married for years when die phone started screaming we both thrashed in horror she bumped my nose and kneed me in a more tender place than that and i doubt i was any more gallant to her i had to scramble over her to answer the phone my flats laid out to suit me when im there by myself which is most of the time i spoke my first coherent thought aloud tm going to kill charlie kelly who else i figured would call me at what ever oclock in the dark this was but it wasnt charlie when i mumbled hullo the re sponse was a crisp question is this inspector david fisher of the environmental perfection agency yeah thats me i said who the who are you i wasnt quite ready to start swearing until i knew who my tar get was inspector fisher i am legate shiro kawaguchi of the angels city constabulary that made me sit up straighten i was beginning to be fully conscious having judy pressed all warm and silky against my left side didnt hurt there either but what kawaguchi said next made me forget even the sweet presence of the woman i loved inspector fisher brother vahan of the thomas brothers monastery requested that i notify you immediately case of the toxic spell dump harry turtledove notify me of what i said while little ice lizards slith ered up my back judy made a questioning noise i flapped my free hand to show her i couldnt fill her in yet of what i repeated i regret to inform you inspector fisher that brother vahans monastery is now in the final stages of burning down brother vahan has forcefully expressed the opinion that this may be related to an investigation you are pursuing god i hope not i told him but i was already getting out of bed does he do you want me to come up there now if that would not be too inconvenient kawaguchi answered im on my way i said and put the handset back in its cradle on your way where judy asked indignantly mashing her pretty face into the pillow against the glare of the st elmos fire i called up so i could find my pants what time is it anyhow two fiftythree said the horological demon in my alarm clock tm going up to st ferdinands valley i rummaged in my drawer for a sweater angels city nights can be chilly as i pulled the sweater over my head i went on the thomas brothers monastery up there the one with all the damning data about the devonshire dump just burned down judy sat bolt upright the best argument id seen for staying home itwasnt an accident or they wouldnt have called you her voice was flat she started getting dressed too by then i was buckling my sandals brother vahan doesnt seem to think so from what the cop i talked with told me and the timing of the fire is wed suggestive is the word that comes to mind no i wasnt looking at her besides by that time she already had on skirt and blouse and headscarf you dont really need to bother with all that i said sleep here if you like ill be back eventually back if shed sounded indignant before now she was furious who care when youll be back im coming with you proceduraby that was all wrong and i knew it but if you think i argued think again it wasnt just that i was in love with judy though id be lying if i said that didnt enter into it but procedure aside i was glad to have her eyes along she was likely to notice something id miss and as far as in vestigating arson went id be pretty useless up there myself thats a job for the constabulary not the epa the freeway flight corridors were almost empty so i pushed my carpet harder than i could have during the day all the same some people shot by me as if i was standing still and one maniac almost flew right into me then darted away like a bat out of hell i hate drunks the one advantage of being a regular commuter is that you dont see a lot of drunks out flying during regular commuting hours its not much of an advantage but commuters have to take what they can get one of these days the wizards keep promising theyll be able to train the sylphic spirits in new carpets not to fly for drunks this is another one i wouldnt stake my soul on syl phic spirits are naturally flighty themselves and they hardly ever get hurt in accidents so why should they care about the state of the people who ride their rugs i pulled off the freeway and darted north up almost deserted flight lanes toward die thomas brothers monas tery toward what had been the thomas brothers monastery i should say it was still smoldering when i stopped at the edge of the zone the constabulary and firecrews had cordoned off fighting fires in angels city is anything but easy undines are weak and unreliable here simply not enough under ground water to support them firecrews use sand when they can and the dust devils which keep it under control for big fires though only water will do and it has to come through the cooperation of the other side the angeles city firecrew mages have pacts with elelogap focalor and vepar the demons whose power is over water most of the time that just means keeping the infernal spirits from har assing the mechanical system of dams and pipes and pumps that fetch our water from far away harry turtledove but sometimes like tonight the crews need more than sand can do more than pipes can give i was just showing my sigil to a womlooldng constable when one of the monastery towers flared anew a wizard in firecrew crimson gestured with his wand to the spirit held inside a hastily drawn pentacle i saw the mermaidshape within writhe hed summoned vepar then that mage had a job i wouldnt want incanting always in a desperate hurry drawing a new pentacle in the first open space you find never daring to take the time to do a thor ough job of checking it for gaps the summoned spirit could use to destroy you only military magic takes a tougher toll on the operator but this fellow was cool as an ice elemental he called on vepar in a dear and piercing voice i conjure thee vepar by the living god by the true god by the holy and allruling god who created from nothingness the heavens the earth the sea and all things that are therein adonai jehovah tetragrammeton to pour your waters upon the blaze there in such quantity and placement as to be most efficacious in extinguishing it and least damaging to life and property in this place before this pentacle without grievance deformity noise murmuring or deceit obey obey obey it pains me to cease the destruction of the monastics housed therein i felt vepars voice rather than hearing it like the demons visible form it was sensuous enough to make me want to forget from what sort of creature it really came the wizard didnt forget obey lest i cast thy name and seal into this brazier and consume them with sulphurous and stinking substances and in so doing bind thee in the bot tomless pit in the lake of fire and brimstone prepared for rebellious spirits remembered no more before the face of god obey obey obey he held his closed hand above the brazier as if to drop into the coals whatever he held i wouldnt have ignored a threat like that and im a mate rial creature to vepar who was all of spirit it had to be doubly frightening water suddenly saturated the air around the burning tower you could see fog turn to mist and then to case of the toxic spell dump rain the same thing had to be happening inside too the flames went out give me leave to get hence vepar said sullenly am i now sufficiently humiliated to satisfy thee the mage from the firecrew was too smart to let the demon lure him into that kind of debate without replying directly he granted vepar permission to go spirit vepar because thou hast diligently answered my demands i do hereby license thee to depart without injury to man or beast depart i say but be thou willing and ready to come when ever duly conjured by the sacred rites of magic i adjure thee to withdraw peaceably and quietly and may the peace of god continue forever between us amen he stayed in his own circle until the mermaidshape van ished from the pentade then he stepped staggered actually out i hoped the fire truly had a stake through its heart that mage didnt look as if he could summon up ten coppers for a cup of tea a slim asianlooking man in constabulary uniform came up to me inspector fisher he waited for me to nod before he stuck out a hand tm legate kawaguchias i said brother vahan asked for your presence here he affected to notice judy for the first time his face went from impassive to cold who is your ah companion here what are you doing bringing your girlfriend along on busmess he meant i said legate allow me to present my fiancee judith adier before he could blow up at me i added coldly myself mistress adier is on the staff of hand ofglory publishing as i feared magic might well be involved in this fire i judged her expertise valuable i gave him back an unspoken question of my own want to make something of it he didnt he bowed slightly to judy who returned the courtesy kawaguchi turned back to me your fears it seems are wellfounded this indeed appears to be a case of arson and homicide by sorcery i gulped homicide so it would appear inspector brother vahan informs me that eleven of the monks cannot be accounted for firecrew harry turtledove have already discovered three sets of mortal remains as die site cools further more such are to be expected may their souls be judged kindly i whispered beside me judy nodded untfl it happens you dont want to imag ine men of god men who worked for nothing but good snuffed out like so many tapers murder of a religious of any creed carries not just a secular death sentence but the strongest curse the sect can lay on which strikes me as only right kawaguchi pulled out a note tablet and stylus inspector fisher td be grateful if youd explain to me in your own words why brother vahan believes your recent work to be connected with this unfortunate occurrence before i could answer brother vahan himself came up i might have known nothing not even magical fire could make the abbot lose his composure he bowed gravely to me even managed a hint of gallantly when i introduced judy to him but his eyes were black pools of anguish as he stepped closer to one of the firecrews st elmos lamps i saw he had a nasty bum across half his bald pate i explained to kawaguchi what id been investigating and why his stylus raced over the wax he hardly looked at what he was writing later back at the constabulary station hed use a depalimpsestation spell to separate different strata of notes when i was through he nodded slowly you are of the opinion then that one of the firms in some way involved with the devonshire dump was responsible for this act of incendiarism yes legate i am i answered brother vahan nodded heavily it is as i told you legate kawaguchi so much loss here enormous profit to someone must be at stake so i see kawaguchi said you must understand though sir that your statement about inspector fishers investigations is hearsay while one directly from him may be used as evidence do understand that legate the abbot answered every calling has its own rituals i didnt really think of the case of the toxic spell dump secular law as opposed to that of the holy scriptures as a ritual system but brother vahan had a point a firecrewman with the crystal ball of a forensics specialist on his collar tabs stood waiting for kawaguchi to notice him when kawaguchi did the fellow said legate i have deter mined the point of origin of the fire he waited again this time just long enough to let kawaguchi raise a questioning eyebrow the blaze appears to have broken out below ground in the scriptorium chamber i started so did brother vahan even in the halfdark and in the midst of confusion kawaguchi noticed judy would have too i wasnt so sure about myself the legate said this has significance gentlemen the abbot and i looked at each other he deferred to me with a graceful gesture that showed me his arm was bumed too i said i drew the information alerting me to a problem around the devonshire dump from the scriptorium now i gather any further evidence that might have been there is gone the actual parchments from which you made your con clusions and from which you might have gone on to draw other inferences are surely perished brother vahan said heavily i confess i have given them little thought being more concerned with trying to save such brethren as i could too few too few i thought he was going to break down and weep but he was made of stem stuff he not only rallied but returned to the business at hand the data as opposed to the physical residuum on which they resided may yet be preserved much depends on whether erasmus survived the conflagration erasmus legate kawaguchi and i asked together the scriptorium spirit brother vahan explained he hadnt named the spirit for me when i was down there but that had been strictly business kawaguchi judy and i turned as one to look at the smok ing ruin which was all that remained of the thomas brothers monastery gentiy judy said how likely is that if the spirit betook itself wholly to the other side when the fire started there may be some hope the abbot said harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump the monastery is was consecrated ground after ad and thereby to some degree protected from die impact of the physical world upon the spiritual kawaguchi looked thoughtful thats so he admitted let me talk to the firecrew if they think its safe well send a sorceandrescue team down into the scriptorium and see if we cant save that spirit it may be able to give vital evidence without the corroborating physical presence of the parchments evidence taken from a spirit is not admissible in court judy reminded him thank you for noting that mistress adier i was aware of it the legate said he didnt sound annoyed though my guess was judy had just proved to him she knew what she was talking about he went on my thought was not so much for your fiancees investigation as for the facts relating to the tragic fire here for that the spirits testimony may veiy well be allowed youre right of course judy said one of the many remarkable things about her is mat when she has to concede a point she concedes it completely and graciously most people go on fighting battles long after theyre lost kawaguchi went off to consult with the firecrew i turned to brother vahan tm sony sir more sony than i could say i never imagined anyone could be mad enough to attack a monastery nor did i he answered do not blame yourself my son you uncovered a great evil at that dump that i knew when you spoke to me of what youd found now it has proved greater than either of us dreamt but that is no rea son to draw back from it rather it is more reason to work to root it out i had nothing to say to that i just dipped my head the way you do when you hear the truth rather to my relief kawaguchi came back just then a couple of men in red dashed into the ruins my eye followed them seeing my head twist kawaguchi nodded they will make the effort inspector fisher they have of course no guarantee of success of course i noted the understatement after a moment i went on with a question did you call me up here just to take my information or can i help you with what youre doing the former i fear unless you have resources concealed in your carpet which are not immediately obvious did the legates eyes twinkle i wasnt sure if he had a sense of humor it was drier than angels city in the middle of one of our droughts well then i said do you mind my asking you for as much as you can give me of what youve found out here the more i learn about how this fire started and the magics that went into it the better my chance of correlating those data with one or more of the consortia that use the devon shire dump thatll help me figure out whose spells are leaking which ought to help you figure out whos to blame for this burning ive worked with constabularies before constables are always chary about telling anybody anything even if the per son who wants to know is on the same side they are kawaguchi visibly wrestled with himself under other cir cumstances it would have been funny finally he said that is a reasonable request which didnt mean he was happy about it come with me then you may accompany us if you like mistress adier how generous of you judy said i knew shed have accompanied us whether kawaguchi liked it or not and gone off like a demon out of its pentacle if he tried to stop her the irony in her voice was thick enough to slice if the legate noticed it though he didnt let on i wondered if the angels city constabulary wizards had perfected an antisarcasm amulet if they had i wanted to buy one such foolishness vanished as the legate took judy and me over to his command post brother vahan tagged along without i noticed any formal invitation the firecrew forensics man was talking with his opposite num ber in the constabulary a skinny blond woman who had a spellchecker that made my little portable look like a three yearolds toy harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump i stared at it with honest envy as soon as kawaguchi introduced me to her she was chief thaumatechnician bornholm i asked how many megageists in that thing anyway she must have heard me salivating because she smiled which made her look a little younger and a lot less tough four meg active eighty meg correlative she answered wow i said beside me judy whistled softly i wondered when the epa would get a portable spellchecker with that land of power probably some time in the new millennium it would just about take the millennium for us to have the tools we need to do the job right the next century shouldnt be more than two or three decades old before were ready to deal with this one so what do we have in there kawaguchi asked bomholm was a good constable she glanced over to him and got his nod before she started talking in front of us civil ian types then she said even with the spellchecker this wont be as easy as id like on hallowed ground soreerous evidence has a way of evanescing in a hurry she turned her head in brother vahans direction the abbot here has a most holy establishment good for his monks and a credit to him but hard on the constabulary all right i wont expect you to hand me the case all sealed up with a papal chiysobull the legate said though i wouldnt have been sorry if you did tell me what you know about what youd expect in an arson case bomholm said strong traces of salamander rather weaker ones from the use of a blasting rod uhhuh kawaguchi said any special characteristics of the salamander that would help us trace it back to a particu lar source on the other side different rituals summon different strains of salamander had this been one of the unusual ones it could have told a lot about who called the creature to the monastery but tile thaumatech shook her head as generic a spell as you can find ten thousand campers use it out in the woods every day to get their fires going of course they tack a dismissal onto it too and that didnt happen here just the opposite in fact it was encouraged same with the blasting rod very ordinary magic hellfire kawaguchi said which wasnt literally true salamanders are morally neutral creatures but summed things up well enough bomholm hesitated then went on when i first set up i thought something else might be there too i wanted to stake down the certain arson traces before anything else though and by the time i came back to the other it was gone hallowed ground like i said fll take the rap for it it was my choice thats what free will is about kawaguchi said you did what you thought was best i presume you ordered the spirit to remember not just analyze we can do further evaluation later certainly bomholm answered with a what do you think i am an idiot look tacked on for good measure i didnt blame her not one bit she added the trouble is you cant evaluate what just isnt there i understand that kawaguchi smacked right fist into left palm in frustration i didnt blame him either there was the spellchecker with access and correlation capability on rela tions with the other side for everybody from achaeans to zulus and all stops in between with hordes of microimps inside to do the thinking faster and more thoroughly than any mere man could manage but as the thaumatech had said you cant analyze what isnt there legate the shout rang through the smoky night kawaguchi spun round one of the guys from the sorceandrescue crew had emerged from the ruined scriptorium his boots thumped on the pavement as he walked over to us he was sooty and sweaty and looked about half beaten to death but his eyes held triumph we made contact with that access spirit legate good news kawaguchi exclaimed thats the first piece of good news ive heard tonight what sort of shape is the spirit in i was just getting to that legate the sorceandrescue harry turtledove man said and some of the sudden hopes id got up came crashing down again he didnt sound what youd cab upbeat the spirits here its manifested enough so we can move it but its not in good shape not even slightly pre liminary diagnosis is that whoever set the fire went after the poor creature on the other side too poor erasmus brother vahan said with as much con cern as if he were talking about one of his monks erasmus oh the sorceandrescue man said then i dont think itb perish but its had a rough time hard to characterize torments on the other side but did it used to manifest itself with its spectacles cracked no brother vahan said and started to weep as if that was to him the crowning tragedy of all those which had befallen the thomas brothers monastery tonight i remem bered the fussy precise spirit and the neat little pair of glasses it had worn how could you crack lenses hat werent really there i suppose there are ways but i got queasy thinking about them we can run the spellchecker on this access spirit thau matech bornholm said maybe well learn just what hit the monastery by finding out how the spirit was tormented tor that matter simple questioning may yield the same information said kawaguchi who sounded ready to start asking poor abused erasmus questions right then and there if the sorceandrescue man would summon the spirit onto a groundglass screen but the sorceandrescue man shook his head nobodys going to run a spellchecker on that spirit any time soon any sorcerous nudge right now before it has a chance to regain some strength and itll be gone for good im not kidding a sorcerous nudge right now wih destroy uh erasmus and ill set that down on parchment the same goes for interroga tion if that spirit were a material being it wouldve gotten last rites because its not material it has a better chance of recovering than thee or me but i warn you youll lose it if you push i shall pray for erasmus recovery along with the recov ery of my brethren who took hurt in the fire brother vahan case of the toxic spell dump said and for the souls of the brethren who lost their lives he spoke slowly and with great dignity partly because he was that kind of man and partly to hold the tears back from his voice judy stepped up to him and put a hand on his shoulder he twitched a fade you could see how unused he was to having a woman touch him but after a couple of seconds he realized she meant only to comfort him he eased as much as you can when everything that matters to you is gone i wished id thought to make the gesture judy had i sus pect the trouble is that i think too much judy felt what she ought to do and she did it im not saying she doesnt think oh my no but its nice to be in touch with this side and the other side of yourself so to speak i turned to legate kawaguchi do you need us for any thing more here sir he shook his head no you may go inspector fisher thank you for your statement i expect we will be in touch with each other about aspects of this matter of mutual con cern i expected that too then kawaguchi unbent a little maybe a human being really did lurk behind the constabu lary uniform a pleasure also to meet your fiancee inspector a pity to drag you out of doors at such an unholy hour mistress adier especially on dark grim business like this i asked david to let me come along judy said and youre right this business is dark and grim if i can do any thing to help you catch whoever did it let me know im no mage but im an expert on sorcerous applications i shall bear that in mind kawaguchi said and sounded as if he meant it judy and i ducked under the tape the constabulary had put around the thomas brothers monastery and walked back toward my carpet the sun was just starting to paint the sky above the hills to the east with pink i asked my watch what time it was and found out it was heading toward six by my body it could have been anywhere from midmoming to midnight we fastened our safety belts and headed back toward the harry turtledove freeway a couple of minutes before we got there judy said i didnt know i was your fiancee huh i answered brilliantly the way you introduced me to legate kawaguchi she said oh that id just done it because it seemed the easiest way to explain what she was doing over at my place at two somefhmg of a morning i thought about it for a few seconds then said well do you want to be do i want to be what now judy was confused my fiancee sure she said and her smile was brighter than the sun which just that moment poked itself into the sky it wasnt the traditional way to answer a proposal of marriage but then i hadnt proposed the way id intended to either i really had intended to get around to it but i didnt know just when now seemed as good a time as any we held hands on st james freeway all the way back to my block of flats after a black night morning sun felt very fine indeed m when i got to work monday morning somebody ambushed me in the parking lot no its not what you think this fellow standing outside the entrance to my building called out are you epa inspector david fisher when i said i was he came trotting over to me stuck a glass globe in front of my face and said tm joe forbes angels city eth ernet station one news i want to ask you some questions about the tragic thomas brothers fire friday night go ahead i said peering crosseyed into the globe the imp inside had enormous ears mournful little eyes and a mouth that stretched all the way across its face id never seen an ethemet imp before forbes shifted the globe back toward his own mouth how are you involved with the thomas brothers and why harry turtledove were you called to the scene of the fire shortly after it occurred he held the globe out to me again id been using some thomas brothers records in an ongoing epa investigation and the constabulary were trying to find out if there was any connection between that investi gation and the fire i answered truthful enough but not what youd call forthcoming as i talked i watched the little imp in the globe its ears twitched with every syllable i spoke its mouth moved in a rather exaggerated parody of human speech ive never had any reason to leam to read lips but i didnt need long to notice it was echoing what i said about half a beat behind me it was transmitting my words back to ethernet station one either to one of its own clones that would relay what i said on to the master broadcasting imp so all the masters clones in peoples sets could hear or else to a listener that would speak them in front of the master imp at a time more convenient for the station crew joe forbes took back the globe do i understand cor rectly inspector fisher that an immaterial witness survived the fire and may yet provide important information about the case id talked to kawaguchi the afternoon before from what he said erasmus was probably going to pull through its ordeal though the access spirit wouldnt be in any shape to answer questions for a while yet actually erasmus didnt have any shape at all but you know what i mean i started to tell forbes as much but had second thoughts i didnt know how many people listened to the ethemet news but could i afford to assume none of the people whod burned the monastery did and if those bastards were listening could i afford to tell them theyd botched the job on erasmus they might try again and they might do it right the next time all this went through my mind in about the time it took to finish exhaling inhale and begin to talk if forbes had caught me on an inhale i must have just started talking before i stopped to think as it was i said i really think thats something you ought to take up with the constabulary they know more about it than i do case of the toxic spell dump forbes looked unhappy i guess he saw from my answers that he wasnt going to get any exciting revelations from me he asked a couple of innocuous questions then tried once more with something substantive what sort of thomas brothers records were you using in your own investigation maybe hed hoped id not notice that one was charmed and would blab away but i didnt i answered td rather not comment since the investigation is still underway the fellows laziness irked me as much as anything else if hed known this side from the other he could have gone down to the criminal and magical courts building and found the parchments id filed to get my search warrant but no he wanted me to do his work for him well i had enough work of my own i said as much tin sony mr forbes but i really have to get upstairs now thank you inspector david fisher of the environ mental perfection agency forbes boomed just as if id told him something worth knowing i pitied his poor imp it didnt look very bright but i wouldnt have been very bright after listening to and transmitting the mindnumbing stream of chatter forbes turned out id hoped to start getting some serious work done on the sorcerous contamination at the devonshire dump itself but i hadnt taken into account its being monday morning mon day morning under beatrice cartwright is a ritual that while not as old as the mass or synagogue sabbath rite is every bit as sacred the staff meeting monday morning everybody in die department sits around for two two and a half hours listening to what every body eke is doing about ninetynine times out of a hundred what everybody else is doing is to put it mildly irrelevant to what youre doing yourself and you could bet ter spend the time actually doing whatever it is you cant do while youre sitting around in staff meeting thank god were an agency not a department the way some people back in dstc want if we were a department wed probably meet twice a week not just once i mean in an abstract kind of way i was glad to hear that phyllis kaminsky was working closely with the constabulary harry turtledove to make several angels city streets less congenial to succubi vice of that sort does need to be combated but even if her report did earn phyllis a pat on the fanny from bea i didnt need to know all the ichorfilled details and i didnt need to know about the aerial garlic spraying jose franco was working on with some of the horticulture people at ucac to try to slow down the little vegetable vam pires that have played such havoc with the local citrus crop over the past few years ever since they got here in a cargo of imperfectly exorcised lemons from greece it wasnt that i had anything against jose or his project i dont want to have to pay three crowns for an orange any more than anyone else but just the same medvamps arent my biggest worry in the world for that matter even though people looked more inter ested than usual when i talked about the devonshire mess it didnt have a whole lot to do with their lives or their jobs but bea likes to soak it all in so every monday morning we meet world without end amen or so it seems in the middle of a staff meeting anyhow at last we were released i felt as if i were upward bound from purgatory no not a jewish concept but useful all the same i staggered off to the jakes with the staff graphic artist at least here i know what im doing i said as we stood side by side martin laughed and nodded hes about as fond of staff meetings as i am having accomplished at least one worthwhile thing that morning i went back to my desk to see if i could make it two i wished the thaumatech had been able to catch more about the incendiary sorcery that had torched the thomas brothers monastery it might have given me a better notion of which toxic spell components to be alert for and from that which consortia to suspect but if magic were just wishing life would be too simple to stand i made myself a new chart an expanded version of the one id done on my kitchen table the week before this one broke things out not just by consortium and type of business but also by specific type of contaminant in lieu of turning the chart threedimensional i assembled a neat battle line of quibs each case of the toxic spell dump in an inkstand of a different color to be sure i had enough id borrowed some from martins immense supply just when i was ready to buckle down to some serious work the phone yammered at me i didnt say what i thought but i thought it real loud that of course didnt make the phone shut up i spoke to the mouthpiece imp david fisher environmental perfection agency good morning dave tony sudakis calling good morning tony how are you half my annoyance went away at least the call had something to do with the case i was working on whafs up i heard about the thomas brothers fire over die week end terrible thing those are good people there we need more like em thats certainly true but here are less like them now eleven less i understand yeah i know a pause i was getting used to pauses from people i talked with which is not to say i liked them any too well once tony was finally done with his he went on i just want you to know that the devonshire land management consortium didnt have thing one to do with this fire i chewed on that found i didnt care for the taste as politely as i could i pointed out tony you can speak for yourself but how can you go about declaring your whole consortium innocent oh he could declare it sure but how was he supposed to make me believe it he surprised me he found a way that sort of worked the consortium management staff is contributing twenty five thousand crowns to the constabularys reward fond for the capture and conviction of whoever fired the place interesting i said and it was interesting enough to write down in fact figuring out exactly what it meant wasnt so simple the most obvious interpretation was that manage ment staff was innocent the other possibility was that somebody up there was guilty as sin and had found a particu larly devious way to cover his or even her tracks in the absence of further data i just had to note it and go on sudakis was dealing with my pause now into it he said you dont take anything on trust do you dave harry turtledove i trust in god i answered he has a more reliable record than most of the people i know life must be easy if you can honestly give all your alle giance to one omniscient omnipotent deity sudalds said but i didnt call you up to talk theology with you i wouldnt mind doing that over some beer one day but now now ive said what i needed to say and ive got the usual swamp full of alligators here he meant that more literally than most people who use the line and his particular swamp held worse things than mere alligators we said our goodbyes and hung up i looked at the phone for a few seconds afterwards maybe sudalds never had reconciled himself to christianity or to monothe ism generally that last comment of his made me wonder well the confederacy is a free country he could believe whatever he wanted as long as the didnt go burning down monasteries to make his point interesting i said again to nobody in particular and started squeezing the undines out of my own swamp id decided to note the contaminants from the smaller companies first before i taclded the lightandmagic outfits and the aerospace consortia if one of the little guys was dumping something spectacularly illicit my hopes was that it would stand out like a mullah in the college of cardinals i was amazed to see just how much nasty stuff some of the little guys messed around with take the outfit called slow jinn fizz for instance heaven help me they were using things there i wouldnt have expected to find coming out of lolas cobold works i mean they were stowing stovein solomons seals at devonshire you think for awhile about the thaumaturgical pressure it takes to deform one of those things and the likely effect on the surrounding coun tryside when you try it and youb have some idea why i noted that in red chocolate weasel had just as manynastinesses things epa men in most of the confederation wouldnt see once in a thousand years aztecian stuff almost exclusively my stomach did a slow flipflop when i saw one neatly written item on their dumping manifesto flayed human skin substitute case of the toxic spell dump as i think ive said before human sacrifice is officially banned within the aztedan empire these days but it used to be a central part of the aztedan cult one whole twenty day month of their old calendar tiaxipeualiztii say it three times fast i dare you means boning of the men and almost all of it had parades where priests capered around wearing the skins of sacrificial victims obviously death magic is some of the strongest sorcery there is but modem technology has eliminated the need that was formerly perceived for it proper application of the law of similarity lets the aztecians produce by less blood thirsty means the same effect they used to get from ripping the hearts out of victims but its still a daunting item to find on a form there are also rumors that some of the flayed skin substi tute isnt created through the law of similarity but rather through the law of contagion yes im afraid that means what you think it does the substitute material gains its effec tiveness by touching a real flayed human skin one hidden away since the days when such sacrifices were not only legal but required the aztecians spend a lot of time denying those rumors the epa spends a lot of time checking them we dont want that kind of sorcery getting loose in this country noth ings ever been proved but the rumors persist i noted that one down in red ink too chocolate weasel i thought would get a visit from some inspector soon if not me then someone else properly manufactured flayed skin substitute isnt illegal but it is one of the things we like to keep an eye on none of the other little firms that used the devonshire dump put anything quite so ferocious in it though i did raise an eyebrow to see how many roosters eggshells essence extractions was getting rid of cockatrices i said out loud the little creatures are dangerous and always have been ferociously expensive because theyre so rare but i wondered if these folks hadnt found a way to turn them out in quantity i looked thoughtfully at that manifest before i went on to harry turtledove the next one if essence extractions had found a way to pro duce lots of cockatrices they were sitting on the goose that laid the golden egg pardon the botched ornithological meta phor but ifs true and the dumping records gave some good clues on how they were going about it tony sudalds hadnt worded about confidentiality for nothing seeing the folks who are trying to thwart you as people just like yourself rather than the enemy in satanic red sometimes not just capital letters isnt easy youre better off dealing with them that way though because its surprising how often they have a point i knocked off at five slid down to the ground pickets were marking on the sidewalk off to one side of the parking lot pickets marched outside die confederal building about three days out of five touting one cause or another some times the people touting one cause run into those touting another and then mere can be trouble these particular pickets werent just marching they were chanting too hey hey waddaya say lets throw out the epa that flicked my curiosity i wandered over to see what they were upset about their signs spoke for themselves save our stbawbermesi was one another said stop aerial garlic spraying and a third better med vamps than turning my back yard into an italian deu i liked that actually even if i couldnt agree with it sometimes protesters will listen to reason i decided to give it a try remarking to a fellow with a blond beard you know if we let medvamps establish themselves here theyll wipe out a good part of our agriculture look what theyve done to the sandwich islands i dont care about the sandwich islands pal blond beard answered all i know is that as far as im concerned garlic stinks i have to smell itevery hour of the day and night and i think its making me sick and its gotten into my flying carpet and the sylphs dont like it any better than i do i may have to trade the stupid thing in and with the per formance shot i wont get near what its worth so there case of the toxic spell dump but i started blond beard had stopped paying atten tion to me he was chanting again i gave up and headed back to my own carpet reminding him that all the people in the spraying area had been warned to cover up their carpets or bring them indoors wouldnt have changed his mind it would just have made him angrier than he was already some people might as well be zombies for all the constructive use they get out of their free will as i started to fly toward the freeway i noticed a familiarlooking man holding a glass glove up to the mouth of one of the picketers it was joe forbes of ethernet station one thanks a lot joe i muttered thousands of people i had no doubt would hear about the imaginary evils of garbc spraying just as if they were thaumaturgically established i hoped hed have the integrity to interview an epa sor cerer or somebody from the citrus business too but even if he did the views of people who didnt know anything except what they didnt like would in effect get equal weight with those of folks whod been studying the problem since it first bared its teeth i sighed what could i do about it people out picketing and raising a ruckus were news regardless of whether they had any facts to back them up the freeway was jammed too which didnt do anything to improve my mood by the time i finally got home next morning i started adding to my chart some of the toxic spell components the aerospace firms dumped at dev onshire i hadnt been at it for more than a couple of hours before i saw id have to talk with my boss bea was on the phone when i went up to her office sometimes i think shes had that imp permanently implanted in her ear as soon as she laid down the handset i scurried in before the phone could go off again i tossed my still only halfdone chart on the desk in front other her eyes followed it down when she saw some of the things id written in red she gave a real live theatrical gasp good god in heaven are we actually storing these things inside a populated area she exclaimed raising a shocked harry turtledove hand her gaze lingered on the flayed human skin substitute even though its legal its appalling to contemplate looks that way i said and this isnt all of it by any means i wanted to ask you to let me do some afternoon fieldwork this week maybe talk to some of the people who use this stuff and see if there arent substitutes or even substitutes for the substitutes i added wondering if a secondgeneration ersatz skin would be magically efficacious go ahead she told me without hesitation she really is a pretty good boss do one other thing first though call mr charles kelly and let him know what sort of mess hes landed this office in ive already had words with him about that but you can emphasize it too if we have to holler for help from the district of st columba i dont want him to be able to say he wasnt warned in advance burning brimstone makes you think of demons bureaucratic finagling has a smell of its own too i went back to my desk and made the call when i got through to charlie he sounded jovially wary a combination implausible only to someone whos never taken his crowns from the government what can i do for you this afternoon david he boomed id expected him not to bother remembering it was still morning for me so i wasnt disappointed when he didnt youve hear about what happened out here over die weekend i asked it wasnt really a question for a second though he sounded as if it was only news out of angels city ive heard is that monastery fire he hesi tated just for a second i could almost see the ball of st ehnos fire pop into being above his head wait a minute are you telling me thats connected to the devonshire case i sure am charlie eleven monks dead of arson in case all the news didnt make it back east without giving him a chance to rally i pushed ahead my boss bea says shes already spoken to you about the way i got this case ifs big ger than you thought its bigger than i imagined when you dropped it on me you should be aware that we may have to have help from dstc if you do youll get it eleven monks jesus mary and case of the toxic spell dump joseph charlie being of the erse persuasion i thought that would hit him where he lived something else i said dont you think its time to level with me and stop playing coy about the bird who tipped you to the trouble at the devonshire dump this time kell s pause lasted a lot longer than a second even through two phone imps and three thousand miles of ether he sounded unhappy as he answered dave id tell you if i could but i swear i cant im sony i blew exasperated air out my nose hard enough to stir the hairs of my mustache against my upper hp okay char lie play a game with me then is your feathered friend from groups involved with any of these named the garuda bird quetzalcoad the peacock throne the pea cock angel and as an afterthought the phoenix more silence from charlie finally he said yeah the birds in there somewhere believe me im taking a chance telling you even that much so long and he was gone fester than a medvamp out of a korean restaurant nice to know one of the ideas judy and i had come up with was the right one it would have been nicer still of course to know which i thought about what hed said and as well as i could tell over the phone how hed said it maybe politics wasnt what sealed his lips maybe it was fear that was the first time i started getting a little bit fearful myself well onward no help for it unless i felt like quitting and if i did that not only would i not want to look at myself in the mirror but judy would drop me like something just up from he pit so off i went to slow jinn fizz the closest out fit id yet found that had a redletter contaminant on my chart the carpet ride up into st ferdinands valley took about twenty minutes slow jinn fizz was on the chief business fly way of the valley venture boulevard the address itself was enough to tell me the outfit had money the building argued for that too an elegant gray stucco structure with slow jinn fizz in neat gold letters on the plate glass window by the entry door underneath in smaller let ters it added a jinnetic engineering consortium harry turtledove aha i said before i walked in the combination of the name and the solomons seals discarded at the devonshire dump had made me figure jinnetic engineering was what slow jinn fizz was all about nice to be right every so often a dazzling blond receptionist as expensivelooking and probably as carefully chosen as the rest of the decor gave me a dazzling white smile how may i help you sir she asked in the land of voice that suggested shed do anything i asked i reminded myself i was engaged the smile congealed on her face when i pulled out my epa sigil id like to see mr durani please in connection with some of your firms recent dumping activities one moment inspector uh fishman she said and dis appeared into the back of the building ramzan durani came out a couple of minutes later in person he was a plump mediumbrown fellow in his mid forties who wore a white lab robe of persian cut and an equally white turban inspector fisher yes he said as we shook hands i gave him a point for getting it right even though his receptionist hadnt we spoke on the phone last week did we not thats right sir in a way this is about the same matter i thought it might be he didnt seem as volatile in per son as he had over the phone for which i was duly grateful please come with me to my office and we shall discuss this further the only thing ill say about his office is that it made tony sudalds look like a slum and tonys beats mine seven ways from sunday he poured mint tea gave me sweetmeats sat me down and generally fussed over me until i felt as if id gone back to my moms for rosh hashanah dinner i dont care for the feeling at my moms and i didnt care for it here either i answered it with bluntness devonshire dump is under investigation for leaking toxic spell components into the sur rounding environment we havent learned exactly whats getting out yet but i can give you an idea of how serious the problem is by telling you there have been three cases of apsychia in the area over the past year alone case of the toxic spell dump and you think we are to blame slow jinn fizz durani bounced no flew out of his chair his volatility was still there all right i just hadnt conjured it up in polite greet ings no no ten thousand times no he cried i thought he was going to rend his garment he didnt he contented him self with grabbing his turban in both hands as if he feared his head would fall off how can you accuse us of such an outrage how dare you sir calm yourself mr durani please i made a little pla cating gesture hoping hed sit down again it didnt work i went on quickly before he threw the samovar at me no bodys accusing slow jinn fizz of anything im just trying to find out whats going on at the dump site you dare accuse slow jinn fizz of causing apsychia he extravagantly wasnt listening i havent accused you i said louder this time have not im just investigating and you must admit that solomons seals are very potent magic with a strong poten tial for polluting the environment durani cast his eyes up to the ceiling and presumably past it toward allah they think i am destroying souls he said not to me he glared my way a moment later you wretched bureaucratic fool slow jinn fizz does not cause apsychia i we this consortium am are is on the edge of curing this dreadful defect i started to get angry at him then stopped when i realized what hed just said you are i exclaimed how in gods name in gods name indeed in the name of the compassion ate the merciful durani calmed down again so fast that i wondered how much of his rage was real temper and how much for show but that didnt matter either not if he really was on the edge of beating apsychia if he could do that i didnt mind him chewing me out every day and twice on fridays tell me what youre doing here i said please people have been trying to cure apsychia since the dawn of civiliza tion and probably long before that modem goetic technology can work plenty of marvels but that harry turtledove jinnetic engineering can accomplish things no one would have imagined possible only a generation ago durani said combining the raw strength of the jinn with the rigor and precision of western sorcery that much i know i said jinnetic engineering outfits have fueled a lot of the big boom on the bourse the past few years and with reason the only way their profit margins could be bigger would be for the jinni to fetch bags of gold from the other side but durani had found something else for them to do over there jinnsplicing he called it what he had in mind was for the jinni to take a tiny fraction of me spiritual packet that made up a disembodied human soul bring it back to this side and using recombinant techniques he didnt wouldnt describe join it with a bunch of other tiny fragments to produce what was in essence a synthesized soul which could then be transplanted into some poor little apsychic kid so you see he said gesturing violently it is impossi ble impossible i tell you for slow jinn fizz or any of our byproducts to cause apsychia we aim to prevent this trag edy to make it as if it never was not to cause it whether what he aimed at was what he accomplished i couldnt have said for that matter neither could he not with any confidence sorcerous byproducts have a way of taking on lives of their own but that wasnt what was really on my mind have you actually transplanted one of these uh synthesized souls into an apsychic human being i knew there was awe in my voice the same sort of awe the garuda bird program raises in me i felt i was at the very edge of something bigger than id ever imagined and if i reached out just a little i could touch it we have transplanted three so far he answered with quiet pride and i wanted to reach out all right reach out and pub the answer from him the transplants appear to have taken that is to say the synthesized souls bond to the body giving the apsychic a true case of the toxic spell dump spirituality he has never before known durani held up a warning hand the true test the test of judgment however has not yet arisen ab three individuals who have undergone the transplant procedure remain alive theory indicates a risk that the synthesized soul may break up into its constitu ent fragments when its connection to the body is severed at death we shafl research that when the time arises yes id think so i said a soul after all exists in eternity it lives here for a while but its primarily concerned with the other side what a tragedy it would be to give a living man a soul only to have him lack one when he died and needed it most worse than if hed never had one if you ask me and till that moment id never imagined anything worse than apsychia something else struck me what happens to the souls from which youre taking out your little packets are they damaged can they still enspirit a human being this is why we take so little from each one durani answered to the limits of our experimental techniques no measurable damage occurs nor should it for is not god not only compassionate and merciful but also loving and able to forgive us our imperfections maybe so but do your artificial imperfections leave these hmm sampled souls more vulnerable to evil influence from the other side the further i got into the case of the devonshire dump the more hot potatoes it handed me this new technique of duranis was astonishing but what would its environmental impact be the lawsuits i saw coming would tie up the ecclesiastical courts for the next hundred years you may think im exaggerating but i mean that literally for instance suppose somebody does something really horrible oh suppose he bums down a monastery and suppose hes able to convince a court that on account of the durani technique hes been deprived of or or of the soul he would have had otherwise is he fully responsible for what he did or is it partly duranis fault a smart canon lawyer could make a good case for blaming slow jinn fizz harry turtkdove or suppose somebody does something horrible and then dams as a defense that hes been deprived of part of his soul by the durani technique how do you go about proving him wrong if he is im no prophet but i foresaw the sons of a lot of canon lawyers heading for fine collegia on the profits of that argument alone and heres another one lets suppose the durani tech nique is as safe as he says it is and doesnt do irreparable harm to anybodys soul lets suppose again that his synthe sized souls have even been passing the test of judgment but nothing manmade can hope to match gods perfection what happens if a misassembled soul does break apart on death leaving a poor apsychic all dressed up with no place to go to what sort of recompense is his family entitled all at once i wished again that magic were impossible that we just lived in a mechanical world yes i know life would be a lot harder but it would be a lot simpler too the trouble with technology is that as soon as it solves a prob lem the alleged solution presents two new ones but the trouble with no technology of course is that problems dont get solved i dont suppose apsychics sud denly offered the chance for a better hereafter would worry about risks i wouldnt in their shoes i guess nothing is ever simple maybe its just as well if things were simple we wouldnt need an environmental perfection agency and id be out of a job caught in my own brown study id missed a couple of sentences when my ears woke up again durani was saying may develop a sampling technique to bring back compo nents only from what you might term mahatnws great souls those who have spirit to spare very interesting i answered and so it was though not altogether in the way hed intended it sounded to me as though he had some concerns over safety himself i won dered who his lawyers were i hoped he had a good team because i had the feeling the strong feeling hed need e is there anything further inspector fisher he asked one case of the toxic spell dump hed relaxed now i guess he only got vehement when he thought his interests were endangered a lot of people are like that thafs about it for now i told him whereupon he relaxed even further he thought the operative phrase there was thats about it i thought it was for now hed done something new and splendid all right but i wasnt sure hed ever realize any profit from it he hadnt had a lawyer at his beck and call the week before hed need one soon or more likely a whole swarm of them remembering his call reminded me how many i and bea had fielded all at once i asked my watch what time it was found out it was a few minutes before three i decided to go over to the devonshire land management consor tium offices and find out just how so many of their dients found out about the epa investigation so fast my sigil got me into the office of a markgrafin charge of consortiate relations a redheaded chap with hairy ears whose name was peabody he showed a full set of teeth undoubtedly kept so snowy white by sympathetic magic i wondered what would happen if a forest fire spilled soot all over the snow to which those teeth were attuned i give him credit he didnt try to cast any spells over me of course we notified our clients he said when i asked him my question their interests were impacted by your search of files at the containment site so we might have been liable to civil penalty had we kept silent all right mr peabody thanks for your time i said put that way he had a point i might have thought better of him if hed talked about loyalty instead of liability but how much can you expect from a mercenary in a fancy suit after that i headed for home i picked up a daily once i got off the freeway for the sake of the sport more than any thing else over in japan i saw the giants had beaten the dragons for their league tide and closer to home the angels and blue devils played to a scoreless tie might as well be real life i muttered when i saw that then i shook my head in real life the cardinals would never have been higher in the standings than the angels harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump but looking at the score gave me an idea i called judy feel like a zoroastrian lunch tomorrow i asked her she giggled sounds good but to make it perfect i ought to fly my carpet after all ifs an ahuramazda thats right you did buy an import last year didnt you i said but let me pick you up instead afterwards anyhow i explained what i was doing with my redletter list thatll be fine judy said nice you get a chance to be away from the office part of your day too bad it couldnt be mornings though she knows how much i hate staff meetings i smacked myself in the forehead i should have thought of that but listen to what i came across today i told her about ramzan durani and slow jinn fizz thats exciting she breathed to give those poor people hope have they worked ao the gremlins out of the process i couldnt tell you durani talks like he has but its his operation so youd expect him to yes judy said of course even if he has the moment anything goes wrong the lawyers will say he hasnt the spiri tual implications are overwhelming is the word that comes to mind you know one of the reasons i love you i said she didnt answer just waited for me to go on so i did you see implications so many people dont they just go oh how marvelous without stopping to think what their marvels end up costing them thank you she said her voice surprisingly serious that doesnt sound anywhere near as romantic as some thing like you have beautiful eyes but i think it gives us a much better promise of lasting i feel the same way about you just so you know what that i have beautiful eyes i said she snorted i added besides i told you that was just one of the reasons i wish you were here right now so we could try one of the others now what might that be she sounded so perfectly innocent she was perfectly unbelievable she didnt even believe herself i wish i were over there too honey but tve got to finish working out this astrology problem for my class reconciling western and hanese systems is a bitch and a half ill see you tomorrow for lunch twelvethirty all right sounds good bye judy works in a part of east ac where you hear spaimsh spoken in the streets about as often as english the rage for zoroastrian diners has reached even there though next year no doubt the ll be passe right now theyre fun the one trouble with those places is that judy and i cant enjoy them to the fullest because a lot of their dishes feature deviled ham we managed though i ate angelhair pasta and devflsfood cake while she had a devfledeggsalad sandwich and angelfood cake just names sure but names have power so where are you going this afternoon judy asked while we waited for the waitress to bring us our lunches up to lold in burbank i said i have the feeling their parchmentwork didnt report half of what theyre dumping they have a real reputation for secrecy nobody except them and the military knows what goes on at the cobold works up in the desert and nobody at all it looks like knows or will say what comes out of the cobold works theyre working in the garuda bird project too arent they judy said thafs right and if you think im going up there partly so i can learn more about that youre right i admitted space travel has fascinated me ever since the first magic mir ror let us see the far side of the moon back when i was a kid the girl carried our plates over to us just then thanks i said as she set them down because she looked as if shed un derstand it better i added grocias de nada senor she answered smiling she hardly seemed old enough to be working fall time maybe she wasnt people who come up to angels city to get away from azteca find out soon enough that the sidewalks arent paved with gold here either they do what they can to get by same harry turtledove as my greatgrandparents did a hundred years ago most of them will it was a pleasant lunch any time with judy was pleasant but the good food and the chance to be out and about in the middle of the day shed been right about that the night before just added to it i hated to leave but she had to get back to work and i needed to be at the lold plant early enoughin the afternoon to do some useful work i parked my carpet in the loading zone in front of hand ofglorys office kissed judy goodbye before i took off it was a pretty thorough kiss if i say say myself this tenyear old who should have been in school made disgusted noises as he walked by i didnt care give him a few more years and hed find out about the sweet magic between man and woman i waited there till i saw judy safe indoors then headed up the golden province freeway to burbank the lold works werent far from the tede airport there they were big and sprawledout enough to have separate buildings and lots for each of the consortiums many projects i flew around till i found a sign that said space division and had a stylized garuda bird under it i parked my carpet as dose to die sign as i could then walked off some of my lunch hiking toward the entrance inside where they didnt show from the parking lot were guards armed with pistols and holy water sprayers i pre sented my epa sigil even though id phoned ahead in the morning i could see how litde ice it cut here the guards were ready to take on major foes from this side or the odier one bureaucrat wasnt worth getting excited about which is not to say diey werent diorough they turned a spellchecker on my sigil to make sure it wasnt forged and hadnt been tampered widi one of diem carefully compared die image on my flying license to my face the odier waited tffl die first was done dien called my office to confirm i really did work diere he didnt ask me for die number he looked it up himself only when they were satisfied did diey phone deeper into die building magister arnold will come to escort you case of the toxic spell dump shordy sir one of diem said here is your visitors talis man he pinned it on me then added once you pass dirough diat door the demon in die talisman wib be roused and will sting you if you get more dian fifteen feet away from magister arnold just so you know sir what happens if i need to use a toilet i asked magister arnold must accompany you to die facility sir he answered unsmiling the guy outside die devonshire dump had billed himself as a security guard this lold fellow reallywas one i found another question suppose i ditch the talisman once i go inside first sir any attempt to do so would rouse die demon second once inside die door diere die talisman will weld itself to your dodiing and remain bonded to it until you emerge if youre a good enough sorcerer sir you can beat die talisman but youll set off a great many alarms in die process and will be apprehended in short order dont want to beat it and i dont want to be appre hended i said i was just curious the guard nodded polite but unconvinced his job was being unconvinced and he was real good at it magister arnold came out a couple of minutes later he was a big rangy fellow in his midfifties in a lab robe almost as fancy as ramzan duranis call me matt he said after we shook hands come along widi me now i came along the door closed behind us i gave die talis man a surreptitious yank sure enough it was stuck to die front of my shirt id figured it would be lold took security seriously i found out just how seriously when we got to die door of arnolds office it was hermetically sealed now i grant you diat hermes is a good choice of protector for an aerospace office in his wingfoot aspect hes naturally related to flight sciences and who better to propitiate in a security system dian die patron deity of thieves but merdful heavens die expense a security system isnt just a seal die backup is a lot more important maintaining a whole cult at a level sufficient to keep its god active and alert harry turtkdove will kill you with priests fees fanes sacrifices what have you i wondered how much of the bill lold was paying itself and how much it was passing on to the taxpayer somehow cost overruns never turn out to be anybodys fault the re just there like crabgrass and about as hard to weed out be that as it may magater arnold rubbed the toggle that served as the door herms erect phallus the herm must have recognized his touch for it smiled and the door came open it dosed behind us with a definitivesounding snick cof fee arnold asked waving to a pot that sat on top of a little asbestos salamander cage no thanks i answered id just as soon drink vitriol as muck that was reheating all day and besides you really dont feel like following me down the hall if i have to use the mens room do you oh yes of course thaft right youre wearing a visitors talisman arent you i hope you dont mind if i have a cup at my inviting wave arnold poured himself one it looked as thick and dark and oily as id figured it would even the fumes were enough to make my nostrils twitch when he set the cup down he asked so what have we done thats brought the epa down on us he didnt say this time but you could hear it behind his words i dont know that youve done anything i answered i do know that somebodys spells are leaking out of the dev onshire dump and i also know that whoever that somebody is hes murdered monks to keep his secret that got arnolds instant and complete attention his eyes gripped me like the romanian giants eastern european sor cerers use to handle magical apparatus they wouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole he was quick on the uptake the thomas brothers fire is connected to this affair is it he said a bad business very bad yes i let it go at that no need for him to know i was personally involved with the monastery fire i pulled out my chart as near as i can tell from this magister arnold loki puts more toxic spells into devonshire than anybody else and the ones i have here are those you admit to publicly case of the toxic spell dump for the record arnold said loudly i deny there are any others his tone was just as sincere as tony sudalds and told me a listener was in there with us i liked that tone even less from the magister because i knew he wasnt on my side while i hoped sudalds was all arnold wanted to do was play with his projects whatever they happened to be it wasnt that i doubted their worth i didnt as ive said im demons for the space program my self but nobody has any business fouling the nest and then pretending his hands are clean for the record i answered just as loudly and just as snotcily i dont believe you arnold glared my guess was that nobod d talked to him like that for a while i let him steam for a few seconds then said are you seriously telling me nothing too secret to get into your era forms goes on at the cobold works what cobold works he said but he couldnt keep a twinkle from his eye that the establishment in the desert exists is an open secret but his smile disappeared in a hurry ifits too secret to go into the forms inspector fisher its also too secret to talk about with you no offense but you need to understand that tm not out to betray our secrets to the hanese or the ukrainians i said you need to understand that and to understand that the situation around the devonshire dump is serious i tossed him the report on birth defects around the site as he read it his face screwed up as if hed bitten into an unripe medlar you see what i mean magister yes i do you have a problem there absolutely but i dont believe the lold space division at least is responsible for it if youll give me a chance ill tell you why go ahead i said nobody id talked to would even entertain the idea that he could be responsible for the leaks well i didnt find the idea entertaining either thanks arnold steepled his fingers more a thoughtful gesture i judged than a prayerful one he went on i gather this toxic spell leak is believed to be through the dumps containment system rather than airborne case of the toxic spell dump harry turtledove yes i believe thats true i said cautiously so he nodded as if hed scored a point thought as much im not breaking security to tell you that space division spells are universally volatile in nature with byproducts to match thats not surprising is it considering what we do i suppose not i said what exactly is your consortiums role in getting the garuda bird out of the atmosphere that did it he started rolling like the juggernauts car which considering the project we were talking about isnt the worst of comparisons lold was in charge of two project phases the second of which presumably because it dealt with air elementals had been split into two elements first we handle the new spells pertaining to the garuda bird itself arnold pointed to a picture tacked onto the watt behind him an artisfs conception of the bird lifting a cargo into low orbit with the curve of the earth and the black of space behind it even in a painting the bird is something to see think of a roc squared and then square that again well the bird could turn a roc into a pebble for a second i forgot about being an investigator and felt like a kid with a new kite the bird is magicintensive anyway arnold went on has to be or else that big bulk would never get off the ground but weve had to upgrade all the speb systems and develop a whole new set for upperatmospheric and exat mospheric work they do fine in similarity modeling pretty soon web get to see what the models are worth you with me so far pretty much so yeah i answered whats this other phase you were talking about something to do with sylphs thats right turns out our models show that maxq what maximum dynamic pressure on the bird he explained grudgingly and then because i still didnt get if added more grudgingly still maximum air buffeting oh id distracted him he gave me a dirty look as if he were a wizard whod forgotten the key word of an invocation just as his demon was about to appear in the pentacle when i didnt rip off his head or swallow him whole he pulled him self together as i was saying maxq on the garuda bird occurs relatively low in the atmosphere due to sylphic action on the traveler through the aery realm sylphs are like that i agreed always have been how do you propose to get them to act any different as i said before we have a twoelement approach to the problem he pulled a chart out of his top desk drawer and showed me what he meant if he hadnt been an aerospace thaumaturge he would have called it the carrotandstick approach as it was he talked about sylphesteem and sylphdiscipline sylphesteem i gathered involved making the sylphs above the garuda bird launch site so happy they wouldnt think about blowing the bird around as it flew past them like a lot of halfsmart plans it looked good on parchment trouble is sylphs by their very nature are happygolucky already and also changeable as the weather how do you go about not only making them even more cheerful than they were already but also making them stay that way if you ask me sylphdisci pline is a better way to go putting the fear of higher powers into the sylphs might well make the air elementals behave themselves long enough to let the garuda bird get through true you couldnt keep it up long sylphs being as they are but then you wouldnt need to tor sylphdiscipline to be effective timing is of the essence arnold said implement your deterrence activity too soon and the elementals forget the brief intimidation implement it too late and it is useless we are still in the process of developing the sorcerous systems that will enable us to ensure minimal sylphic disturbance as the garuda bird proceeds on its mission if youre still developing them am i correct in assuming that no byproducts from that element of your project would appear on my list of contaminants from lold let me check if i may he said he looked at my chart case of the toxic spell dump harry turtledove just as id looked at his no thafs not correct some of this activity with beelzebub comes from our shop i remembered die patch of flies at the devonshire dump and shivered a little dealing with beelzebub involves some of the most potent most dangerous sorcery there is i said sounds like overkill to me why pick such a mighty poten tate of the descending hierarchy to overawe the air elementals my guess was that asking the question would prove a waste of time that arnold would baffle me with technical jargon till i gave up and went away but he fooled me saying its really quite straightforward at least in broad outline we shall require the lord of the flies to inflict a plague of his creatures on the sylphs to distract them from the passage of the garuda bird you dont think small i said then something else occurred to me but whats to keep the flies from torment ing the garuda bird along with the air elementals magister arnold smiled dimly as i said ifs straightfor ward in broad outline details of the negotiations with the demon are anything but simple as you may imagine he is if you will forgive me hellishly clever yes i let it go at that if it were up to me id have come up with some other way of distracting the sylphs after a couple of seconds i said dont byproducts from a conjura tion involving beelzebub have a chance of sliding through the underground containment scheme at the dump they arent all volatile as you claimed before i suppose thats true arnold sounded anything but happy about supposing that was true but he did it anyhow i give him credit for that he tried to put the best face on ifc you havent alluded to these particular byproducts as being the ones which are leaking however inspector fisher until you show me evidence that they are i hope you will forgive my doubts okay fair enough i said going around the edges of the dump with a sensitive spellchecker checking air and earth fire and water for sorcerous pollutants would blow charlie kell s request for discretion further into space than die garuda bird could cany it but that couldnt be helped not now i got up and started to leave id just about made it to the door when i remembered the demon imprisoned in my visitors talisman i turned around and headed right back toward magister arnold he was coming after me thanks i said dont mention it his voice was dry my own peace of mind is involved in keeping you healthy till you get out the door you know just think of all the parchmentwork id have to fill out if an environmental perfection agency inspector got stung to death by the lold security system i wouldnt get any real work done for weeks knowing the epa bureaucratic procedures as i do i was sure he was right about that then a couple of casually ut tered words sank in stung to death magister arnold i said gulping the security guard didnt mention that little detail well he should have arnold answered testily he must have noticed my face chance expression before you ask in spector we do have a permit to incorporate deadly force into our security setup because of the sensitive nature of so much of what we do here if you like i will be happy to show you a copy complete with chrysobull of that permit no never mind the assurance in his voice said he wasnt bluffing and if i wanted to check i could do it at the criminal and magical courts building but visitors should be warned before they enter the secure area sir theyd have more of an incentive for following instructions carefully oh it seems to work out all right we havent lost one in a couple of weeks the aerospace man had a perfect deadpan delivery at first i accepted what hed said with out thinking about it then did a double take and only then noticed the very comers of his mouth curling up i snorted hed got me good he led me out to the door by which id entered as soon as i was on the far side of it i took off the talisman now i could and all but threw it at the security guard you didnt tell me it was lethal i snarled harry turtledove if your intentions were good sir you didnt need to know he answered and if they were bad you also didnt need to know he should have been a jesuit after i got done gasping for air i slunk out toward my carpet then headed for home it was still early but if id gone someplace else and done my song and dance id have been late i was late the day before put the two days together i figured and theyd come out even it was the sort of logic youd expect after a zoroastrian lunch but it satisfied me for the moment because i was early i made good time on the way back down to hawthorne of course that left me rattling around my flat for a chunk of the afternoon im usually good at just being there by myself but it wasnt working that day i didnt feel like going out and going shopping besides with next payday getting close and the last one only a ghostly memory the ghouls had been chewing on my checking account i decided to do something to put crowns into my pocket not take them out i had three or four sacks of aluminum cans rattling around under the sink and in my closet i took em out carried em down to my carpet and headed for the local recycling center save the environment and save energy said the sign outside recycle aluminum i nodded approvingly as i lugged the cans over some programs sell themselves as being good for the environment when theyre not but recy cling isnt one of them the fellow at the center tossed the cans on the scale looked back at a little chart on the wall behind him give you two crowns sixty he said and proceeded to do just that the small change went into my pocket the twocrown note into my wallet thank you friend i told him any time he answered see you again soon i hope youre making some sorcerers life easier i let that go with a nod since i work for the epa i would have bet i knew more about it than he did recycled alumi num lets magicians use the law of similarity to extract more of the metal directly from the ore its a lot cheaper and more case of the toxic spell dump energy efficient than the alchemy they have to resort to when theyre working without any aluminum source to say nothing of the preposterous and expensive mechanical processes you have to use to coax aluminum free of the min erals that contain it were it not for sorcery i doubt wed ever have learned what a wonderfully useful metal alumi num is two crowns sixty wouldnt come close to paying the bill from the department of water and powers id found in my mailbox the bill was up from last month too the department a little dippedon notice said had gained approval for a three percent increase in salamander propitiation fees everything costs more these days the money id got for the aluminum cans would just about cover a hamburger though not the fries that went with it a golden steeples was right around the comer from the recycling center i went in there spent my dividend and a bit more besides it was a long way from a gourmet treat but when youre eating by yourself a lot of the time you dont care a newspaper rack stood just outside the golden steeples it used the same kind of greedy little imp that dwells in pay phones i stuck in the right change pulled out a times if id tried to take more than one the imp would have screamed blue murder i think its ashame the racks have to resort to measures like that but they do life in the big city back in my flat i opened a beer and drank it down while i read the daily one of the pagenine stories directly con cerned me brother vahan was appealing to the cardinal of angels city for a dispensation to allow cosmetic sorcery for one of the monks badly burned in the thomas brothers fire i prayed that the cardinal would grant the dispensation cosmetic sorcery can do maivelous things these days if the doctors and wizards have a recent portrait of someone before he was burned they can use the law of similarity to bring his appearance back to what it used to be function doesnt follow superficial form of course but a bum victim gains so much by not becoming a walking horror show trouble is the cardinal of angels city is a stiffnecked harry turtledove erseman who takes the mortification of the flesh and gods will seriously the story said he was considering brother vahans appeal tut the issuance of a dispensation cannot be guaranteed he was liable to decide god wanted that monk disfigured and who were we to argue with him that sort of attitude never made sense to me far as i can see if god wanted bum victims to stay ugly forever he wouldnt have made cosmetic sorcery possible but then im just an epa man not a theologian and especially not a catholic theologian what do i know st george and the dragon was splashed all over the entertainment section and i wondered what the cardinal thought about that i hadnt gotten a good enough look at the blonde by the hollywood freeway to tell if she was the one falling out other minitunic in the ads i wasnt about to go to the lightandmagic show to find out either that mis erable publicity stunt had cost them at least one cash customer when i got to work the next morning more pickets were marching out alongside the confederal building to protest the aerial spraying for medvamps i shook my head as i went up the elevator to work some people simply cannot weigh shortterm inconvenience against longterm benefit as soon as i got to my desk i started working like a man possessed had a priest wandered by he probably would have wanted to perform an exorcism on me but i banged through the routine parts of my job as fast as i could so id have time to investigate the devonshire case properly i wanted to get out to chocolate weasel that afternoon the bestlaid plans id just managed to get the wood on top of my desk out from under the usual sea of parchments and visible to the naked eye once more when the phone started yelling at me unlike some people i know i dont usually have premoni tions but i did this time what i smelled was trouble the phone hadnt given me much else lately david fisher environmental perfection agency mr fisher this is susan kuznetsov of the baronys bureau of physical and spiritual health case of the toxic spell dump yes id never heard other mr fisher im calling from chatsworth memorial hospital i was going to notify the st ferdinands chapter of the thomas brothers as is usual in such cases but due to the recent tragedy there that was impossible when i called the east angels city thomas brothers monastery i was referred to you why i asked my mind wasnt on the devonshire dump not that minute but then before she could answer i put together whom she worked for where she was calling from her likeliest reason for wanting to get hold of the thomas brothers and their likeliest reason for passing her on to me dont tell me mistress kuznetsov im afraid so mr fisher weve just had an apsychic baby bom here iv i dont know much about babies call it lack of practical experience give judy and me a few years and i expect well do something about that but not now oh my brother up in portland has a twoyearold girl and i have some little cous ins up there too but i can count on the smelly fingers of both hands the number of diapers ive changed so poor little jesus cordero the irony of the name struck me as soon as i heard it didnt look much different from any other newminted kid to me he lay on his tummy in the cra dle wriggling in a sort of random way as if he didnt really understand he had arms and legs and could do things with them the only thing in the least remarkable about him to the eye was an astonishingly thick head of black black hair his mother sat on the side of the bed by the cradle she harry turtledove was nineteen twenty something like that she might have been pretty if she hadnt looked so wrung out from giving birth her husband had a hand on her shoulder he was about her age dressed like a day laborer they talked back and forth in spainish i wondered if theyd entered the con federation legally and wondered even more if they truly understood what had happened to litde baby jesus in the room with them were susan kuznetsov a middle aged woman nononsense variety built like a crate and a priest he was a tubby litde redheaded fellow named father flanagan but he proved to speak fluent spainish himself in angels city thats a practical necessity for a priest these days any question about the diagnosis father i asked him not abit of it worse luck for the poor boy he answered listening to him i wondered if you could speak spainish with a brogue but all such frivolous thoughts vanished as he went on i was going through the nursery last night the way i always do blessing the newboms of my creed i came to this litde fellow and well see for your own self inspector he took off die crucifix from around his neck set it against die bab s cheek murmured a few words of latin thats not my ritual of course but i knew what was sup posed to happen because babies being new to die world are uncorrupt die cross should have glowed for a moment symbolic of die linkage between goodness on the odier side and die innocence of die babys soul not for nodiing did scandinavian converts speak of die white christ but nodiing was all we saw here the crucifix might have been merely metal and wood not one of die most potent mystical symbols on this side at its touch litde jesus twisted his head in die hope diat it was a milkfilled breast gendy his face sad die priest redonned die crucifix susan kuznetsov said fadier flanagan called me first diing dlis morning of course i came out immediately he repeated die test in my presence dien and i made odiers so as to be absolutely certain this baby diough odierwise healdly and normal possesses no soul tears stung my eyes having somediing so dreadful hap pen to a poor tiny kid whod never even had die chance to case of the toxic spell dump commit a sin struck me as horribly unjust not even satan got anydiing out of it eidier because when jesus cordero died hed just be gone what did it mean far as i could tell it meant only diat we dont understand die way dungs work as well as wed like to sir i said to die babys fadier his name was ramon his wife was lupe td like to ask you some questions if i may to see if i can learn how dlis unfortunate diing happened to your son sf ask he said he understood english even if he didnt speak it too well his wife nodded to show she also followed what id said the first thing i asked was dieir address i wasnt sur prised to learn diey lived within a couple of miles of die devonshire dump we were only five or six miles away there at die hospital then i tried to find out if lupe coidero had used any potent sorcerous products during her pregnancy she shook her head nada she said nodungat all i persisted contact widi magic is such a part of everyones everyday life diat sometimes we dont even think about it your medical treatments were all of die ordi nary sort she answered in rapidfire spainish fadier flanagan did the honors for me she says she had no medical treatments till birth she could not afford diem i nodded glumly diats the story widi so many poor immigrants diese days through die priest lupe went on the only diing even a litde different was diat i had morning sickness so i went to die ourandero for help speaking for himself fadier flanagan said probably somediing on die order of camomile tea few curanderos traffic widi anydiing important probably i agreed but i have to be diorough mrs cordero can you give me die name and address of dlis person i don remember she answered in english her face closed up i could guess what diat meant it was bound to be somebody from her home village back in azteda somebody she didnt want to see in trouble harry turtledove i tried again mrs cordero its possible the medicine you received had something to do with your giving birth to an apsychic child we have to check that out to make sure the same misfortune doesnt happen to someone else i don remember she repeated her face might have been cast in bronze i knew i wasnt going to get any answers out of her i caught father flanagans eye he nodded almost imperceptibly maybe hed tiy to talk some more with her later maybe hed just ask around in the neighborhood one way or another i figured before too long id find out what i needed to know ramn cordero bent over the cradle picked up his son by the smooth way he held the baby in the crook of his elbow i guessed it wasnt his first nifio imdo he said softly even more softly father flanagan translated beau tiful boy little jesus was a nicelooking baby enjoy him ab you can mr cordero i said love him a lot this is all he has heu have to make the best of it thats good advice susan kuznetsov said she dropped into spainish at least as fluent as father flanagans then returned to english for me i told him that many apsychics live extraordinary lives on this side maybe to help compen sate for not going on after they die artists writers thaumaturges what she said was true though shed just mentioned the good half theres pretty fair evidence that the leader of the alemans during die second sorcerous war was an apsychic and that he promoted the massacres and other horrors of the war exactly because he wasnt afraid of what would happen to him on the other side once he was gone he was gone permanently that wasnt the sort of thing you wanted to mention to an apsychics parents though the baby wiggled thrashed woke up with a squall about like what youd expect from a minor demon who doesnt care to be conjured up lupe held out her arms her husband set jesus in them i glanced down at my toes while she adjusted her hospital robe so she could nurse him the squalls sub sided to be replaced by intent slurping noises case of the toxic spell dump tiene mucho hambre lupe said hes very hungry she seemed pleased and proud as a new mother should no little jesus tragic lack hadnt fully registered with her i stood there for a couple of more minutes wondering ab the while if i ought to say something about slow jinn fizz maybe god wfflmg ramzan durani and his outfit could fill the vacuum at the center of little jesus cordero from what durani had said he could fill it what troubled me was whether he was creating similar but smaller vacuums in other souls he said not but even hed admitted his proce dure was stffl experimental in the end i kept my mouth shut part of that was not wanting to raise the adult coroeros hopes too much the rest was simple pragmatism even though baby jesus had no hope for eternal life odds were he wasnt going to shuffle off this mortal coil tomorrow or next year either he had the time to wait whfle the gremlins were exorcised from duranis jinnetic engtaeering scheme i wonder what i would have done if fd been dealing with a seventyyearold apsychic in poor health someone facing imminent oblivion would gaming that person a soul assum ing the procedure worked outweigh me harm inflicted on other souls in the process assuming it didnt work as well as durani claimed i decided i was awful glad jesus was just a baby lupe raised the little fellow to her shoulder patted him on the back after a few seconds he let out a burp about an octave deeper than youd think could come from anything so small when will you be going home from the hospital i asked her mariana she said td like to come by your home that afternoon if i could i said i have a portable spellchecker so i can begin investigating for toxic spells in the local environ ment and id also like a look at whatever potion you got from your curanderv i saw from her face that she didnt understand everything id said so did father flanagan he translated for me harry turtledove lupe and ramdn looked at each other no questions about nothing else he asked they were illegals then none i promised that wasnt my business hying to find out why their son had been born without a soul was swear it in gods name you don make no cross bamn said suspiciously father flanagan was giving me a questioning look too tell them im jewish i said his face cleared i was sure he didnt care much for my beliefs but thats okay i wasnt fond of all of his either but we acknowledged each others sincer ity he spoke way too rapidly for me to follow what he said to the corderos but they nodded when he was through lupe said you go you look you find out we trus you the padre say we can trus you he better be right he is i said and let it go at that if id taken another oath the corderos might have thought the first one wasnt to be trusted father flanagan nodded slowly understanding what id done susan kuznetsov said besides jesus there is a native born citizen of the confederation and entitled to all the protection of our laws when she turned that into spain ish the corderos beamed they liked the idea the woman from the bureau of physical and spiritual health quietly added i just wish our laws could do more for the poor little guy neither she nor father flanagan trans lated that i said my goodbyes collected mistress kuznetsovs carte de vistte and flew back to the office the elves hadnt magi cally cleaned up my desk while i was gone i didnt care it could stay dirty a while longer i picked up the phone and called charlie kelly the yammering at the other end went on for so long that i wondered if he was back from lunch yet it was well past two back m dstc where the demons did those con founded confederal bureaucrats get the nerve to keep swilling at the public sty like that all i needed was a minute of no answer on the phone to swell up and bellow like an en raged bub taxpayer when after all i was a confounded confederal bureaucrat my very own self case of the toxic spell dump environmental perfection agency charles kelly speak ing finally charlie this is dave fisher in angels city we just had another apsychic birth close by the devonshire dump that makes four in a little more than a year this isnt going to be a quiet investigation any more charlie im going to find out whats leaking and why no matter how noisy i have to get he kind of grunted do what you think necessaiy shit charlie youre the one who sicced me onto this im not usually vulgar on the phone and im not usually vul gar in the office but i was steaming now youre making it a lot harder than it has to be in what way he asked as if he hadnt the slightest idea when charlie kelly goes all innocent on you check how many fingers and toes youre wearing the odds are real good theyll add up to a number smaller than twenty i cant imagine how i kept from screaming at him you know per fectly well tell me about the bloody bird that keeps singing in your ear tm sony david but i cant he said i never should have mentioned that to you in the first place well you did and now youre stuck with it i said sav agely theres something rotten in the area of that dump people are being born without souls people are dying too if youll remember the thomas brothers fire you started me on this and now you wont give with what you know thafs damnable i have to pray youre wrong charlie answered but whether you are or not i cant give you what youre asking this whole matter is bigger than what you seem to grasp bigger than i thought too if i could id shut down your whole investigation this from a highpowered epa man good god char lie what are we talking about here the third soreerous war if we were i couldnt tell you so kelly said goodbye david im afraid youre on your own in this one my imp stopped reproducing his imps breathing hed hung up on harry turtledove i dont know how long i stared at my own phone before i hung up too jose franco walked past my office door i think he was just going to nod at me the way he usually does but he stopped in his tracks when he saw my face whats the matter dave he asked real concern in his voice hes a good guy jose is you look like you just saw your own ghost maybe i did i said which left him shaking his head why in gods name was charlie kelly acting altogether too serious about a third sorcerous war the first two were disasters beyond anything imaginable even in night mares before this century a third one if mankind was stupid enough to start a third sorcerous war wed prob ably never have to worry about a fourth one because nobodyd be left to fight it and charlie wouldnt even tell me who the enemy was liable to be you ever look back on your life and notice just how many sins youve committed to get where you are how everything that always seemed solid all at once starts to crumble under your feet until youre peering straight down into ae pit that was what i felt like after i got off the phone with keby the hair stood up on the back of my neck no wonder id alarmed jose afterwards i needed to gwe myself a good hard shake before i went back to work when youve spent a whfle contemplating armageddon environmental concerns dont look as big as they did if the third sorcerous war comes along there wont be any environment left to protect anyhow i drowned my sorrows in a cup of coffee wishing it were something stronger then more or less by main force i made myself call legate kawaguchi to find out how eras mus was doing people are like that the world may be going to hell around them and the third sorcerous war would be a reasonable approximation believe me but they try to keep their own little pieces of it tidy ah inspector fisher kawaguchi said after id made it through the maze of constabulary operators to his phone i was going to phone you in the next few days we expect that case of the toxic spell dump access spirit to become accessible to interrogation within that time frame thats good i said both because i hoped id learn something that would help my case and presumably kawaguchis and because i was glad erasmus would make it what other news do you have about the fire investigations are continuing he answered which meant he had no news or maybe it meant he just didnt feel like telling me any thing constables are like that sometimes i decided to give him a nudge see if i could shake something loose have your forensic sorcerers made any progress in analyzing those strange traces the thaumatech picked up at the scene the ones the consecrated ground erased before she could fully get them into her spebchecker you have a retentive memory inspector kawaguchi did not make it sound like a compliment more as if hed hoped id forgotten yet another phone pause this one i suppose while he figured out whether to try to lie to me interesting choice for him sure i was a civilian but a civilian who worked for a confederal agency if he did lie and i found out about it my bosses could make things unpleasant for his bosses who would make things unpleasant for him he finally said the traces remain vanishingly feint but enhancement techniques seem to indicate some sorceries of persian origin do they i said slow jinn fizz moved up a few notches on the suspect list so did bakhtiars precision burins an outfit i hadnt yet got around to visiting i asked him what enhancement techniques do the angels city constabulary use i hoped my own shop could leam something new and useful but he answered nothing out of the oroinaly im afraid we had our best results with an albite lens focusing the rays of the full moon on the spebchecker chamber that holds the memory microimps yes thafs pretty much standard i agreed only a constable would call it albite the more usual name is harry turtledove moonstone because its opaque a moonstone lens removes moonshine from moonbeams thereby improving recollections is there anything else inspector fisher kawaguchi asked i wondered if i ought to tell him one of my superiors was afraid the case was connected with the third sorcer ous war hed probably think i was moonstruck or lunatic if you prefer the latin i hoped hed be right bet ter that than charlie being right besides kawaguchi had enough worries of his own a constables job is neither easy nor pleasant anything else the legate repeated more sharply this time no not really thanks for your time please do keep me informed on how your investigation is going and let me know the moment erasmus becomes available for questioning i will do that inspector good day to you the work id meant to do that morning took up the after noon instead i had to keep up with it somehow which meant i didnt get out to chocolate weasel as id planned to do i wouldnt manage to do it tomorrow either because i was going to take my litde portable spellchecker over to the corderos house to see what it could find there and after that i figured bakhtiars precision burins had moved ahead of it on my list if persian magic was involved in the thomas brothers fire people complain that bureaucracies never accomplish anything i mean i complain when a bureaucracy im not part of succumbs to inertia half the time though the prob lem is too few people trying to do too many things in not enough time i felt like sisyphus except getting over to chocolate weasel was just one of the stones i had to try to shove to the top of the hill i kept running back and forth between them keeping them all from rolling down to the bottom again but not moving any up very far and every so often whether i got one of the old stones to the crest of the hill or not new ones appeared case of the toxic spell dump all in all the image was enough to get a man down on ancient greek religion i shoved stones around till it was time to go home after supper i called judy one of the things that makes troubles smaller is talking about them actually i suppose the trou bles stay the same size but when theyre spread between two people they seem smaller i told her about poor little jesus cordero and also about what charlie kelly had had to say maybe one of these days ramzan durani can synthesize a soul for the little boy she said she has a knack for remembering names and other details that slip through my fingers like sand now she went on but this other my god david was he serious who charlie he sure sounded that way to me what really frosts me is knowing how much he knows that hes not telling i understand she said but what are we supposed to do while hes not telling just go on with our lives as if we didnt know anything was wrong thats not just hard thats impossible i know but what choice do we have i answered peo ple have been doing it as long as there have been people carrying on inside their own little circles and holding their affairs together as best they could no matter what was going on around them if they didnt ive got a feeling the world would have torn itself to pieces a long time ago maybe youre right she said and then suddenly come over david would you i dont want to be alone not tonight not after what you just told me be there in half an hour i promised i made if too with a good five minutes to spare judy lives in a flat down in long beach in a neighborhood mar ginally better than mine the guardian at the outer entrance to her building knows me by now so i didnt have any trouble getting in fair enough i went there about as often as she came to see me i liked her place it was in an older block of flats than mine so it had occasional plumbing problems no ice harry turtledove elemental connection for hot summer days and a wheezy excuse for a salamander that couldnt keep the place warm in winter but there were compensations the main one i think was decently thick walls you didnt find out everything your neighbors were up to as if you watched them in a crystal ball shed lived there for five years and the flat had the stamp of her personality on it it was crammed with books maybe even more than mine the knickknacks aside from the menorah and brass candlesticks for the sabbath were museum copies of greek and roman sorcerous apparatus all mellow clay and greened bronze the prints on the wall were by arcimboldo you know the fellow who made por traits out of interlocked fish or fruit or imps theyre endlessly fascinating to look at and you never can decide just how far out of his tree old arcimboldo was if you think im building up to a tale of lurid lovemakmg im sorry it wasnt like that we hugged each other she made some coffee we talked later than we should have and when we slept together thats all we did we slept together if youre under twentyfive you probably wont believe me but sometimes thats better and more intimate too than twitches and moans not believe me that i have anything against twitches and moans but to every thing its season my sleep season ended too soon the next morning the horological demon in judys alarm clock bounced me out of her bed with a bloodcurdling ululation i hurried back to my place showered changed clothes grabbed a danish and my portable spell checker and headed for the office what i had in mind was racing through business in the morning and heading up to the corderos house in the after noon to take some readings with the spellchecker thats what i ended up doing too but it wasnt as simple as id had in mind something large and unpleasant landed on my desk with a thud i dont quite mean that literally but the report i was going to have to produce would be fat enough to thud down somewhere ive mentioned that angels city is in case of the toxic spell dump the middle of a drought the note bea passed to me explained that some sorcerers up in the north end of the barony of angels tried to bring rain with chumash indian charmstones perhaps in the hope that native spirits would have more effect on the local weather than imported white mans magic they got nothing i dont mean they didnt get rain nobodys been able to get much in the way of rain for angels city the past few years i mean they got nothing no sign that the powers linked to those charmstones were still there to be summoned what bea wanted me to do was determine whether the chumash powers were in fact extinct thats always a melancholy job extinction means some thing wonderful going out of the world forever whether from this side or the other the poor chumash though have been so thoroughly dispossessed and assimilated over the last couple of hundred years that no one believes any more in the powers they once revered not only does no one believe in them hardly anybody even knows they exist and powers without believers will die even the great pan is two thousand years dead now heavens before i could get started i had to go to the ref erence library to look up chumash charmstones and how they fit into the rest of the indians cult i found out they were used not only for making rain but also in war they could make you invisible to arrows in medicine and in gen eral sorcery they tied in with other talismans atishwin the chumash called those and with the powers who helped the chumash shamans and now by what bea had passed to me they were just little carved chunks of steatite as inert as ifthe d never had any magical intent at all i went up to beas office shot the breeze with her secre tary rose really runs that place if she ever quit wed fall apart until she got off the phone then ducked in fast before it made noise again whats my priority on this chumash thing i asked her the devonshire project is taking up a lot of my time right now i know she answered it still comes first its active while if the chumash powers really are extinct theres no harry turtledove hurry about saying so youll want to get a more formal inves tigation going to check that out one way or the other have the thaumaturges see if the chumash gods of the upper world the first people or the nunashish of the lower world are still accessible to invocation youve been reading up on this i said up until a couple of minutes before id never heard of the dark misshapen nunaskish she grinned at me of course i have if i knew about these spirits off the top of my head they wouldnt be on the edge of extinction would they if it turns out they havent gone over the edge report back to me right away because well need to try to arrange a preservation scheme assum ing we can afford one doing a costbenefit analysis to figure out whether its worthwhile to save an endangered deity is so coldblooded that its one of my least favorite parts of the job it is unfortu nately also all too often necessary as i noted when i saw matt arnolds door herm maintaining a cult for a super natural being who would otherwise be gone is expensive its the other sides equivalent of a captive breeding program for an animal thats vanished from the wild if the chumash powers were still alive somebody me most likely would have to figure out their role in the local thecosystem and whether that role justified the money to provide worshipers and whatever else they needed id never been part of the god squad before its an awesome respon sibility when you think about it bea must have seen the look on my face dont get your self in an uproar david the odds are that these powers have just faded away like so many others the indians rever enced before white folks and black settled here if thats so all youll have to do is write up the report its only if the nunashish and the rest are still around that youll have any bigger worries i know that i answered actually i hope they do sur vive but if they do and if theyre very much enfeebled which they will be yes i know holding a powers fate in your hands isnt case of the toxic spell dump easy in the old days they were proud of ridding the world of gods in whom they didnt believe some of the early chris tian writings the ones from the time of the great extinctions in europe will sicken you with their gloating but our ideas are different now we know everything has its place in creation to be preserved if possible but to be the one who decides if its possible and then to have to live with myself afterwards it wont be easy bea if you wanted a job that was easy all the time you wouldnt be here she said anything else no all right thank you david i went back to my office and made a couple of calls got the ball rolling on the chumash channstones then i plowed through as much of the more routine stuff as i could before lunch if id known how bad lunch was going to be id have worked straight through it the cafeteria must have assem bled the unappetizing glop on my plate with help from the law of contagion some time a long while ago it might have been in contact with real food two crowns ninetyfive shot to well you get the idea i slid down to my carpet with my spellchecker in my lap my stomach made small unhappy noises hoping they wouldnt turn into large unhappy noises i flew on up into st ferdinands valley the brown dirt and yellowbrown dry brush of the pass were getting to look very familiar the corderos lived in a neighborhood that had been upper middle class maybe thirty years before a lot of the houses still looked pretty nice but it wasnt upper middle class any more gang symbols and tags mostly in spain ish were scrawled on too many walls sometimes on top of one another and the houses even the nicelooking ones often held three four or more families because that was the only way the new immigrants could afford to pay the rent the house the corderos lived in was like that three women and a herd of kids not old enough for school watched me while i set up the spellchecker all the men including ramon cordero were out working lupe held poor little jesus and nursed him while she tried to keep track of a harry turtledove toddler who looked just like her one of the women her name was magdalena spoke good english she translated for me when i said first things first let me check that bottle of tonic you were tell ing me about mrs cordero lupe cordero rattled off something in spainish the woman who wasnt magdalena disappeared into the back part of the house she came back a minute later with a jar that had started out life holding tartar sauce it was half full of a murky brown liquid lupe made a face don taste good she said i actuated the spellchecker with passover wine and a hebrew blessing my rite was close enough to what the women were used to a latin prayer and communion wine that they didnt remark on it not even to say id omit ted the sign of the cross i was almost disappointed soy jwko is one of the spainish phrases i do know i unscrewed the lid of the extartarsauce jar sniffed the current contents myself the brown liquid didnt smell like anything in particular i reminded myself that lupe had drunk it without ill effect and that father flanagan had told me few curanderos trafficked in or with anything dan gerous that reminded me i asked lupe want to tell me the name of the person you got this from she shook her head don remember she said stub bornly i shrugged i hadnt expected anything different i started to stick the spellcheckers probe right into the liquid but the microimps inside the unit started screaming as soon as i got the end of the probe over the rim of the jar the women exclaimed bilingually i decided id better not put the probe in until i saw what the spellchecker was screaming about words started showing up on the ground glass as the microimps tried to teh me what was wrong theyd been programmed to write in what was mirror image for them but they were so agitated that they kept forgetting it didnt matter i could follow either style well enough the ingredient listing came first ocdi maguey beer to you ocelot blood ferret flesh dragon blood i blinked a case of the toxic spell dump little at that one but the aztecans have dragons too then the spellcheckers imps started writing unidentified forbidden over and over and over id never seen the spellchecker do that before i never wanted to see it again either ceuak i muttered under my breath sometimes eng lish lacks the words you need i almost wished judaism had a convenient gesture like the sign of the cross i could have used one just then to say i was flummoxed is to put it mildly lets try it again i said as much to steady myself as for any other reason i tried again from square one shutting down the spellchecker and reactivating it you have to be careful if you do that more than once in a short time the spirits inside can take on too many spirits from the wine and lose memory but it did make them stop screaming this time i reversed the normal order and had them ana lyze the sorcerous component of the tonic not the physical ingredients that went into making the complete magic thats what i tried to do at any rate the screaming started again as soon as the probe got anywhere near the jar i looked at the ground glass to see what the microimps had to say they expressed their opinion in two words unidentified forbidden they wrote those two words until the whole screen was full then started underlin ing them whatever had gone into that tonic in analyzing it id sent a boy to do a mans or maybe a giants job even moving the probe away didnt calm the spellchecker imps they stopped underlining only when i closed the jar as tight as i could even then none of the usual commands or invocations would clear the ground glass or make them stop screaming i had to shut down the spellchecker to get them to shut up mrs cordero whatever is in this potion its very strong magic and very dark magic i said magdalena translated for me my spellchecker wont even confront it you see i want two things from you please she nodded i went on first i want to take this jar to a proper thaumaturgical laboratory harry turtledove for full analysis st take it she said the other thing i want is the name of the curandero who sold it to you i said mrs cordero this stuff is dangerous do you want another mother to have a baby bom like jesus madre de dios no she exclaimed good i answered more abstractedly than i should have i was wondering if the hellbrew in the tartarsauce jar had caused all the apsychic births around the devonshire dump if it had then the biggest part of the case for leaks against the dump had just collapsed but if the dump and everybody using it were innocent whod torched the thomas brothers monastery and why all at once nothing made sense i pulled my attention back to the tacky little living room in which i stood im sony but an image of the virgin of guadalupe while undoubtedly effective as an apotropaic is not to my mind a work of art if its painted on black velvet in luridly phosphorescent colors lupe cordero still hadnt said who the curandero was i realized she was waiting to be coaxed okay id coax her please mrs cordero this infor mation is very important w you don tell him who you hear it from she asked anxiously i hedged til try not to to my relief that was good enough for her okay she said he call himself cuauhtemoc hemandez and he have his house up near van nuys boulevard and omelveny i noted the irony of a curandero operating by a dutch and erse comer angels city is changing lupe went on his sign it say curandero in letters red an green thanks very much mrs cordero i said and meant every word of it i wrote down what shed told me so i wouldnt forget it then left the house and started flying around looking for a public pay phone i finally found one outside a liquor store whose front window said cerveza pria in letters three times the size of the ones that adver tised cold beer i called the office from there and got rose when i asked case of the toxic spell dump to talk to bea she said tm sony dave shes already on the phone with someone could you ask her to come out to your desk please i said this is important one of roses many wonderful attributes is her almost occult sense of knowing when somebody really means some thing like that and if theres a spell to produce the same effect way too many secretaries have never heard of it half a minute later bea said what is it david it had better be interesting lurked behind her words when id told her what the spellchecker had done with lupe corderos potion she sighed and said well you were right that is important bring it in to the laboratory right away david and well see what really is in it then we and the constabulary will drop on mr hemandez did you say his name wasp like a ton of bricks most of the time these curandems are only guilty of venial sin but desouling a baby isnt even slighdy venial tf thafs what did it i said cautiously but yeah im on my way im just glad the lab survived last years budget cuts so am i bea answered farming things out to private alchemists and wizards would have eaten up just as much budget as maintaining our own analysis unit specialists naturally charge plenty for their expertise youre not just paying for what they know now but for what learning it cost them and besides this way we didnt have to stand in a queue in case we needed results in a huny as soon as i got back to the westwood confederal build ing i took the jar over to the lab ifs on the same floor as the rest of the epa offices but tucked into a comer and hedged around with protective charms not much different from the ones on the fence outside the devonshire dump our principal thaumaturgic analyst bureaucratese for wizard in case youre wondering is a balding blond fellow named michael manstein hes very good at what he does he brings an alemanic sense of precision and order to whats too often a chaotic art that he makes me want to stand at attention and dick my heels every time i go in to harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump talk with him is by comparison a detail hello david he said looking up from the table where he was inscribing a circle with his blackhandled knife what can i do for you this afternoon i gave him the tartarsauce bottle and explained where id got it and how my spellchecker had reacted to it his eye brows came together as he listened a little vertical crease appeared just above his nose i finished so id like you to find out what really is in the jar here and what spells made it strong enough to set off my spellchecker like that i may have to exorcise it before i can use it again interesting michael took the jar from me wrapped it in a green silk cloth with several magical symbols inscribed on it in pigeons blood when must you have results from the analysis yesterday would be good i said he laughed the small polite laugh of a man who not only doesnt have the best sense of humor ever hatched but also has been besieged by importunate clients more times than he cares to remember i went on seriously if i can have this tomorrow some time that would be great the stuff is suspected of being involved in an apsychia case and may be linked to several others up in the valley ah i see this tells me what i need to set my priorities for the coming work michael manstein is too compulsively preciseto get sloppy with the language and say things like prioritize thats nice i said whatever his priorities were the potion wasnt at the top of them he went back to scribing his circle i turned to go trying to hurry manstein is like fay ing to make the sun rise faster then i had an afterthought whose sorcerers tools do you use michael he finished the circle before he answered one thing at a time with michael manstein i order them from bakhtiars he said at last theyve always given me good results back before the industrial revolution a wizard had to be his own smith his own woodworker his own tanner if he didnt make his instruments himself sometimes right down to refining the ore from which a metal would be drawn they wouldnt be property attuned to him and would give weak results or none at all modem technology has changed ah that correct applica tion of the law of contagion allows thaumaturgical tools to keep the mystic links to their original manufacturer even when someone else uses them while the law of similarity permits their attunement to any wizard because of his like ness to the mage who made them some firms take one approach some the other some seek to combine the two michael asked why do you want to know that because i thought you used bakhtiars tools i answered and because bakhtiars may be somehow connected to the jar of potion i just gave you what i know is that bakhtiars dumps at devonshire and there may be an involvement between the devonshire dump case and this stuff its a cir cumstantial link if its there at all but i figured you ought to know about it youre right thank you manstein said i have a spare set my father brought with him when he came here from alemania after tile first sorcerous war iu use that to make sure theres no conflict ofsorcerous interest makes sense i said and michael yes be careful ofwhats in that jar i have the bad feeling ifs really vicious tin always careful manstein said the phone yelled at me i felt like yelling right back id spend most of ae morning trying to put together a panel to investigate the thecological status of the chumash indian powers and i wasnt having much luck half the people id talked to seemed convinced in advance that the powers were extinct and good riddance to them if you listened to the other half youd move eight million people out of the bar ony of angels so the powers could have free rein as they did in the days when the chumash lived here david fisher environmental perfection agency it wasnt any of the thecologists for which i thanked god it was michael manstein he said harry turtledove could you come down to the laboratory please id like to discuss the specimen you brought me for analysis okay if you want me to as soon as id heard his voice id picked up a leadstick and a pad of foolscap but cant you just tell me whats in it over die phone id really rather not he said judging somebodys tone on the phone is always risky and michael wouldnt be anything but mild and serious even if ae world started coming to an end around him but i didnt dunk he sounded cheerful some new safety symbols were up around die lab but i didnt pay diem any particular attention like any wizard worth his lab robe manstein was always fiddling widi his protective setup technology changes all die time if you dont keep up its your soul youre risking michael manstein wasnt a man to take risks he could avoid what do you have for me i asked as i came dirough die door hed arranged more amulets inside die lab too a lot of diem featured die feadiered serpent i made die con nection is it as bad as diat he stared at me his eyes had a slighdy unfocused look id never seen in them before as if hed gone fishing for minnows and hooked die midgard serpent on his lab table stood die extartarsauce jar id given him around it was scribed a sevenfold circle let me put it like dris diey only protect die intercontinental megasalamander launch sites widi eight it wasnt as bad as diat it was worse he said david i have been a practicing thaumaturge for twentyseven years now utterly characteristic of him to be exact had it been me idve said somedring like going on thirty he went on in diat entire period i do not believe i have ever seen an abomination oftilis magnitude enough to cause apsychia in a fetus i asked im surprised it didnt desoul the modier he answered from anyone else diat would have been exaggeration for conversational effect michael doesnt talk that way he handed me a sheet of parchment here are die preliminary results of die analysis my eyes swept down die list for a few seconds diey case of the toxic spell dump didnt believe what diey were seeing just as at first you refuse to draw meaning from pictures of camp survivors and camp victims of die second sorcerous war some horrors are too big to take in all at once i went back for a second look the words curse diem did not change i made my moudi utter diem human blood michael flayed human skin are you sure your techniques distinguish between die substitute and die real thing maybe it was a substitute made dirough contagion radier dian similarity that would be bad enough but i was grasping at straws and i knew it but manstein shook his head probability zero im afraid i hoped die same diing but i didnt just use sorcerous tests i also employed mechanical forensic analysis there can be no doubt of die actual human component of dlis elixir i gulped what hed just told me meant that lupe cor dero a very nice girl was also an unwitting cannibal i wondered how anybody was supposed to break diat to her poor kid all shed wanted to do was keep her breakfast down as if she didnt have troubles enough i looked at die diaumaturgical column on die parchment most of it was innocuous even beneficial manstein had found invocations of die virgin the son i remembered die name of lupes son several saints from aztecia a couple of minor demons related to child birth but diere in die middle of diem standing out like a dragon in a fairy ring huitzilopochdi i said yes michaels understated agreement held a world of meaning why i wondered couldnt die aztedan war god have been teetering on die edge of extinction no one not even die sort of people who march to save medvamps would have shed a tear to see him leave die other side for wherever gods go when they die his influence on this side has always been baleful his power fueled by hearts ripped from human victims what maniac i wondered had imagined he should be summoned to strengdien a potion diat exalted life not gore but i knew die answer to diat cuauhtemoc hemandez i harry turtledove must have said the name out loud for one of michael man steins buttercolored eyebrows rose an eighth of an inch or so the wrandero who made this stuff i explained ah michael said the eyebrow went down have you cabed the constabulary about this yet i asked no i thought it appropriate that you be the first to know thanks i added thanks twice in fact i dont think ill eat any lunch today so my waistline thanks you too heh heh he said just like that im afraid he reahy is as straitiaced as that makes him sound were going to be involved in nailing this cwandero along with the constables i said i dont remember the last time anything so nasty got loose in the environment and god only knows how many jars are still sitting on shelves in the nostrums cabinet or next to the sink if were real lucky hemandez will have kept records on the women hes sold it to so he can try and poison them again with something else odds are though web have to spread the word through the dailies and the churches hemandez may not even be totally responsible man stein said hows that i asked indignantly the tests i performed seem to me to indicate that the mfld beneficial influences in the potion were overiain on top of the already present summoning of huitzilopochtii he answered the cwandero may not have been aware that the latter was present if he didnt know it was there then hes responsible for being a damned fool i snapped and i meant it literally he certainly shouldnt be allowed to run around loose practicing thaumaturgy and inflicting this garbage i pointed at the tartarsauce jar on innocent ignorant immigrant women there i cannot disagree with you michael said do you want to call the constabulary or shall i tb do it i said after a few seconds thought til want to fly up there with them and be in on the arrest make sure however much of this potion hemandez has is sealed and case of the toxic spell dump then properly disposed of i wished solomon had heard of huitzilopochtii that would have made the problem of sealing the vicious stuff simple but however effective the great kings design is with jinni baalim and other middle eastern denizens of the other side its useless against new world powers except those largely subsumed into a christian matrix and huitzilopochtii as mansteins analysis had shown all too clearly still had a great deal of independent potency then something else occurred to me hemandezs horri ble nostrum might end up in the devonshire toxic spell dump tasting the irony of that i went back to my office and got on the phone the first constable i talked to was a fellow named joaquin garda madre de dios he burst out when i told him what id run into being of aztecan descent he had a culturally ingrained understanding of just how nasty a power huitz ilopochtii was i knew it in my head he felt it in his gut he bumped me up to his superior a sublegate called higgins and he must have given him an earful too because higgins was the soul of cooperation well get going on a warrant for this right away inspector fisher he promised any time we get a chance to put one like that out of business we leap on it he didnt argue when i said i wanted to go along either sometimes constables get stuffy about things like that i added better make sure your people are well warded sublegate with one potion like that around who knows what else hemandez has in there with him well send out the special wizards and thaumaturges team higgins said if they cant handle it nobody this side ofdstc can ill call you back as soon as we have the war rant thanks for passing on the information my pleasure i told him i want this guy shut down at least as much as you do after i got off the ether with higgins i went back through my files and found the names and addresses of the other three apsychic lads born near the devonshire dump in the past year then i checked in the phone grimoire two of the harry turtledove families were tested i called both those houses and by luck got an answer each time what i wanted to know was whether the mothers had bought any potions from cuauhtemoc hemandez both women i talked to answered no i thanked them and added the data to my notes then spent a while scratching my head the curanderos nostrum was certainly vile enough to have caused jesus coidero to be born without a soul but just because it could have didnt necessarily mean it had i kicked myself for not doing a more thorough job around the corderos house but i didnt kick too hard when the microimps in your spellchecker start going berserk youd better pay attention to that more nearly routine stuff kept me busy the rest of the day when bea walked by my office door in the middle of the afternoon and saw me there she raised an eyebrow and said i expected youd be in die field now id hoped to get to bakhtiars precision burins myself but it just wasnt working i said ill probably be out tomorrow or the next day and explained what manstein had found in the potion id brought back from lupe corderos house thats revolting she said youre right we need to clamp down on that as hard as we can with the enormous aztecian population in angels city the last thing we need here is a largescale flareup of huitzilopochdism it would make worries over medvamps rather smad potatoes wouldnt it i said i do admire your talent for understatement david bea headed on down die hall understatement was an understatement if huitzilopo chdi got established in angels city it wouldnt be fruit trees drained dry it would be people i thought about hearts torn out on secret altars necromancy ritual cannibalism a lot less refined than the genteel christian variety i also thought about all the other bloodthirsty powers that would be drawn to the area the act of human sacrifice is so powerful a magical instrument that it reverberates through the other side all sorts of hungry things would head this way wanting their share when the gods smelled the sweet case of the toxic spell dump savor they gathered like flies above the sacrifice what utnapishtim told gilgamesh five thousand years ago remains true today they say thats how the horror happened in alemania but the leader didnt tiy to throw the powers out oh no he welcomed them widi open arms and fed them i dare say beyond their wildest dreams the whole world has seen what came of that not here i thought never ogam courts in angels city open at half past nine at exactly the next morning i got a call from sublegate higgins we have the warrant he said it was so fast i wondered if hed used maximum ruhollah maybe not he operated out of the st ferdi nands valley substation and hed be sure to have a local judge up there under his spell he went on were mov ing out at tenthirty if youre not here by then youll be late til be there i said and got off the phone miserable cowboy i thought everything had to be his way but i headed for my carpet as fast as i could when youre dealing with people like that you dont want to give them any excuse to mess you up just as well i did too i made it to the substation with only about three minutes to spare traffic up through the pass was just ghastly dont ask me how but when a big long haul transport carpet broke down and had to land a unicorn got out of its cage people on carpets and others riding pegasi were trying to herd it back to where it belonged and werent having much luck as my carpet crawled through the gawkers block i won dered if theyd have to go to a nunnery to find someone who could calm the beautiful beast given angels citys reputa tion they might have had a tough time finding a virgin outside of one catching the unicorn thank god was not my worry when i finally did get to the constabulary station higgins gave me a disapproving look so perfectly flinty he must have harry turtledove practiced it in the nunor he introduced me to the swat team who looked more like combat soldiers than highly trained mages i nodded to the thaumatech weve met before so we have it was bomholm you came up to the thomas brothers fire thats right i still envy you your spellchecker enough chitchat higgins said lets fly id never ridden on a blackandwhite carpet before let me tell you those things are hot as we shot up the flyways to the curanderos place i reflected that the sylphs in the constabulary carpet could have used a little discipline them selves a couple of turns would have tossed me off on my ear if i hadnt been wearing my belt but we got there in a huny hemandezs house was on omelveny a couple of lots east of van nuys i hadnt known whether he had a store front for his death shop but no it was just a little old house with a handlettered sign in green and red as lupe cor dero had told me that said curandero nailed onto the front porch watching the swat team operate was something else too police carpets arent bound by the governing spebs that restrict ordinary vehicles to their flyways the mages drew an aerial ward circle around hemandezs establishment from above before anybody landed whatever he had in there they werent about to give him a chance to use it constables dont live to enjoy their grandchildren by taking risks they dont have to sublegate higgins used an insulated umbrella same prin ciple as the footbridge at the devonshire dump but applied upside down to penetrate the circle with him came four of the swat team wizards bomholm the thaumatech with her fancy spellchecker and bringing up the rear yours truly all the firepower that preceded me the constables were armed for any sort of combat physical as well as magical made me wish i was one of the mildmannered bureaucrats the public imagines all government workers to be i wouldnt have minded falling asleep at my desk just then bomholm said the spellcheckers already sniffing some case of the toxic spell dump thing nasty up ahead higgins rapped on the door now the boys from the swat team stood on either side of him ready to kick it down but it opened i dont know what id expected cuauhtemoc hemandez to look like but an aztecan version of your wellloved grandfather wasnt it he had white hair spectacles and until he took in the crowd on his front porch a very pleasant expression that faded in a hurry to be replaced by bewilderment what you want he asked in accented english you are cuauhtemoc hemandez the curandero hig gins said formally s but the old man smiled you need what i got senor maybe you have trouble keeping your woman happy from the way the back of higgins neck went purple and then white maybe he did have trouble keeping his woman happy but he was a professional his voice didnt change as he went on mr hemandez i have here a war rant permitting the angels city constabulary to search these premises for substances contravening various sec tions of city provincial and confederal ordinances dealing with controlled sorcerous materials and another warrant for your arrest on a charge of dispensing such ma terials you are under arrest sir anything you say may be used against you hemandez stared as if he couldnt believe his ears senor you must be mistaken he said with considerable dignity i am just a curandero i dont hardly do no magic worth the name did you sell a potion to a pregnant woman named lupe cordero a few months ago i asked one that was sup posed to fight morning sickness and keep the baby healthy i sell lots of these potions he said shrugging it could be lupe corderos baby was born without a soul i told him he went pale under his swarthy skin had he started off fair he would have ended up the color of his shining hair he harry turtledove crossed himself violently no he cried it cannot be im afraid it is mr hemandez i said remembering michael mansteins speculation that the cwandsro might not even know what all was going into his nostrums i went on sorcerous analysis of your potion shows that part of its power comes from ingredients and spells consecrated to huitzilopochdi like any aztecans he knew of the gods his people had worshiped before the spainish came to the new world he got paler still he reminded me of a cup of coffee into which you kept pouring more cream in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit sefior i did not use this this poison of blood but it was there i said its still there bornholm the thaumatech added i can detect it inside the house nasty stuff stand aside mr hemandez higgins said in a voice like doom the curandero stood aside as if caught in a night mare from which he couldnt wake up one of the fellows from the swat team took charge of him the rest of us walked past them into the house it was none too neat in there my guess was that he lived alone a blackframed picture of a grayhaired woman on the mantle put more force behind the guess if he followed huitzilopochdi he sure didnt let it show the front room had enough garish catholic images to stock a couple of churches assuming you put quality ahead of quan tity candles flickered in front of a carved wooden statuette of the virgin i glanced at bomholm she nodded the little shrine was what it appeared to be one of the bedrooms was messy it got a lot messier after the boys from the swat team finished trashing it the kitchen was pretty bad too hemandez was not what youd call the neat kind of widower the swat team started in there as soon as they were done with the bedroom what had been the den was the curanderos laboratory these days a lot of the things in there were about what youd expect to find in an aztecian healers workroom peyoti mushrooms few more effective aids in reaching the other case of the toxic spell dump side bark of the olotuhqu plant which has similar effects but isnt as potent its related to jimsonweed a potion of xiuhamoui root and dog urine that was supposed to prevent hair loss personally id rather be bald hemandez had had his triumphs too a glass bowl held dozens of what looked like tiny obsidian arrow points either they were a fraud to impress his patients or hed been pretty good at curing elfshot from which the aztecans suffer as badly as the alemans although alemanian elves generally make their arrowheads out of flint we also found an infusion for invoking tiazolteteo the demon of desire not apparently to provoke lust but rather to put it down the infusion had a label written in spainish on it bomholm the thaumatech translated it for us to be used together with a hot steam bath she laughed i wouldnt be homy after a steam bath anyhow i dont think if that had been all the curandero was up to the visit by the swat team would have been a waste of taxpayers hard earned crowns but it wasnt bomholm went over to a table in one comer of the room she looked at her spellchecker in growing concern its here somewhere in amongst this gynecological stuff she muttered again a lot of the stuff you could find at any curanderos leaves for rubbing against a new mothers back to relive afterpangs herbs to stimulate milk in women with new babies a douche of ayo nelhuati herb and eagle dung for pregnant women all more or less harmless but with them bingo bornholm said when she opened a jar of clear liquid i already knew her spellchecker was more sensitive and powerful than mine now she showed that being a con stabulary model it was also better protected against malign influences her face twisted as she read from the ground glass the microimps are reporting human blood and flayed human skin all right disgusting bring hernandez in here sublegate higgins ordered as soon as a couple of fellows from the swat team had done so higgins pointed at the jar and said whats in there you in that jar hemandez said is ferret blood and a little harry turtledove bit dragons blood is for mostly the ladies who are going to have babies they get the he ran out of english and said something in spainish hemorrhoids bomholm translated yeah ive heard of that one she gave the curandero a look on whose receiving end i wouldnt have wanted to be brew this up yourself did you no no hemandez shook his head vehemently dragon blood is muy caro very expensive i buy this mix from another man he say he is a curandero too at one of the how you say swap meets they have here he give me good price better than i get from anybody else ever i believe that i told him the reason you got such a good price is that its not what he told you it was tell us about this fellow is he young old does he come to the swap meets often you can find just about anything at a swap meet and cheap sometimes its even what the dealer says it is but a lot of the time the fairy gold ring you got will turn to brass or lead in a few days the horological demon in your watch will go dormant or escape or what you think is medicine will turn out to be poison the constabulary and the epa do their best to keep the meets honest but its another case of not enough men spread way too thin hemandez said he calls himself jose hes not young not old just a man i see him a few times he is not regular there sublegate higgins and i looked at each other he looked disgusted i didnt blame him an ordinary guy named jose who showed up at swap meets when he felt like it what were the odds of dropping on him about the same as the odds of the high priest in jerusalem turning hindu thats what i thought anyhow but bomholm said if we can put a spellchecker at the dealers gates at a few of these places ill bet theyll pick this stuff up its that strong id work weekends without overtime to try and ill be shocked if some other thaumatechs dont say the same thing everybody knows about huitzilopochdi no one wants him loose here greater love hath no public servant than volunteering for case of the toxic spell dump extra work with no extra pay folks who carp about the con stabulary and about bureaucracy in general have a way of forgetting people like bomholm and they shouldnt because there are quite a few of them i said if youll lend me one of these fancy spellcheckers ill take a sunday shift myself i know a lot of people would rather worship than work then but thats not a problem for me i think ill take you up on that higgins said after a few seconds thought id figured he would the constabulary doesnt draw a whole lot of jews i wrote down my home phone number and gave it to him youll hear from me he promised i hope i do i have to confess i had an ulterior motive or at least part of one the dealers at a swap meet get in early so they can set up i figured id bring judy along and after we were done with the checking assuming we didnt find anything we could spend the rest of the day shopping like i said you can find just about anything at a swap meet v a couple of days after we put cuauhtemoc hemandez out of business sublegate higgins did indeed call me to set up sunday surveillance at one of the valley swap meets that evening i called judy to see if she could come along with me as id hoped she could after wed made the date we kept on talking about the whole expanding case for a while i was saying if hemandez can show he gave lupe cor dero that vile potion out of ignorance rather than malice hell get a lighter sentence than he would otherwise i dont think ignorance is a proper defense in case like that judy said if a cwandero doesnt know what hes doing he has no business trying to do it dealing with gri moires every dav she takes an exacting view of magic and its abuses harry turtledove im not sure i agree with you i said intent counts for a great deal in sorcery it i heard a noise from the front part of the flat and broke off listen let me call you back i think somebodys at the door i went out to see who it was most likely one of my neigh bors wanting to borrow the proverbial cup of sugar i figured but somebody wasnt at the door he was already inside sit ting on a living room chair i could still see the chair through him too so it was somedisembody howd you get in here i demanded as i may have said i have more than the usual line of home security cantrips i gave fair warning i forbid thee spirit in the name of god adonai elohim jehovah to enter within this house depart now lest i smite thee with the consecrated blasting rod of power you dont bluff when you say youre packing a rod mine was in the hall closet behind me but the spirit didnt move calm as could be he said i think youb want to reconsider that he traced a glowing symbol in the air if youve ever been to a lightandmagic thrillshow you probably think you know that symbol as a matter of fact the one you think you know isnt the genuine article close but not quite only specially authorized beings may sketch the true symbol and have it take fire for them i happen to know the difference my eyes got wide an ordinary joe like me never expects to meet a real spook from central intelligence what do you want with me i asked hoarsely the ci spook looked me over we take an interest in huitzilopochui he said maybe youll tell me what you know about the recent manifestation you uncovered so i told him and as i talked i found myself wondering just what the devil i was getting into every step into the toxic spell dump case seemed to drag me deeper into a pol luted ooze from which i feared id be lucky to escape with my soul intact after i was through the spook sat there for quite a while without saying anything i watched him i watched the chair case of the toxic spell dump through him and i tried to figure out how the puzzle pieces fit together evidently my visitor from central intelligence was doing the same thing because he finally said in your opinion what if anything is the relationship between die various elements you have outlined the leaking spell dump the monastery arson the possibilities inherent in the garuda bird project the decline of the local powers and this trouble with the curcmdero and his potions i didnt think there was any connection between the chumash and the rest of the mess i exclaimed that hadnt even occurred to me as for the other things im still dig ging and so is the angels city constabulary if you want my gut feeling i think some of the other things will prove tied together but i dont see how right now and i dont have any sort of evidence to back me up never underestimate the value of gut feelings the spook said seriously you ignore them at your peril the finding at central intelligence is essentially the same as yours otherwise they would not have sent out a spectral operative thafs spooktalk for spook to bring an over view back to dstc etheric transport is of course a lot quicker than the fastest carpet the spook could just cut directly through the other side from the district of st columbaand back a privilege denied to all mere mortals save a handful of saints dervishes and boddhisatvas none of whom for various good reasons was likely to be in the employ of central intelligence i said since youve come crosscountry to interview me that seemed a politer phrase than interrogate me maybe youll tell me something too when the spook didnt say no i went on is this case somehow connected with worries about the third sorcerous war the spook got up from the chair took a couple of steps toward me how did you make that connection his voice was quiet and cold as hemlock moving up toward the heart he took another step in my direction i dont have a big front room he was already halfway across it three more steps and he could do i didnt know what but id read enough spy thrillers to make some guesses reach harry turtledove inside my head and pinch off an arteiy maybe unless a good forensic sorcerer helped do my autopsy id go into the thomas brothers demographic records as just another case of apoplexy younger than most i slapped backward yanked open the closet door whipped out the blasting rod and pointed it at the spooks midsection back off i told him this rod is primed and ready all i have to do is say the word and youre cooked of course my flat would be cooked too a rod operates on this side as well as the other but i figured i had a better chance of escaping from a burning flat than from a ci spook he stood very still he didnt come forward but he didnt move back not even when i thrust the rod out toward him as he had before he said i think youll want to reconsider that unless youre packing something very much out of the ordinary youll hurt your books and furniture much more than me i knew the military had developed some highlevel protection for their own spectral operatives it seemed reasonable that a central intelligence spook would enjoy the same shielding come to that some of the goetic technology has trickled down to the underworld which makes constables unhappy on the other hand this is a mage abramelin mogen david special i said i dont care how well youre warded against christian or muslim magic this is the fire that dealt with sodom and gomorrah now the spook backed up being transparent his features were hard to make out but i thought he looked thoughtful you could be bluffing he said so could you impasse he went back to the chair sat down again i lowered the rod but i didnt let go of it the spook said since we are uncertain of each othefs powers shall we pro ceed as if the recent unpleasantness had not taken place let me ask you again with no threat intended or implied why you believe this case my be connected to national secu rity issues case of the toxic spell dump well for one thing why would you have walked through my door if it werent i said the spook grimaced mistily heisenbergs thaumaturgic principle the mere act of observation magically affects that which is being observed i console myself by remembering im not the first to fall victim to it nor shall i be the last i didnt want any kind of spook not even a philosophical one in my front room i went on if it makes you feel any better i was worried about it before i ever set eyes on you too many big powers involved beelzebub the whole per sian mess i havent got to the bottom of yet now huitzilopochdi i didnt mention charlie kelly i wasnt sure he deserved my loyalty not any more but he still had it i must advise you to keep your suspicions to yourself the spook said after a longish pause he might as weu have been on the telephone ran through my mind one of those maddening bursts of irrelevance that will pop up no matter what you do reaching the wrong ears your prophecy could become selffulfilling it might help if youd tell me which ears are the wrong ones if i sounded plaintive can you blame me he shook his murky head no for two reasons first the information is classified and therefore not to be casually dis seminated under any circumstances and second the more you know the more apt you are to betray yourself to those who may have reason to be interested in your knowledge your basic assumption should be that no one may be privy to your speculations if anyone with whom you come into con tact shows undue interest in this area summon me at once from central intelligence headquarters in dsfcc how do i get hold of you in particular i asked i mean central intelligence has a lot of spooks on the payroll my name is legion he said henry legion he turned around walked out through my chair and wall and was gone next day thank god was friday traffic was light going in as it often is on friday mornings i wasnt fooled i knew id have the usual devilish time getting home i tried not to harry turtledove think about that maybe i told myself as i floated up the ele vator shaft id have myself a nice easy day knock off early and beat the weekend crunch on st james freeway i walked into my office took one look at the in basket and screamed sitting there was one of the ugliest confed eral forms ever designed in big block letters the cover said request for environmental impact report slightly smaller letters added proposed importation of new species into barony of angels having got the scream out of my system i merely moaned as i sank into my chair who i wondered wanted to bring what into angels city and why i just wished huitzilopochdi had to fill out all the forms hed need to establish himself here legally wed be free of him till doomsday or maybe twenty minutes longer huitzilopochtii and his minions unfortunately didnt bother with forms with trembling fingers i picked up the report request and opened it somebody it seemed was proposing to schlep leprechauns over from the auld sod in hibemiation revive them once they got here and establish a colony in angels city at first glance it looked reasonable we have a good num ber of erse here and a lot more who pretend they are when st padraigs day rolls around the leprechauns wouldnt have any trouble feeling at home in angels city tracking the litde critters to their pots of gold would help a few poor folk pay off the mortgage the odds were about like winning the lottery but who doesnt plunk down a few crowns on the lot tery every now and again the way of environmental issues though is to get more complicated the longer you look at them figuring out how leprechauns would affect the local thecology wasnt going to be easy tracing the interactions of beings from this side is complicated enough but when you start having powers involved i moaned again medium loud one of the things id have to examine was the impact importing leprechauns would have on the chumash powers assuming those werent case of the toxic spell dump extinct if the chumash powers were still around hanging by a metaphorical fingernail would bringing in leprechauns rob them of the tiny measure of devotion they needed to survive bea walked by the open door just in time to hear that moan she stuck her head into the office why david whatever is the matter she asked as if she didnt know this i said pointing to the orange cover of the environ mental impact report request do you by any chance have a spell for making days fortyeight hours long so i can do everything im supposed to if i did id use it myself she said but i dont think gods been in the habit of holding back the sun since joshuas day this is going to be a bear to handle i said especially on top of the devonshire dump case and the chumash extinc tion study st elmos fire came on above my head just like you see in the cartoons thats why you passed it on to me so i could run it parallel to the chumash project thats right david she smiled sweetly bea isnt what youd call pretty but she can look almost angelic sometimes being sure youre on the right path will do that for you i guess she went on i figured it would be better to have both of them in your hands than to make two people run back and forth checking with each other all the time and maybe working at cross purposes okay i said put that way it made sense bea didnt get to be boss of my unit on the strength of an angelic smile she has a head on her shoulders the easiest way to handle the issue would be to work up two scenarios she said one for the leprechauns environ mental effects without worrying about the chumash powers the other assuming those powers do still manifest them selves here yeah that makes sense i scribbled a note on a scrap of foolscap on my desk thanks bea any time she said sweetly still and went off to inflict impossible amounts of work on someone else to be fair i have to admit she worked like a team ofpercherons herself harry turtledove and she had put her finger on the most efficient way to handle the two studies side by side they still wouldnt be easy or quick id have to design simulations approximating the immediate effect of leprechauns on the thecology of angels city with and without taking into account the chu mash powers then an epa wizard would animate the simulations and follow them under the crystal ball as far into the future as he could noting changes every year or two until the images faded into uncertainty id have to justify every assumption i used in my initial simulations too the people who wanted to import lepre chauns in carpetioad lots and the folk who were convinced bringing in even one wee fellow would disrupt the local the cosystem would both be preparing their own models and running them under crystal balls id need to demonstrate that mine were the most accurate representations of what was likely to happen all of which meant that i didnt get out to bakhtiars pre cision burins that afternoon let alone chocolate weasel and neither i nor anybody else did any fancy spellchecker sniffing around the devonshire dump to try to find out just what was leaking out people long for the days when the king ruled instead of reigning when the power of the barons was undiluted when the prime minister kept quiet and did what he was told they say the governments gotten too big too complex maybe theyre right some of the time i couldnt ted you for sure politics is a brand of theology that never excited me but i will tell you this some important epa work wasnt getting done because my department didnt have enough people to deal with projects as fast as they came up am i supposed to assume were the only government outfit with that problem i know i worked overtime that night i made it to the synagogue with bare minutes to spare before the rabbi started singing lkhah dodi to welcome in the sabbath judy was sitting so close to the front on the womens side that she didnt even see me come in i didnt manage to nod at her let alone say hello until the service was done case of the toxic spell dump i was afraid you werent coming she said after we hugged work i made it sound like the fourletter word it was listen have you eaten yet i grimaced when she nodded all right you want to come along with me anyhow ill get you pie and coffee or something i flew straight here from the office sure she said where do you want to go we ended up at a lenn s not far from the synagogue a step up from the golden steeples a step down from a real restaurant i just wanted to feed my face and they do have pretty fair pie and besides i thought remembering henry legion it wasnt a place that was likely to have a listener planted in it i hadnt called judy back to tell her about the spook by the time he got out of my flat i was imagining people and things listening to my phone calls when i was through she stared at me for a few seconds then she said youre not making that up in a tone of voice that meant shed been wondering right up to the end not a bit of it i was a little hurt she had trouble believ ing me but only a little because i would have had trouble believing a story like that from anybody else i mean people dont just start having visits from spooks with threatening manners except i did i added from what he said maybe i shouldnt be telling you any of this david fisher if you even thought of keeping me in the dark id show your picture to a mirror and then break the mirror she said indignantly i sort of expected as much i said thing is from what henry legion said its liable to get dangerous you didnt worry about that when you took me to the thomas brothers fire i tried to interrupt i didnt take you there you invited yourself she rode over me like the demon horses of the wild hunt and you invited me to the swap meet with you day after tomorrow i did that before the spook showed up i muttered harry turtledove do you want me not to come she said do you want me not to go back to your flat with you tonight do you want me not to bother going ahead with the arrangements for the wedding do you think im afraid dont you see i want to get to the bottom of this as badly as you do i did the only thing i could possible do at that particular moment i surrendered i did it literally i took a white handkerchief out of my pocket and waved it in the air between us judy bless her went from furious to giggling in the space of a second and a half the waitress whod been about to refill my coffee cup undoubtedly figured id gone out of my mind but that was a small price to pay for keeping my fiancee happy only trouble was i was land of afraid myself after sunset saturday i flew up to st ferdinands valley to pick up the heavyduty constabulary spellchecker an advantage of dealing with the constabulary is that they never close a disadvantage is that their parchmentwork is even more cumbersome than what the epa uses and if you didnt think that was possible youre not the only one by the language of their forms they figured id abscond with the gadget the second their backs were turned unless i promised not to in writing ahead of time why dont you just lay a geas on me i asked sarcastically oh no sir said the clerk who kept shoving parchments at me that would be a violation of your rights apparently signing away my life wasnt because i spent so long signing forms i didnt get back to my place until going on ten i lugged the spellchecker upstairs it was nominally portable but being part troll didnt hurt if you wanted to carry it more than a few feet put it down so i could open the door picked it up again with a grunt and set it down in the middle of the front room its about time you got back judy said i was starting to worry about you forms i said and tried to make it sound as blasphe mous as one of your more usual maledictions i must have case of the toxic spell dump managed because judy laughed i stretched something in my back went pop it felt good i suspected id lost about half an inch of height manhandling the spellchecker up to my flat maybe the pop meant i was getting it back again i glared at the gadget miserable thing twenty years ago there werent any portables judy reminded me ten years ago one with the capacity of the checker in your closet would have been bigger and heavier than this beast ten years from now theyll probably pack even more microimps into a case you can cany around in your hip pocket too bad they havent done it yet i grumbled and stretched some more judy gave me a sidelong look are you trying to tell me you want me to get on top tonight if thats what youd like i said far as i can see its won derful either way or any others your imagination conjures up she asked her watch what time it was a tiny vertical frown line appeared between her eyes whatever we do lets do it soon were going to have to get up early to make it to the valley when the swap meet dealers start coming in so we did it soon and it was fine judy is one of the most thoroughly pragmatic people ive ever met but that doesnt keep her from being able to enjoy herself it just means she makes sure she blocks out the time in which to enjoy herself my alarm clock woke us up much too early on an other wise perfectly good sunday morning then laughed at us as we staggered around like a couple of the notquiteliving dead i swore id have to get a new clock one day soon i think ive said that before but this time i really meant it i showered then shaved while judy went in after me i was dressed by the time she came out and fixed breakfast while she got that thick wavy hair of hers dry scrambled eggs toast coffee very basic i threw the dishes in the sink for later did my heman weightiifting routine with the con stabulary spellchecker and offwe went they hold the sunday morning swap meet at the mason harry turtledove flyin by night its the biggest outdoor lightandmagic house in the valley by day its just an enormous parking lot so they get some extra use and some extra crowns out of the space because we were good and early we got to park dose to the dealers entrance for which my overworked back was heartily grateful the only people there were a couple of guards drinking coffee from a big jug they looked like and turned out to be sunlighting offduty constables their names were luke and pete i had trouble remembering which one was which they both had the same short dark hair the same watchful eyes the same big shoulders theyd been told we were coming somebody was on the ball there they helped set up the spellchecker at the side of the gate then poured more coffee for judy and me it was nice and hot the jug must have had a tiny salamander in the base some of the new storage vessels have a salamander on one side and an ice elemental on the other so they can keep hot things hot and cold things cold the only problem is you dont want to drop them if the partition between the two elementals breaks they fight like cats and dogs i explained what i was looking for and why both guards looked grim pete or maybe it was luke said i hope you nail the bastard i got three kids at home i dont like think ing about anything like that happening to one of em luke or was it pete pointed to the spellchecker and said i wish that thing could spot theft along with sorcery it would sure make the departments life a lot easier pete anyway the other one said i was at a briefing about theft detectors a couple of weeks ago from what i heard they operate by spotting guilt in a perpetrators soul trouble is most perpetrators dont feel enough guilt to set em off judy said understand theyve recently identified the sorcerous component of intent that may make some new lands of antitheft magic possible provided the discrimina tion spell routines are sensitive enough to tell real larceny from a merchants legitimate appetite for profit case of the toxic spell dump the guards had given her the usual looks a man gives an attractive woman they were polite about it nothing to bother her or me now they looked at her in a different way id seen that happen a lot of times before when people real ized how sharp she was i just smiled ive known it for years i sure hope they make something like mat work pete said an awful lot of stuff you see here is stolen everybody knows it but how do you prove it if you could itll happen judy said not tomorrow probably not the day after either but ifu happen the principles are there the gremlins are in engineering the actuating sorcery and the support systems by god id cheer for anything that made my job easier for once pete said id cheer louder if i thought the techniques would just be used for tracking down thieves but ive got a bad feeling they wont judy said the more effective magic becomes the more the powers that be will use it to poke into ordinary peoples lives thats the way things seem to work anyhow pete and luke represented the powers that be now they looked at each other but neither of them said anything i told you they were polite for that matter im part of the powers that be too but i stood with judy on this one peo ple often dont realize how precious just being left alone is even if the guards had decided to aigue wed have been too busy to cany it very far dealers started showing up pete and luke checked their permits and made sure theyd paid for their stall space judy and i monitored the spellchecker as they came through the gateway some of them had their goods and stall setups on carts that they pushed or pulled others piled them onto little carpets that sort isnt bywaylegal but ifs awfully handy for hauling things around quite a few dealers werent happy about passing in front of a spellchecker what is this the airport one of them grumbled so many dealers asked questions that my spiel got real smooth real fast by the time the first four or five had gone by id taken out my epa sigil and set it on top of the spell checker id point to it and say were looking for a very harry turtledove specific contaminant that we have reason to believe is being sold at swap meets perhaps unwittingly nothing else we notice will get cited that probably wasnt quite true if somebod d come by with something as conspicuously illegal as a crate of black lotuses for instance we wouldnt have let him take them in but to my relief noth ing like that happened and the explanation kept the dealers from getting antsy heavens what a lot of stuff there was clothes food jew elry nostrums the microimps in the spellchecker seemed dubious a few times but not dubious enough to make me stop anybody ethemet receiver imp modules i wondered how many of those were stolen toys both mechanical and sorcerous guitars grimoires judy looked more than scorn ful at the quality i could go on for a lot longer the dealers were as varied as the stuff they sold men women blonds blacks aztedans persians hanese samo ans indians in dhotis and saris the other flavor indians in feathers i watched one bronzesldnned fellow slip out of his work shirt and put on a feather bonnet he noticed me watching him grinned land of sheepishly gotta look authentic if you want the people to buy your medicine man he said as he pushed his cart past me why not i answered agreeably i glanced down at the spellchecker from what the microimps had to say about them the medicines werent strong enough to be worth buy ing i wondered if the alleged indian was even as genuine as the stuff he sold the next fellows through were a pair of aztecans the had a rug with their stuff on it and were chatting with each other in spainish judy gave me a hard shot in the ribs with her elbow huh i said then i looked at the ground glass in the spellchecker if they hadnt been trained to tell what they were sensing the litde imps would have run and hid as it was my stomach lurched when i saw what they reported hold on there you two i said sharply they hadnt noticed me or the spellchecker whats the case of the toxic spell dump matter one of them asked at die same time as the other one said who are you i picked up my sigil environmental perfection agency i said what do you have in those boxes nostrums one of them answered i got a friend his brotherinlaw hunts dragons down in aztecia he gets the blood sells some to us we dilute it sell some here every body makes some money he didnt sound like a crook just a fellow doing a job thats what he looked like too he and his friend both ordi nary guys in work shoes and jeans cotton tunics and caps the first thing you leam is you cant tell by looking pete and luke came alert they didnt move toward us not yet but they quivered like lycanthropes just before the full moon rises which one of you is jose judy asked suddenly the one in die red cap jerked in surprise howd you know diat lady i unreeled die long probe from die spellchecker actually i wished i had one of diose elevenfoot rumanians tm going to have to ask you to open one of diose jars of dragon blood for me i said jose shrugged sure why not he flipped the lid off one of die boxes the jars inside looked like die ones cuauhtemoc hemandez kept in his workroom once upon a time die d held mayonnaise now as soon as jose un screwed a top i knew what diey held judy who was at die spellchecker made a small strangled noise id told her what kind of stuff was in diere but hearing about it doesnt pack the same punch as seeing it in die ground glass i waved to pete and luke they came trotting over the fellow in die blue cap whod kept pretty quiet up till now saw diem and said what die hells going on thafc just what i want to know i snapped considering what was in die jars i meant it literally i turned back to jose you ever sell any of dlis ah dragon blood to a cumndero named cuauhtemoc hemandez i sell to lots of people man he answered they pay cash i dont ask who diey are you know how diat goes he harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump spread his hands and looked at me one man of the world to another i knew how it went all right it meant he didnt pay taxes on the money he made at the swap meets ifs theoretically possible for the crown to keep track of all the crowns in the confederation the financial wiards in the gray flannel suits back in dstc would love to do it too trouble is of course that the sorcery involved is so complex that it makes getting the garuda bird off the ground look like tossing a roc by comparison and so people like jose will go on cheating on what they owe and people like you and me will end up foot ing the bill for them except now jose was facing some time at public expense of an altogether different sort i said by what the spell checker shows me sir there isnt any dragon blood in here theres human blood and human sidn and i looked back at judy who nodded a godawful strong stink of huitz ilopochdi jose and bluecap i found out later his name was car los so ill call him that looked at each other if they werent utterly appalled they should have been making their money at the lightandmagic shows not swap meets they wouldnt have gotten it in cash but theyd have made enough to keep from complaining as soon as he heard huitzuopochtii pete or maybe luke said you gentlemen are under arrest anything you say may be used against you the offduty constable who hadnt arrested the nostrums peddlers whichever one he was headed for the office ill call the station get em to send a squad carpet over here as soon as hed gone maybe twenty feet toward the door jose and carlos tried to run for it being off duty pete car ried only a club he yanked it out and pounded after jose that left me with carlos be careful dave judy yelled at my back it was good advice it would have been even better had i been in a position to take it carlos was a little wiry guy and shifty as a jackrabbit but every one of my strides ate up twice as much ground as his he looked over his shoulder saw i was gaining and didnt watch where his feet were going he fell splat on his face i jumped on him his hand darted for one of the pockets in his jeans i didnt know what he had in there maybe something as sim ple as a knife maybe a talisman like the ones at loki except with a demon ordered to attack whoever was bothering him whatever he had i didnt care to find out the hard way either i grabbed his wrist and hung on for dear life dont be stupid i panted you wont get away and you will get yourself in more trouble chinga tu niadre he said no doubt sincere but less than germane then he tried to knee me in a place which would have interfered with my carrying out his instructions i managed to twist away so i took it in the side of the hip it still hurt but not the way it would have as if from very far away i heard people shouting back and forth the way they do when they have no idea whats going on and just get more confused trying to find out carlos took another shot at refaceting my family jewels then from right above us somebody yelled freeze asshole somewhere in his past carlos must have painfully found out what happened when you disobeyed that particu lar command he went limp very cautiously i looked back over my shoulder there was luke with his club upraised to do some serious facial rearrangement on anybody who felt like arguing with him hes all yours i croaked and got to my feet i hadnt noticed tib then that id torn my pants ripped a chunk of hide off one knee and scraped an elbow too not quite as bad things started to hurt all at the same time i felt shaky the way you do in the first few seconds after a traf fic accident pete had hold of jose luke was frisking carlos turned out hed had a blade in his pocket maybe two inches long not exactly a terror weapon but not something id have wanted sliding along or maybe between my ribs judy ran up are you all right dave yeah i think so i said taking stock one piece at a time harry turtledove i hadnt been in a fight since i was in high school id forgot ten the way you could taste fear and fury in your mouth the way even your sweat suddenly smelled different id sort of hoped shed throw her arms around me and exclaim oh you wonderful man something like that any how as ive remarked however judy is a very practical person she said youre lucky you werent badly hurt you know that so much for large dumb masculine hopes a little man with a big mustache burst out of the office luke had been heading for when the fun and games started by then luke had carlos handcuffed he pointed to me and said here losef fix this guy up would you unless i miss my guess hes been working harder than hes used to at the epa losef looked at my elbow my knee and my pants youre right he told luke his accent seems everybody has an accent in angels city these days was one i couldnt place he reached up patted me on the shoulder you come with me my friend we fix you up i came with him he fixed me up all right he sat me down in the office an amazing collection of pictures of girls and succubi filled one wall i was glad judy hadnt come along even if she wouldnt have done anything more than sniff bustled out and returned a couple of minutes later with a fellow who toted a black bag the doctor his name was mkhinvari had the same odd accent as losef he looked at my elbow said roll up your pants looked at my knee is not too bad he said which was about what i thought he cleaned the scrapes though being a doctor he called them abrasions with spirits which hurt worse than getting them had then he touched each one with a bloodstone to make it stop oozing slapped on a couple of bandages and went his way losef said now we fix trousers you wait here i dutifully waited there this time he came back with a grayhaired woman this is carlotta shes best in the business carlotta nodded to me but she was more interested in my pants she touched the two edges of the hole together case of the toxic spell dump murmured under her breath yes i know youll say any tai lors shop has somebody who specializes in repairing rips ifs easy to apply the law of similarity because the torn material is in essence like the untom doth around it and to use the law of contagion to spread that cloth over the area with which it was formerly in contact but on most repairs youll be able to see if you look closely the seam between the real cloth and the whole dodi from which the fix was made not with carlottas work though as far as i could tell the pants might never have been torn i even got die crease back that left a fairsized bloodstain carlotta turned to losef and said shut the door please after he did she reached into her sewing bag and pulled out a little nightbox of the sort that are made so carefully no light can get in when she opened it a small pallid fuzzy creature crawled out vampire hamster he explained they are drawn to doth and well you will see the vampster didnt like even the tiny bit of day sliding under the bottom of die door it made a snuffly noise of complaint before carlotta could tell him to losef went over and shoved a dirow rug into die crack the vampster relaxed carefully any undead even a rodent needs to be handled widi respect carlotta picked it up by die scruff of die neck and set it on my pants leg i sat very still i didnt want die creature going after blood i hadnt already spilled but itwas well trained it sniffed around till it found die stain on my trousers dien stuck out a pale pale tongue and began to lap die blood right out of the dodi when it was finished not a trace of die stain was left and die vampire hamsters tongue had turned noticeably pinker as my blood began to enter its circulation when carlotta plucked it off me it wiggled and hissed it was feeling frisky now she plopped it back into die nightbox closed die lid and touched a crucifix to die latch so die vampster couldnt get out by itself my pants didnt even feel damp i guess vampire hamsters dont have spit and die stain was all gone thanks very much i said to carlotta thats beautiful work harry turtledove tor a friend of losefs its a pleasure of course she waved at the wall of succubi and giris losef has lots of friends id have shriveled up and died or at least looked for a nightbox to hide in after a crack like that but losef must have been shriven against embarrassment oh if only they were he said rumbling laughter i would die young but i would die happy he turned to me you are all right i am all right i answered thanks for taking care of me i went back outside blinking against the daylight as if i were undead myself the blackandwhite constabulary car pet had just flown in one of the constables he looked just like pete and luke except he was blond took my statement youll hear from us inspector fisher he promised good enough i looked over to where his partner was transferring the vile potion from jose and carlos rug to the squad carpet handle that stuff with extreme respect you dont want it spilling so weve been warned he nodded back toward luke and pete then touched the brim of his cap god give you good day he went back to the carpet to keep an eye on carlos and jose judy walked over to me she inspected the bandage on my elbow then the knee of my trousers she felt the mate rial i winced anticipating shed poke the raw meat under there but she didnt thats a wonderful patch job she said losef has connections i said i just wish people were as easy to repair as clothes the elbow and knee were throb bing again luke ambled up and said now that weve dropped on the guys you were looking for shall we let the rest of the dealers in without running em past the spellchecker he pointed outside the gates nobody had gone through since the dustup with jose and carlos started now they were lined up like carpets on st james freeway on friday night and not moving much slower sure go ahead i told him like you said we caught case of the toxic spell dump the people we wanted glad cries came from the dealers when luke started waving them through i stuck my head into losefs office and asked if i could store the spellchecker there so judy and i could do some shopping when he said yes i cut across the incoming stream of dealers and lugged the gadget back across i wondered for a moment if it would react to the pictures of succubi but it didnt losef sure seemed to though judy said im glad we caught them now we can enjoy our own sunday knowing they wont be spreading their poi sons to anyone else that pair wont anyhow i agreed but i wondered how much other contraband would get sold right here at this swap meet and at all the others around angels city a lot unless i missed my guess i tried not to think about that the dealers whod been delayed were all setting up their stalls in a tearing hurry when you try to rush things a lot of the time you end up doing them wrong some of the dealers seemed as if they were doing music hall comedy turns poles and awnings and signs would go up then a second later theyd fall down again one guy had his sign fall over three times in a row after the third time he gave it a good kick maybe that knocked the gremlins loose because on the fourth try it stayed where he put it a couple of minutes later right at ten i found out why the dealers were in such a frantic rush the customer gates opened then right on time and never mind that the dealers had been delayed losef was not about to waste a chance if hed held up the customers some of them might have gotten miffed and gone home and customers he had aplenty jews persians hanese and japanese and indians none of whose sabbath rituals were disturbed by getting there on sunday and spending money along with them were a goodly but not godly number of folks id have guessed to be christian both of aztecan descent and every other variety some people of any faith feel more attachment to money than to any other god it may seem crazy but every once in a while i wish die harry turtledove confederation were a little less prosperous a litde less secure in flush times people think of themselves and the devil with anybody and anything else they sometimes need reminding that whats happening now isnt forever which probably sounds like sour grapes since i was out there shopping right alongside everybody else but you wouldnt i dont think have found me there on a saturday judy and i wandered up one asphalt aisle and down the next pausing at one stall here another one there judy picked up a green silk scarf that went well with her red brown hair i bought a new alarm clock i was sick of the shrieking horror i had at home and even sicker of it laugh ing at me this one was made in siam with a native horological demon it cost less than five crowns if i didnt like it id toss it too and try one more time we both got sausages on buns from a persian fellows pushcart given his own faith he wasnt one whod sell pork i think i mentioned that one of the dealers had brought in a load of grimoires getting a scarf or a dock at a place like that is one thing but it never ceases to amaze me that people think you can acquire sorcerous skill and power on the cheap as with anything important you need to learn from the one whos best not the one with the best price naturally judy paused at the display she flipped through a couple of volumes turned away shaking her head the fel low who was hawking them scowled in disappointment he thought hed found another sucker that bad i asked worse she said the fatter book there is one of those compendia of spells in the public domain and theyre in the public domain because they werent very good to begin with the other one the one in the blue binding is one of those teachyourselftobeamagemthreeweeks books i spotted a couple of typos toward the end they might be dangerous under other circumstances why not now because ninetynine people out of a hundred wont get far enough in the course to stumble across them and the odd case of the toxic spell dump one the one who does stick to it will have learned enough to spot them before he does something stupid okay i see what youre saying that makes sense but once she got rolling judy wasnt one who stopped easily the folks who buy those things are the same women wholl plunk down fifty crowns for a magic cream to make their breasts bigger or men wholl pay a couple of hundred for magic to make something else bigger the only magic there is the one that the people who sell this land of junk have for spotting fools she didnt bother to keep her voice down a couple of middleaged ladies whod been about to inspect the grimoires took off for another stall as if theyd been caught looking at something blasphemous lady please whined the guy who was peddling the junk tm tryingto make aliving so why dont you try to make an honest one she said but then she threw her hands in the air whats the use id seen her in those moods before the only thing to do is get her interested in something new i said look over there at the jewelry that woman is selling it isnt something you see every day all id aimed at was distracting judy but by sheer luck i turned out to be right some of the pieces from the jew eler tamarisks gems her sign said were of the modem sort clunky with crystals but even those were in finer settings than you usually find at a fancy store let alone a swap meet and the rest judy is enamored of things grecoroman a lot of the necklaces bracelets rings and other pieces were copies so skulful that but for their obvious newness and their profu sion they might have been museum pieces and tamarisk a sharpfaced brunette who wore her hair tied up in a ker chief knew her business too her eyes lit up when judy pointed at what looked to me like a gold safety pin and called it a fibula and she practically glowed when judy identified a little pendant head dangling from a necklace as a bulla they lost me after that as far as i knew they might have been incanting when they started throwing around terms like repousse and lost wax harry turtledove i saw how judys eye kept coming back to a romanstyle ring with an eagle in low relief on a wide flat gold bezel it was in profile a tiny emerald highlighted its visible eye nor mally i would have said it was a mans ring but jud s last name is adier after all and ather means eagle in the most speculative voice i could come up with i re marked you know hon i havent found you an engagement ring yet eveiy once in a while you say the right thing judy as you will have garnered is a steady serious person more so than i am and i lean in that direction myself making her face light up as if the sun had just risen behind her eyes isnt easy watching it happen made me light up too then i got hugged and then i got kissed and all the while tamarisk was just standing there patient as the sphinx and i figure every smooch i got upped the asking price of that ring about another fifteen crowns but so it goes some things are more important than money thats what i told myself anyhow we haggled for a while considering that tamarisk knew she had me where she wanted me she was more merciful than she might have been but not much when we finally agreed on a price she said and how will you pay cash no i dont like to carry that much on me do you take masterimp certainly sir id lose half my business if i didnt i dug into my hip pocket pulled out my wallet and from it the card tamarisk took a receiver plate out from under her display table when i was a kid credit was a complicated business full of solemn oaths and threats of vengeance from the other side on renegers and much default anyhow because so many people find gold and god easy words to confuse its not that way any more a lot of the mystique is gone but so is a lot of the risk modem technology again as with the burgeoning phone system ectoplasmic cloning has made all the difference i put my thumb on the card to show i was its rightful possessor tamarisk did the same with the receiver plate together we declared how many crowns wed agreed to transfer from my account to hers case of the toxic spell dump the conjoined microimps in the card and the plate com pleted the circuit by etherically contacting the accounting spirits at my bank which confirmed that i did have the crowns to transfer as soon as the transaction was complete the card started sliding around on the plate as if it were on a ouija board i picked it up and stuck it back in my wallet then with tamarisk smiling die smile of a businessperson whos just had a good day i picked up the ring and set it on judys finger because id found the style a little masculine i was afraid it would be big tamarisk said ill size that for you if you need me to but judy held up her hand and showed both of us that it fit well she and i grinned liking the omen its wonderful she said thank you david i got idssed again which couldnt help but improve things tm always glad to see my customers happy tamarisk said beaming and i hope you wont take it amiss if i tell you i also do wedding rings i think we may just make a note of that i said in my most solemn voice as i pocketed one of her cartes de visite judy nodded with a last backward look at the other lovelies on display we wandered off to have a look at the rest of the swap meet judy kept murmuring its wonderful over and over shed hold up her hand so the ring would sparkle in the sun and the little emerald catch fire as if it were the eye of a liv ing bird said first chance you get maybe tomorrow eve ning you ought to take it to a jeweler you trust i know it looks good and i know tamarisk seems fine but i want to make sure you only have the best ill do that she said and then a moment later or maybe i wont have to weve got a constabularyquality spellchecker sitting in the office waiting for us if it wont tell us whether weve just bought faiiy gold what good is it true enough i admitted and if anything is wrong not that i think there will be mistress tamarisk will have a visit from pete and luke when she sets up here next week which one of them is which judy asked harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump oh good i exclaimed im not the only one who couldnt tell then and when somebody like judy has trouble telling two people apart you know there isnt much to choose between them before long we went back to the dealers gate after tamarisks stall the rest of the meet was strictly a downhill slide i manhandled the spellchecker out of losefs office poured out a little wine to enspirit the microimps and touched the probe to judys ring physically it was gold and copper in a ration of three to one it had an karat stamp and lived up to it the litde emerald was a real litde emerald that was plenty to satisfy me but as long as the microimps were looking at the ring i let them examine its magical component as well i wouldnt have been surprised if theyd drawn a blank jewelry is a trade you can if you so choose cany on largely without sorcerous aid but no tamarisk had worked a small spell of fidelity on it by analogy with the legionarys faithful ness to his eagle as a symbol of rome that just made me happier what better enchantment to find on an engagement ring judy was reading the ground glass upside down when she saw that she squeezed my hand hard i shut down die spellchecker hauled it to my carpet and took it back to the constabulary station i got a round of applause when i brought it in sign him up somebody shouted which made me grin like a fool we flew back to my block of flats after that when we got back up to my place well i wont say i got molested because i didnt feel in the least that it was a molestation but it was something on that order judy and i liked pleasing each other in lots of different ways which also augured well for the days that would come after we stood under the kiwppah together after sunday worse luck comes monday with monday worse luck would come the weekly office staff meeting as if that werent enough to start things off on the wrong foot congealed was the only word that fit traffic on st james freeway what with my weekend peregrinations i was starting to think i lived on that miserable freeway its a curse of angels city life when at last i got up to my desk i discovered somebody had put a toy constabulary badge on top of the papers in my in basket whats this about i said loudly carrying the souvenir out into the hall several people heard me squawk and stuck their heads of out their offices to see what was going on we didnt know till yesterday that we had a real live hero here in the office phyllis kaminsky said she batted her eyes at me in a way shed evidently borrowed from the succubi she was trying to control from her it came off as more sardonic than seductive thats right jose franco chimed in i wish my garlic spraying program would get as much good ethemet publicity as dave pulled in last night oh god i said and meant every word of it what have they been saying about me i didnt really want to know one more argument against having an ethemet receiver that way you dont have to listen to what reporters do to things you were involved in we heard what a brave fellow you were breaking up this contraband ring and capturing the leader singlehanded martin sandoval said the graphic artist paused before he stuck the gaff in me so we all clubbed together to buy you that symbol of our appreciation i looked down at the little tin badge if it cost half a crown whoever bought it got cheated i do hope it wont bankrupt you generous people bea swept into the office just then what wont bankrupt whom she asked which meant everybody had to tell the story all over again i resigned myself to getting ribbed worse than adam until people got tired of the joke bea said i know a better way to commemorate the occasion david can lead off at the meeting this morning thank you bea i intoned if shed told me i could leave after id given my report that would have been worthwhile as it was i figured id taken the early lead in harry turtledove the running for the dubious achievement of the week award i went back into my office and did as much as i could till half past nine which was meeting time just to make sure we couldnt pretend to forget and so accomplish something worth doing before lunch rose called everyone to remind us all to come on up to beas office even michael manstein was there looking out of place in his white lab robe among all the business domes and martins casual getup since he doesnt go out in the field he can dress as he pleases good morning everyone bea said when wed all assembled bright and not too eager before her i think well begin with david this morning by all accounts hes had the most exciting week of any of us i flashed the little tin badge and growled now listen up everybody or else actually my report went pretty well michael backed me up on the sorcerous details of the potion id found at lupe corderos and everyone looked suitably grim on hearing them i told about the arrest of the curandero whod sold lupe the stuff and about being lucky enough to come across jose and carios on sunday your diligence does you and the epa credit david bea said which was enough of a brownie point to make me want to set out a bowl of milk the other nice thing about having been so busy with all that stuff was that i didnt get in trouble for die too numer ous tilings i hadnt managed to accomplish during the week the toxic spell dump investigation perse was stalled i hadnt managed to get out to bakhtiars precision burins let alone chocolate weasel or the lightandmagic outfits i still didnt know whether the chumash powers were coming or going and as for the leprechauns well the environmental impact survey hadnt started going anywhere either all of which meant of course that for the next several days id be running around like acephalous poultry trying to catch up on those projects and whatever else landed on me in the interim not a pleasant prospect to contemplate of a monday morning case of the toxic spell dump bea said jose you and martin are going to report together am i right they did martn produced the mockup for a poster of an ugly little green fellow sinking his fangs into an orange the text said hes not your friend dont give him a ride in english and spainish thats veiy good bea said very good indeed it ought to make a lot of people who have been raising the roof about gariic spraying see medvamps in a whole new light you can start reproducing it right away as far as im concerned comments anyone am i missing something with a lot of bosses youd better not dislike something after they said they loved it bea bless her isnt like that michael manstein stuck up his hand and said the poster does not accurately reflect the appearance of the mediterra nean fruit vampire he was right of course medvamps not that michael would use such a colloquialism are as pale as any other un dead creatures and the sap they suck from fruits and vegetables is commonly clear too but bea said patiently we dont need to be precisely accurate here michael we want to get across the notion that the medvamp is a danger ous pest not something that ought to survive and flourish in angels city does the poster meet that objective manstein shrugged it should be obvious in any case and it would be obvious too if everyone were as rational as michael the general run of people being what they are though rationality needs all me help it can get the poster was passed by acclamation and we went on to phybis by then it was getting close to eleven oclock and my stomach was starting to rumble but phyuis had landed a project even uglier than my intertwined investigations of the chumash powers and the wisdom of naturalizing lepre chauns shed started doing a study on the pros and cons of changing the way angels city handles its sewage not to put too fine a point on it angels city produces a whole lot of shit for tile last many years phyllis who is a very thorough person said how many but i forget weve used the demon vepar to process all this waste vepars harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump provinces are the sea and putrefaction so the arrangement has always seemed logical enough the trouble is members of the descending hierarchy just arent reliable lately as the population of angeles city has grown so have the number of sewage spills and the number of days the water in st monicas bay is too foul for swimming or fishing or anything else and so theres been some serious discussion of transfer ring the job to poseidon if anyone on the other side has a vested interest in keeping the ocean clean hes the one not only that he also has power over earthquakes in angels city that matters having one power in charge of both those aspects of local life might well save the taxpayer some crowns or it might not poseidons cult like that of hermes is artificially maintained these days angels city would have to pay into the fund that municipalities and organizations which use the sea gods services have set up to provide for his wor ship that wouldnt be cheap vepar like any judeochristian demon has enough genuine believers to keep him active without any expense the city would have to assume bea asked what communities are currently using posei don to handle their sewage and what sort of results have they gotten there are several phyllis said the first one that occurs to me is athenai piraievs over in ellas not a fair comparison michael manstein put in in ellas the god comes much closer to having a continuous tra dition of worship than he would in angels city and is likely to be significantly more efficacious i will be happy to pro vide documentation to support this assertion phyllis glared at him no doubt hed just undercut the example she was going to use but when michael says a com parison isnt appropriate he wsi have evidence to back him up fumbling a litde phyllis talked about carthage instead the real trick i gathered from what she had to say was keeping poseidon happy about getting his hands dirty so to speak some powers with artificially maintained cults are pathetically eager to do anything at all as long as they keep their last handful of worshipers others have more pride poseidon seemed to be part of the second group but he does do a satisfactory job when properly incen tivized bea persisted michael visibly flinched when he heard that but again held his tongue bea was a bureaucrat after all every so often she went and talked like one that is my impression phyllis answered let me remind you if vepar were perfectly reliable wed have no reason for contemplating a change and theres the added benefit of increased earthquake protection or increased earthquake risk if the deity is angered michael said phyllis glared at him again but i think he was right to point out the problem environmental issues are the most complicated ones this side of theology and reading the text of the world is often more prone to ambiguity than interpreting a sacred scripture bea said thank you for the presentation phyllis do you think youll be able to give a preliminary recommendation on whether to pursue making this change in hmm two weeks time may i have three phyllis asked bea scribbled something on her calendar three weeks it is she looked around at the rest of us does anyone have anything more i sat very still willing silence on everybody around me sometimes that works and sometimes it doesnt today to my vast relief it did nobody said anything bea looked around again just in case shed missed someone on her first check then she shrugged thank you all that was the signal for us to get up and head for the door as fast as we could without being outandout rude oh and david bea called after me caught i turned around yes i said as innocently as i could i do hope youll have more progress to report on your other projects at our next meeting bea said tb do my best i promised thinking that if i had fewer projects i could get more done on each of them i also made harry turtledove a note to myself not for the first time that bea didnt miss much and i thought but didnt dare say i could also get more done if i didnt have to spend dose to half a day every week in staff meeting the papers on my desk were starting to create a rampart effect as if i were going in for trench warfare d la the first sorcerous war i was just getting ready for a serious assault on them when the phone delivered a sneak attack from the flank environmental perfection agency david fisher i said hoping the switching imps had misspelled and given me a wrong number but they hadnt inspector fisher this is legate kawaguchi of the angels city constabulary department i sat up straighter what can i do for you legate i stopped feeling guilty about getting interrupted after all the call involved one of the other projects i was working on bea would be pleased can you come up to the valley substation please inspector kawaguchi said the scriptorium spirit eras mus now appears capable of communicating i wanted to whoop with glee right in his ear i dont know how i stopped myself im on my way legate i chortled the ramparts on my desk would undoubtedly get higher while i was out of the office so what i told myself this is more important which was true but sooner or later id have to catch up with the other stuff anyhow i tried not to think about that as i hurried toward the slide vi my stomach was making litde plaintive grumbles by the time i got up into st ferdinands valley even without too many addenda beas meeting ran long and kawaguchi had called before i got a chance to think about lunch i grabbed a dachshund sausage at the first momandpop joint i came to once i got off the freeway and i must confess that i walked into the constabulary substation smelling of mustard some of the people whod seen me on sunday looked sur prised to find me back again what is this fisher you want to move in bomholm the thaumatech called to me off hand i couldnt think of a notion i liked less legate kawaguchis office was a musty little cell smaller than a monk would live in and messier than an abbot would tolerate im not exaggerating brother vahan was in there harry turtledove when i walked through the door and by the look on his face he would have given kawaguchi a really nasty penance if hed thought he could get away with it how are you faring i asked him after we shook hands did the cardinal ever grant that dispensation so your burned monks could get cosmetic sorcery no he said with that one word his heavy face dosed down completely so that he looked like nothing so much as one of those alarmingly realistic portrait busts from republi can rome the st elmos fire from the ceding gleamed off his bare pate as if it were polished marble kawaguchi said the scriptorium spirit erasmus was more severely harmed in the fire than we realized even now a couple of weeks after the arson was perpetrated weve needed a team of specialists to establish contact with it i was just explaining this to the abbot when you came in inspector fisher please go on then i answered if i find myself lost i hope you wont mind me interrupting with a question or two certainly kawaguchi said as i was telling brother vahan madame ruth and mr cholmondeley he pronounced it correctly as if it were spebed chumlee combine to facilitate communication between this side and the other she is a medium and he a channeler by pooling their talents and infusing new technology into their work theyve achieved some remarkable results we have every reason to hope for another success here today let us hope you are correct legate brother vahan said and i nodded too they are waiting for us in interrogation room two kawaguchi said nominally since the scriptorium spirit is on the other side it could be manifested anywhere however evoking it in an interrogation room will hopefully add to the weight of the questions being asked and the legate coughed the chamber in question has more space available than this office which might otherwise have been suitable take us to interrogation room two then i said case of the toxic spell dump brother vahan got up from his chair the fire and its after math had taken a lot out of him his stride had been strong and vigorous but now he walked like an old man thinking about where hed plant each toot before it came down interrogation room two lay halfway down a long gloomy had that seemed especially designed to put the fear of god into miscreants brought there kawaguchi opened the door waved brother vahan and me through ahead of him intro ductions took up the next couple of minutes madame ruth was a tall swarthy woman with a gold capped tooth she was also enormously fat her bright print dress would have been a tent on anyone else but had to stretch to cover ad of her pleased tmeetehuz she said when she shook hands with me she had a grip like a long shoremans her partner nigel cholmondeley couldnt have been more different from her if hed spent his whole life deliberately trying he was as britannic as his name elegant accent long thin redcheeked face complete with a little brush of sandy mustache old school cravat let me put it this way if hed been born under a caul it would have been a tweed one legate kawaguchi said before we begin would you care to give the hofy abbot and the inspector a notion of the tech niques you will utilize the large medium and the english channeler looked at each other for a moment before cholmondeley said allow me madame ruth shrugged massively i tried not to show how relieved i was id sooner have listened to him than her any day he said while communication with the other side is as old as mankind techniques have recently taken several steps forward as youll notice much of the equipment we employ would have been unfamiliar to the practitioners of only a few decades ago he pointed to the battered table shoved off to one side of the interrogation chamber on it were five of the strangest looking helmets id ever seen they looked as if theyd been made to cover the whole top of the head from the middle of harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump the nose on up i didnt see any eyeholes for them and they had long blunt projections out from where your ears would go with one on youd look something like an insect and something like a man whod just had a length of tree trunk pounded in one ear and out the other after giving brother vahan and me a few seconds to examine those curious artifacts cholmondeley resumed by your expressions gentlemen i should venture to say this is your first experience with virtuous reality he waited again maybe to let us deny it if hed kept on waiting for that hed have had a long wait he saw as much himself and smiled exposing a formidable mouthful of yellowish teeth virtuous reality my friends lets us simulate the best of the world it creates a plane neither fully of this side nor of the other whereon for example a wounded spirit may meet and communicate with us while not having to return fuby to the locus of its misfortune how do we go about reaching this uh virtuous reality i asked madame ruth and i shall be your guides cholmon deley smiled again even more toothily than before if you will just come over to the table there sit around it and place a helmet over your head the prospect did not fill me with enthusiasm but i went over to the table anyhow as i sat down on one of the hard constabulary department chairs madame ruth said once you put on your helmet take the hands of the people to either side of you well need an accomplished circle to access virtuous reality i reached for the helmet nearest me it was heavier than id expected maybe the weight lay in those ridiculous ear pieces i slipped it on it seemed to conform to my face id expected to be blind i hadnt expected to be deaf as well but the helmet seemed to suck away all my senses leaving me a void waiting to be filled distantly i remembered what madame ruth had told us to do i was sitting between brother vahan and nigel chol mondeley i made myself reach out to take their hands though i could hardly tell if my own were moving i found brother vahans hand first his grip was warm and strong it helped remind me i still needed to get hold of cholmondeley i fought against the apathy the helmet imposed on me at last after what seemed a very long time my fingers brushed his his bones were thin delicate almost birdhke i was afraid id hurt him if i put any pressure on them then i waited another longseeming while id expected things to start happening as soon as my hands joined my neighbors but it didnt work that way i still lingered my senses vitiated by the helmet after a while i began to won der whether i was still touching the abbot and the channeler i thought so but it was hard to be sure all at once color and sound and touch and all my other senses came flooding back i found out later that that was the instant in which the last two of us finally took each others hands completing the circle as madame ruth had said at the time i was just relieved to return to well where had i returned to wherever it was it wasnt dingy old interrogation room two it was a garden the most beautiful id ever seen col ors seemed brighter than life sounds clearer and sweeter smells as sharp and informative as if they came through a cats nose instead of my own welcome friends to the world of virtuous reality nigel cholmondeley said suddenly i could see him though he hadnt been there a moment before he still looked like him self but somehow he was handsome now instead of horsefaced this will be a new experience for you so look around madame ruth chimed in she too appeared when she spoke the big city had vanished from her accent as had the cap from her tooth and i saw that about sixty percent of the rest other had disappeared too she was still madame ruth as cholmondeley was still cholmondeley but now she looked good amazing legate kawaguchi murmured softly which made him spring into view while remaining himself he also looked like a recruiting poster for the angels city case of the toxic spell dump harry turtledove constabulary department no cynicism was left on his face and no tiredness either this is remarkable i said i presume that let me become visible to he others but not to myself as far as i could tell i remained a disembodied viewpoint too bad i would have liked finding out what an idealized version of me looked like let us proceed brother vahan said now i saw him too he doesnt look any different i exclaimed which was true the abbot remained a careworn man in a dark robe nigel cholmondeley spoke with enormous respect in virtuous reality only those who are themselves trufy virtuous before the experience have their seeming unchanged during it suddenly i wondered how much id altered to my com panions in this strange place maybe i didnt want to be idealized after all then all such petty concerns faded into insignificance you see i saw a serpent in the garden and i dont quite know how to explain this but its true the serpent wasnt crawling on its beoy this isnt just a garden i said awe in my voice as the realization crashed over me this is the garden thats right very good madame ruth sounded pleased id caught on so fast virtuous reality has translated you to a simulacrum of the place mankind enjoyed before the original sin while we were truly virtuous ourselves i am not sure i approve brother vahan said heavily the theological implications are troubling its only a thaumaturgical simulation a symbol if you will cholmondeley assure him we dont pretend other wise the test of a symbol is its utility and we have found this one to be of enormous value on that basis will you bear with us on that basis yes the abbot said but if he was happy about it he concealed the fact very well good without the willing consent of the participants the simulation is all too likely to break down which would precipitate us back into the mundane world where sadly virtue is less manifest cholmondeley said and as i said virtuous reality can be valuable as you see he pointed coming through the trees was erasmus in the strange space of virtuous reality the scriptorium spirit seemed as real and solid as any of the rest of us more real and solid than i seemed to myself brother vahan made a choked noise and ran toward the spirit erasmus ran toward the abbot too they embraced i can feel him brother vahan exclaimed finding his old friend palpable seemed to wipe away his reservations about virtuous reality at a stroke while brother vahan greeted erasmus i took a longer look at the trees from which the scriptorium spirit had emerged i recognized some of them orange and lemon pomegranate and date palm but others were strange to me both in appearance and in the scents that wafted from their fruits and flowers to my nose i wondered if the tree of knowledge grew in this version of the garden and what would happen if i tasted of it haw to ask that serpent i thought but when i looked around for if it was gone just as well i suppose i grieve that you were wounded brother vahan was say ing we all gathered around him and erasmus the abbot went on never in my worst nightmare did i imagine evil being so bold as to assail our peaceful monastery nor i erasmus answered mournfully id never heard him speak till that moment on this side hed manifested himself only with written words on the ground glass his apparent voice perfectly fit his studious appearance and the spectacles he affected it was dry serious on the pedantic side if you imagine michael manstein as a scriptorium spirit youre dose are you in pain now brother vahan asked anxiously no pain i think is impermissible in this remarkable place erasmus peered from one of us to the next i recog nize here inspector fisher of the environmental perfection agency and this other gentlemans semblance is also some how familiar to me although i do not know his name i am legate shiro kawaguchi of the angels city harry turtledove constabulary department kawaguchi said when erasmus looked his way perhaps you sensed my aura during the bre officers under my command helped rescue you that must account for it erasmus agreed i fear i have not yet made the acquaintance of the other two individuals here madame ruth and mr cholmondeley have made it pos sible for us to use what they term virtuous reality as a meeting ground with you brother vahan explained yes i have encountered the concept in recent journal issues erasmus voice suddenly grew sad again now without doubt lost to the flames intriguing to observe an application of it speaking of the flames legate kawaguchi broke in i would be grateful for your account of what took place during the evening on which the thomas brothers monastery fire took place must i recount it even in virtuous reality erasmus looked scared so dose came i to being ektinguished forever if you want the perpetrators apprehended we must have your statement kawaguchi answered yours i think is the only reliable testimony as to what occurred on the other side during the commission of the felony brother vahan added you should also know old friend that eleven of the brethren lost their lives in the fire and many others were badly burned his face twisted i thought about the stiffnecked cardinal of angels city and his doubts about cosmetic sorcery i did not know erasmus whispered his pale thin vis age twisted too remembered pain fear i couldnt teu they warned me it would be folly of the purest ray serene to speak of what they did to me evenassuming i was there after able to manifest myself which they found unlikely but eleven of the holy brethren very well abbot legate i shall speak in praise offofly legate kawaguchi held a stylus and note tablet in his hands i dont know where they came from they hadnt been there an instant before maybe it was just the nature of case of the toxic spell dump virtuous reality to accommodate itself to the wills and desires of those who occupied it being a constable kawaguchi felt he needed written documentation when he questioned a witness since he needed it he got it or maybe im altogether off base i dont pretend to be a thaumaturge at any rate note tablet poised the legate asked what do you mean by they erasmus the individuals who tormented me on the night of the fire the scriptorium spirit answered kawaguchi scribbled a note then he said let us take that night in chronological order if possible that may be the clearest method of ascertaining the facts in this matter is that a reasonable request for many denizens of the other side beings not so bound up in time as you humans the answer would be no erasmus said but as a scriptorium spirit concerned not only with order in my records but also with regular access to those records by the holy brethren and other researchers he looked toward me i have a dear sense of duration and sequence yes go ahead then kawaguchi poised his stylus erasmus took him literally beginning with the monks celebration of vespers he began to give a minutebymmute account of everything that had happened within range of his sensorium at first everything was both tedious and alto gether irrelevant if he kept up in that vein i began to fear wed stay in virtuous reality forever it would certainly feel like forever nigel cholmondeley held up a hand forgive me eras mus he broke in but could you perhaps skip to that portion of the evening when you first noticed something amiss ah erasmus gave kawaguchi a whydidntyousay whatyouwanted look then took up the tale anew at in the morning two unauthorized persons entered the scriptorium i attempted to give the alarm but was pre vented before erasmus could answer brother vahan put in we harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump noted nothing out of the ordinary legate as i told you on the night of the fire that evildoers should trespass upon hal lowed ground without drawing the notice of anyone within and that they should overcome alarm spells lain down with die authority of the holy catholic church they had no small power behind them till the day i would not have thought it possible like any other major faith the catholic church maintains that its connections with the other side are the most potent around id say the most omnipotent but purists like michael manstein and erasmus wouldnt approve with the powers the church has over there its not easy even for a jew like me to disagree very loudly having his holy protec tion fail must have been a dreadful shock for brother vahan i cannot answer the question with certainty erasmus said i know only that i was silenced as the holy abbot has suggested by a spell of great force what flavor did it have i asked was it some strong an cient ritual revived specially for this purpose or did it cany the precision of modem magic again i cannot say the scriptorium spirit answered if i may use an analogy from your side as well ask a mouse crushed by a boulder in a landslide whether it was granite or sandstone very well we are to understand you were forcibly silenced and prevented from alerting the brethren kawaguchi said trying to keep erasmus moving in the right direction what transpired subsequently i was interrogated erasmus answered my questioners sought to learn what inspector fisher here had gleaned from our records i tried to refuse i tried to resist the holy abbot had ordered me to treat the inspector in all ways as if he were one of the brethren and i should never have betrayed heir secrets who came into the scriptorium like or rather as thieves in the night then they began to torment me so much for virtuous reality i didnt feel virtue not after i heard that what i felt was guilt i didnt need to ask that disappearing serpent where the tree of knowledge grew id already eaten of it at the thomas brothers monastery and because i had erasmus had suffered brother vahan made a noise that said he was suffering too he embraced the scriptorium spirit they dung to each other whatever legate kawaguchi was feeling he didnt let it interfere with his interrogation he said could you please describe for me the torments performed upon you brother vahan angrily turned on him why are you try ing to force erasmus to reexperience the torments those murderers inflicted because their nature may provide important information on the perpetrators kawaguchi answered the particular magics utilized will be clues to the backgrounds of those who performed them i assure you this is standard constabulary procedure in dealing with cases involving the other side brother vahan i pray your pardon the abbot said he was one of the rare people ive met who didnt find his manhood threat ened by backing down you dont tell me how to conduct my affairs i owe you the same courtesy erasmus kawaguchi said the scriptorium spirit didnt look happy about recounting what had happened to him but after a little while he nod ded let it be as you say legate and may the truth bear out your hopes first came fire this would have been at when my questioners decided i was and would remain obdurate fire wasnt reported in the monastery until after one kawaguchi said not the fire of this side but that of the other which burns the spirit rather than the material erasmus replied not for nothing i can now tell you do so many mortals fear the pangs of hellfire for to endure such eternally would be anguish indeed kawaguchi scribbled notes i wondered how much good theyd do him counting the magics that dont have fire in them somewhere is a much easier job than reckoning up those that do and the way erasmus talked about what had harry turtledove happened to him suggested the fire sprang from christian or muslim sources die former espedaby didnt lend itself to narrowing down the list of suspects the scriptorium spirit continued at the invaders concluded fire was inadequate to persuade me they resorted instead to the venom of sorcerous serpents which coursed through my ichor and brought with it suffering dif ferent from but not less intense than that which the names had produced snakes you say kawaguchi repeated with a nowwere gettingsomewhere air and of what nature were they with all respect legate i must remind you that i am a scriptorium spirit at a monastery not a herpetologistfs establishment erasmus answered in a dignified voice i can state with authority that they were dissimilar to the one inhabiting the garden here for which claim i have scriptural authority behind me past that fools may rush in but while i am no angel i tear to tread i found a question i thought kawaguchi had missed can you describe the men who tormented you erasmus again i fear not the spirit answered they were masked against the sight of your side and so cloaked around in sorcery that i have no notion of their true spiritual sem blance either save that were it benign they would not have used me as they did i sighed kawaguchi sighed even brother vahan looked a little less saintly than he had nigel cholmondeley and madame ruth shifted from foot to foot theyd brought us all together here in virtuous reality but for the amount of in formation erasmus had given us they might as well not have bothered very well then kawaguchi said sighing again what happened next i still refused to divulge the nature of the research inspector fisher had been conducting erasmus said at the intruders again became discontented with their means of torment and shifted stratagems i found myself tramped under the sharp hooves of an enormous cow that made me sit up and take notice metaphorically you case of the toxic spell dump understand legate kawaguchi leaned forward toward erasmus till he was fell past the point where i thought hed fall on his face maybe you cant do that in virtuous reality i dont know a cow you say he pressed not a bull are you sure about that i am certain erasmus declared interesting kawaguchi said i saw what he was flying toward bull cults are common straight mithraism has never quite died and there are modem revivalist sects trying to pick up supporters who dont get the spiritual charge they need from christianity and islam personally i dont need to get drenched by the blood of a slaughtered bull to feel a union with the godhead but some folks evidently do but cows now two of the places where the cow is a focus of magic are india home of the garuda bird and persia from which sprang among others in the case slow jinn fizz and bakhtiars precision burins a place i hoped id get to before i died of old age erasmus went on the hooves of the cow seemed sharp as whetted steel they flayed me past any anguish i had pre viously imagined and so to my lasting shame inspector fisher at i yielded to my inquisitors torment and described in detail the records i had copied for you judge me as you will the deed is done when a spirit talks about lasting shame it means lasting forever unless ifs a sylph or one of that flighty breed i said erasmus you did the best you could what you went through is more than i could have stood im sure of that you dont need to feel shame on my account you are gracious the scriptorium spirit said brother vahan also inclined his head in my direction that made me feel good winning brother vahans good opinion isnt easy but its worth doing what happened after you finished providing the perpe trators with this information after kawaguchi glanced down at his notes i finished betraying inspector fisher at erasmus said bleakly i hoped that would be the end of it that the malefactors would take what they had learned and depart harry turtledove instead as you know they forthwith kindled the fire which i gather resulted in the destruction of the thomas brothers monastery as to that i could not speak with certainty for when the ground glasses in the scriptorium melted or shattered from the heat of the flames i lost my interface with your side and still in agony awaited my own dissolution the firecrew and constabulary rescued you i said exactly so at the time and since i have doubted whether they did me any great favor but as with my betrayal of you the deed is done and we now must proceed to act upon its consequences the scriptorium spirit turned to legate kawaguchi oh there is one thing more for some time after i was tormented i lacked much of my normal awareness of self and surroundings were i flesh and blood i gather you would say i was semiconscious only quite recently have i regained my full sensorium when i did so i found as part of my immediate surroundings this i hadnt figured erasmus for a sense of the dramatic but from behind his back he pulled out a short green feather kawaguchi held out his had may i see it erasmus gave it to him he felt it held it close to his face in a gesture that said he was nearsighted he shrugged just seems like a feather to the eye and the hand he turned to madame ruth and nigel cholmondeley and asked are magical forensic tests possible in virtuous reality they both shook their heads madame ruth said remember that isnt the actual feather youre holding legate but its analog in this sorcerous space and like everything else in virtuous reality it is imbued with special properties springing from this space and thus not a fit subject for testing i should have thought of that kawaguchi clicked his tongue between his teeth not so much in disappointment as in annoyance at himself he turned to brother vahan fur ther questions i have one i said how did the two men react when you finally yielded to the cows hooves and told them what id been investigating case of the toxic spell dump one of them said to the other hell get his too i expect erasmus answered it didnt surprise me but it didnt delight me either if somebody was willing to bum down a monastery die added burden of sin that would ac crue from going after an epa inspector couldnt have been heavy enough to worry him brother vahan said old friend how soon wib you be able to manifest yourself normally on our side once more it shouldnt be much longer holy abbot erasmus said the metaphysicians tell me i could do it now if my familiar haunts were restored as it is im given to understand its a matter of days rather than weeks good the abbot said i shall pray that the time will be soon for purely selfish reasons i find i miss you very much an undead who hadnt fed in a thousand years had infi nitely more blood in him than erasmus ever could so when i saw the scriptorium spirit blush i just chalked it up to virtu ous reality and if we were out of questions we didnt need to be there any more i asked how do we get back to inter rogation room two you must return to awareness of the body you left behind there nigel cholmondeley answered as soon as your hands leave contact with those of die persons to either side of you die circuit will be broken and you and all of us wib return to die mundane world my hands i looked down and of course i couldnt see diem from what my eyes reported i might as well not have had any hands or anydiing else i was just diere virtuous reality is an insidious kind of place it so completely involves all die senses and seems so dioroughly real diat leaving wasnt as easy as cholmondeley made it sound i wondered if early explorers had got stuck in it forever ifdiey had i won dered ifdie d realized it an intense look of concentration came over brodier vahans face presumably he couldnt see his own hands eidier but an instant later i was sitting on a hard chair widi a stifling helmet over my eyes and ears i clawed it off the nimy reality of die interrogation room was a long long way om die garden where id been a moment before harry turtledove everyone else was taldng off the masks too now that we were back in the constabulary station nigel cholmondeley was horsefaced again madame ruth fat as any two people you want to name and legate kawaguchi short and skinny and tiredlooking i suppose i looked the way i always do too on the table in front of kawaguchi along with the ciga rette bums and coffee rings lay a note tablet full of scribbles i didnt remember its being there when we sat down i didnt think he could have brought it back from virtuous reality but then i saw right in the middle of the table a bright green feather kawaguchi spotted it at the same time i did he grabbed it and stuck it in a little transparent pouch made of spirit gum to keep it from being magically influenced remarkable nigel cholmondeley said one seldom sees artifacts returning with participants in a virtuous reality experience officially this is not and cannot be evidence kawaguchi said its trail of provenance is severely tainted any judge to whom it was presented would throw it out of court and very likely the case with it unofficially i shall convey it to the lab and find out what our forensics people make of it let me know please i said if id snatched it first id have taken it straight to michael manstein assuming of course that kawaguchi and half a dozen big constables with clubs hadnt started working out on me to make me give it back since they might have done just that constables being demons for evidence maybe it was for the best kawaguchi got it instead of me brother vahan dipped his head to madame ruth and then to cholmondeley let me apologize to both of you for my previous doubts as to the nature of virtuous reality he said he was as usual nothing if not gracious i can see that it will become a valuable tool in thaumaturgic research thanks right back atcha for thinkin fast and breakin the circle madame ruth sounded like herself again too too bad that can be the tricky part gettin back here where we belong nigel cholmondeley put it more piously mankind was ever reluctant to leave the garden case of the toxic spell dump so i thought the abbot agreed but then i remem bered i had no true right there burdened as i was by the weight of original sin after that recalling my body to action in this actual world was easier the channeler and the medium looked at each other lets talk about that some more brother vahan if you dont mind cholmondeley said the extraction technique you describe might well be incorporated into one of the helmets ritual subroutines if we are able to isolate the symbolic essence of your thought sequence it could make you a nice piece of change and us too madame ruth said like you said virtuous reality is the coming thing and if you was to get a piece of it wealth means nothing to me brother vahan said ive heard a lot of people say that he was one of the handful who made me believe it as may be nigel cholmondeley said which meant he had his doubts too he also had a hook no matter how fru gal you personally may be have you not got a monastery to rebuild brother vahan stared at him i watched the hook snag the fish the abbot said let us discuss it then for the greater glory of god lets eat somethin while we talk madame ruth said which struck me as more honest than lets do lunch and most of the other ways people try to combine business and food despite my sausage i was hungry too but not as hungry as i thought id be when i asked my watch what time it was i found out to my amazement that id been in the world of virtuous reality for only about five minutes it had seemed like a couple of hours while i was there oneiromancers say dreams are like that a lot of things going on but compressed very tightly in terms of time judy keeps up on the ins and outs of theoretical thaumaturgy better than i do i made a note to ask her how virtuous reality simulated the dream effect i didnt have lunch with brother vahan and the medium and channeler enough things were going on at the office that i wanted to put in as much time as i could there trying to claw my way through the piles of junk on my desk i harry turtledove wouldnt starve before dinner so i went south through the pass into westwood a little faster than a constable armed with a tracking demon would have approved of fortunately i didnt spot any blackandwhite carpets all the way back down st james freeway after a good trip on the freeway i got stuck in regular fly way traffic on the way back to the confederal building i peered around the carpets ahead of me trying to figure out what had gone wrong this time the fellow on the rug next to me leaned over and called theres a demon stration up there at the comer up there at the comer of course was where i was trying to go i growled so what if theres a demonstration theres a demonstration at that comer about three days a week then what hed said really sank in a demon stration i didnt want to believe id heard that but he nodded i wondered if i ought to turn my carpet around and get out of there as fast as the sylphs would take me no wonder there was a traffic jam if demons were out protesting confederal policy i hoped the building would survive thered be swat teams and god only knows what all else up there trying to keep the irate powers from turn ing the place into an inferno my sense of duty got the better of my sense of self preservation i kept going toward the confederal building it took a while for me to inch close enough to find out what was going on id been wrong in my first guess the powers at the demon stration werent apt to turn violent and they didnt need constabulary thauma turges to hold them at bay but as soon as i saw them i understood why they stopped traffic you see they were all succubi actually thats not quite true some of them were incubi and some of them well im not quite certain whose fancy some of them catered to but whosever it was im sure they met it as for me i barely noticed those others i was busy watching the succubi i couldnt help myself some of the pictures up on losefs wall were pretty spectacular but case of the toxic spell dump pictures dont begin to convey the essence of what succubi are all about when you see them in the quasiflesh you cant help but think theyre the creatures men were really designed to mate with they make women look like clumsy makeshifts phyllis kaminsky bless her heart was down there arguing with some of them trying to convince hem to give up and go away phyllis is a nicelooking gal several years younger than i am and in better shape too the company she was keeping made her seem a poorly jointed wooden puppet turned out on a lathe by somebody who didnt know how to run a lathe very well one litde devil with a blue dress on happened to catch my eye the promise on her face the way she ran an impossibly moist tongue over unbelievably sweet unbelievably red lips the sinuousness and you can turn that into a pun or not just as you please it works either way of her hip action put em all together and ifs a minor miracle i didnt run into the carpet in front of me one of the reasons i didnt was that the gal flying that car pet wasnt exactly where she was supposed to be either instead of keeping her eye on the carpet in front of her shed been gaping at an incubus who was taller darker and hand somer than he had any business being when you think about it you shouldnt be surprised our sexual demons are so strong theyve been evolving right along with us for as long as weve been human proof of which is how strongly they manifest themselves on this side theyre used to coming across theyve been doing it for mil lions of years you have a dirty mind do you know that filtering out all the double entendres that come naturally you see there you go again when discussing succubi is more trouble than its worth unlike the medvamp protesters the succubi and incubi didnt cany signs or chant slogans they just paraded they were their own best message by then id got dose enough to hear phyllis as wed as see her she was saying but the existence you lead degrades harry turtledove both you and mankind dont you see that sexual exploitation is wrong and damaging to the soul if this were a muslim country wed be honored not hunted a succubus retorted though irate herself she made phyuis sound shrid and screechy by comparison her voice brought to the ear the taste of erse creme liqueur she went on we have no souls to worry about we exist for pleasure and since you humans endlessly prate about free will surely youll admit you can choose us or avoid us as you see fit phyuis had been over that ground before she said tart of your attraction comes from the other side so it distorts free will besides humans of unsavory sorts carry on their sordid affairs in areas you frequent because they know theyll find a lot of customers there you dont just haunt neighbor hoods you blight them the succubus shrug was magnificent this is your prob lem not ours we get we want from humans they get what they want from us we find it an equitable arrangement as i finally flew into the parking lot phyllis lost her tem per and started shouting at the succubus its always a mistake to let powers even minor ones get your goat they have more patience than people anyhow what with their far longer terms of being they can afford it besides here i feared phyuis was fighting a losing game the succubus knowledge of biology was empirical and extremely specialized but she had a point her kind and mankind were essentiauy symbiotes and nobody was likely to make either turn loose of the other if that hadnt hap pened all through recorded history it wasnt likely to start in modem angels city but phyllis had a point too because the people in our society who go to succubi and incubi are generauy out for a cheap thrill the re often the people who go after other thrills find a neighborhood with succubi on the streetoor ners and youh generally find its not the kind of place where youd want to bring up your lads if you had a choice keep ing sexual demons of any flavor off the streets makes pretty fair sense to me case of the toxic spell dump i parked my carpet got off and went over to see if phyllis wanted a hand from me as i was walking up to her that suc cubus in blue gave me the eye again my breath went short i couldnt help ifc succubi have been perfecting the art of se duction probably since the days of the manapes natural selection works on the other side no less than on this one powers that arent adored perish and others take their place if my reaction meant anything that particular succubus would stay around forever phyllis saw me not quite slavering and made an exasper ated noise i suppose i cant blame hen i must have seemed more like part of the problem than part of the solution she said what do you plan on doing dave will you whip out your little tin badge and run them all in you dont want to get into a war of sarcasm with phyllis or at least i dont ive been scorched often enough to keep that in mind at all times so please believe me i was about to answer with something mild and soothing but before i could the succubus in blue said im sure hed rather whip out something else instead dear just lis tening to her was enough to set my heart racing like a couple of laps around the track but when she licked her lips again i started sweating so hard i did the only thing i could short of whipping out something else i mean i fled phyllis lost it again i cant say i blame her here she was watching one of her own people turned into a bowl of quivering gelatin i was definitely quivering but at least part of me was a lot stiffer than gelatin by one of the sexy little demons she was trying to control she started screaming at the succubus the succubus screamed right back with invective from just about every language since primeval indoeuropean shed had a lot of satisfied customers all right since i obviously wasnt going to be of any use at the demon stration i went upstairs to work on other tilings rose had left a message on my desk professor blank of ucac had called while i was out scratching my head i took the message up to her pro fessor blank i said pointing wouldnt he leave his name harry turtledove now rose looked puzzled i think he said his first name was harvey there i was looking and feeling like an idiot twice in the space of ten minutes harvey blank was chair of the goetic sciences department at ucac he was one of the first peo ple id phoned about investigating whether the chumash powers were still around i slunk back to my desk and returned his call the telephone imps reproduced his voice even more blurrfly than is their habit he must have been eating some thing when he answered after a sentence or two he spoke more clearly hello inspector fisher thanks for returning my call i wanted to get back to you about some preliminary results of the extinction investigation go ahead i said grabbing for a pencil and a scrap of parchment what have you learned not as much as id like he answered yes he was a pro fessor the experiments i have conducted however do indicate that the powers formerly venerated by the chu mash indians are not currently manifesting themselves in the barony of angels theyre extinct you mean i had curiously mixed feelings most of me was sony as im always sony well almost always id make an exception for huitzflopochtii to see the other side diminished but that nasty lazy piece everyone has lurking inside the one christians identify with original sin let out a cheer because i wouldnt have to work as hard on the leprechauns if the chumash powers were gone for good i didnt quite say that professor blank said thats what it sounded like to me i told him it was the first conclusion i drew from the thaumaturgic regression analysis he admitted a more thorough evalu ation of the data however leads to a different interpretation it seems more likely that the powers in question have not so much vanished as withdrawn from any contact with this side the withdrawal appears volitional are you sure i said ive never heard of anything like that the general rule is that powers will keep a toehold on case of the toxic spell dump this side if they possibly can the more active they are the more they show themselves in the world the better chance they have of attracting and keeping worshipers to give them the veneration they need professor blank said no im not sure the void in the thecological contours of the barony is certainly there it is however if you will permit me to employ metaphorical lan guage more as if the powers made the hole and pufled it in after themselves than as if they simply disappeared from spiritual starvation they are gone though theyre gone he agreed that much is indisputable i have been unable to contact or detect them in any way either by recreating the old chumash rituals or through modem scientific sorcery but they might come back if the situation is as i envision in the highestprobability scenario that possibility remains open yes if on the other hand this is merely an unusually sudden extinction as remains possible they are indeed gone for good can you find out which more precisely the lazy part of me was still hoping to get away with running only one set of projections for the thecological impact of leprechauns on the barony of angels if i had to run two all right but ifl had to run two and then didnt know which one to we nightmares spring from such things so do blighted careers im working on that now professor blank said by the way he said it he hadnt the faintest idea whether what he was working on would work if you know what i mean let me ask you something else i said suppose the chumash powers have withdrawn voluntarily in their terms suppose the great eagle whose wings support the upper world has flown away is it goetically even possible for them to reverse the process i dont know just as i dont know why theyve with drawn blank answered my research team is still working on that too were exploring various possibilities there such as i prompted speculation ranges from harry turtledove withdrawal to maintain some level of survival the other sides equivalent of fungi forming spores when the environ ment grows too hostile for normal growth to an active protest against the thecological changes here over the past two centuries when i heard that i wanted to bang my head on the desk protests about environmental issues are hard enough to deal with when they come from this side what was going on down on the sidewalk showed how much more complicated they could get when powers started playing what had at first been a human game absurdly i wondered whether the chumash first people and sky coyote had gotten the idea from the parading succubi after a moment i realized that was impossible the chumash powers had disappeared before the sexual demons went on the march hunger strike i murmured as much to myself as to professor blank i pray your pardon he said maybe the powers are starving themselves of recognition to force us to notice them and give them the veneration they require thank you inspector fisher that will go onto the list and let me thank you again for involving me and my gradu ate students i presume that was what hed meant when he talkedabout his research team before in this project i am confident we shall eventually leam a great deal from it i didnt like the sound of that eventually when do you hope to have some results i can use to help plan policy pro fessor i think i ought to remind you that this isnt just a research project but one where the answers will be put to practical use i understand that of course he said a little sulkily he might have understood it but he didnt like it one bit a pro fessor indeed i thought he went on we shall endeavor to be as expeditious as possible provided that we remain con sistent with appropriate experimental protocols thats fine sir but i think i ought to warn you that if i dont have harder data than youve given by hmm three case of the toxic spell dump weeks from today i cant guarantee that your report will become part of the decisionmaking process was i playing fair of course not not even slightly pro fessors always claim they go into the university or take holy orders or whatever so they can devote their full attention to whatever the re interested in roman epigraphy or beekeeping or the thaumaturgical arts of a vanished indian tribe sometimes they even mean it but a lot more often ive found that professors who see a chance to influence events outside academe will leap at it in spite of their alleged lack of interest truth to tell i dont know if a savant of roman epigraphy ever got that kind of chance at least since the days when the empire was a going concern but my guess is that hed grab it too and so now professor blank said three weeks eh even with two phone imps between his mouth and my ear he sounded distinctly unhappy another phone pause fol lowed i understood the reason for this one he was giving me a chance to say id made a mistake and the real deadline was three months or three years away i didnt say any such thing blank sighed very well inspector fisher i will attempt to meet the challenging timeframe you have out lined god give you good day sir the same to you professor and im grateful for your help i look forward to seeing your detailed report it will be most valuable both to me and to the environmental perfection agency as a whole as long as he was going to do what i wanted i had no problem with letting him down easy it worked too he seemed a lot happier by the time he got off the phone i spent the next several minutes making notes on the con versation both as an aidememoire for me and to let me have something to show bea so shed know i really and truly was working on all the cases that crowded my desk in an ideal world i wouldnt have had to waste my time with worries like that but no one has ever claimed plato would recognize the confederal bureaucracy as an ideal world i asked my watch what time it was found out it was almost half past four a busy day i was getting tired of not harry turtledove having the chance to get up to bakhtiars precision burins but i had made one trip to st ferdinands valley maybe tomorrow i told myself i wrote a note reminding me to call tony sudalds tomorrow too the investigation had gone so many different ways lately that i hadnt done much with the devonshire dump itself in quite a while sudalds probably figured id fallen off the edge of the world not that hed miss me if i did instead of finding something constructive to do with the last half hour of my work day i looked out the window to see if the succubi were still marching down below they were and traffic in the building rush hour on wilshire boulevard always heavy was becoming downright elephantine maybe i could duck south down side flyways to st monicas boule vard and get on the freeway there it was a good plan it should have worked too veteran was crowded heading north because people couldnt turn onto wilshire from it but southbound traffic didnt look too bad i felt pretty smug sliding down to the parking lot this once i figured i had a fighting chance of beating the system thaumaturgy hasnt found them yet but there must be gremlins who sit around listening for thoughts like that i was just strapping on my safety belt when a priest happened to fly down veteran in an instant all the succubi who had been on wilshire started running after his carpet shaking every thing they had and calling out blandishments that made my ears turn red and they werent even directed at me succubi of course delight in tormenting priests thats been obvious ever since christianity began and priests being mortal have been known to yield to temptation some of the temptation here was pretty tempting too a normal rule in westwood is that you cant find a parking space to save your soul the priest though must have had the power of the lord behind him because he managed to slide his carpet into one the succubi squealed with delight and jounced after him sure theyd found another sinner in clerical collar case of the toxic spell dump they got a rude surprise the priest hadnt stopped to dally with them hed stopped to give them a load of fire and brimstone to take the place of the sweet scents they were wearing bitch wolves was the nicest thing he called them and went on to things like haughty vainglorious lecherous betrayers ready for every wickedness and fickle in love which when applied to a succubus is about like calling the ocean damp he roasted them on both sides meanwhile though half the males on wilshire tried to turn onto veteran so they could keep ogling the succubi which meant the traf fic jam spread with them at first the succubi didnt believe the priest was serious they had a thorough understanding of the way people work and knew too many folks like to condemn in public what they do in private so they kept on pressing themselves against the priest rubbing their hands over him kissing his cheek and his ear and the bare circle of his tonsure paying no heed to his outraged bellows then he pulled out an ampule of holy water the suo cubis squeals turned to screams they ran youll pardon the expression like hell and the priest his virtue intact even if his clothes were mussed got back onto his carpet and flew away he flew away slowly by then that was the only way it was possible to fly on veteran everyone else flew slowly too including me i shouldnt have been thinking such uncharita ble thoughts abut a man of the cloth especially one who had just proved his faith against a challenge to which many would have succumbed but i was if hed flown by five minutes later id have had an easy trip to the freeway getting snarled in traffic instead would have tried the patience of a saint i made it home much later than id intended and in a much fouler mood these things happen after a bottle of ale and a steak my attitude improved a good deal i know what would improve it more too i called judy im so jealous im going to hit you the next time i see you she said when i told her id been involved in using vir tuous reality to contact erasmus we were just talking about case of the toxic spell dump ak x that at the office today the consensus in the business is that its the biggest advance in sorcerous technology since ecto plasmic cloning i didnt think it was that important i said look at the ways having large numbers of identical microimps has changed our lives spellcheckers telephones ethemet sets all sorts of things our grandparents couldnt have imagined thinking of that much change happening again and prob ably happening faster because it would be allied to the developments that are already in place made my head spin but judy said oh it is david the world will be a differ ent place twenty years from now because web have figured out all the things we can do in virtuous reality think about it whats the biggest problem in sorcerous applications today ask me a hard one i answered to accomplish every thing people want to do these days spells keep getting more and more complex and errors creep in some of the errors are pretty ghastly too like the one at the union kobold works in india a few years back where a rakshawas mistak enly ordered to turn out wood alcohol instead of the more friendly sort hundreds died from drinking it and a couple of thousand more were permanently blinded all from one small goof in translating a spell from latin into sanskrit so the hindu demon could understand it youre right of course judy said which took my mind off the contemplation of disaster just as web too she went on but think what wib happen when any old mage can go into virtuous reality to develop his sorcerous subroutines because of the nature of that space the number of errors should drop way down ideally it should fall to zero but i think the fallibility principles will keep that from happening still i hadnt thought of it in those terms i admitted it just seemed a handy way to reach a spirit whod been too badly damaged to manifest himself in this rough rugged world i thought about some of the things the wizards had done to poor erasmus judy didnt need to know about those she said im just glad ill have my masters and be out of the copyediting and proofreading end of the business soon mark my words the accuracy breakthrough that wib come with virtuous reality is going to throw a lot of sharp people onto the streets change has a way of doing that the more efficient the spells get the more they do and the less anybody needs ac tual people i said one of the reasons the general movers plant in van nuys is going under is that the japanese have figured out a way to power the looms that make their flying carpets by kamkazes divine winds that does look to be the way its going she said but what do we do with all the people who lose jobs eventually nobody will need people for anything and then where will we be the two answers that occur to me are bored and broke i answered but those are for people in general people in particular us i mean will be married we may end up broke but i dont think well be bored no not bored she agreed especially not with children in the house uhhuh i said i know children are usually one of the things marriage is about i even looked forward in an abstract sort of way to being a father but it didnt seem real to me i had trouble imagining myself giving a baby a bath or helping a little girl with her subtraction problems then i thought about the corderos they were nice lads whod had every reason to expect a nice normal baby instead they got jesus bom without a soul how were they handling it how could i handle something like that if it happened to me the very idea was nearly enough to put me off parenthood for good you stib there judy asked when i didnt say anything for a while relax its not as if youre going to have to start changing diapers tomorrow the woman can read me like one of the grimoires she proofs i suspect that like them ib end up better for the editing too just to show her i had other things on my mind besides immediately turning into a daddy i said something else harry turtledove interesting happened today or at least i thought it was i told her about the demon stration outside the confederal building id bet you thought it was interesting she said darldy women take a particular tone when they talk about attractive competition that bothers them they take a different but not very different tone when they talk about attractive competition that amuses them over the phone i had a tough time telling which one judy was using she went on see anything you liked in particular well the image of the succubus in blue leaped into my mind as fully threedimensional as the little demon had been herself as a matter of fact yes i did my best to sound sheepish but i didnt know how good my best was judy left me hanging for a couple of seconds before she started to laugh good she said between chuckles if youd told me anything else id have figured you were lying succubi are made to be succulent after all i wish id been there i could have leered at some of the incubi watching is fun though i think men may be more apt to enjoy it than women maybe i said it didnt seem to matter much to the traffic though everybody was staring men and women both oh god i hadnt even thought about that it must have been awful commuting every day from long beach up into east ac judy knows all about traffic tangles and loves them as much as anyone else who has to get on the freeway to go to work it was worse than that she laughed again when i told her how the strongminded priest had foiled my effort to escape down veteran thinking back on it i decided it was funny too it certainly hadnt felt funny why i was sitting on my carpet twiddling my thumbs for an extra twenty minutes so how was your day i asked certainly not as interesting as yours she answered very much the usual looking at sheets of parchment and making little marks on them in red it keeps me out of the barons paupers home but past that it doesnt have a whole case of the toxic spell dump lot to recommend it i cant wait to finish my masters so somebody will hire me to work on the theoretical side of sorcery then youll be working in virtuous reality all the time if it turns out to be as important as you think it wffl i said it will and i will then ill come home and we can be less than virtuous together judy hesitated just a beat but well be married so itll be virtuous after all hmm im not sure i like that i think itll be fine any which way i said and speak ing indirectly of such things do you want to have dinner with me tomorrow night indirectly indeed she said sure id love to shall we go to that hanese place near your flat again sounds good to me you want to meet here after we get off work ah right judy said itll be good to see you i love you love you too hon see you tomorrow bye thinking of seeing judy kept me going through a mis erable tuesday at the office i did get some of the small stuff done lord the things that show up on an epa mans desk sometimes i got a letter from a woman up in the high desert asking it the ashes of a coyotes flesh had the same antiasthmatic effect as those of a foxs flesh when drunk in wine and if so whether she could set traps for the ones that kept trying to catch her cats just answering that one took a couple of hours of research and a phone call to the chief huntsman of the barony of angels in case youre interested the answers are yes and she had to buy a twentycrown license first respectively the environmental study on importing leprechauns though took a large step backwards i got a very fancy looking legal brief from an outfit that called itself save our basin which opposed allowing the little people to establish themselves here sob put forward the fear that once we had leprechauns here all the sidhe would hence forth pack up and move to angels city im condensing but thats what the gist of it was harry turtledove now on first glance this stuck me as one of the more idiotic environmental concerns id seen lately the climate here both literal and theological isnt congenial to pow ers from cool moist eire but the save our basin folks had so many citations in their brief from the evocatio of juno out of veil and into rome to the establishment of the virgin at guadalupe in what had been a purely azte can thecology that i couldnt dismiss it out of hand it would have to be countered which meant more research more projections and more delay i wondered how long leprechauns could stay in hiberniation i hoped it was a long time i looked at the names on the letterhead of the save our basin parchment i didnt recognize any of them but somebody in that organization was one clever lawyer as far as i could see none of the citations in the brief was precisely analogous to what would happen if we imported leprechauns into angels city but they were all close enough to being analogous that i and again by analogy our legal staff couldnt afford to ignore them wed have to examine every one of those instances demonstrate that it was irrelevant and withstand challenges from save our basin trying to establish that the instances werent irrele vant at all in a word a mess i figured the best way was to taclde their citations chronologically so i started researching the roman sack of veil i found out in a hurry that all the accounts of the sack are legendary some more so than oth ers legends are trickier to deal with than myths mythical material definitely has theological overtones you know what the thaumaturgic content is but in a legend you cant tell whats from this side and what from the other a lawyers paradise in other words im sure save our basin did it on purpose too not for the first time lately i had the feeling i was wading deeper into quicksand when quitting time finally rolled around i breathed a heartfelt thank god my spirits improved considerably as i left behind the spirits id been wrestling with at work and case of the toxic spell dump k y lookms folwarct to dinner with ffaa rert ofthe being e more enjoy on my way home someone tried to kill me vii everything was fine tib i got off the freeway at the second traffic in fact had been a little lighter than usual though on st james freeway at rush hour a little light than usual isnt the same as light or even close to it still i was feeling pretty good about the world as i headed east up the second toward my flat i had to wait for cross traffic at the comer of the second and anglewood boulevard a small church was being moved up anglewood on top of a couple of extraheavyduty car pets when at last it cleared the intersection i tried to start across fast but couldnt because the little old lady on the car pet in front of me didnt that probably saved my life though i sent foul thoughts her way at the time a carpet had been idling in the parking lot of the filed harry turtledove chicken place on the far side of anglewood id noticed it and wondered what the two guys on it were thinking about most likely nothing was my disparagmg opinion if theyd had any brains they would have taken advantage of the hole in traffic the traveling church made and headed up the sec ond themselves they got moving fast enough after i went by too fast in fact if a blackandwhite carpet had been anywhere nearby theyd have picked up a ticket just like that i saw in my rear view mirror that they didnt seem to like the way i was flying either they zoomed up above me to pass that would have earned them another ticket from any constable who saw them i thought about signifying my opinion of the way they flew with an ancient fertility gesture but i decided not to as ive mentioned hawthorne is a tough town and people have been known to get shot or have other unpleasant things happen to them on the flyways of angels city so i just did my best to pretend the louts didnt exist as they went up and over me as they did though one of them leaned out past the fringe of his carpet and dropped something down onto mine they sped away and my carpet didnt want to fly any more tore i had time for one startled squawk and the first two words of the shnw before the carpet suddenly just a rug hit the ground with a thump that made me bite my tongue and left my backside bruised for the next two weeks if i hadnt been wearing my safety belt if the carpet hadnt rolled up around me when i hit or if id been going faster i dont care to think what might have happened as things were i wasnt badly hurt but i had that weird sensation you get after an accident i was pretty shaky but i had almost total perception and recall of everything going on around me other carpets kept flying by a few feet overhead the people on them intent on their own business and not caring at all about somebody whod just had his carpet fail him but why had it failed i couldnt figure that out did it case of the toxic spell dump have something to do with whatever the punk had dropped on my carpet i looked around for that trying to find out what it was i didnt see anything on the carpet itself but something was stirring out on the weedcovered dirt just beyond the fringe i bent my head closer the earth itself seemed to be writhing for a second or two i didnt understand what i was looking at then i did and ice ran through me it was a tiny earth elemental busfly digging itself back into its proper home fire and water are the opposing elements we most com monly notice but earth and air are opposites too matt arnold had talked about sylphesteem and sylphdiscipline but if those two guys had tossed an earth elemental down onto my carpet that was nothing short of sylphabuse the elemental had gone now though back to its own proper home i tried the starting spell my carpet lifted off the ground as smoothly as if nothing had ever been wrong with it very carefully looking every which way as i went and wishing for eyes in the back of my head i flew on home all the way there i tried to make some sense out of what had happened the way theologians wrestle with gods will was it just a couple of hooligans out to have some sport with whoever drew the short straw thafs the sort of random vio lence that gives angels city flyways a bad name but this time i wished i could believe it i couldnt though those two guys on that rug had been waiting for me in particular id noticed them sitting a few feet off the ground in the parking lot while the church slowly flew by on angle wood boulevard if theyd wanted to head up the second theyd had all the time they needed to do it theyd just waited but why again i didnt have much trouble coming up with an answer it had to have something to do with die case of the toxic spell dump i did my best to remember what the wo punks had looked like all i could come up with was swarthy and darkhaired they might have been persians or aztedans they might have been hired muscle too israel ites druzes indians from the confederation or from india harry turtledove even hanese or japanese i hadnt got a real good look at then and an awful lot of people in angels city match up to the description swarthy and darkhaired i came to that dispirited conclusion about the time i set my carpet down in its parking space back at my block of flats somebody was going downstairs from his carpet as i was coming up from mine he gave me an odd look as we passed on the stairs but i didnt think anything of it past wondering what was haunting him that afternoon then i turned the knob to my own flat judy sat curled up on the couch in the front room reading a book on the gamda bird id picked up a few days before and hadnt got around to putting on a shelf yet what started out as her smile of welcome turned into something else when her mouth sagged open in surprise good god david what happened to you a lot had happened to me but i asked foolishly what do you mean what happened she sprang to her feet grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the bathroom mirror as if i wasnt to be trusted to do anything that required rational thought on my own look at yourself she commanded i mentally apologized to the fellow whod stared at me while i was coming up to my flat i looked like someone whod been frenchkissed by a vampire streaks of blood ran from the comers of my mouth and had dripped down onto my shirt before i wore it again id have to go visit carlotta or somebody else with a vampster all my clothes were disheveled as if id been through a carpet crash in them funny how that works i thought vaguely what happened judy said again so i told her in as much detail as i remembered pieces seemed blank while others that happened only moments later were there in incredible perfection i could have described exactly how every tiny dod of dirt wiggled and wavered as the earth elemental pushed its was through them after it rolled off my carpet i started to until judys face told me that wasnt something she needed to hear case of the toxic spell dump you could have been killed she said when i was through that was the general idea i said if i hadnt been wear ing my safety belt or even if id been going faster when they dropped the elemental on me i didnt care to think about that much less talk about it i turned on the cold water splashed it onto my face that and then burying my head in a towel to dry off gave me an excuse not to talk for a couple of minutes then i tried to unbutton my shirt that was when i discovered how bad my hands were shaking i had a dreadful time making my fingers hold onto the smooth little buttons after watching me struggle with the first two judy took over as in everything she did she was quick and deft and capable the feel of her fingers fluttering against my chest inflamed me as if shed turned into a succubus ive heard that living through a battle makes you homy i didnt know about that not firsthand i hadnt been in a fight let alone a battle since i got out of primary school but by the time judy got to the last button i couldnt wait any more i grabbed her and kissed her not quite as consumingly as td had in mind because my tongue was still sore well she said when she came up for air before she could say anything else i kissed her again well she repeated a minute or so later and his time she managed to go on ifs a good thing i drank the cup of roots when i got here instead of waiting till after dinner it turned out to be a very good thing for the next half hour or so i forgot all about what had happened on the second the only problem with making love to put aside your problems is that theyre still there when its over sitting up on the bed afterwards i said youd better be careful too honey youve gotten yourself involved in this case if they come after me whoever they are theyre liable to come after you too thafs non but it wasnt nonsense and judy must have known it because she didnt finish the sentence she sat up beside me her nod made her jiggle most pleasantly harry turtkdooe but her voice was serious as she replied what have we gotten ourselves into here i thought about charlie kelly and henry legion i dont know i said grimly but im going to find out dinner at the hanese place was good in fact dinner was probably wonderful but we were both too distracted to enjoy it as much as we should have and not meaning to be crude my rear end hurt and when we flew to the restaurant and then back again i kept looking over my shoulder won dering who was behind us and why i almost jumped out of my sidn when a carpet zipped by closer than it should have but it was just a couple of teenage lads with more machismo than brains when we got back to my flat safe sound and overfed judy said i want you to do something for me like some people you may know judy has a serious voice she was using it now what is iti asked she said before we went out you said i should be care ful from now on well you should too i want you to start doing what they do in the thrillers leave for work a few min utes early one day then a few minutes late the next dont get onto the freeway at the second every morning or off it there every night the same for wilshire at the other end of your commute dont make yourself an easier target i mean i started to laugh to tell her that was all silly stuff but it didnt seem silly not after those guys had tried to do me in okay i said and found myself nodding you do the same i will she promised i wondered if we ought to stop seeing each other for a while if shed said she wanted to do that i wouldnt have let out a peep but i didnt suggest it myself maybe that was selfish of me in fact im sure it was a little but the main reason i didnt was that i was pretty sure she was in too deep to turn invisible so easily do you want to stay the night or do you think youd be safer going home now i asked her td intended to stay she said i stuck a change of case of the toxic spell dump clothes in your closet she did some veiy visible thinking if the re interested in me whoever they are they have to know where i live they could be waiting for me there as well as here ill stay she made a face oh i dont like this having to think about everything before you do it is it safe is it risky i dont like it at all me neither i said but im glad youre staying i wasnt what youd call keen on being here by myself i think id probabfy wake up every time a cat screeched or a dog barked was that selfish well yes probably it was also very true i did something else then i went into the hall closet took out my blasting rod and put it under the bed where i could get at it in a huny judy watched without saying a word but nodded soberly when i was done judy and i woke up once in the middle of the night with a horrible start when the sylphs in somebodys carpet started screaming because the antitheft geas was violated or maybe because they thought it was or maybe for no reason in particular you never can tell with spirits of the air their nocturnal screams are a sound you hear fairly often in angels city or any other goodsized town generally when you least want to at last whoever owned the carpet went down there and made them shut up or maybe the thief flew away on it anyway quiet returned jesus judy said or somebody i agreed we both settled down and tried to go back to sleep it took me a long time and by the way judy was breathing she had as much trouble as i did what had happened to me left both of us jumpy the horological demon in the alarm dock id bought at the swap meet caterwauled to get us up a little past six the noise it made was so awful i figured the siamese exported its land so they wouldnt have to listen to em but at least it had the courtesy not to laugh as judy and i woke up and untangled wed drifted together after we finally drifted back off and were sort of sleeping all over each other shower shave dress breakfast coffee wed spent title night at each others flats often enough that we had harry turtledove a routine for it what wasnt routine was the way i walked judy out to her carpet looked around to make sure nobody was lurking nearby and watched till she was out of sight then i went back to the garage gave my own carpet a care ful onceover before i got onto it and finally headed for work i got there unscathed shut the door to my office and got on the phone the first person i cabed was legate kawaguchi he heard me out then asked this occurred where on the second past anglewood you said thats right this location unfortunately is not within the jurisdiction of the angels city constabulary department inspector fisher i suggest you contact the hawthorne constables and report it to them so i did feeling foolish people always say angeles city or ac but the metropolitan area has lots of other munici palities some large like long beach others minuscule but all of them jealously hanging onto as much autonomy as they can the hawthorne constables took my report and prom ised theyd look into it but i didnt have any great faith in the promise unlike kawaguchi they had no feel for the kind of case in which id gotten myself involved the decurion at the other end of the line asked if my flying could have angered the two men who dropped the earth elemental on my carpet he wanted to keep things inside a simple framework when i finally got off the line there i called charlie kedy in dstc i listened to the imp at the far end squawk it sounded very far away i know youre going to tell me thats nonsense thanks to the ether no two points are more distant than any other two i dont care im teding you what i heard charles keby environmental perfection agency toofc him long enough to answer his bloody telephone i thought good morning charlie i said it was still morning back in dstc with half an hour to spare this is david fisher out in angels city a couple of men tried to kill me last night charlie as far as i can tell the only reason anybody would want to do that is the toxic spell dump case im working case of the toxic spell dump on your toxic spell dump case dont you think its about time you gave me the gospel truth charlie david i there was a long long silence on the other end then a tiny sound and then more silence even though it was reproduced through two phone imps i recognized the sound it was a handset going gently back into its cradle charlie had hung up on me i didnt believe no i didnt want to believe what that meant maybe i told myself charlied had somebody important walk in and hed get back to me later back in dstc there were lots of important people and even more who thought they were i fooled with the parchment on my desk for fifteen minutes then called back the phone squawked even longer than it had before finally i got an answer environmental perfection agency melody trudeau speaking it was a womans voice all right not the gravelly tones that made charlie identifiable in spite of phone imps mistress trudeau this is david fisher from the angels city epa office im looking for charlie kelly i was on the phone with him a little while ago and we got cut off that was more than giving him the benefit of the doubt but i still thought i might as well then melody trudeau said im sorry mr fisher but mr kelly left for the day about fifteen minutes ago would you like me to take down a message for him the kind of message i wanted to give him i couldnt send over the phone i said no thats all right thank you for ask ing and hung up after that i just stared at the phone for about five min utes i needed that long for what had happened to soak in as far as i could tell charlie kelly had told me he didnt give a damn whether i lived or died i know the confederation has been only remotely feudal since not long after we broke away from england but i still thought supervisors owed sub ordinates something in the way of loyalty especially when they were the ones whod got their subordinates into the mess in the first place go ahead call me naive i started to go up front and dump my troubles on bea but harry turtledove stopped about two steps away from my door what was i supposed to tell her im sorry boss but i may not be in tomorrow because someone will have murdered me that didnt do the job and what point complaining to her about charlie kelly she couldnt do anything she was junior to charlie too shed think he was contemptible sure but i already thought he was contemptible i stood there halfway between my desk and the door get ting madder by the second then i turned around and stomped back to my chair if charlie wouldnt listen to me henry legion would seems logical right getting hold of the ci spook wasnt as easy as i thought it was going to be central intelligence wasnt in the dsfcc telephone directory apparently on the assumption that if you couldnt figure out how to reach them you really didnt need to talk to them after id scratched my head for a minute or two i called saul klein he works for the confederal bureau of investi gation his offices are a couple of floors above mine id gotten to know him on the elevator and in the cafeteria hes a good enough fellow when he answered the phone i said saul how are you this is dave fisher down in the epa can i pick your brain for a minute sure dave he answered whats up you know those little musical sprites they import from alemania the mmisingers sure what about em ive heard some people express concern that they dont just leam new songs while theyre here that they might be picking up other things which could be useful for alemanic intelligence as far as i knew there was nothing to that minisingers arent spooks you just take em to your heeler and turn em loose a lot of taverns have them for back ground music things like that but my madness had method to it ingenuous as all get out i asked would that be cbi business saul intelligence by foreign powers no we dont touch that dave you need to talk to central intelligence back at the capital he said case of the toxic spell dump thanks do you happen to have their number sure ive got it right here he said and gave it to me i wrote it down thanked him again and made my phone call sometimes the indirect approach is best once i was actually talking with a real live human being things went better i got connected to henry legion faster than id ever been transferred before good day inspector fisher the ci spook said his phone voice sounded more like his real voice than any natu ral persons i wondered if that was because he like the phone imps was a creature of the other side so they could pick up the essence of his voice as well as what he said while i was wondering he went on i thought i might hear from you again but not so soon as this what is the occasion of the call somebody tried to idll me last night i answered bluntly the only reason i can think of for anybody wanting to do that is the toxic spell dump case i want to get to the bottom of that and youre the only channel i have now no denying henry legion was sharp he pounced on that last word like a lycanthrope leaping onto a roast of beef now he said you previously had another source of infor mation who has become inaccessible to you inaccessible is just the word i know i sounded bitter id thought charlie kelly was a friend oh not a close friend but somebody who wouldnt let me down if things got tough hed shown me what that notion was worth though well my loyalty to him stopped at the point where it was liable to get me killed i told the spook you asked how i got wind of the danger of a third sorcerous war yes across three thousand miles i could visualize his ectoplasmic ears springing to attention wait a minute i said before i teh you i want your promise that youll let me know whats going on everybody keeps saying that the more i know the more dangerous itll be for me i cant think of anything a lot more dangerous than getting killed i can henry legion said maybe he really could maybe harry turtledove he was just trying to scare me but i was past being scared of or by phantoms and didnt answer after a couple of silent seconds the spook took another tack why should you believe any promise i make i am of the other side and have no soul to stake on an oath promise on your pride in your own wits and ill believe you i told him another telephone pause when it was done legion said youre not the least clever mortal with whom i have dealt let it be as you say by my pride in my wits inspector fisher i shall tell you what i know in exchange for your information on condition that the secret go no farther than you uh i said i couldnt think of a condition better calcu lated to make judy want to wring my neck my fiancee is also involved in this case and has been just about from the start she knows about the threat of the third sorcerous war i cant promise not to tell her but she doesnt blab henry legion let out a long sigh sexuality he said as if he were cursing very well inspector fisher i agree to your proposed amendment provided she agrees to tell no one now speak and withhold nothing so i spoke i told him about charlie kelly and about the bird charlie kept being too coy to name and i told him what charlie had said about the risk of war and about how charlie had hung up on me and bugged out of his office ah mr kelly the spook said matters become less murky not to me they dont i told him although of low rank himself charlie was several notches above me but i let that go your mr kelly is well connected politically henry legion said he is the close friend and familiar i use the word almost in the thauma turgical sense of a cabinet subminister whose name i prefer not to divulge but who i think is like to be the source of his ah sensitive information that matter can be and shall be rectified i assure you i didnt care for the way he said rectified i wondered if the anonymous cabinet subminister was about to have the case of the toxic spell dump fear of an angry god put into him or if hed have to suffer what they call an unfortunate accident but that for me was a side issue i said i told you what i know now you keep your end of the bargain at that point much too late i wondered how i was sup posed to make him keep the bargain if he didnt feel like it but he said perhaps this conversation would be better con tinued face to face rather than through the ether you are on the seventh floor of the westwood confederal building is that not correct thats right i agreed hang up the phone then i shall see you shortly i dutifully hung up sure enough a couple of seconds later henry legion materialized in my office or rather the top half of him did the floor cut him off at what would have been his belly button if spooks had belly buttons the sound proofing in the confederal building is pretty good but i heard the woman in the office right below me let out a star ded squeal so i presume henrys legs end popped into being just below her ceiling the spook peered down at himself he looked mistily annoyed then said a threefoot error on a crosscountry journey isnt bad ifs not as if i were material he sounded like someone trying to convince himself and not having much luck he pulled himself up through the floor so his ec toplasmic wingtips rested on the carpet its a good thing hes not material i thought two differ ent sets of matter arent designed to occupy the same space at the same time the likeliest result of that would have been one big bang once he was all in the room with me his dignity recov ered in a hurry he draped himself over a chair gave me a nod and said by my pride in my own wits david fisher i shall tell you what i can ask your questions his wits were still working pretty well i noticed if i didnt come up with the right questions i wouldnt find out what i needed to know well first things first whos trying to loll me henry legions indistinct features distinctly frowned harry turdedove without further information i cannot answer that with any more assurance than you possess yourself i realize it is of the essence to you but i trust you will understand it is not my primary concern yeah i said grudgingly understanding didnt mean i had to like it i tried something else if there is god forbid a third sorcerous war whos going to be in it and whose side will we be on god forbid indeed the spook said as for who would begin the fighting if war came again i cannot say with any certainty the confederations place would depend on the patterns of other belligerents as you may know some of our alliance systems overlap others as a matter of fact i do know that i was getting angry i also know that i gave you straight answers and youre giv ing me the runaround i dont cab that a fair exchange i didnt know what i could do about that unfortunately if henry legion didnt feel like answering questions all he had to do was disappear and ignore my phone cabs from then on out but he didnt disappear he held up a transparent but pla cating hand before he could say anything rose tapped on the door then opened it and stuck her nose into my office im sony dave she said quickly i didnt realize you had someone in here then she got a good look at henry legion her eyes widened as she realized what sort of some one he was but she dosed the door and went away anyhow rose is a wonderful secretary you were saying i prompted the spook so i was henry legion agreed i do apologize for appearing evasive but the matter is more complex than most mortals even those in high places fully grasp the turmoil that has marked this century and that may yet precipitate the third sorcerous war has roots that go back hundreds of years it is an outcome of a fundamental shift in the bal ance of powers that occurred with and as a result of die european expansion which began half a millennium ago i do follow you i said remember where you are this is the epa one of die things im working on that has case of the toxic spell dump nothing to do with the toxic spell dump case is whether the chumash indian powers have gone extinct in the past few years this is a trivial example of the phenomenon to which i refer die spook said towers have been reduced and dis placed and others magnified on a scale unseen since the diminution and neardestruction of the grecoroman pagan deities and the rise of christianity and that impacted only europe north africa and western asia this is worldwide in scope to give you some notion of what i mean consider that sarganatas and nebiros the one brigadiermajor the other fieldmarshal and inspectorgeneral of the judeo christian descending hierarchy have for several centuries made their residence here in the americas i grant diat the re wickeder than huitzilopochdi but are they any nastier i asked the aztecian wargod wasnt evil in and of himself the way die demon princes were but his proper food was blood my stomach twisted when i thought about the flayed human skin in the potion cuauhtemoc hemandez had sold to lupe cordero but henry legion said that is not the point the point is that huitzilopochtii has been displaced and naturally resents it the same is true of most of the indigenous powers of the americas of polynesia of australia the muslim expansion through the southern isles has reduced the range of the hindu powers who still have their enormous indian belief base upon which to draw ukrainian and spainish con quests on the other hand have cut into the sphere where jinni and ghouls and other muslim powers can roam at will and the horror that was alemania two generations ago shows christendom isnt immune to theological disaster either what youre telling me is that the whole world is going to hell i said slowly i wondered whether i was exaggerating for conversational effect or being perfectly literal central intelligence prognostications put the probability of that outcome as less than ten percent in the next decade henry legion said his voice inhumanly calm a year ago however that same probability was assessed at less than harry turtledove three percent whether fully judeochristian or not inspector fisher trouble is brewing beneath the orderly surface of our existence since id had the door closed all morning my office was warm and rather stuffy i shivered even so okay i said theres trouble what does it have to do with the devon shire toxic spell dump as for a precise answer i can only speculate henry legion replied but consider this the spell residues stored at that site are the worst and most potent yet devised if they are lealdng into the wider environment they draw attention to the dump that attention is liable to be extremely unwel come if something undocumented but deadly is being disposed of at the devonshire dump all at once i remembered the nothing id seen walking the path from the dump entrance to tony sudalds office i never had got around to asking him what that was i hadnt called him tuesday either too many other things going on have you any further questions henry legion asked yeah i do i said okay you dont know for sure which powers or humans might touch off the third sorcerous war you must have suspects though isnt that what central intelligence is for to be suspicious as a matter of fact yes the spook answered suspects you say in order of probability they are persia azteda the ukraine and india that didnt help me much some sort of persian connec tion seemed die most likely cause of trouble at the devonshire dump too at least judgtog by what had hap pened to erasmus while i couldnt rule out the aztecans either not with huitzilopochdism on the loose and the trail that had led me to poor soulless jesus cordero for that matter i couldnt rule out the powers of india either which meant loki and the other aerospace firms were still suspects along with the cow erasmus had been tor mented by sorcerous serpents and the garuda bird is a great foe of such complications complications i remembered that other serpent id seen the one in the garden of virtuous case of the toxic spell dump reality who hadnt had to crawl around on his belly if the model for that serpent had behaved himself better the world would be a more peaceful place today i said what youre telling me is that you dont know whos trying to kill me or who wants to start the war but you want to use me to help you find out in essence yes henry legion said keeping you alive while the investigation proceeds would also be desirable to me even more than to you i assured him the situ ation reminded me of an old riddle how do you know when there are pixies around the answer is when you get pix ilated i never had found that riddle very funny it was a lot less so now when it was more like finding out who was trying to idb me by what happened when they did it someone tapped on the door then opened it rose again she said quietly when i saw you hadan important guest david i arranged for my phone imp to cover yours heres a message for you nodding as politely to henry legion as if she couldnt see through him she went back outside again the spook said we here at central intelligence and at other nations equivalent services i assure you are gener ally less than delighted when an amateur like yourself gets stuck between the lines of the cantrip so to speak not only because of the danger to which you are exposed but also on account of your unpredictability which may set off other unpredictable acts at a juncture when unpredictable acts have the potential to bring on what may for all practical pur poses be armageddon if henry legion had been a human being he couldnt possible have said all that on one breath as it was charlie kelly had in essence told me the same thing but charlie had bugged out on me while the ci spook was still on my side i hoped what do you suggest i do next i asked him cany on with your life and work as normally as you can he answered if fate is kind always an interesting ques tion you will eventually be able to work your way out of the center of interest you now occupy and if fate isnt i said harry turtledove a human being even one who worked for central intelli gence probably would have given me a soothing answer back henry legion didnt if fate is unload inspector fisher you will be killed if fate is very unkind the world will go with you as i said before the balance of powers has been upset for a long time megasalamanders may be the least we have to worry about that much pessimism rocked me but a megasalaman der can slag a whole city i felt absurd the second the words were out of my mouth was i bragging of how destructive our ultimate weapons were or complaining they werent destructive enough yes inspector legion but although megasalamanders are of the other side the devastation they create is confined to the material henry legion said implacably further they do not launch themselves but travel when and were ordered by the mages who control them if the powers seek to redress the balance on their own he dematerialized then leaving me an an empty office and cold dread in my middle thats the trouble about argu ing with a spook if he wants it he can have the last word this time though i think he would have had it even if hed stayed around i thought about what hed just said suppose all the pow ers that had seen their domains shrink over the past five hundred years or so got together and struck back at the ones that had dispossessed them a man mad for revenge is liable to take it no matter what ft costs him and those he loves if the powers acted the same way then heaven help the people over a big part of the globe except it would more likely be hell on earth no wonder henry legion couldnt work up much con cern about whether i individually lived or died in a way it didnt seem that important to me any more either but only in a way i stared down at my desk trying to get back from contemplating armageddon to doing my job my eye fell on the note rose had come in to give me the message i saw was from legate kawaguchi it said in its entirety the case of the toxic spell dump feather is from a specimen of pharomachrus mocinno it was written just like that rose had printed the formal name in block capitals so i couldnt possible misread it undoubtedly shed had kawaguchi give it to her letter by letter so she wouldnt get it wrong too rose is a queen among secretaries only one trouble i hadnt the slightest notion what a pharomachms mocinno was i called kawaguchi back but i didnt get him hed gone into the field something horrible and gruesome had just broken the centurion who took my call sounded so harassed that i didnt have the nerve to ask him whether he knew what land of bird kawaguchi had meant i went and checked our own reference library not all environmental issues involve the other side we had books about birds that dwell in the barony of angels fharomachrvs mac bum wasnt one a little information but not much i made a mental note to ask kawaguchi about it the next time i talked with him then went back to work a good rule ive developed and dont follow enough is when in doubt make a list writing things down forces you to think about whafs important to you it works so well its almost magic the first writing i suspect really was magic vaasfc against forgetting it still serves that role if you give it half a chance so i wrote when i was done the top of the list looked like this checking around the devonshire toxic spell dump bakhtiars precision burins the chumash powers importing leprechauns chocolate weasel everything below i figured could wait most of the bottom of the list was daytoday stuff where it didnt really matter whether the day was today tomorrow or next tues day some of the other items like what had caused jesus cordero to be born apsychic were important in and of themselves but were also linked to highpriority items i also noticed i didnt really have five items up at the top i harry turtledove had two getting to bakhtiars precision burins and choco late weasel sprang from trying to get to the bottom of what was going on at the devonshire dump and of course the chumash powers study and the one on leprechauns were almost incestuously intertwined armed with my list i did go up front to see bea i wanted to get her approval on it so i could cany on with a clear con science and without having to worry about unexpected thunderbolts from her rose waved me through into her sanctum for a wonder bea wasnt on the phone and she didnt have anybody in there with her good morning david she said one eyebrow went up i hear youve been spending time with some highpowered company im very impressed i wasnt surprised rose had told her a secretary is sup posed to keep a division head informed about what people are doing and besides even a queen of secretaries is enti tled to a little gossip but if bea knew about henry i could take advantage of it even though i wished id never met the ci spook i said the devonshire dump case seems to be turning into a national security affair thats why ive put it at the top of my todo list i shoved the parchmentacross the desk at her she looked at it she looked at me she shook her head slowly back and forth a couple of times in that churchchoir voice of hers she said david why do i get the feeling the main reason youre showing me this list is to get my approval in advance for what you intend to do anyway with some bosses wideeyed innocence would have been the best approach me i cant wtagfne what youre talking about try that with bea and shed rap your knuckles with a ruler maybe metaphorically maybe not i said youre right but i really think these are the things that need doing id handle as much of the rest of the stuff as i can but im not going to worry if i get behind on it while im settling the big things if id had to id have told her about charlie kelly then that would have shown her i wasnt taking the speh dump case too seriously but she looked at me again nodded as slowly as shed case of the toxic spell dump shaken her head before david part of being a good man ager is giving your people their heads and letting them run with their projects im going to do that with you now but another part of being a good manager is letting people know youre not here to be taken advantage of i understand i said and i did if these cases turned out to be inconsequential or if they were important and i botched them shed rack me for it that was firm but it was fair bea is a good manager even if i do hate staff meetings all right david she said with a faint sigh thank you rose gave me a curious look as i emerged from beas office i flashed a thumbsup then waggled it a little to show i wasnt sure everything would fly on angels wings she made silent clapping motions to congratulate me oh david what was mat bird the constabulary legate called you about she asked as a matter of fact i still dont know myself i said i went to the reference center to look it up but i couldnt fend it there that means its not local whatever it is ill call kawaguchi back this afternoon and find out ill let you know as soon as i do one way to keep a secretary happy is not to hold out on her i went back to my office dug through my notes found the phone number for bakhtiars precision burins and called the way my luck had been running i figured a thun derbolt would probably smite the confederal building just as i made the connection and i was close the phone at the other end had just be gun to squawk when a little earthquake rattled the building i sat there waiting wondering the way you always do whether the littie earthquake would turn into a big one it didnt in a few seconds die rattling stopped along with im sure several million other people i breathed a prayer of thanksgiving the secretary for bakhtiars precision burins and i spent a litde while going did you feel that and i sure did back and forth at each other before i confirmed my appointment and hung up then i got back on the phone this morning id used it as much as bea usually does and called tony sudalds harry turtledove hedo dave he said i was wondering when id hear from you again thought maybe my file fell behind your desk or something he laughed to show i wasnt supposed to take him seriously i laughed too to show i didnt no such luck i told him this is just to let you know that we wib be doing a sorcerous decontamination check of the area around your site as soon as we can get the apparatus together i appreciate the courtesy of the cab inspector he answered slowly i wasnt dave any more i have to tell you though we still deny any contamination youb need a showcause order before you can start anything like that and well fight it i know i said when your legal staff asks you tell them the case is under the jurisdiction of judge ruhollah i spelled it for him since he granted me the original search warrant if the epa couldnt get a showcause order out of maximum ruhollah i figured it was time for us to fold our tents and head off into the desert judge ruhollah sudakis repeated tb pass it along bye i didnt think he knew about ruhobah but the con sortiums lawyers would i moved parchments from one pile to another on my desk called legate kawaguchi again and found out he was still at the crime scene then ate a rubberized hamburger at the cafeteria i washed it down with a cup of hot black mud slid down the parking lot and headed up into st ferdinands valley again normally i wouldnt go up there ten times a year id been doing it so often lately that i was starting to memorize the freeway exits i got off at white oak and flew north toward balditiars precision burins on the way i passed a church dedicated to st andrew actually to san andreas because it was an aztecan neighborhood a line of penitents was filing in i wondered why st andrews feast day isnt until november then i remembered the mornings earthquake no doubt they were calling on the saint to keep more and worse from happening their chants rang so loud and sincere they made case of the toxic spell dump me sure that if another earthquake did strike it wouldnt be san andreas fault i flew into die parking lot behind bakhtiafs precision burins a couple of minutes early the building that housed the outfit was four times die size of slow jinn fizzs fancy establishment on venture boulevard and probably cost about a fourth as much to rent it had the virtue of absolute plainness one more industrial building in an industrial part of town the receptionist who greeted me was about a fourth as decorative as the one at slow jinn fizz too so it goes but she was friendly enough or maybe more than friendly enough oh youre inspector fisher she said when i showed her my epa sigb did the earth move for you too she giggled i didnt know what to make of that if id been unat tached i might have been more interested in finding out as it was i figured the best thing to do was let it alone so i did i said is mr bakhtiar free to see me just a minute ill check she picked up the handset of the phone bakhtiafs precision burins wasnt in the highrent district but it used all the latest sorceware the silencing spell on the phone was so good that i couldnt hear a word the receptionist said till she hung up he says he can give you fortyfive minutes at the most will that be all right thanks it should be fine mistress mendoza i answered reading the name plate on her desk cynthia mendoza call me cyndi she said everybody does here come on with me i have to let you into the back of the shop because of the security system i followed her back down die hall balditiars doorway wasnt hermetically sealed as ive said only really big firms and governments can afford diat much security but he did have an alarmed door if anybody who wasnt audiorized touched die doorknob it would yell bloody murder cyndi mendoza took die knob in her hand and chanted softly from die book of proverbs she criedi at die gates at harry turtledove the entrance of the city at the coming of the doors and then from the song of solomon rose up to open to my beloved i opened to my beloved the knob turned in her hand she waved me through ahead other then murmured something else to the door to propitiate it for having let me through do you know she said as she led me through the burin works to bakhtiars office the same charm that persuades the alarmed door to open peaceably is also used sometimes as a seduction spell is that a fact i said though it didnt surprise me noth ing in the judeochristian tradition blends sensuality and mystic power like the song of solomon she nodded it doesnt get tried as often as it used to though it only works on virgins this brought forth more giggles she couldnt have made it more obvious she was inter ested in me if shed run up a flag a man always finds that flattering but i wasnt interested back i said is that a fact again its one of the few things you can safely say under any circumstances because it doesnt mean a thing well here we are cyndi said stopping in front of a door that had ishaq bakhtiar margrave painted on it in black letters edged with gilt she tapped on the door which mustnt have been alarmed since it didnt scream then headed back toward her own desk im afraid she gave me a dirty look as she went by ishaq bakhtiar opened his own door waved for me to come in he didnt look like a corporate margrave he looked and dressed like a working journeyman wizard by stereotype persians come in two varieties short and round or long and angular ramzan durani of slow jinn fizz had been of the first sort bakhtiar exemplified the second everything about him was vertical lines thin arms and legs his big not quite straight nose and die creases to either side of it the beard worn short on the cheeks and long on the chin that made his face seem even narrower than it was like ramzan durani he wore a white lab robe unlike duranis his didnt give the impression of being something case of the toxic spell dump he put on to impress visitors it wasnt what youd call shabby but it had been washed a good many times and still bore faint stains that looked like old blood and herbal juices when we clasped hands his engulfed mine and im not a small man nor one with short fingers but if he hadnt gone into sorcery he would have made a master harpsichordist those spidery fingers of his seemed to reach halfway up my arm i am pleased to meet you inspector fisher he said with a vanishing trace of persian accent that did more to lend his english dignity than to turn it guttural please take a seat thank you i sat down in the chair to which he waved me it wasnt very comfortable but it was the same as the one behind his desk so i couldnt complain will you take mint tea he asked pointing at a samovar that must have come from a junk shop or perhaps since the day is warm you would rather have an iced sherbet please help yourself to sweetmeats also since he poured tea for himself i had some too it was excellent he might not have cared how things looked but how they performed mattered to him the sweetmeats sent up the ambrosial perfume of almond paste their taste didnt disappoint either he didnt linger over the courtesies nor had i expected him to not when hed blocked out only fortyfive minutes for me as soon as wed both wiped crumbs from our fingers he leaned forward showing he was ready to get down to business i took the hint and said im here mr bakhtiar because youre one of the major dumpers of toxic spell byproducts at the devonshire site and as i said over the phone the dump appears to be leaking his dark brows came down like thunderclouds and so you think it is my byproducts that are getting out you think i am the polluter allah muhammad and hussein be my wit nesses i deny this inspector fisher i dont know whether youre the polluter i said i do know from your manifests that enough sorcerous byproducts come from this business to make me have to look into the possibility harry turtledove get the burinmaker he is always the polluter bakhtiar scowled at me even more blackly than before in superstitious persia i could understand this attitude though i know how foolish it is here in the confederation where reason is supposed to rule my heart breaks to hear it taken over ab inspector bakhtiars precision burins reduces the sorcerous pollution in angels city we do not increase it this i can demonstrate go on sir i thought i knew the argument he was going to use but i might have been wrong i wasnt he said consider inspector if every wizard had to manufacture his own sorcerous tools as was true in the olden days not just burins but also swords staves rods lancets arctraves needles poniards swords and knives with white and black handles because the sorcerers of the barony would be less efficient and more widespread than we are here far more magical contamination would result from their work but that does not happen because most thaumaturges purchase their instruments from me they cause no pollution because they are not doing the work i am and because of it bakhtiars precision burins draws the attention of regulators like yourself ive heard that singlesource argument many times it generally has an element of truth to it doing things in one place often is more efficient and better for the environment than scattering them all over the landscape and bakhtiar was right when he said singlesource providers do stand out because they still pollute and the people who use their serv ices dont but all that doesnt mean singlesource providers cant pollute more than they should i said as much bakhtiar got to his feet come with me inspector you shall see for yourself he took me out onto the production floor it was as ef ficiently busy as most other light industrial outfits ive seen a worker wearing asalamandric gloves lifted a rack of redglowing pieces of steel out of a fire turned and quenched them in a bath from which strongsmelling steam rose that must have been the third heating for the burin case of the toxic spell dump blanks bakhtiar said now they steep in magpies blood and the juice of the herbforoile ergonomically efficient i said the factory hand had been able to transfer them from the flames to the bath with out taking a step as they soaked up the virtues of the blood and the herb he prayed over them and spoke words of power among the names i caught were those of the spirits lumech gadal and mitatron all of whom are potent indeed i asked how do you decontaminate the quenching bath after youve infused the powers into it the usual way with prayer and holy water bakhtiar answered inspector i do not claim these are one hundred ercent efficacious i am aware there is a residue of power t behind this after all is why we dispose of our toxic spell byproducts at the devonshire facility as mandated by the laws of the barony the province and the confederation if leaks have occurred surely that is the responsibility of the dump not of bakhtiars precision burins we have complied with the law in every particular if so you dont have a problem i answered my con cern is that someone has been disposing of byproducts that arent listed on his manifest things vicious enough to break through the protection setup even if in only minuscule amounts and to sorcerously contaminate the surrounding environment this i understand he said nodding as manufacturers of burins and other thaumaturgical tools however we oper ate with a limited range of magicengendering materials as you must know here come with me see if you find one tiny thing in any way out of the ordinary for an establishment such as ours i came he was right i didnt find anything out of the ordinary the knives with the black handles were steeped in cats blood and hemlock and fitted with handles of rams horn interesting that bakhtiar a muslim conformed to common judeochristian usage there im given to under stand the affinity goes back to the shqfar the ramshom trumpet which commemorates the trumpets that toppled jerichos walls harry turtledove another technician was inscribing magical characters onto hazehvood wands and cane staffs the scribing instrument was a burin presumably one of bakhtiars precision burins he also inscribed the seals of the demons klippoth and fri most onto wands and staffs respectively i could feel tihe power in the air around him the sorcerous and the mundane mingled in the produc tion of the silken cloths in which bakhtiars burins and other instruments were wrapped the firm did its own weaving inhouse three persian women in black chadors and veils worked clacking looms turning silk thread into fine shim mering cloth i wondered how long it would be before the automated looms of the japanese made that economically impractical theyd taken much of the flying carpet business from detroit and they were sidllful silkworkers as far as i could see the combination made it only a matter of time bakhtiar said the red silk is for the burins the black fit tingly for the knife with the black handle and the green for the other magical instruments for those others the proper color is less important so long as it be neither black nor brown a calligrapher with a goose quill dipped in pigeons blood wrote mystic characters on a finished silk cloth around him a dozen other goose quills animated by the law of similarity wrote identical characters on other cloths i asked bakhtiar why are you using automatic writing for this process and not that of inscribing the wands and staffs as we have the opportunity we shall inshauah do the latter as well he answered but the silks are merely protec tive vessels for the instruments while the instruments themselves are filled with a thaumaturgic power which as yet overcomes the automating spells but we are working on it as i say in fact i read recently that a sorceware designer up in crystal valley has had a breakthrough along those very lines was he using virtuous reality by any chance i asked as a matter of fact he was bakhtiar sounded surprised up till then his expression had said i was an unmitigated nuisance now my nuisance value was at least mitigated he case of the toxic spell dump said you are better informed on matters sorcerous than i should have expected from a bureaucrat we dont spend all our times shuffling parchments from one pile to the next i said too much of our time yes but not all he stared at me out of black deepset eyes i might even wish you spent more time at your desk inspector provided that time was the period you have instead set aside for har assing legitimate businesses such as mine investigation is not harassment i said and stared right back persians of the lean variety tend to look like prophets about to call down divine wrath on a sinful people which gave bakhtiar what i thought of as an unfair advantage in that land of contest but i held my own and we cant afford to take a spill from this dump lightly in aid of which may i see the decontamination facility you mentioned i shall take you there he said i expected that would be your next request sensibly bakhtiar kept his decontaminators off the main shop floor and in a chamber of their own that both minimized any corruption that might interfere with their work and made sure their procedures wouldnt weaken the sorcery that went into the instruments inspector fisher allow me to present dagoberto velarde and kirk mccudough the decontamination team for bak htiars precision burins bakhtiar said bert kirk this is david fisher of the epa they think were responsible for a leak at the devonshire dump i didnt bother denying that any more id seen i wasnt going to convince bakhtiar and his crew the decontamina tors glared at me velarde was short and copperbrown mccullough tall gaunt and redhaired with the light of religious certainty shining in his hard gray eyes just carry on gentlemen i said pretend im not here by their expressions they wished i wasnt they made an odd team one you wouldnt find everywhere but they worked smoothly together as if theyd been doing it for years they probably had one of the guys from the shop harry turtledove floor no i take it back it was a woman in hard hat overalls and boots wheeled in a vat on a doby she slid it off nod ded to the decontaminators and headed back out bert velarde broke open an ampule of holy water sprin kled it over the vat to neutralize as much of the goetic power in there as it could holy water is efficacious if applied by any believer and while you cant always tell by looking i would have bet two weeks pay he was catholic but prayers by catholic layfolk arent as potent as those from priests velarde didnt pray that was kirk mccul loughs job he had a deep impressive voice and a thick caledonian burr he hardly bothered looking at the book of common prayer he held in his big hands he knew the words by heart that didnt mean he was just reciting by rote though he put his heart into every word kirk is an elder of the church of the covenant bakhtiar told me quietly the diversity of angels city has its advantages til say i agreed ishaq bakhtiar was one sharp operator the distinction between clergy and laity is much less in prot estant churches than in catholicism the prayers of an elder who presumably was among the elect were as likely to be heard as a ministers and bakhtiar could hire two laymen for less than hed have had to pay one who was consecrated like i said a sharp operator he was also sharp enough to say and if you have any doubts whatsoever inspector fisher as the whether the decontaminators are fully employed come back to my office with me now and i will show you complete records of their activity since we moved into this building i had no doubts but i went with him nonetheless he rummaged through his files plopped a handful down in front of me i looked through them they showed me what hed said they would this left me unsurprised how often will the head of a business voluntarily show documents that dont paint him in the best possible tight but if anything was wrong at bakhtiars precision burins you couldnt have proved it by me ah his procedures were what they should have been his decontamination team case of the toxic spell dump might have been unorthodox in the nontheological sense of the word but it was effective anything eke inspector he asked when id worked my way through the last folder rather pointedly he asked his watch what time it was the little horological demons answer showed id already devoured fiftyfive of his precious and irreplaceable minutes where id promised to make do with a mere fortyfive i guess i was supposed to wail and abase myself and swear never to sin in that particular way again living in a large city though has a way of coarsening you when i said tm sorry i took up so much of your time i put just enough bureau cratic indifference into my voice to let him know i wasnt the least bit sorry he glared at me again this time i didnt bother glaring back which only irked him more i got up i think i can find my own way out no you mis he caught himself if he was really rude to me who could guess how much trouble id cause him persians understand about revenge he tried again no inspector you forget the door it is active in both directions so no matter how much he didnt care for me he had to escort me out so i wouldnt alarm his door and in case youre wondering i hadnt forgotten he gave me some insincere parting pleasantries and let me walk up the hall by myself cyndi mendoza hit me with a dazzling smile when i came out to her desk id forgotten about her bakhtiar could have won the exchange if hed called her back to his office to bring me out but that would have cost him an extra couple of minutes of my presence and i suppose he was too effi cient to think of it she said do you remember that opening spell which was no doubt intended to get around to asking if i thought it would work on her i forestalled that though i said tm sorry no i make it a point never to remember anything i walked out while she was still staring when i got back to the confederal building and went up to my office i found on my desk a note from rose in big red harry turdedwe letters david come up to beas office immediately wonder ing what sort of trouble id managed to get into while i was gone i went up to beas office in the anteroom sat rose the real ruler of the domain and a fussylooking litde fellow with a big nose and a loud cravat he was looking through one of roses stationery cata logues which meant he was either madly meticulous or bored stiff the latter if a couple of litde faint spots on his shirt meant anything hello dave rose said to me and then here he is mr epstein the litde man bounced to his feet you are david fisher inspector environmental perfection agency he asked running my name and job title together yes i said who are you samuel epstein subclerk of the courts angels city bar ony of angels from under the stationery catalogue he drew out a piece of parchment so splendid with calligraphy its mostly done by automatic writing these days as with the quills inscribing symbols on the silk instrument covers at bakhtiars but it stffl looks mighty impressive and gaudy with seals i hereby deliver unto your person this summons to appear in the court at the day and hour indited hereon in the matter of the constabulary of angels city vs ctiauhtemoc hemandez he presented it to me with such a gorgeous flourish that i half expected to hear a ruffle of drums i read the parchment it was what epstein said it was ill be there i told him sony to keep you waiting here so long couldnt you just have left this on my desk not in cases involving thaumaturgy in the commission of a firstdegree felony he answered in such cases the chain of transmission of summonses must be as tightly controlled as that concerning the transmission of evidence okay i said shrugging he undoubtedly knew the arcana of his own field but you must spend an awful lot to time just sitting and waiting why dont you bring along something more interesting to read than that i pointed at the catalogue case of the toxic spell dump but he recoiled with as much horror as if id offered him a bacon cheeseburger anticipating idleness would consti tute moral turpitude on my part good day to you sir he edged around me and fled rose and i looked at each other she said if i spent a lot of working time waiting id bring something interesting too that relieved my mind if rose doesnt think something involves moral turpitude you can take it to the bank that it doesnt all the way home i thought about what had gone on at bakhtiais it was of a piece with everything else connected with the devonshire dump case as far as i could tell on a quick visit everything there was on the up and up and the boss loudly denied doing anything that could possibly make toxic spell byproducts get out of the containment area and into the environment somebody was lying but who not knowing was devilishly frustrated i was going to call judy after i finished dinner but she called me first want to do something perverse she asked i know a straight line when im handed one sure i answered do you want to fly up here or shall i go down there besides the very male part of me panted there was always the outside chance that was what she had in mind the snort she gave me said it wasnt and also said shed fed me the line on purpose maybe she wanted to see what id do with it or maybe shed already guessed what id do with it and wanted to see if she was right she said i was thinking more along the lines of a monday night date thafs perverse all right i agreed why monday night because i read in the independent pressscryer that a new numidian restaurant is opening up monday night about six blocks from here feel like coming down and trying it with me numidian eh jews often go to muslimstyle restaurants and the other way round too no need to worry about pork on the menu or back in the kitchen and aside from that i like north african food couscous salata mesh wiya tuna salad with chili pepper eggs tomatoes and harry turtledove peppers dressed with olive oil lemon juice and salt chicken with prunes and honey the lamb soup called harira souiria with onions paprika and saffron my stomach rumbled just thinking about it sounds wonderful only thing is how crowded will it be we can find out of course if you dont want to said it sounded wonderful i really had too so i got points for that what time do you want me down there what time do you want to come listen mistress adier this is your date so you tell me what to do hmm she said is that how its supposed to work okay ill play along is a quarter to eight all right sure by the time we get there ill be hungry enough to do proper damage to the menu and afterwards always assuming i dont fall asleep on your couch because im so full maybe we can do something perverse she snorted again viii monday shaped up as a very good day not only did i have a date with judy but maximum ruhollah had come through with the showcause order that would let me michael manstein and me actually go up and examine the area around the devonshire dump to see what was leaking and god willing find out why that happened thursday he spent friday quashing appeals from the devonshire land management consortium the order was still good when i got to the confederal building monday morning had one of the appeals succeeded the words would have faded right off the page they tell stories about officials who go out to conduct their business open up their briefcases and pull out a blank sheet of parchment nobody dies of embarrassment but harry turtledove sometimes you wish you could i reminded myself to check my document before i handed it to tony sudalds if there was anybody i didnt want laughing his head off at me he was the guy i met michael manstein up on the seventh floor he was packing vials of this jars of that silk bags full of other things and tied with elaborately knotted scarlet cords into his little black bag i scratched my head why not just take a good speflchecker i asked he glanced up from what he was doing i am operating under the assumption that we will be searching around the walls for leaks david he said as patiently as if i were a kid dygarden pupil the containment spells would degrade the performance of the microimps in a spellchecker that had certainly happened when i used my own portable to run an unofficial scan of the dump it hadnt picked up anything but the containment cantrips id figured a more sensitive model would overcome the interference but the reason i had michael along after all was that he knew more of such things than i did youre the wizard i told him shall we go your carpet or mine we ended up taking his hed had a special option package installed to insulate his sylphs from the potent magics he often flew with i didnt care to risk having my carpet break down and strand me in the middle of nowhere for which as detractors of angels city wib tell you st ferdinands valley is an excellent substitute as we slid down to the lot i grinned no staff meeting for me today michael manstein flew exactly as you would expect exactly at the speed limit exactly where he ought to have been every change of height or direction signaled at exactly the right time exact fits michael exactly as you will have gathered he parked his carpet in the same lot id used when i first came up to the devonshire dump we got off and started across toward the dump id taken maybe three steps when i said didnt you forget to activate your antitheft geas you ought to go back and do it this isnt a saintly neighborhood his thin rather pallid face took on an expression id never case of the toxic spell dump seen there before if you can believe it michael manstein looked smug he said whats sorce for the geas is sorce for the gander sometimes magicians are irritating people all right so michael had better theft protection on his carpet than the usual geas woven into the fibers while its still on the loom all right so even if someone succeeded in beating that pro tection hed still be able to tell where his rug had gone but was that excuse enough for making bad puns about it i didnt think so especially not early in the morning the security guard sitting in his glass booth was a differ ent fellow from the one whod been there the last time i went up to the dump so he didnt recognize me two epa sigils and a showcause order prominently displayed yes it still had writing on it were plenty to get his attention though he picked up his phone called tony sudalds then came back out to us and said hell be here in a minute sudalds took longer than that but not much the guard set the insulated footbridge over the barrier so tony could come out and talk with us he gave me a bonecrusher hand clasp made michael wince with another one and said okay lets see the order i gave it to him he read it carefully handed it back to me this says youre authorized to search the surround of the aforementioned property he made a face lawyer talk anyway this doesnt say thing one about coming inside thafs right i nodded were trying to see whats leak ing out after all okay sudalds said again i am directed by our legal staff to provide no more cooperation than what the order demands that means that if you need to take a leak youve got to do it across the street you cant come into the contain ment area for anything he gave me an apologetic shrug im sony dave but thafs what my orders are since well be sniffing around your wall maybe ill just stand up against it if i need to whizz i told him he gave me a funny look bureaucrats arent supposed to talk like that michael manstein said im going to get to work now harry turtledove he opened up his little black bag and started taking things out of it sudalds watched him setting up i watched sudakis after a minute or so i said walk around the comer with me tony why you gonna whizz on my shoes but he walked around the comer with me as soon as we were out of sight of michael and more to the point the security guard i gestured as if i were pulling out an amulet tony sudalds might be a bruiser but dont ever think hes dumb he went through his little pagan ritual with the chunk of amber he wore in place of a crucifix when he nodded to me i said okay we cant go inside the dump i understand your position but i still want to ask you about something i saw or thought i saw when i was in there before id have done it sooner but i keep forgetting what is it his voice was absolutely neutral i couldnt tell whether he wanted to help was angry at me curious or anything he just set the words out in front of him as if theyd been printed on parchment i described as best i could the nothing id seen in the dump the way just for an instant the containment wall seemed to recede to an infinite distance from my eyes did you ever notice anything like that i asked him it was unnerving sounds that way he agreed and now he let life creep back into his words he shook his big fair head nope cant say i ever did see anything of that sort he quickly raised a hand dont get me wrong dave i believe you you spend as much time as i have inside that containment area and youll see all lands of strange things like i said before you get all those toxic bits of notquitespent sorcery reacting with each other and you will see funny things youd better believe you will but that particular one no sony okay thanks anyhow i didnt know whether to believe him or not as usual he was hard to get a spell on i won dered if it was because he worshiped perkunas in a mostly judeochristian country and the same goes for muslim lands too followers of other powers often seem difficult to case of the toxic spell dump fathom on the other hand tony probably would have been tricky if hed been a catholic too anything else anything else short you want to talk about while the charms still on he asked i shook my head we went back around the comer to the containment area entrance the security guard looked mod erately entranced himself watching michael set up tony sudalds didnt give manstein even a glance he positioned the footbridge motioned for the guard to pick it up again and marched in toward his office maybe working in the toxic spell dump for so long had dulled tonys sense of wonder lots of strange things undoubtedly happened in there most of the sort you wouldnt want to see outside a stout sorcerous barrier but for me and evidently for the security guard too nothing is more interesting than watching a skilled thaumaturgical craftsman at work and michael manstein is one of the best if youre looking merely to detect the presence of most substances and powers you dont need fancy sorcery sup pose you want to find out if someones spilled sugar under a rug for instance get out some sugar of your own and apply die law of similarity if you get a reaction in your control bowl it was sugar under the rug all along ants everywhere are a good due too but if youre trying to see whether the influence of say beelzebub is leaking out of a toxic spell dump you dont go about summoning up beelzebub to see if the law of similar ity applies not if youre in your right mind you dont anyhow byproducts from spells that invoke beelzebub are contained within warded dumps for good reason you dont want them getting out into the environment and if you summon the lord of the flies outside the containment area thafs just whafs going to happen and so michael manstein attacked the problem indirectly i mention beelzebub because thats whose influence he was checking for when tony sudalds and i came back from our sub rosa chat instead of even thinking about invoking the demon he pulled out a jar full of every thaumaturges friend the good old common fruit fly case of the toxic spell dump harry turtledove because fruit flies are very simple and very stupid creatures the re exceptionally sensitive t mage apprentices practice spells with them if you cant make your charms work on fruit flies youre better off in another line of work and when that magic has anything to do with beelzebub of course their sensitivity increases even more just by watching the way they flew from the jar michael could tell whether the demons influence had leaked out where it didnt belong it was as elegant and lowrisk a test as you could imagine since im not a mage myself to me that just looked like little brownish flies coming out of a bottle when michael screwed the lid back on i figured i could safely interrupt him so i asked any sign of beelzebub none apparent to me he answered the lord of the flies is renowned for his trickery but i do not believe him capable of evading the fruitfly test it draws them even more strongly than spoiled plums good to hear i said because i know there are spell byproducts with his influence on them inside he dump yes that is to a certain degree reassuring michael agreed if a power so corrosive as beelzebub cannot break free of die containment area that augurs weh for its chances of holding in other less aggressive toxic spells who after beelzebub i asked i had thought huitzilopochdi he answered he is at least as dangerous as beelzebub and we have seen through the case of that wretched curanderos nostrum that he is ac tive and seeking to become more active in the angels city area again he didnt try to invoke the aztedan war god after all we were doing everything we could to keep huitzilopo chdi from manifesting himself around angels city instead he performed another indirect test this one using flayed human skin substitute it looked like parchment but it made my flesh creep all the same michael chanted hi a clucking gobbling language it wasnt poultry it was nahuad spainish is the dominant tongue in aztecia today but many people still use nahuad in their daytoday lives and its as much die language of die native powers as arabic is forjinni i hadnt known michael knew it but i wouldnt bet against michaels knowing any particular tiling the chant ended michael looked down at die square of flayed human skin substitute it seemed just die same as it had when he took it out of his bag he grunted softly whats the matter i asked i would have expected to observe some reaction diere he answered huitzilopochdic contamination is as likely an inducer of apsychia as any i can diink of but diere appears to be no external seepage at least not as measured by dlis test what were you expecting to see i asked the influence of huitzilopochdi was brought into die devonshire toxic spell containment area by means of flayed human skin substitute had diat influence spread beyond the containment area die sheet of die substitute material i have here would have demonstrated it by beginning to bleed i gulped i was sorry id asked would it be real blood i asked in diaumaturgy real is a word almost witiiout meaning michael said sniffily it would look feel smell and taste real whedier it could be successfully removed from die flayed human skin substitute and impplanted in die veins of someone who had suffered a loss from injury or vampirism trutii to tell i do not know it might be worth determining an interesting question yes he pulled a pencil out of die pocket of his lab robe peered around for somediing on which he could jot a note for one dreadful second i feared he was going to scribble on die piece of flayed human sidn substitute i dont diink my stomach could have stood diat but at die last minute he fished out a parchment notebook instead and did his jotting on diat he spent die rest of die morning and the whole afternoon on tests of diat sort to my amazement and distress he came harry turtledove up empty every time no i take that back he did find one leak after four in the afternoon when both of us were fed up and frustrated enough to try something silly he tested for stardust and sure enough the tip of the wand he was using glowed for a minute undoubtedly deposited here along with more unsavory items by one of the hollywood lightandmagic outfits in search of a hit michael said but even if stardust is leaking its not toxic i said the most it could possibly do would be to make somebody popu lar who doesnt deserve to be michael manstein looked at me as if i were a schoolboy whod added two and two and come up with three not five but definitely three id fallen short of what was expected of me like a good schoolmaster he set me straight the prob lem is not stardust outside the containment area david as you say that is trivial in and of itself the problem is that stardust could not possibly get out of the dump if it were not leaking we have therefore established that the leak exists what we have not established is which serious contaminants are emerging from it oh i said feeling dumb odds were awfully good that he was right still though you tested for all the danger ous powers whose influences are likely to be in the dump and came up with zip stardust is pretty elusive stuff even the lightandmagic people dont know for sure where itll stick maybe it did leak out by itself indeed michael said and maybe you could find a mineral able to create blasts to rival those of megasalaman ders yet i would not lose sleep fretting over the probability of either event i will take oath upon any scripture you care to select that something and something malevolent at that created the breach through which the stardust emerged that is my professional judgment you work with experts to get their professional judgment if having got it you then choose to ignore it youd better have a real good reason i not only didnt have a real good reason i thought michael was right but if he was what had gone wrong case of the toxic spell dump i said what bothers me most about detecting the star dust and nothing more serious is that the dump operators will be able to claim that the dust didnt really come from inside even though we know it was dumped there the neighborhood will make it hard for them to substan tiate that michael waved to show what he meant i had to nod if ever a neighborhood remained conspicuously untouched by stardust the one around the devonshire dump was it why havent we found any nastier influences leaking then i asked the most obvious reason is a failure in our testing tech nique michael answered i must confess however that at this moment i cannot tell you where the flaw lies all my procedures have in the past shown themselves to be more than satisfactory i asked my watch what time it was when i found out it was twenty to five isaid lets knock off for the day and see if were more brilliant in the morning i wanted to get back to my own carpet so i could go down to my place pack an overnight case and then head for jud s most days michael mansteins impressive integrity wouldnt have let him contemplate taking off early let alone doing it when he said why not i confess i blinked he added we certainly arent accomplishing anything here at the moment with the possible exception of entertaining the security guard maybe he was trying to justify leaving to himself or maybe to me at that point i didnt need any jus tifying all i wanted to do was head south michael must have talked himself into it because he started sticking tools and substances back into his little black bag i stood there waiting hoping he wouldnt get an attack of conscience he didnt as soon as he was through we walked across the street to his carpet and headed for westwood traffic was its usual ghastly self so many carpets on so many flyways meant there was so much lint and dander in the air that the famous angels city sunshine turned pale and washedout a lot of people were rubbing their eyes as they harry turtledove flew that pobution usually seems worse in st ferdinands valley than other parts of town too they dont get the sea breeze there to clear it out what theyre going to have to do one of these days is design a flying carpet that isnt woven from wool people have been trying to do that for years so far they havent managed to come up with one the sylphs like but if they dont succeed before too long angels city isnt going to be a place anybody in his right mind would want to live i breathed easier literally and figuratively when we got out of the valley and back into westwood michael pulled up beside my carpet in the parking lot are you going to go back up to your office and see what awaits you he asked nope i said whats that new testament line suffi cient unto the day is the evil thereof something like that anyhow tomorrow will have troubles of its own im not really interested in finding out about them in advance as you will michael said since it was nearer six than five he didnt have any trouble finding a parking space most people who work at the confederal building had gone home he headed on in anyhow now that he was here hed do some more work maybe he was feeling bad about his fall from probity me i didnt feel bad at all hungry yes but not bad i jumped onto my carpet and headed home i got off at impe rial instead of the second just in case more earth elementak with my name on them were waiting for me if they were i evaded them i got home unscathed i stayed just long enough to use the plumbing and toss tomor rows outfit into an overnight case then i was out the door down the stairs back on my carpet and on my way to judys going down st james freeway into long beach in the evening is a gamble when its bad the carpets might as well be sitting on your living room floor i could have got there at nine as easily as a little before eight but i was lucky and so i pulled up in front of judys place right on time i used the talisman to let her buildings watcher know i belonged there then went up the stairs two at a time to her flat i knocked on the door when she didnt come case of the toxic spell dump right away i figured she was using the plumbing herself or something so i let myself in i took one step in the front room and then stopped star ing for a second i thought id gone into the wrong flat it took me a while to realize judys spare key wouldnt have let me into any place but hers but judy as befits a copy editor is scrupulously neat the flat had been trashed books were scattered all over the floor knickknacks strewn everywhere some of them were broken earthquake i thought and then more sensibly burglars i ran into the bedroom calling judys name as i went nobody answered on me bed lying exactly parallel to each other just the way judy would have set them there were a green sflk blouse and a pair of linen pants the right land of outfit to wear to the opening of a nice new restaurant the bedspread was white i am you will have gathered familiar with judys bed and its bedclothes the red stain next to die blouse was new it wasnt a big stain but seeing even a little blood is plenty to make your own blood run cold judy my voice came out as a frightened croak no answer again i hadnt really expected one the bathroom door was open the air in there felt humid as if shed taken a shower not long before she wasnt in there now though not anywhere i yanked back the curtain to be sure burglars faded from my mind i wished die word would have stayed stuff after all is only stuff you can always get more but an uglier more frightening word took its place kidnappers i didnt want to dunk if let alone believe it after what had happened to me on the second though what choice did i have i ran back to die bedroom where die phone was i snatched up die handset nodiing happened the phone was dead ichor dripped from die litde cages diat held die ear and moudi imps the front mesh on bodi cages was pushed in whoever had snatched judy had taken die time to impplode die phone before he left widi her i hurried out to die walkway went to die flat next door i harry turtledove knocked hard i need to use your phone to call the con stabulary i said loudly someone was home st elmos fire glowed through the curtains and i could hear little noises inside but nobody came to the door cursing the faintheart to a warmer climate than angels citys i ran downstairs and pounded on the managers door he answered opening the door was part of his job hed seen me going in and out often enough to recognize me as soon as he got a good look at my face he said whafs the matter son i didnt take ofiense thafs how he talks besides hes old enough to have fought in die second sorcerous war and he has a bad limp so maybe he did so hes old enough and then some to be my father i said may i use your phone please i think judys been kidnapped as with any magic saying the word made it real judy judy adier in he gaped at me and men at the door id left open i suppose to confirm that that was the flat i was talking about he stood aside youd better come in his flat could have been furnished from the st ferdi nands valley swap meet the operative phrase was essence of bad taste from the couch his wife gave me a fishy stare that was the least of my worries but he took me to the phone and let me use it so his carpeyed wife could stare all she liked even through two phone imps the long beach constabu lary decurion sounded bored when he answered my call kidnapping though is a word to conjure with when youre talking to constables dont go back into the flat he told me stand out in front of the building and wait for our units it wont be long mr uh fisher i stood out in front of the building it wasnt long two blackandwhites pulled up red and blue lanterns flashing right behind them were a couple ofplainweave carpets that carded plainclothes constables everybody swept up to judys flat and started doing con stabularytype things physical searches spells what have you one of the plaindothesmen grunted when he saw the case of the toxic spell dump imploded phone looks like a professional job he said we arent likely to come up with anything much they hadnt bothered asking me for a statement yet i said this isnt just an isolated case i can guarantee you that oh how the plainclothesman sounded skeptical is the politest way i can put it as with the bored decurion at the phone desk i had the words to rock him i spoke them one by one attempted murder thomas brothers fire central intelligence youd better get hold of legate shiro kawaguchi up in st ferdi nands valley i added he can fill you in on the details all right sir well do that the plaindothesman said he was a tall black fellow named johnson jesus what kind of mess are we walking into the middle of a bad one i said but youre not in the middle of it youre just on the edge im in the middle and so is my fiancee a fellow wearing forensics crystal bads on his collar tabs came up to johnson and said ran a similarity check between the blood on the bedspread and the razor i found in a bathroom drawer they match so thats probably adiers blood i moaned thats a word you hear every so often but you hardly ever use it let alone do it this was one of those times i felt as if id been kicked in the belly judy bleeding judy maybe dead i must have said that out loud though i dont remember doing it because the forensics man put a hand on my shoul der and said i dont think shes dead sir theres evidence of some funny kind of fastdissipating sleep spell in the flat my best guess is she put up a fight they slugged her she kept fighting and they knocked her out so they could get her away from here i liked him and believed him too he didnt try sounding like somebody who knew everything there was to know no pseudolearned drivel about analyses and reconstructions his best guess was what he had and thats what he gave me i thought it seemed likely too harry turtledove the constables in uniform had been knocking on doors through the block of flats people opened doors for them even the louse who lived next to judy and had pretended i didnt exist but theres a difference between getting doors to open and learning anything once they have the constables came back to judys flat emptyhanded nobody had seen anything nobody had heard anything thats insane i exploded they take an unconscious woman downstairs and out of a block of flats at a busy time of the evening and nobody noticed must have been magic johnson said if they used it to knock mistress adier out they probably used it to aid the getaway too ill check that the forensics man said and he bustled out onto the walkway what do i do now i said as much to myself as to any one else half of me wanted to make like a lightandmagic show mercenary and go out slaughtering all the bad guys the other half unfortunately reminded me that not only did i not know how to get my hands on the bad guys but that if i went after them whoever they were alone theyd dispose of me instead of the other way round johnsons answer showed that as suited a constable he had a thoroughly practical mind what you do now mr fisher is come down to the station with us so we can get a sworn statement from you i didnt know where the long beach constabulary station was i had to follow one of the plainweave carpets back there it turned out to be almost on the ocean in a fancy new building legate kawaguchi would have killed for johnsons large bright efficient office come to that i wouldnt have minded having it myself like constables anywhere in the barony of angels the long beach crew had a regular library of scriptures on which the people with whom they dealt could swear truthfulness everything from the analects to the zendravesta they pulled out a torah for me i rested my hand on the satin cover while i repeated the oath johnson gave me then he called up their scriptorium spirit to take down case of the toxic spell dump my words i repeated everything id said in jud s flat and added detail to go with it after a while i paused and said what time is it anyhow johnson asked his watch it said nine fortyone could you get me a sandwich or something i asked i came down here for a dinner date with judy and i havent eaten since lunch we were going to try that new numidian place oh bocchus and bacchus johnson said yeah ive seen it advertised i wouldnt mind trying it myself hang on a minute mr fisher ill find out what i can round up for you instead of couscous and iamb i had a greasy burger greasier fries and coffee i drank only because it would have been an environmental hazard if id poured it down the commode then i finished giving my statement and then i said what do i do now this time i was asking the plain dothesman by to live as normally as you can he said id heard that advice before i was sick of it how are you supposed to live nonnady when people are trying to idb you and theyve abducted the person who matters most to you in the world johnson must have understood that he raised a light palmed hand and went on i know its a tah order what were going to have to do now is wait for contact wait for either your fiancee or the people holding her to get in touch with you whatever their demands are say youll comply and then let us know immediately but what if they i couldnt say it absit omen and ad that but he knew what i meant mr fisher the only consolation i can give you is that if theyd intended to commit homicide they could have done it they must have some reason for wanting mistress adier alive thanks i said from the bottom of my heart it made sense now all i had to do was pray the kidnappers were sen sible people but if they were sensible people would they have been kidnappers johnson came around his desk set a big hand on my harry turtledove shoulder you just go on home now mr fisher try and get some rest do you want one of our blackandwhites to fly up with you make sure youre not walking into a trap yourself after a couple of seconds i shook my head he looked relieved as if hed regretted the offer as soon as he made it i suspected the long beach constables were stretched as thin as any other force ifs an ugly world out there id just had my nose rubbed in how ugly it can be he walked out to my carpet with me well be in touch sir and well also get in touch with that legate kawaguchi of yours and with central intelligence and with the cbi too because ifs a kidnapping whafs funny sir i can get in touch with die cbi i said i work two floors under their angels city office i wondered if saul klein would get involved in the case nice to have one landsman around anyhow hed certainly be more comfort able to work with than the ci spook henry legion was unnerving johnson patted me on the shoulder again sent me on my way i remember very little about flying back to hawthorne too much else on my mind too little of it good i propitiated the watcher for my block of flats glided into the garage got off my carpet and headed for die stairway once i was inside the building i didnt worry about how late it was or how dark stupid i know especially after what had happened to judy i suppose youve never done anything stupid eh a vampire stood grinning at the bottom of the stairs modem medicine can do a lot for vampires periodic blood impplants to stifle dieir hunting urge heliotrope badis to let diem go abroad between dawn and dusk never on sunday die correspondence between real and symbolic sun is too strong dien sunspectacles to keep diem from being blinded when diey do fare forth by day those who choose to and i admit diose who can afford to take advantage of such techniques can lead largely normal lives not all do some would sooner follow dieir instincts and prowl i hadnt heard of vampires in hawdiome but i wasnt shocked to encounter one for one tiling i dunk i was case of the toxic spell dump beyond shock for another as ive said dlis is a pretty rough litde town just for an instant i wondered if he was connected with the bastards whod taken judy i had my doubts vampires if i can mix a metaphor are usually lone wolves odds are this one was just trying to keep himself fed random street crime however is just as dangerous to its victim as one diat targets him in particular the vampires eyes glittered i knew diat if i looked into diem for very long id be fascinated and dien die blood sucker could do whatever it wanted widi me i reached under my shirt pulled out something on a chain round my neck the vampire must have drought it was going to be a crucifix its fanged moudi opened in a scornful laugh a lot of vampires especially die ones diat survive for very long in christian countries are of balkan muslim blood and so immune to die sign of die cross but i didnt pull out a cross what i wore instead was a mystic jewish amulet a sevenbyseven acrostic prepared by die same mage abramelin works diat made my blasting rod i yanked it off over my head and direw die kaballistic missile at die vampire he had quick reflexes he caught it before it hit him in die face but diat didnt do him any good his cry of pain turned to an anguished howl the hebrew term for vam pires is kepiloth empty ones and its a good description because die ve lost so much humanity die re extremely vulnerable to magical countermeasures when die acrostic based on die hebrew word for dog hit dlis one he had no choice but to transform get out of here you son of a bitch i yelled and drew back my foot to give him a good lack he fled yelping tail between his legs i picked up die amulet hung it back around my neck and trudged upstairs to my flat only later when i was lying down and trying to sleep did it occur to me diat if i hadnt been emotionally drained from what had happened to judy die vampire might have made me panic and drained me in harry turtledove the literal sense before i thought of the amulet as it was i just took him in stride and did the right thing without even thinking about it every so often lying there id ask my watch what time it was the last answer i remember getting was going to work on three hours sleep is one of those night mares everybody has once or twice a lot of the time a new baby in die house is the reason not for me thinking about a baby made me think about judy wed had so many plans i didnt want to think about throwing diem all away a cup of coffee with breakfast another cup of cafeteria mud the minute i got in and another one right after that one more half an hour later i felt myself wind tighter and tighter by god id get through the day if tonight ever came id probably be too buzzed to sleep then one things at a time though get through the day first that meant more phone calls i didnt feel the least bit guflty about using my office my personal affairs and those of the toxic spell dump case had become inextricably inter twined first i called saul klein upstairs saul this is david fisher down in the epa again i said i want no i dont want to but i have to report a kidnapping this is die report diat we received from die long beach constabulary last night he asked when i said yes he went on is dus connected widi die minismgers case you were telling me about a little while ago id forgotten die minisingers i discovered diat along widi tired and worried i could be embarrassed too no it doesnt have anything to do widi dial if youve received diat long beach report saul does diat mean youu be on die case til be involved yes he answered is it convenient for you diat i come down and discuss matters now youre on die sevendi floor is diat right yes and sure come on down can you stop at die cafete ria and bring a couple of cups of coffee ib pay for diem he came we drank coffee he asked all die same case of the toxic spell dump questions johnson had die night before numbly i gave die same answers he scribbled notes when i was done he said well do eveiydiing we can for you david and for mistress adier i promise you diat i noticed he didnt promise theyd get her back alive and unhurt he must have known belter dian to make promises he might not be able to keep when he left i called henry legion the spook said i shall be diere direcdy he was too faster crosscountry dian saul klein had been from two floors up of course henry legion hadnt had to stop for coffee i told my story for the diird time repetition made it feel almost as if it had happened to someone else almost but not quite the ci spook said this is disturbing events are moving faster than crystalball projections had indicated my opinion is diat your scanning around the toxic spell dump may well have been die precipitating factor but except for a litde stardust we didnt find anydiing i said neariy wailing as if i were i kid who got caught and walloped for peeking in a bedroom window witiiout even seeing anydiing interesting you may know diaf die spook said i would doubt die perpetrators do then he disappeared on me i hate diat it always gives him die last word two down my next call was to legate kawaguchi i wondered if hed still be off on his odier case but no i got him this is in relation to die kidnapping of mistress adier whom i met at die thomas brodiers fire he asked when he heard it was me so the long beach constables must have already talked widi him thats what dlis is in relation to all right i said heavily i cant imagine any odier reason for kidnapping judy espe cially when whoever did it also tried to kill me a few days ago i can imagme odier reasons kawaguchi said before i could start screaming at him he went on i admit however diat your scenario appears to be of die highest probability as you will have surmised and as i had surmised i have discussed dlis matter widi die long beach force i would however also be grateful for your firsdiand account harry turtledove i gave it to him one more repetition i thought one more movement out of the realm of reality and into that of discourse in a way it was a sort of antimagic magic uses words to realize what had only been imagined i was using them to turn tragedy and horror into memory which is ever so much easier to handle when i was through kawaguchi said did you learn from the forensics man what sort of sleep spell he detected at your fiancees flat you know i didnt i answered hie plaindothesman johnson and i went down to the long beach station so i could make my sworn statement there and the forensics fel low didnt stick his head into johnsons office while i was giving it i shad inquire kawaguchi said his words were spaced a little too far apart as if he was writing and talking at the same time i said i wanted to check with you too legate to see if you have any new answers that would help dear up who did this to judy whoever it was had also undoubtedly arranged to have the earth elemental dropped on my flying carpet at the moment that seemed utterly unimportant to me new answers no he said i have some new questions however there has been vandalism relating to the garuda bird project at the lold plant in burbank vandalism behind a hermetic seal thatis supposed to be impossible i said now speaking slowly myself i was scrawling a note to call matt arnold many things once supposed impossible have come true kawaguchi said take virtuous reality for example thank you i exdaimed that reminds me of some thing else i wanted to ask you whats the more usual name for pharwnachrus mooinno kawaguchi actually laughed i hadnt been sure he could my apologies inspector i should not have read the name to your secretary straight off the laboratory report the com mon name for the bird in question is the quetzal quetzal i slammed into that head on as if my carpet had run into a building are you sure case of the toxic spell dump confirmed by an ornithologist and an etruscan orni thomancer kawaguchi said youre sure i admitted but thats crazy michael man stein he runs the sorcery lab here and i went around the devonshire dump yesterday and we found no trace of aztedan sorcery leaking he even tested with flayed human skin substitute for huitzhopochtiism i have told you what i know kawaguchi said the pos sibility remains that the feather was somehow altered in its translation from virtuous reality into our own merely mun dane space and time as i noted at the time if would not be accepted as evidence in a court of law another alternative is that the feather is indeed derived from a quetzal but was deliberately placed within range of the scriptorium spirit erasmus sensorium for the purpose of misleading us yeah i said or it might be real whatever that means in connection with something out of virtuous reality exactly so kawaguchi said ockhams razor argues for that interpretation although the others cannot be ignored i shave my data with ockhams razor too its the most practical tool to use in preparing baseline data for projec tions and such but like any other razor it will cut you if youre not careful with it thanks for the information legate kawaguchi i said would you do me one more favor please would you call a spook named henry legion at central intelligence back in dsfcc gave him the number and tell him what youve just told me ifs something he needs to know believe me use my name itll help you get through to him i shall do as you suggest kawaguchi answered slowly the implications however are troubling i know when id first heard charlie kelly reluctantly admit the possibility of the third sorcerous war it chilled me for days now as far as i was concerned it was old news judy bulked ever so much larger in my thoughts i couldnt worry about the whole worid going up in smoke thats too much for any mere man to take in but when some damned i hope bastard kidnaps the woman you love you understand that real well harry turtledove kawaguchi and i said our goodbyes he promised again that he would call henry legion me i called lold and eventually got connected to matt arnold i just got off the phone with legate kawaguchi of the accd i told him he said you had a breakin and some vandalism on the garuda bird project thats right he answered one of our people was criti cally injured too kawaguchi didnt say anything about that i said what happened he was bitten by a snake even over the phone i could hear arnolds voice turn grim some dever sorcerer found a way to beat a hermetic seal did the constable tell you about that he mentioned that it had been done but not how i answered you sound like you know do yes arnold said therell be some sleepless nights up in crystal valley until they can bring their sorceware up to date you dont need a crystal ball to predict that i agreed how was it done everyones always claimed hermetic seals are proof against just about anything i heard the silence that meant he didnt want to tell me quickly i added remember i have a professional interest in this any magic that can beat such a powerful seal has to have serious consequences for the environment all right he said grudgingly i guess i can see that but dont go spreading the word to all and sundry you under stand im not a reporter or a newsman for the ethemet i replied with dignity okay he said what happened was the bastards used one of hermes own attributes to break the seals he was sup posed to oversee it was a very clever application of the law of similarity ill say i wish whoever came up with it would have put as much energy into something legitimate go on i said the snakebite has something to do with it he paused again i realized i was supposed to figure out case of the toxic spell dump why some other morning i might have enjoyed playing intellectual games that particular day i just didnt have it im sony i must be dense i said my troubles werent any of his business can you explain it for me a sniff conveyed across the ether by two phone imps carries an impressive weight of scorn matt arnold said think about the kerykeion hermes carries the what he made another impatient noise as far as i was concerned lucky for him he was at the far end of a phone connection the epa doesnt have the money or the secrets to get hermetic seals so i had no reason to be familiar with the minutiae of hermes cult maybe he realized that or maybe he just wanted to get me off the phone so he could go back to whatever hed been doing before i called he said the latin term for the kerykeion not really proper you know for talking about a greek power is the caducous that i did understand the staff with the my voice trailed away snakes i said in an altogether different tone of voice no wonder you said the bite had something to do with it thats right he said as if there might be some hope for me after all they used the affinity of all snakes to the ones of the caduceus to weaken the seal and let them get into our secure areas sneaky i added i hope you told legate kawaguchi about that if one set of bad guys figures out a stunt every body will be using it two weeks later then something else occurred to me how did your vandals get to the hermeti cally sealed areas anyhow you had some toughlooking guards out front when i was there they got lulled to sleep arnold sounded as if he didnt like to admit that some land of spell or other kawaguchis forensics people havent got back to me with the data excitement ran through me it sounded a lot like the way judys kidnappers had operated i wrote that down so i wouldnt forget it and promised myself id call plainclothes man johnson as soon as i was off the phone with arnold harry turtledove while i still had him on the ether though i asked what land of snake bit your man it was a ferdelance arnold answered nasty thing the venom makes you bleed internally as if you had a vampire gnawing you from the inside out lucky its a rela tive of our local rattlesnakes the antivenin spells for the one were efficacious enough we hope against the other like i told you jerrys still on the critical list but they think hell puu through im glad to hear it i said but why a ferdelance in the first place why not use our rattlers for one thing its more poisonous if thats what the bas tards were after and for another if the sorcerers were aztecians theyd be more familiar with their native serpents than ours and if they werent they could throw suspicion on azteca by planting snakes native to that realm i was think ing about the quetzal feather hi now id suspected the persians more than anyone else i wondered if id have to change my mind i also remembered persians deviousness if they could hide their schemes by implicating someone else theyd do it and i remembered i still hadnt visited chocolate weasel matt arnold said forensics ought to let us know before too long i hope so i said thanks for your time ive already wasted so much on this miserable business a little more doesnt matter now with that encouraging word arnold hung up on me i called johnson when he answered my ear imp yelled into my ear so i suppose he was yelling at his mouth imp did the kidnappers call you or your fiancee im sorry no how sorry i was i explained what id heard from matt arnold then asked has your forensics man been able to identify the sleep spell that was cast in judys flat hold on he said thats in my notes i saw it let me look the imps reproduced the noise of shuffling parch ments then i heard johnson say yeah here it is more as case of the toxic spell dump if to himself than to me after a few more seconds he must have put the handset up to his mouth again because his voice came back loud and clear tve got it mr fisher forensics says its an aztecian spell summoning the power named the one called night the one from he nine beyonds to cast sleep on the victim theres a note here that its not generally used with good intent im sony to have to tell you that sir not half as sony as i am to hear it i answered but i wasnt surprised or not much either aztecians really were behind this or somebody was putting on one hell of a bluff and i mean that literally the higher the evidence mounted the more i doubted it was a bluff from its own point of view after all aztecia has owed the confederation a big one for a long time angels city used to be aztecian territory after all so did st francis up north so did the arid zone and new aztecia further east and snowland and denver and all the rest of ruddy with them azteda would be a great nation without them the confed eration wouldnt be and thats just in the sphere of mortal politics i thought about what henry legion had said about the shift in the bal ance of powers it was already plain that huitzilopochtii wanted his own back and if that green feather meant what it seemed to so did quetzalcoati the two powers had been rivals before the spainish came if theyd composed their differences if that was so then heaven help the confed eration heaven had better help anyhow i called legate kawaguchi back when i got him i asked what kind of sleep spell knocked out the guards at the lold plant in burbank thats in my notes he answered just as johnson had he was quicker to find the answer than the long beach con stable had been here we are the report indicates that it was an aztecian spell one invoking the power variously called the page and the crackler sending the spirits of the victims to the nine beyonds the nine beyonds i said is this power also known as the one called night harry turtledove i dont see that name here let me check with forensics and call you back he did too inside of five minutes inspector fisher the answer to your question is yes forensics wants to know how you knew this power is not commonly invoked in angels city just got off the phone with long beach the one called night is the power that put judy to sleep kawaguchi was nobodys fool i shall consult immediately with plainclothesman johnson he declared this link must be explored to the fullest extent possible more goodbyes after they were through i sat staring at the phone wondering whether to call henry legion again or give tony sudalds a piece of my mind before i could do either rose stuck her head into my office and said bea would like to see you and michael up front please you werent there for staff meeting yesterday so she wants to catch up on what youve been doing no i said it came out utterly flat as if ridiculous no tion somebody built a mechanical that could talk rose stared she knows im not fond of staff meetings but when the boss says come unto this one he cometh and when she says go unto that one he goeth at least if he knoweth whats good for him but david rose began trying to bring me to my senses no i said again cant too busy i was just going out into the field when you came in it wasnt true but i could make it so i got up from my desk started for the door if rose hadnt got out of the way in a hurry id have walked right through her david are you all right she called after me as i trudged down the hall no i answered being very tired is kind of like being drunk it makes you say die first thing that pops into your head you often regret it later i wondered if id still have a job to come back to even as i was sliding down to the parking lot its a good thing id come to know st ferdinands valley well over the past few weeks i could fly up to the devon shire dump without having to think about where i was going case of the toxic spell dump i wasnt real good at thinking not then when id told rose i was about to go out and do field work i hadnt had the slightest idea where id go and do it grilling tony sudalds face to face instead of over the phone was the closest thing to a good idea id had this time the security guard didnt need to see my eea sigd before he got on the phone with sudalds a minute later he set up the footbridge and i went into the contain ment area as i walked up the warded path toward sudakis fortress of an office i looked for the patch of nothing id seen a couple of times before rather to my relief i didnt notice it not then sudalds opened die outer door himself he probably started to say something pleasant and meaningless but one look at my face made him change his mind you all right dave he asked i gave him die same answer id given rose no to him though i amplified it i was supposed to go out to dinner with my fiancee last night after i got back from examining this place i didnt get to do dial when i went down to her flat i found shed been kidnapped thats terrible he exclaimed a comment i could hardly disagree widi he started to take me inside dien stopped in his tracks say what you like about antanas sudakis hes plenty sharp he looked back at me wait a minute he said slowly you dunk dieres some land of connection between us and that dont you listen dave im here to tell you that i overrode him you bet your sweet ass i dunk dieres a connection tony ive drought diere was a connection ever since die thomas brotiiers monastery burned down i really diought there was a connection when a couple of louts tried to kill me after i got off die freeway one afternoon when what now he interrupted me i realized i hadnt told him about diat so i did then i went on and now die day after die epa wizard and i scan dlis place judy gets snatched what am i supposed to dunk tony what would you think i dont know he said hardly louder dian a whisper harry turtledove he was shaken i could see that his left hand reached for the little amber amulet he wore under his shirt he made it go down by what looked like a deliberate effort of will i decided to shake him up some more and just so you know tony you do have a leak in your containment setup michael manstein and i found hollywood stardust all around your walls stardust is harmless he said rallying as gamely as he could yeah but if stardust is leaking what else is getting out with it michael had had to make that obvious point for me now i took malicious pleasure in hitting sudalds over he head with it he was tough id known that already you didnt find anything else did you he demanded no but we will us only a matter of time and thauma turgy and you know it as well as i do i took a deep breath tried to calm down anyway that isnt what i came up here for i wanted to find out who you called when michael and i got to work out here whoever it is either did the kidnapping themselves or else called somebody to arrange to have it done the only call i made was to the devonshire land man agement consortium office he said i had to let them know so they could he ran down like a mechanical watch as he realized what he was saying he kicked at die cement under his feet oh shit them or somebody connected with them i said it just about has to be i thought hed give me more arguments more denials but he didnt yeah he said in a voice like ashes so what are you going to do about it i said pushing hard be a good litde consortium soldier and pretend none of this has ever happened you can it would be legal youd probably even get promoted but could you look at yourself in the mirror whenever you went into a mens room fuck you dave he said evenly i did try to hit him then he caught my fist before it connected id known he was stronger than i am but not how much if hed hit me back case of the toxic spell dump somebody else would be telling you this story but he didnt he just hung onto me for most of a minute then said you done being stupid i nodded he let me go good you dont want to fay preaching at me again it wont push me in the direction you want me to go you got that he waited until i nodded again before he went on okay now that youve got that straight id do everything i can to help you get your lady back for my reasons mind you not yours were wasting time here i dont think i understand you at all i said i dont think you do either it wasnt pejorative more as if he was stating a law of nature maybe he was as ive said id never dealt with anybody of european origin who still clung to his peoples old gods not in an artificial cult like that of hermes but as part of a tradition as old and serious as my own balance of powers i thought and then wondered whose side perkunas was on after enduring umpty hun dred years of christianity the lithuanian power might be as eager as huitzilopochtte to get his own back but no matter where his god stood i thought tony stood with me almost dragging me in his wake he started down the walk toward the exit i happened to look back toward his office at just the right time wait i exclaimed and grabbed his arm it was like taking hold of the juggernauts car once he got moving he didnt want to stop for anything look back there i said in a tone heading toward desperate thats what i was talking about before grudgingly he turned around i dont see anything he said i dont see anything either i answered i see nothing here stand right where i am now i moved off the spot he moved onto it he shook his head started to go now i was desperate stand on tiptoe i suggested im several inches taller than he is he gave me a look that would have wilted me under any other circumstances when i stayed crisp he shrugged and went up on his toes a second later he said something in harry turtledove lithuanian that i didnt understand then he dropped back into english you were right after ab dave i dont know what that is neither did i at the moment i couldnt see die nothing the dump just looked like a weedy vacant lot but when id stood where tony was now the wall beyond that point seemed to recede into infinite space and yet at the same time it was obviously right where it belonged i dont know how to explain it any better than that i got the feeling i wasnt sensing it entirely through normal vision tony sudalds came down off tiptoe he was as usual briskly derisive when you see something you dont under stand in a toxic spell dump youd better start trying to find out what it is just as fast as you can he said why dont you call your wizard his name was manstein right and have him get up here the sooner he can find out whats going on over there the sooner we can start trying to deal with it arent you the same fellow i heard yesterday talking about how if michael or i set so much as a toe inside the confines of the dump your people would sue us until the vulture let prometheus liver alone go ahead rub it in he said yeah im that guy but im also the guy youve finally convinced so come on back to my office i was never so happy to turn around in my life as we headed back toward the squat ugly fortress i asked do you know what got dumped in that area the more i can teh michael the quicker heb be able to identify whats going on makes sense sudalds said he looked over toward where wed seen that nothing it wasnt there now of course because we werent in the right spot thatd be about hmm area b check for you he pawed through the files muttering all the time no cant be that one that one was exorcised two years ago maybe this one no forget it i know everything rocs egg shell can do hahl hah i echoed gotta be this one dave threefour months ago one of case of the toxic spell dump the barons watchers of the shore found the remains of what sure looked like a major conjuration out on malibu beach they tested the junk for thaumaturgical activity but it came back negative and i mean real negative like thered never been any magic around it since time began nobody be lieved that not from the way the stuff was laid out so they brought it here and dumped it in spite of the tests i remember that one i said there were letters in the times complaining about the waste of taxpayers crowns thats it tony agreed you ask me me only thing worse than die government spending money when it doesnt need to is not spending it when it does need to i started to pick up die phone then stopped you said stuff was laid out what kind of staff he looked down at his parchments funny stuff like nodiing ive ever seen before staffs widi stone disks mounted on one end others widi those shells called sand crowns instead if i had to guess id say die stones were carved flat to look like die sand crowns and diere were odier staffs long and short topped widi feathers looked like some kind of indian ritual maybe but not one i know okay i got on die phone and called michael while i waited for him to answer i worried some more balance of powers indian magic would not be wellinclined toward what i drought of as peace and order not now environmental perfection agency michael manstein speaking michael hi ifs david fisher listen ive got a new job for michael interrupted somediing he hardly ever does david where are you what on earth are you up to bea is quite vexed a word only he would come up widi widi you and bos is practically in tears that made me feel bad but it would have made me feel worse if i didnt feel pretty bad already in words of one sylla ble i explained where i was and what i was up to i also told him about judy which explained why i was up to it good heavens david he said about as big an outburst harry turtledove as youb ever hear from him no wonder your behavior was so anomalous yeah no wonder at all i grunted anomalous wasnt the word for it shitty was i could blame it on endless worry no sleep and too much coffee but in the end it came back to me if youre not responsible for what you do in this world who is have you discovered anything of import in your return to the devonshire toxic spell containment area michael asked graciously not saying anything more about what sort of beast id been as i matter of fact i have i told him about the nothing then put tony sudakis on he phone so he could confirm it tony gave the handset back to me michael was saying shall fly there forthwith to investigate your description strikes me as extremely urgent he hung up hes on his way i said to sudakis okay he answered td better stay here then to make sure he can get in and do what he needs to do what about you you gonna wait here with me i thought about it shook my head tve got to get back and mend my fences listen do you have a telephone at home i waited till he nodded then said would you give me your number i may need to get hold of you any time like it or not and im not saying youre liable please understand that youre in the middle of this too and theyve got judy whoever they are he scrawled it on a scrap of parchment here you go call when you need to thanks i went out the door down the warded path i didnt even look back for the nothing this time over the footbridge and out to my carpet on the way back to st james freeway i passed a florists shop i stopped and bought rose some roses sometimes words arent contrition enough roses eyes went wide when i set die vase on her desk she pointed to the closed door to beas office shes in a meeting right now but shell want to see you when she gets out and thank you david you didnt have to do this michael told me what your trouble was ill pray for you case of the toxic spell dump rose is one of the good people if god was in a mood to listen to anybody hed listen to her i did have to do this i said its die stuff before diat i shouldnt have done she waved diat aside and started to say somediing more but i was already on die way back to my office no matter how much of a big hairy diing id been i found shed faidi fully taken my messages while i was out one was from hemy legion id have to call him back i thought then i looked at die next one it was from judy dc i dont know how long i stood there staring at the little piece of parchment in my hand every feeling you can imagine ran through my mind joy that judy was alive fear that she was in their clutches hope worry rage all of them jumbled together at once in a way that would have made me dizzy even if i hadnt been running on no sleep and too much coffee eventually i started thinking as well as feeling the mes sage not surprisingly left no return number i ran back j down the hall to rose threw it on her desk i meant to tell you about this david she said but what with the flowers and all it went right out of my mind im sony so even rose could make mistakes i hadnt been sure it harry turtledove was possible but it didnt matter not right then never mind i said how did she sound what did she say she just asked for you and hung up when i told her you were out of the office rose said i didnt know any thing was wrong then she gave me a reproachful look if id told her earlier she might have been able to do more you have to remember ive only spoken with her the couple of times shes come up here and occasionally taken messages for you and no one ever sounds like herself on the phone miserable phone imps but no sooner had that thought crossed my mind than i ran up the hall and almost ran down phybis again she let out an indignant squawk back to my office i wished michael were still here instead of up at the dev onshire dump id read that a good wizard could sometimes trace a phone call even after the etheric connection between the imps at the opposite ends was broken phone imps are nearly identical one to another hats what ectoplasmic cloning is all about nearly but not quite as bacons troscmtto puts it theres a divinity that shapes our ends roughhew them how we will tiny imperfections get into the cloning process macro identical but micro dif ferent thafs why the phone switching system works so well because the imps are so like one another and spring from the same source the laws of similarity and contagion make establishing contact between any two of them easy and because they arent quite identical each can be assigned its own place in the telephone web god im an idiot i exclaimed a moment later god i presume already knew this michael manstein was a good wizard sure but he wasnt the only good wizard involved in this case the cbi had plenty of skilled mages just two floors up i called saul klein told him what had hap pened tb send someone right to you he said as soon as i was through henry legion might have got down to my office faster than the wizard did but i dont think any mere mortal could have she was a hanese woman who came up just past case of the toxic spell dump my elbow but she seemed smart and businesslike as all get out she introduced herself as celia chang what time would this telephone call have been placed she asked i looked down at the parchment rose bless her efficient soul had made a note of it ten twentyseven i answered and ifs now she paused to ask her watch five min utes past twelve a little more than an hour and a half the etheric trail should not be impossibly cold let me see what i can do mr fisher from the efficient way she went about things i gathered this wasnt the first time shed traced phone calls probably not the fiftyfirst either if anybody had to use that particular thaumaturgy a lot it would be the cbi i felt easier id been wishing she were michael but now i decided i didnt need to worry about it she opened her little black bag took out what looked like a telephone handset but wasnt id never seen a blue porce lain phone anyhow and set it on the desk next to my phone does the telephone consortium know you have gear like that i asked officially no she said her smile made her look much younger and prettier than she had without it unofficially ask me no questions and ill tell you no lies like anybody else with an ounce of concern for the world to come she was hesitant about being forsworn never mind i told her she took a copper cable from one pocket other lab robe used it to connect her blue box to the real telephone as she did so she made a face properly this should be silver she said ifs a better conductor of sorcerous influences than copper but its also more expensive and so ifs not in our thaumaturgical budget if i were in private practice she shook her head if i were in private practice id be less use ful im sure you have to manage on fewer resources than you find ideal too how right you are i said she was making small talk while she could just to put me at my ease when the need for serious conjuration came she harry turtledove started ignoring me that was all right i hadnt expect any thing different wizards dealing with the other side dont need their elbows joggled even metaphorically mistress chang might have been hanese by blood but she used standard western sorcerous techniques ones that date back to the species of origen and some of them even farther no reason she shouldnt have for all i knew her ancestors might have come to the confederation a couple of generations before mine after censing the copper cable she took two metal plaques each inscribed with a demons seal and affixed them to the cable i dont need a full manifestation from either eligor or botis she explained but i do require the application of some of their attributes eligor discovers hidden things while botis discerns past present and future now if you will excuse me the first gesture of her elegantly manicured hand was a wave to get me to move back a couple of steps the next was a pass that accompanied her conjuration calling up demonic attributes without getting raw demon so to speak is a tricky business i watched quietly and respectfully while she did what she had to do it was more like coaxing than commanding no impressive circles or pentagrams no manifest thyself or eternal torment shall overwhelm thee at the climax of the incantation she just said help me please you two great powers i teu you modem sorcery lacks the drama it had in the good old days but we can do things now that our ancestors never dreamt of trying when celia chang pointed to the plaques on the cable the seals that bound eligor and botis which had been black squiggles on silver metal began to glow with a light that outshone the st elmos fire on the ceiling the light started to fade then grew again theyre searching through time for the etheric connection celia chang said just then botis seal blazed for a moment i had to blink and turn my head aside the cbi wizard softly clapped her hands together we have the fix in time now to see whether eligofs allegory algorithm can uncover the missing phone number case of the toxic spell dump i didnt know what we were waiting for probably for eli gofs seal to flare up the way botis had that didnt happen its squiggles continued to shine as they had before i dont know if youre familiar with eligors seal it looks rather like an open mouth with a rubber arrow threaded through its upper lip arrow or not though that sort of a mouth up and spoke like the old roman godlet aius locutius one number after another until there were ten celia chang and i both wrote them down as eligor gave them to us by the time wed recorded the last one the lines on both plaques had stopped glowing lets compare them the wizard said i handed her the scrap of parchment on which id taken down the numbers she held out the one on which shed written them wed both heard the phone number the same way she asked is this number familiar to you no i shook my head its not judys its not any phone number ive seen before i expected as much but you never know she said well have to go to the telephone consortium then and leam to whom the number belongs if anyone of course it might be a public phone i hadnt thought of that i said in a hollow voice hard for me to imagine kidnappers having a victim make a call from a pay phone in the middle of the morning but it was possible especially if they knew of one that couldnt be easily seen from the street mistress chang said well be in touch with you as soon as we leam anything mr fisher she packed up her sorcer ous impedimenta nodded to me still businesslike but with i thought some sympathy too and strode out of the office my stomach growled fortunately a couple of seconds after that what with all the coffee id poured down there it had been growling on and off for a while now but this was a different note it wanted food no matter what your mind tries to do to you your body has has a way of reminding you of lifes basics harry turtledove i went over to the cafeteria and bought myself a vulcanized hamburger as a matter of fact it was cooked so hard that vulcan had he been of a mind to could have carved the battle reliefs that hed put onto the shields of achilles and aeneas right onto the surface of the meat i ate it anyhow at the moment i didnt much care what i fed my fire as long as it filled me up and i washed it down with more coffee the stuff was starring to lose its power to conjure up my demons i found myself yawning over the last of my fries but no rest for the weary i plodded back to the office to see what i could accomplish in short the answer was not much part of the reason was that i jumped halfway to the ceiling every time the phone yarped hoping it would be judy again it never was none of the calls i got was of any consequence whatsoever every one of them though broke my concentration in aggregate they left me a nervous wreck along with hoping one of the calls would be from judy i also kept hoping one wouldnt be from bea i just didnt have it in me to play staff meeting games right then and i wasnt real thrilled about having to bear up under sympathy either atlas carried the whole world but right now i had ab the weight on me i could take but bea to my relief didnt call except for relief i didnt think anything of it at the time looking back though i think she didnt call precisely because she knew i couldnt deal with it bea is a pretty fair boss i may have mentioned that once or twice the phone squawked yet again when i answered it celia chang was on the other end mr fisher we have located that telephone whose number i traced a little while ago it is unfortunately a public phone up on the comer of sotos and plummer in st ferdinands valley oh i said unhappily i am sorry mr fisher she said but i did think you would want to know yes thank you i said and hung up i never have figured out why you thank someone whos given you bad news case of the toxic spell dump maybe to deny to the powers that its really hurt you no mat ter how obvious that is after celia changs call the phone stopped making noise for a while i tried to buckle down and get some work done but i still couldnt make my mind focus on the parchments in front of me id write something realize it was either colos sally stupid or just pointless scratch it out by again and discover i hadnt done any better the next time all i could think about was judy judy and sleep in spite of all that coffee i was yawning about half past three someone tapped on my door sev eral people had been in already news of what had happened was getting around with its usual speed in offices i knew they meant well and it made them feel better but it just kept reminding me of what judy had gone through and might be going through now still once more couldnt make me feel much worse than i did already come in i said resignedly it was somebody i worked with but somebody who already knew what was going on hello david michael manstein said i trust i am not intruding no no i said someone else would have been but not michael here sit down tell me what that thing that nothing i mean in the devonshire dump is he folded his angular frame into a chair steepled his long pale fingers first tell me if you have any word of your fiancee he said so i had to go through that again after all he listened attentively michael is always atten tive then said i am sorry you were out of the office when judith called i wish i could have been here when the cbi wizard traced the call as well i have had occa sion to attempt that twice but succeeded in only one instance an opportunity to improve my technique would have been welcome i had the feeling he was more interested in the magic for its own sake than the reason it had been used but i couldnt get angry about that it was michael through and through i tried again to make the carpet fly my way so what was that nothing did you analyze it case of the toxic spell dump harry turtledove i did he answered as best i could determine it is nothing whats that supposed to mean i know i sounded pee vish nerves exhaustion coffee again michael didnt notice what hed found intrigued him too much for him to pay attention to details like bad manners he said it is in my experience unique an area from which all the magic has been removed not externally as would be normal but internally whatever powers are involved are still contained within the barrier established around them but have in effect created that barrier to shield them from the surrounding world or vice versa i have no idea how to penetrate the barrier from this side could whatevers in there burst out from the other side i asked it is conceivable michael said since i am of necessity ignorant of what lies inside the barrier think of it as an opaque soap bubble if you likealthough it is almost infi nitely stronger i cannot evaluate the probability of that possibility i worked that through till i thought i understood it then i said why does the the nothing make everything behind it look so far away again i cannot give a precise answer michael said i believe i do grasp the basic cause of the phenomenon how ever the barrier is in effect an area where the other side has been removed from contact with this side the eye natu rally attempts to pursue it in its withdrawal thus leading to the impression of indefinitely great distance behind it okay i said that made some sense certainly more than anything id thought of which given my current state wasnt saying much but it raised as many questions as it answered the most important of which was how do you go about separating this side and the other theyve been inextricably joined at least since people and powers became aware of each other and possibly since the beginning of time michael said if your next question is going to be whether i have a theoretical model to explain how this phe nomenon came to be the answer i regret is no i regret it too but thats not what i was going to ask you i said michael raised a pale eyebrow to him finding a theoretical model ranked right up there with breathing my mind was on simpler things i was going to ask if youd come with me to inspect chocolate weasel tomorrow morning i explained how more and more of the evidence was pointing toward an aztedan connection beaten a hermetic seal have they michael murmured again the thaumaturgy interested him more than anything else he went on well be seeing learned articles on that for some time to come but yes i will be happy to accompany you to chocolate weasel where is the facility located in st ferdinands valley near the comer of mason and nordhoff i answered that wasnt a part of the valley id learned yet the devonshire dump was north of it while the businesses and factories id visited were farther south and east i figured michael or i could find it though he said shall we take my carpet again and meet here as we did yesterday all right i answered i was just as glad that hed fly us up into the valley at the moment i wondered whether id be able to get myself home tonight michael headed for the lab no doubt intent on catching up on whatever hed had to abandon when i called him from the devonshire dump i asked my watch what time it was a little before four not quite soon enough to go home but too late to do anything useful assuming i could do anything use ful to the parchments on my desk i decided to try to call henry legion i realized there was an advantage in dealing with a spook rather than a person even though it was just about seven back in dc he was likely to be on the job at least i didnt think spooks had families to go home to and sure enough i got him when i called inspector fisher he said i was hoping i would hear from you what have you learned since this morning so i told him what id learned the hermetic seals the quetzal feather the ferdelance the one called night the nothing it took a while until i told him what all id found harry turtledove out in the course of the day i hadnt realized how big a forest it made one tree at a time had been falling on me but to shift the figure of speech i had a lot of pieces i didnt have a puzzle i shall convey your information to the appropriate sources he said when i was through inspector fisher the confederation may well owe you a large debt of gratitude im sony i said tut right now that doesnt matter much to me ab i want to do is get judy back and i dont think im much closer than i was maybe fitting some of the pieces together would help i asked is it die aztecians that weve bumped up against here your information makes that appear more likely he answered maddeningly evasive and dispassionate as usual i was too tired to get angry at him i just pushed ahead if it was the aztedans why did they attack the garuda bird the ci spook hesitated i must have asked the right question the answer which immediately springs to mind is that the garuda bird is the great enemy of serpents being the representative of birth and the heavens while serpents are in the camp of death the underworld and poison the great enemy of serpents for a second it didnt mean anything i was beat then an alarm dock started yelling inside my head quetzalcoati this though had occurred to me yes henry legion said what do we do i demanded prayers come to mind the spook answered which while sensible was not what i wanted to hear he added past that the best we can call if you require my assistance inspector fisher i shall do what i can for you thanks i said i was talking to a dead line hed hung up someone tapped on the door i looked up now as the day wound down it was bea i gulped she wasnt the person i wanted to see right then or at least i thought she wasnt until she said quietiy i just want you to know david that my prayers will be with you tonight from henry legion the suggestion of prayer had had the case of the toxic spell dump undertone that even that probably wouldnt help the mess we were in bea though sounded calmly confident it would make everything all right i liked her attitude better than the spooks but then henry legion knew more about what all was wrong than she did tm sony i didnt come see you i muttered i wasnt just sony i was ashamed of myself but thafs not something you can casually say to your boss i guess she was good at reading between he lines she said if you like we can talk about it more tomorrow why dont you go home and try to get some rest now youb be better for it she made shooing motions then smiled my mother used to do that to chase chickens off the back porch i havent thought about it in years go on home now thank you bea i said humbly and i went on home i dont remember what i cooked for supper that night which is probably just as well i thought about going to bed right afterward but if i did that i knew id wake up at three in the morning and stay up so i rattled around in my flat instead like a pea in a pod that was much too big for it the quiet in there felt very loud i wished i had an eth emet set to give myself something to occupy my ears and maybe my mind being alone with yourself when youre wor ried is hard work i tried to work but i couldnt concentrate on the words the phone yelled i banged my shin on the coffee table in the front room as i sprang up and dashed off to answer it it was some mountebank selling microsalamander cigar light ers im afraid i told him where to put one before he let the salamander loose i limped back out front after i hung up i picked up my book again i should have been reading something useful maybe about the garuda bird or quetzalcoati but no it was a thriller about thirteen guys on a spy mission to alemania during the second sorcerous war i was at the exciting part the alemans were trying to drive them into the alkahest pits still bubbling from the first sorcerous war even so i kept losing track of what was going on harry turtledove the phone again i almost hoped it was another huckster id taken savage mindless pleasure in baiting the first one too much had happened to me with no chance for me to hit back at anyone if a miserable salesman chose that moment to inflict himself on me it was his lookout hello i snapped david the progressive distortion from two phone imps couldnt mask the voice all my rage evaporated even before she went on its judy honey i whispered just hearing for sure that she was alive took my breath away i made myself talk louder are you all right im fair she said which made me fearful all over again she hunted on dont ask questions dave you have to listen to me they wont let me talk long they say you have to stop messing around with things that arent your business or else i waited to hear what the or else was but shed stopped i was afraid i could figure it out for myself tell them i say rfl do whatever they want i answered i hoped shed get the distinction just because i said it didnt mean i would be careful dave she said they arent joking they her voice cut off faintly as if the imps were reproducing the words of someone farther from the phone i heard come on you honey i love you i said while i was talking though somebody hung up the phone i dont think judy heard me i spent a while wishing damnation on the wretches whod snatched her then pulled myself together and called the long beach constables plaindothesman johnson had the night off i got some other worthy name of scott he heard me out then said thanks for passing on the information sir well do what we can with it which meant as i knew only too well they werent going to do much it did tell them as it had me that judy was still on this side that did count for something to them and it had counted for a lot more than something to me i had fresh hope case of the toxic spell dump i caded the cbi saul klein had gone home but the fel low who answered the phone knew what was going on with the case i asked him can you send someone down to try to trace the call your mistress chang managed to do it earher today well why not the cbi man said after he thought it over csat hurt to tiy he read me back my home address to make sure he had it right then said well have someone there in half an hour or so it was more like fortyfive minutes but that didnt sur prise me i drive st james freeway every day i know how things can be down there when the rap on the door came i opened it with my left hand my right hand was holding the blasting rod after what had happened to judy i wasnt tak ing any chances the weedy little fellow outside gave back a pace when he saw i was carrying a rod which meant he almost went ass over teakettle down the stairs he rallied fast though cant say as i blame you six he said and flashed a cbi sigil that said he was an intermediate thaumaturgic ana lyst by which i learned the cbi has sffly job tides too named horace smidley i lowered the rod right away he might not have looked like the lightandmagic show version of a cbi man but he sure did look like a horace smidley i led him to the phone he went through the same tracing ritual celia chang had used earlier in the day back at the office he wasnt as smooth as she had been he was only an intermediate thaumaturgic analyst after all but he got the job done the quasimouth that formed ehgors seal spoke its series of digits then fell sflent once more thafs the same number they used when they called before i said is it careless of them smidley made a ducking noise in the back of his throat i got the idea that he disapproved of carelessness no matter who perpetrated it even if it made catching the bad guys easier he went on til take the infor mation back with me what do you think it means i asked are they holding harry turtledove judy somewhere dose to there and using that phone because ifs convenient to them that is most probable he said he and michael man stein would have got on weh together the other possibility is that they are deliberately transporting her a long distance to mislead us possible as i say but risky any accident or fly ing violation that a constable happens to observe destroys what up to now has appeared a wellorganized scheme again you could tell he liked organization no matter who was using it or for what purpose i worry about people like that the leader of alemania had had a lot of them behind him horace smidley though was on my side for which i was duly grateful i thanked him for taking the trouble to come down at night my pleasure he said and then to my mind weakened the answer by adding and my duty he headed down the stairs intentionally this time and then i presume on back to westwood me i shut the door after him brushed my teeth and went to bed i dont remember another thing until the alarm clock scared me awake the next morning it was going to be a hot one i could tell as soon as i got out of bed even after a long nights sleep i still felt tired but out my bedroom window i saw that the wind stirring tile eucalyptus tree next door was some from out of the north east what they call st anns wind that always strikes me as rude or dont you think naming a wind after the virgins mother implies she talked too much the wind swirled hard enough to shake my carpet as i headed for the freeway when i flew past a vacant lot i watched the dust devils spinning tumbleweeds around and tossing them up into the sky there are more dust devils these days than there used to be ive always said cutting the budget for meteorological exorcists was a mistake one day the devils will join forces and blow down a building or three and fixing things will end up costing a lot more than were saving now but what politician looks to the future i wondered why i case of the toxic spell dump was bothering myself come to that if the third sorcerous war broke out dust devils would be the least of my and everyone elses worries michael was waiting for me in the parking lot have you received any news he asked as i walked up to his carpet they made judy call me last night i said nodding whoever they are they want us to stop investigating any thing that has anything to do with the devonshire dump or else michael gave me a curious look yet you are stifl here he turned on to wilshire to get to st james freeway for the trip up into the valley yeah im still here i said i dont believe stopping would really make them turn judy loose and besides the deeper we get into this case the more important it looks god help me i was starting to think like henry legion sav ing the worid not just one person looked bigger all the time we got off the venture freeway at winnetka and headed north michael flying me navigating it was a mixed kind of neighborhood first a business block then a row of homes then some more businesses once we flew past what looked half like a school half like a farm i glanced down at my map thafs the ceres institute ofst ferdinands valley in spite of everything i laughed angels city is an ecumenical place another artificial cult michael said his business is keeping up with such things they say the goddess really does improve agricultural productivity i wonder how much maintaining her cult adds to the price of produce though costbenefit analysis again you cant get away from it in our society it was the same kind of thing i was doing to see whether the chumash powers would be worth preserving if they did still happen to exist that reminded me id have to call professor blank one of these days and see what more hed harassed his graduate stu dents into finding out we should be getting dose michael said we are i answered after a check of where we were the next major cross street is nordhoff youll want to turn harry turtledove left there mason is the next fairsized street that wib cross it about half a mfle west ofwimietka veiy good michael swung into the leftmost flight lane at winnetka and nordhoff we had to wait for all the south bound carpets to go past before we could turn though strange how rules of the road that were codified for horses in europe long before anyone outside the middle east was flying carpets still govern the way we handle traffic sorcery of course maintains anything old and curious because being old and curious makes it powerful in and of itself id never thought of traffic rules falling into that category though the north side of nordhoff was a light industrial park with one big rectangular box of a building following another the south side was mostly houses though the comer with mason boasted a liquor store a golden steeples that prob ably did a landoffice business ftom all the working types across the street and also a spells r us chocolate weasel was in the industrial park a couple of buildings past mason michael let his carpet down in an open space near the front door as i undid my safely belt and stood up i noticed that a lot of the carpets in the lot were old and threadbare people didnt work here to get rich that was obvious michael picked up his little black bag we walked over to the entrance side by side the first thing that hit me when we went inside was the music there were minisingers involved in the case after all id have to teh saul klein but they werent playing lieder oh my no the inside of choco late weasel sounded like an aztedan bar in east ac or maybe like one down in tenochtidan both in style of music and in volume i must confess i winced all the chatter inside was in spainish too no i take that back i heard a little clucking nahuafl too no english not until people noticed us i got the idea people who didnt look aztedan didnt pop into chocolate weasel every day the aztedan community in angels city is big enough to be a large city of its own and doesnt have to deal with outsiders unless it wants to by the looks they gave us we were outsiders they didnt case of the toxic spell dump want to deal with those looks got darker when we pulled out our epa sigils too suddenly everyone in the place developed a remarkable inability to understand english michael foiled that ploy though by asking for the head of the firm in fluent spainish i wondered if the secretary would fall back into nahuad she was one of the people id heard using it if she did though michael would give her another surprise i won dered how many pale blonds spoke the old aztedan language not many seemed a fair guess but rather to my disappointment she didnt in fact hearing michael use spainish made her unbend enough to remember she knew some english after all which put me back in the conversation she took us down the hall to the consortium markgraves office jorge vasquez looked at us with about as much enthusi asm as a devout hindu confronted with a plate of bloodred prime rib he was a handsome fellow in his early forties and doing quite well for himself unless i missed my guess his suit would have run me dose to two weeks pay he shoved our sigils back across the desk at us then leaned forward to glare i am sick and tired of harassment by the epa he said you people have the attitude that our spells must be perverse because they are based on the authentic rituals of our people it is not true our procedures are no more wicked than the thaumaturgy die catholic church works through transubstantiation he pointed to the crucifix on the wall behind him thafs a matter of opinion i answered myself im jewish i didnt elaborate what it meant was that i found any ritual of human sacrifice no matter how symbolic on the unpleasant side vasquez didnt say anything but his nostrils flared so he wasnt real fond of jews eh well that was his problem not mine i went on in any case this visit has nothing to do with the merit of your rituals only with the way youre preparing your toxic spell byproducts for disposal the devonshire dump is leaking and leaking something noxious enough to harry turtledove cause an outbreak of apsychic births in die neighborhood considering some of the materials and cantrips you use i hope you can understand how we might be concerned i teh you again inspector fisher this is bigotry in action vasquez said we run a dean shop here what do you think we are doing attempting to bring about the dominion of huitzuopochtii over angels city that was one of my major concerns but telling him so didnt seem politic i just said why dont you take us over to your flayed human skin substitute processing facil ity thafs the likeliest source of thaumaturgic pollution here i think it is a legitimate sorcerous substance permissible under the laws of the confederation vasquez said hody i repeat you are harassing chocolate weasel by singling us out bullshit i said which made him sit up straight in his chain not the first time lately id surprised somebody by not talking the way an epa inspector was supposed to i didnt care if he was hot i was steaming i went on you are not being singled out sir ive been visiting businesses that dump at devonshire for weeks now youre not being discriminated against because youre aztecian either ive hit persian places aerospace firms what have you but even you wont deny flayed human skin substitute is a dangerous substance i hope now we can do this politely on an informal level or i can go out get a warrant and turn this place inside out how do you want to play it he calmed down in a hurry somehow id thought he might he said what sort of tests do you have in mind i looked at michael he was the expert he said i intend to use the similarity test with my own piece of skin substitute to see if uncontrolled huitzilopochtlic influences are present he was going to try the same test hed used back at the dump in other words i didnt know what vasquez would say about that maybe start complaining about theological discrimination but he didnt he just got up and said come with me gentlemen i concluded he was a lot like ramzan durani of slow jinn fizz plenty of bluster when he was excited but a reasonable case of the toxic spell dump man underneath fine with me id had it up to here with arguments as soon as we left the office the racket from the mariachi minisingers came back full force that kind of music has its enthusiasts unfortunately im not any of them and the minisingers true to their alemanic ursprung gave it a slight oompah beat that did nothing to improve matters the workers on the factory floor glared at michael and me as we went by not everybody loves the epa too bad the confederation would be contaminated a lot worse than it is if we werent around squares of flayed human sidn substitute lay at the bottom of vats even though the stuff was legal it turned my stom ach michael said take one out for me please vasquez translated his request into spainish one of his men reached in and fished out a dripping sheet its darker than the substitute you have in your lot i remarked vasquez said this is the residue of the tanning baths proper cleansing will restore the usual shade michael manstein raised an eyebrow at that but he didnt say anything so i let it ride i said i trust you have proper import certificates for the flayed human sidn substitute i shall fetch diem immediately vasquez said please do not let my absence delay you in your tests he headed back toward his office michael got to work with his sheet of human sidn substi tute and the one the worker had pulled out of the vat i clutched my kabbalistic amulets i was ready for anything from his sheet of substitute starting to bleed to all hell break ing loose i was ready for what might have been worse than hell breaking loose i was ready for huitzilopochdi alive and in person and in a bad mood i wasnt sure id get out of chocolate weasel in one piece if that happened but i had a chance jorge vasquez came back while michael was still incanting he handed me the certificates id asked for sure enough they showed he was bringing in flayed human skin substitute produced by the law of similarity as certified by harry turtledove some high sorcerer down in tenochtitlan the point of origin of the stuff the certificate had aztecian export stamps and confederation import stamps right where they belonged on parchment chocolate weasel was as legal as could be thanks very much mr vasquez i said you maintain excellent documentation i have to he answered his tone bitter it is the only way i can protect myself from harassment because i am an aztecian businessman serving my people on confederation soil he was back to that song again i let it alone nothing i could say was going to make him change his mind michael spoke a last couple of magical words lifted the wet sheet of flayed human skin substitute from the one hed taken out of his little black bag no sign of bleeding he said sounding as surprised as he ever did which is to say vasquez who didnt known him well wouldnt have noticed any change in his voice i must conclude that the specimen from the vat is thaumaturgically inactive with respect to huitzflopochtli i could have told you as much vasquez said in fact i did tell you as much but you chose not to listen are you satisfied i nodded reluctantly id thought wed surely find the pot of gold at chocolate weasel which reminded me id have to do something one of these days about the study on naturaliz ing leprechauns michael said the data we have obtained leave us no reason to be dissatisfied which struck me as damning with faint praise he must have been disappointed too i presume you will have the courtesy to mention this in your written report vasquez said with icy ironic politeness i also trust you will be making that report soon i knew a hint to get out of there when i heard one id have liked to stay and snoop some more but after michael failed to find any trace of huitzilopochthc influence on the flayed human skin substitute i didnt see how i could i waited for michael to finish packing the tools of his trade then dejectedly followed vasquez back to his office in front of that office he sank another barb i hope you case of the toxic spell dump gentlemen can find your own way out good day he went inside and closed the door after him we found our own way out once again nobody up front took any interest in us except to speed us on our way i was ready to go too id had such high hopes everything would break open at chocolate weasel but what did we get there nothing the same as wed got everywhere else it wasnt just a case any more either judys life lay on the line damnation i said as we scuffed our way across the lot toward michaels carpet no sign of it there not so far as i could prove he said although so far as i know flayed human skin substitute unlike the authentic product comes in only one color and is merely toughened not darkened by the tanning process really i said thats interesting but if you found no sign of huitzilopochtii its nothing more than interesting my thought exactly he said sitting down and reaching for his safety belt a tattered old carpet on its last fringes flew slowly into the lot settled into a parking space maybe fifty feet from us the two guys on it were talking in spainish and paid us no atten tion whatever one of them wore a red cap the other a blue one that rang a vague bell in my mind but no more then the fellow in the blue cap turned his head so i got a good look at his face you dont soon forget the looks of a guy whos tried to bounce your balls it was carlos the charming chap from the swap meet and the man with him was jose they got off their carpet they didnt bother with safety belts and went on into chocolate weasel i stood there staring after them come on michael said a little querulously having failed here we may as well return to the office and more productive use of our time huh he snapped me back to myself we havent failed here your test may have but we havent he looked at me as if he had no idea what i was talking about after a moment i realized he didnt i explained rapidly finishing those are the two who sold cuauhtemoc hemandez his poison full of real human sidn and the influence of harry turtledove huitzflopochtii what are they doing at chocolate weasel if its really as legit as your test showed a cogent question but michael was frowning yet how could the similarity test i employed on the flayed human skin substitute be in error it was conducted under univer sally valid thaumaturgic law a dreadful suspicion was growing in me i didnt want to speak it out loud for fear of making it more likely to be true or maybe it was more the worry that comes out in the phrase speak of the devil i did say im not questioning su pernatural law just the assumptions you made the test under and i think i know how we can find out if im right come on what are you doing michael said but he unbuckled got off his carpet and little black bag in hand followed me across the street a salesman came up smiling when we walked into the spebs r us store me still a couple of paces in front of michael good morning sir sirs he said amending things when he realized we were together what sort of home thaumaturgics can i interest you in today i showed him my epa sigil a couple of seconds later michael got his out too he still didnt know what i was up to but hed back my play the salesman he looked like a college idd stopped smiling and looked real serious as you see were from die environmental perfection agency i said were in the middle of an investigation and we urgently need a spellchecker id like to borrow one from you and activate it for a few minutes the kid gulped i cant authorize that myself sir ib have to get the manager he fled into the employees onuf section of the store to do just that the manager looked like what his salesman would turn into in about ten years hed added a mustache to the mix and lost his zits and some callowness he listened to my story then asked are you investigating us i got that one real quick if i said yes hed say no but i could say no with a clear conscience when i did the manager led michael and me over to the display of case of the toxic spell dump spellcheckers against one wall and waved to show us we could help ourselves since money was no object i chose a fancy wmesap from crystal valley then i asked the fellow does that liquor store next door carry passover wine do you think you use that ritual do you he looked interested as if he wanted to talk shop but knew it wasnt the right time or place yes i think they would sir this part of the valley has a fairly large jewish population thank you sir i said may we use this unwrapped one here i dont want to inconvenience you any more than i have to believe me i appreciate your cooperation i turned to michael you can wait here if you like ill bring back the wine at his nod i trotted out of the spells r us sure enough the liquor store had what i was after big square bottle with a neck long enough to use as a clubhandle in a pinch label with a whitebearded rabbi a fellow who looks like the catholic conception of god the father peering out at you because its specially blessed passover wine is thaumaturgically more active than your average enspirited grape juice so its available all year round i bought a bottle of sweet concord just picking it up brought back memories of childhood seders when it was the only wine i got to taste all year and took it back to the home thaumaturgics emporium michael said if you plan to go back inside david and if your conjecture is accurate there is a significant probability that the staff will make a sizable effort to disrupt your activ ity my feeling was that there was a significant probability the chocolate weasel staff would make a sizable effort to disrupt me if i was right and never mind my activity but i said if theyre doing what i think the re doing in there i dont think well need to go back inside while we talked back and forth the salesman and spells r us manager stood off to one side listening so hard i thought theyd grow asses ears the way king midas did in the greek myth at another time or place it might have been funny harry turtledove i went outside michael following again the two guys from spells r us watched through their plateglass window i could figure out what they were thinking when they saw me point a spellchecker probe at chocolate weasel some thing on the order of whats been across the street from us for god knows how long it was a good question with luck id have a good answer soon the rich fruity smell of the passover wine came welling out of the bottle when i broke the seal i poured a capful they make the cap just the right size to hold the usual acti vating dose good ergonomics into the spellchecker receptacle and chanted the blessing no sooner had i fin ished the boray pri hagcfen and added omayn than the screen lit up with a smile the microimps inside were happy and ready but even though i aimed the probe at the chocolate weasel building the spellchecker didnt pick up anything from it it identified the magic associated with the flyway and also the crosswalk cantrips not all of which as ive noted are christian by any means i said something unfortu nate and added disgustedly youd think they didnt work any magic at all in there which we know is not the case michael said this sug gests to me that the building is shielded against probes from outside you have to be right i said but what can we do now go on in like you said if we do that were liable not to come back out again i am of the opinion that we have sufficient information to seek a warrant and let the constabulary deal with the matter from here on out michael said the staff of chocolate weasel are consorting with criminals and the buildings being so tightly sealed is suspicious in and of itself the blanking of the sorcery within goes far beyond any that would be required to prevent industrial espionage just then the front door to chocolate weasel opened and a couple of women came out no matter how good the places shielding was id already found out it wasnt case of the toxic spell dump topologically complete like the devonshire dumps i hadnt had to cross over an insulated footbridge to get in that meant influences could go out through the opening too i looked down at the ground glass on the spellchecker the microimps saw something across the street all right something they didnt like one bit words started forming unidentified forbidden i felt as if someone had poured a bucket of ice water down my back the door to chocolate weasel closed quickly and the damning words dis appeared from the ground glass but they remained imprinted on my mind id hoped never to see their like again but here they were thats the same spellchecker reaction i got when i probed the potion that curandero gave lupe cordero i said now i know why your similarity ritual failed michael i was glad i hadnt had lunch yet i might have thrown up right on the sidewalk in front of spells r us michael shook his head im afraid your logical leap went past me there you were testing for similarity to flayed human skin sub stitute i said i dont think thats substitute in there think thats real flayed human skin yes that might conceivably throw off the accuracy of the test sometimes michael is almost off in a virtuous reality of his own i suppose i shouldnt have been surprised he thought about the testing first but i was still he does con nect to the real world after a couple of seconds his eye got wide behind his spectacles dear god in heaven there are thousands of square feet of flayed human skin substitute in those vats if it is the genuine material rather than the substi tute then a lot of people have ended up dead huitzal opochth is well fed and the whole stinking world may come down on our heads i didnt realize id started spouting dog gerel till the words were out of my mouth tt is now imperative no mandatory that we notify the authorities forthwith michael said since he was right i shut down the spellchecker no doubt to the microimps relief and took it back into spells harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump r us thanks very much gentlemen i said we appreci ate the help now can you tell us where the nearest pay phone is theres one outside the golden steeples the manager answered if it hasnt been vandalized the salesman blurted but cant you tell us whafs going on tm sony i said but its against epa policy to reveal the results of an ongoing investigation as i say youve helped though leaving them frustrated we headed across mason toward the golden steeples the closer we got the less optimistic i was about finding the phone in working order the local street gangs had vandalized the building scrawling tags like huneric and tbasamund on the wall in big angular let ters graffiti are an environmental problem too one for which we dont have a good answer yet and sure enough when we came up to the pay phone i saw that somebody presumably the punk who went by that monicker had carved the name gelimer into the base of the phone and used either a tweezers or a little levitation spell to get the coins out through the narrow slits hed cut of course once he violated the integrity of the containment system the coincollecting demon was also able to escape and pay phones are rigged so their imps stay dormant unless he collects his fee the phone then might as well not have been there unless i turned to michael are you a hot enough wiz ard to get around ma bell possibly with time and equipment we lack at the moment he said finding another pay phone would be more efficient ergonomics again whether its what size to make the cap on a bottle of wine or deciding to spell or not to spell you cant get away from it lets go back to the carpet then i said were sure to pass one as we fly back to the freeway we crossed over to the chocolate weasel parking lot me i wasnt what youd cab enthusiastic about setting foot there again but i didnt feel too bad because i was doing it only to leave the place for good though i didnt really need to i picked up the map to check the route south we could either head back to win netka the way wed come and then down or else we could fly westto michael i said hoarsely i know where we can find a pay phone do you he glanced over to me i did not think you were overly familiar with this section of st ferdinands valley tm not i said but look i pointed to the map the next major flyway a couple of blocks west of where we were was sotos and the next decentsized street north ofnord hoff was plummer i know theres a pay phone there because thafs where judy called me from good heavens michael said the concatenated implications yeah i said chocolate weasel is involved in something really hideous theyre doing their best to hide if it leaks out of the devonshire dump we find out about it i find out about it i mean somebody tries to get rid of me somebody does kidnap judy and then they make her call me from a phone just around the comer from chocolate weasel since there is a phone at that location and since it was undoubtedly working as recently as last night i suggest we use it michael said he lifted the carpet off the chocolate weasel parking lot eased onto nordhoff and flew west toward sotos just getting away from chocolate weasel felt good as if i were escaping cursed ground considering what i thought was going on inside the building that might have been literally true michael turned right onto sotos and flew up to plummer the comer there had a bunch of little shops i didnt see a pay phone in front of any of them i wondered if celia chang and horace smidley had screwed up but what were the odds of their both screwing up the same way astrologi cally large i thought when a solution is not immediately apparent more harry turtledove thorough investigation is required michael said a creed which for the research thaumaturge ranked right up there with the one hammered out at nicaea he parked the carpet in front of a place whose sign had two words in the roman alphabet dvin deli and a cou ple of lines in the curious pothooks armenians use to write their language i dont read armenian myself but ive seen it often enough to recognize the script sure enough the fellow behind the counter in there looked like brother vahans younger cousin except that he sported a handlebar mustache and had a full head of wavy irongray hair god bless you what can i do for you gentlemen today he said when michael and i walked in i have some lovely lamb just in and with yogurt and mint leaves he kissed the tips of his fingers even if mixing meat and milk wasnt kosher it sounded good to me i hated to have to say im sony were just look ing for a pay phone across the street behind the camiceria next to the hanese bookstore he said pointing i dont know why they didnt put it out front but they didnt and when youve made your call why dont you come back i have figs and dates preserved in honey all kinds of good things he was a salesman and a half that one i got out of the dvin deli in a hurry before i was tempted into spending the next hour and a half there buying things i didnt need and half of which i wasnt permitted to eat the hanese bookstore also had a twoword english sign hongs books and the rest was in ideograms for a couple of seconds i didnt see the pay phone back of the aztecian meat market it was on the far side of a very fra grant trash dumpster nobody flying casually down the street would have noticed anything going on while whoever had judy made her call me the camicerias back door didnt have a window either so people in there might not have spotted anything amiss either i dug in my pocket found change and fed it into the greedy little paw of the pay phones money demon i called case of the tomc spell dump plainclothesman johnson saul klein and legate kawaguchi in that order johnson and klein werent alto gether convinced that chocolate weasel was involved in judys kidnapping though they both said die evidence was better than anything else they had kawaguchi said id handed him enough so he could give chocolate weasel a good goingover dont just send constables i warned him that place is major sorcerous trouble if you dont call out a hazardous materta magica team for it youll never ever need one i appreciate your concern inspector fisher kawaguchi said but i assure you that i shall make all necessary arrangements good day shut up and let me do my job was what he was saying i just hoped he knew the kind of trouble his people were liable to walk into at chocolate weasel after that i had to cadge some more change from michael i called bea to let her know what was going on instead of bea i got rose who told me die boss was at a meeting away from die confederal building and couldnt be reached no matter what for die next couple of hours wonderful i said listen rose dungs are liable to start felling on your head any minute now i explained how and why she just took it in stride i would have been surprised at anything less whatever needed doing shed take care of it as if bea were standing behind her giving orders were unbelievably lucky to have her and we know it when i was done she said have two important phone messages for you one is from professor blank at ucac and die odier is from a mr antanas is diat right sudakis at die devonshire dump yes antanas is right thank you rose web be back at die office soon and ib attend to the calls dien bye i said and hung up rd been meaning to call blank and i wasnt all diat surprised to hear from him first but i wondered why he said it was urgent for me to call him back nothing about his investigation of the chumash powers had been urgent up till now and i wondered what had bitten tony on die backside harry turtledove just my luck to be out of the office when two important calls came in michael said before we leave this site i suggest that you examine it most carefully i would be willing to wager the cbi has tried already but if you find anything here which you can identify as belonging to mistress adier the law of contagion may enable us or the constabulary or the cbi to trace her present whereabouts no guarantees of course sorcerous countermeasures having become so effective these days but a chance nonetheless so i looked god did i look leaving something behindwas just the sort of thing judy would have done if she got the chance anything to give us a better shot at finding her i went down on my hands and knees and pawed through weeds and pebbles like a wino after a lost quartercrown hoping praying shed managed to drop a button or something no luck all i got was the knees of my pants dirty finally i admitted it even to myself sony michael but acres nothing here in the adventure stories people always man age to leave a clue while the bad guys arent watching i guess it doesnt work that way in real life it would appear not to he agreed this is my first encounter with a situation which might reasonably fall into that category so my experience is as limited as yours i sus pect however that if real criminals made as many errors as those in adventure stories virtue would triumph in the real world more often than it does i suspect youre right i said glumly brushing at my trousers some of die dirt looked to be there to stay i sighed feeling useless and also irrationally as if id let judy down lets head back to the office then were wasting time here from what rose said ive had a couple of calls that need answering right away i also have other work upon which i could be usefully engaged michael said that made me feel bad all over again i hadnt even asked him what i was disrupting by dragging him up to the valley again and again but he went on seeking information which will aid in the rescue of your fiancee necessarily takes priority over other concerns case of the toxic spell dump thank you michael i said as we walked back to his car pet his glance over at me was puzzled as if he wondered what i was hanking him for maybe he did he thinks so well that i sometimes wonder about the rest of his spirit i noticed that he flew down sotos to the freeway instead of going back to winnetka with michael i think it was gust for die sake of greater efficiency id have done die same diing but not on account ofdiafc i just wouldnt have wanted to swing back any closer to chocolate weasel dian i had to when we got back to die confederal building i bought somediing allegedly edible from die cafeteria while i fought it down i kept diinldng about lamb widi yogurt and mint leaves sinful as bacon for me but it sounded delicious all die same and candied dates then widi my fireplace full of fuel and widi a heartburn to prove it i went to my office and picked up die phone professor blank sounded blunter dian phone imps could normally account for when he answered die phone so i fig ured id caught him at lunch twice running and probably a brown bag one ucac boasts better eateries dian we have here which meant he was eidier tight widi a crown or else dedicated to what he was doing id been willing to give him die benefit of die doubt even before he said im so glad you returned my call inspector fisher ive been waiting here at my desk hoping you would i just now got in i answered starting to feel guilty because id eaten lunch before i called him back rose our secretary said it was urgent so youre die first call ive made that at least was true whats up trust you will recall he began which meant he didnt trust any such diing diat when we last spoke i was uncer tain whedier die chumash powers were extinct or had so to speak encysted diemselves on die odier side abandoning all contact widi this side for an indefinite period perhaps in die hope of being lured back here should more worshipers appear to propitiate diem he hadnt said all that when we talked before some of it he must have worked out since dien but he had said enough harry turtledove of it to let me answer yes i remember that do you know which is true now the latter im afraid he said and i mean that in the most literal sense of the word id figured it was the latter having learned that the chu mash powers were in fact extinct wouldnt have been news urgent enough for him to haunt his office waiting for me to call back but i hadnt though even finding them active would be frightening whats to be afraid of i asked the powers are indeed encysted new regression analysis establishes that beyond any statistical or theological doubt he said but ifs a topologlcally unusual spherical encyst ment are you aware inspector that the surface of a sphere can be continuously deformed until it is inside out well no i said what does that have to do with the chumash powers ifs a good approximation of what those powers seem to have done on the other side he answered as i said in our earlier conversation they seem to taawe taken a hole and pulled tt in afterward apparently leaving nothing behind something he said there made a bell toll in my mind but be fore i could figure out what it was he went on the problem from our point of view is that the powers if my calculations are correct can reverse their encystment and burst out violently at any time they choose violently i echoed how violently crystalball prognostications vary the scenario is unique and so many of my parameters are uncertain he said if however they release maximum magical energy the effects on the surrounding area will be somewhere between those of a megasalamander ignition just above it and an earth quake oh approximately on the order of magnitude of the one that hit the city of sfc francis in the eariy years of this century the effects will be different you understand be cause theyll be primarily thaumaturgic rather than physical but the size of the event will be more or less in that range esus i said which shows how acculturated i am fool ishly i added no wonder they didnt want to bother making rain case of the toxic spell dump no wonder at all inspector professor blank said nei ther i nor my staff have been able to determine where the interface between the chumash powers encystment and this side is presently located we would have expected it to be in the extreme northwest of the barony of angels for that was formerly chumash territory but as i say we have not succeeded in detecting it i hope that with your greater resources the environmental perfection agency will do what we have not accomplished good day he hung up on me i wanted to loll him hello here comes a catastrophe ive found out ifs on the way but i cant deal with it all up to you dave good luck pal thats what was left at the bottom of the alembic in my nose it smelled like old catbox instead of committing murder i called tony sudalds he didnt sound as if id caught him at lunch but he had some thing in common with professor blank anyhow he sounded scared dave its you perkunas and the nine suns im glad to hear from you you know that thing i mean that nothing you spotted in the containment area its going through some changes and i dont like em even a little bit changes what land of changes i asked thinking i didnt need one more thing to worry about on top of every thing professor blank had just dumped on me well for one thing you can notice the effect from any where along the safety walk now and i can see it from die roof of my office too eerie if you ask me but theres worse i can feel something starting to build over there even through the wardspells like die worlds gonna turn inside out any minute now its bad i dont even know if die outer con tainment wall will hold dlis one and if it doesnt he let it hang diere i gulped i didnt like die way it sounded not even slighdy what have you done so far i asked ive called for a swat team but a lot of diose are busy somewhere else he answered i had a hunch i knew where too dneywere taking down chocolate weasel tony went on i called you for two reasons you were die guy who spotted die nodiing in die first place and die wizard you had widi harry turtledove you seems pretty sharp man i teb you i think i need ab the help i can get on this one td get michael web be there as fast as we can fly i promised then something sudakis had said really hit me i echoed it inside out whafs that tony said listen if you and your buddy manstein dont get here in a hurry there may not be any here to get to you know what i mean inside out i repeated tony didnt you say the stuff in that zone came from the beach up in malibu yeah he said so way up at the northwest edge of the barony of angels right yeah he said again what are you flying at dave get a hazmat team there right now i said fear knotting my belly i thought i knew why professor blanks grad stu dents hadnt found the chumash powers encystment site where they thought it was supposed to be tve been hying to tony protested they wont listen to me teb em the guy who tipped em to chocolate weasel says this is liable to be a thousand times worse teb em that use my name theyll come ab right you know whats going on even through the phone imps he sounded accusing im afraid i do im coming anyway i hung up on him for a change then i ran down the hall yebing for michael like a man possessed he listened to me for fifteen seconds tops grabbed his black bag and sprinted for the slide me right behind him we piled onto his carpet and hightailed it back to st ferdinands valley knowing what we were head ing for i wished we were flying the other way x harry turtledove when he was good and ready he delivered his verdict i mean it just like that he really sounded magisterial there is i believe much truth in the view you express the great european theological and economic expansion of the past five hundred years coupled with the enormous growth of thaumaturgic knowledge that spearheaded among other things the industrial revolution has indeed had a profound impact on both the politics and thecology of the rest of the world i can hardly be surprised to leam that longestablished powers chafing under the pressure of europeanimposed belief structures imposed by supe rior military and magical force are actively seeking to overwhelm that force you mean you approve i stared at him that is not what i said he answered more sharply than usual i said i am not surprised that the powers and pre sumably the peoples who reverence them seek to regain their former prominence i did not say i wished them suc cess in that effort such success would be the greatest disaster the world has ever known or so i believe at any rate you get no argument from me i said i had not expected you to disagree he said you have a reasonable amount of sense by all appearances i wanted to reach over and pat him on the knee why michael i didnt know you cared i said from his point of view hed just given me the accolade and i knew it facetiousness aside he amended i just grinned he ignored that and went on let us take the americas for instance they being the most dearcut examples of a massive human and thecological transformation in the past semimillenium okay take the americas i said agreeably gesturing to show he was welcome to them truth was as long as i was schmoozing with michael i didnt have to think about either judy or the likelihood that armageddon was liable to come bubbling out of a toxic spells dump michael gave me a severe look facetiousness aside i said case of the toxic spell dump sorry i told him you were saying nothing of great complexity nothing in fact that should not be obvious to any reasonably objective observer that we immigrants have done more and better with this land in the past five hundred years than its native peoples would have accomplished during the same period nothing that isnt obvious eh i said grinning wickedly plenty of people natives and immigrants both id use your phrase why not would say youve just committed blasphemy that weve done nothing but slaughter and pol lute in what was for all practical purposes paradise on earth i find only one technical term appropriate to use in response to that viewpoint bullshit michael delivered his technical term with great relish i am not saying that slaughter did not take place i am not denying that we pol lute working as i do for the environmental perfection agency how could i i do deny however that this was in a manner of speaking government work for the earthly paradise careful how you talk there i said you work for the government yourself remember michael refused to be distracted leaving aside the habits of the natives of the islands off the coast whose tribal name gave english the word cannibal the two most prominent cultures in the americas five hundred years ago were the aztecs also cannibals who fueled themselves both theologically and in terms of protein through human sacrifice and the incas whose theology was benign enough but who regimented themselves more thoroughly than the ukrainians would have tolerated before their latest crisis youre hitting below the belt talking about peoples who didnt live in whats now the confederation i protested what about the noble warriors and hunters of the great plains well what about them he asked the culture they now revere and think of as ancient did not exist and could not have existed before the coming of the europeans because their own ancestors had hunted the american horse harry turtledove to extinction hardly good environmental management in my opinion and the firearms they used to defend their terri tory bravely against encroaching whites were all bought or stolen from those same whites because they did not know how to make them for themselves whoa there i held up a hand blaming people for not having skills isnt fair and the whites who took the land away from the natives werent what youd call saints conquest by firewater deliberately spread smallpox and mass exorcisms of the native powers isnt anything to be proud of youre right he said but if europeans had not found the americas until for example the day before yesterday they would not have found them much different from the way they were five hundred years ago and that is precisely the point i am trying to make thanks to modem thauma turgy our present culture supports far more people at a higher level of affluence and greater material comfort than any other in the history of the world is that all you judge culture by i asked seems to me there should be more to life oh no doubt but make note of this david as a general rule not universal i concede but general the people who show the greatest contempt for material comforts are those lucky enough to have them the abyssinian peasant starving in his droughtstricken field the canaanite cobbler suffering under a plague of gnats because no local sorcerer knows enough to properly control beelzebub the slumdweller in dstc aching with a rotten tooth because her parents hadnt had the crowns to go to an odontomagus to affix the usual invisible shields to her mouth they will not speak slightingly of the virtues of a full beby and a healthy body things we take for granted despite their being historically rare wait a minute michael you just cheated there you were talking about how wonderful our culture is and then one of your suffering examples comes straight out of our own slums you cant have it both ways he didnt answer for a few seconds he was getting the carpet off the freeway once hed done that though he said case of the toxic spell dump i fail to see why not i never claimed we were perfect per fection is an attribute of the divine not the human i said that on the whole we do better for more people than any one else has our flaws notwithstanding i hold to that position i thought about it the only times id ever been hungry were at yom kippur fasts and those i undertook for the sake of ritual not because i had no food i slept in a flat on a bed i was protected against diseases and curses that had lain whole nations waste in ancient times i said you have a point the other thing was the chumash powers and the aztedans wanted to restore the unpleasant old days the trouble with that was that most of the millions of people in the barony of angels liked the new days better what would happen to them my limited acquaintance with the chu mash powers didnt make me think they were that ferocious but huitzilopochtii the chumash powers must have cut a deal with the aztedan war god i realized i tried to imagine the secret dealings that must have happened on the other side huitz ilopochtii was a much bigger fish than the sky coyote the lizard or the demons of the lower world but they were extra powerful here because the barony of angels was their native territory the combination could prove deadly i reached that unpleasant conclusion about the time mi chael pulled into the parking lot across the flyway from the devonshire dump to my relief three or four blackand whites were already there their synchronized salamander lanterns flashing red and blue people were standing on the sidewalk rubbernecking the way they always do when something goes wrong over on the dump side of the street a couple of constables were laying down the ritual yellow tape that keeps rubbemeckers from getting too close to the action michael and i hurried across the constables saw our epa sigils and demystified a stretch of tape so we could cross the line did you get a hazmat team here i asked one of them harry turtledove yeah we did he said i thought they had there were more blackandwhites in the parking lot than constables outside the dump but while his partner put the magic back into the hne the fellow went on the guy who runs the dump tried to get an epa hazmat team too but it was already on an urgent call worse luck luck had nothing to do with it id told kawaguchi he was liable to need that team at chocolate weasel and he was god knows but tony sudakis was liable to need it here too no magic yet has made people able to be two places at the same time theyre working on it i understand with thau matechnology based on what theyve learned with ectoplasmic cloning but so far it happens only in lightand magic shows and sorcerous fiction stories too bad boy could we have used it the security guard recognized michael and me without being asked he brought out the footbridge so we could cross into the containment area as soon as we did he yanked it away as fast as he could in principle that was smart you didnt want to weaken the magical containment scheme in any way in practice i was afraid it would do about as much good as sunglasses under the megasalamander blast profes sor blank had mentioned about three steps down the warded path that led to tony sudakis office i stopped dead in my tracks tony hadnt been kidding you could see the nothing from anywhere on the walkway now you felt that if you leaned forward you might fall straight toward it forever and hed been right about the feeling that pervaded the dump too it was as if the nothing were an egg quivering on the verge of hatching but that wasnt the only thing that made me stop and stare the constables from the hazardous materia magica team werent working only from the warded path theyd actually gone into the dump itself to come to grips with the nothing sure they knew what they were doing sure they were draped with so many different kinds of apotropaic amulets that they looked like perambulating christmas trees sure case of the toxic spell dump their shoes had coldiron soles to insulate them from the thaumaturgic vileness that littered the place all the same they put their souls on the line not just their soles i wouldnt have gone out there for a million crowns for judy yes without a second thought if you dont know what really matters to you why bother living tony sudalds was up on the roof of his office he saw michael and me waved and disappeared a minute later he came pounding down the path toward us he had a hard hat on his head his cravat was loosened and his collar open he was a foreman again not an administrator and looked as if he loved it glad you got here he said dave on the phone you sounded like you know more about this shit than maybe any body you want to brief yolanda there he pointed up ahead to one of the hazmat team people up till then i hadnt noticed the boss of the team was a woman she was black slim maybe my age not half bad though she looked both too smart and too tough to be model pretty i told her what i knew about the chumash powers and what id heard from professor blank not an hour earlier when i was through she crossed herself what are we sup posed to do then she said this is worse than were really set up to face maybe a military team would be a better bet to resist doubt that michael put in military teams are config ured against specific security threats persian aztecian ukrainian but the chumash till this moment have never posed a danger to the confederation warrior priests and the like wib not be able to help us yolanda scowled you could tell she was the kind of person who wanted to get right in there and do things then worry about consequences later what do the two of you recom mend then she demanded do as weu as you can was the answer that immediately sprang to mind if the chumash powers remanifested themselves with the burst of thaumaturgic energy professor blank had feared there was nothing else to do and even that harry turtledove wouldnt help but you always have to play the game as if you think youre going to win which when you get down to it is also part of dying well so i said delay every second we keep that nothing encysted buys us time to evacuate the neighborhood it may not help but then again it may tony i presume you have procedures in place for an emergency evacuation sure he said youd better implement them then epa orders if you like you got it boss he went back to his office on the dead run if his procedures were like most peoples hed have a bunch of spells completed but for the last word or pass or whatever so he could but them into effect one after another bangbang bang sure enough maybe thirty seconds later we heard a dreadful cacophony from the cacodemons mounted at each comer of the containment fence it reminded me fittingly enough of the air raid warnings that would help mark die start of the third sorcerous war after theyd screeched for a while the cacodemons started yelling evacuate the area evacuate the area con tamination may escape from the devonshire containment site evacuate the area then they shouted what i think was the same thing only in spainish they were loud enough to be heard for miles that was why they were there but they made talk inside the contain ment area just about impossible for anybody who wasnt an accomplished lipreader i was sure my ears would ring for the next couple of days assuming i was still around in a couple of days michael stuck his head next to mine bawled in my ear delay is all very well but to the end futile sooner or later probably sooner the chumash powers will succeed in breaking free of their encystment and returning to this side with the accompanying energy release you have described he turned his head so i could yell into his ear it was my turn after all yell i did i know but well get some people case of the toxic spell dump away so when the great eagle and die lizard and rest get out diey wont do die damage diey want to i turned my head michael shouted possibly not the damage diey do inflict however will be more dian adequate to satisfy anyone not im sure he kept talking after diat but i stopped hearing him i was running for tony sudalds office as fast as my legs would cany me he was coming out as i dashed in he might as wed have been phyuis kaminsky i almost bowled him over phone i said panting inside die blockhouse die noise from die ca codemons was just too loud not deafening sure go ahead he followed me back up die hall i made my call talked for maybe a minute and a half hung up when i was done tony stared at me bigeyed you drink diafll work he asked unwontecdy quiet let me put it dlis way i answered if it doesnt do you think diese concrete blocks are going to save us he shook his head i went on i dont eidier the hazmat mages out diere wib delay all diey can but how long is diat sooner or later probably sooner i realized i was echoing michael die chumash powers wttl break out and when they do bend over and loss your bum goodbye yeah sudalds said how much time do you drink diey need to buy i just dont know i answered burbank isnt far but i dont know how much prep diey have to do first ab we can do now is wait and hope we walked back out into die unbelievable din togedier i bawled into michaels ear tony yelled into yolandas no question he got die better half of diat deal michael shouted back at me not die best chance but i see none better then he walked over to scream presumably die same dring at tony i wish i had your connections yolanda shouted at me i wish i didnt have diem i answered because diat would mean dris miserable case never happened she nodded grimly we all stared toward die east like die kings of orient widi somebody extra thrown in for luck trouble was all die luck in this case had been bad i tfiought about poor litde jesus cordero seeing if die harry turtledove slow jinn fizz jinnetic engineering techniques could make him a soul hadnt seemed urgent he was just a baby after all years and years would go by before he had to worry about forever vanishing from the scheme of things thats what id thought but if the chumash powers burst forth hed be gone for good not even limbo just gone out in the dump one of the hazmat mages crumpled like soggy parchment i couldnt tell whether the toxic spell residues had overcome him or whether hed just broken under the burden of delaying the burst yolanda leaped off the warded path and dragged him back toward its very tenuous safety one he was back on the path he pulled himself into fetal position and lay there shivering sorcerous shock of some kind sure enough he was breathing and he nodded his head when yolanda shouted at him so he wasnt critical since he wasnt the rest of us kept looking eastward either wed be saved in which case we could treat the hazmat mage later or we wouldnt in which case nothing we did for him now would matter anyway i preferred the first choice but wouldnt have bet any thing big on getting it suddenly tony sudakis finger stabbed out isnt that he didnt go on maybe for fear his words would induce it not to be i dont think it is i yelled hard to sound bitter when youre yelling but i managed more likely to be a big cargo carpet on me landing approach toward burbank airport we all watched for another couple of seconds tony shook his head a carpet heading into burbank would be getting smaller this is getting bigger so it is michael said he forgot to yell but i read his lips when michael forgets to do something he should you know hes under strain we all were i didnt want to think he was right just because that would have made getting my hopes dashed all the crueler but after another few seconds there could be no doubt the speck in the air we were watching swelled out of speck dom far faster than any carpet could have and it didnt have case of the toxic spell dump a carpefs shape either i saw great wings beat majestically the garuda bird i shouted with all my heart and with ad my soul and with all my might as the bible says the bird came on unbelievably fast two or three more flaps and it was hovering over the dump of course it didnt need to work its wings the way a merely material creature of flesh and feathers would have the other side suffused it it was after all an avatar of vishnu as matt arnold had said back at the loki works it couldnt have flown or existed at all as a material creature when it hovered above the dump its wings spanned the entire width of the containment area and more and cast the ground into shadow almost as deep as night it looked much like die poster in arnolds office those incredible wings supporting a hugechested body that didnt look birdlike at all to my mind nor was its head anything like that of a natural bird but for the hooked beak that took the place of nose and mouth the rest especially the eyes looked more nearly human and the feathers on top of its head instead of being peacockbrilliant tike those of die body and wings were black and soft like hair the wings beat again right over our heads the blast of wind from a flap like that should have blown walls down and blown dust motes like us into the next barony but it didnt after a moment i realized why since it flew more by magic than with its wings their flapping was just a symbolic act not quite a real one and thank god for that it wasnt something fd worried about when i called matt arnold the garuda bird threw back its anthropomorphic head and let out a bellow that sounded like a tuba about the size of a city block played by a mad giant wfaod quit halfway through his first tuba lesson let me put it like this by com parison the squalling cacodemons were quiet and melodious one thing or rather two sets of things thoroughly orni thomorphic about the garuda bird were its talons in fact it was the most talented bird id ever seen those enormous gleaming daws could have punctured the midgard serpent by the look of them i would have paid a harry turtledove good many crowns to watch that fight from a safe distance say the surface of the moon now as the bird hovered over the devonshire dump its left foot closed on die nothing the hazmat mages pelted back out of the way i found i was holding my breath this was something else i hadnt had figured when i called arnold was the garuda birds magic strong enough to pene trate the encystment the chumash powers had thrown up around themselves if not well if not i told myself we werent any worse off than we would have been without the bird when the garuda birds talons struck the nothing sparks flew but the talons didnt go in i was praying and cursing at the same time both as hard as i could the garuda bird bel lowed again this time in fury i staggered wondering if the top of my head would fall off and whether id ever hear again the muscles in the garuda birds monster drumsticks bunched thafs what i saw anyhow though i knew it was only a quasiphysical manifestation like the birds flapping wings what it meant was that on the other side the garuda bird was gathering all its thaumaturgic force its claws closed on the nothing once more more sparks flew the bird cried out yet again but its talons still would not penetrate i thought we were doomed but then ever so slowly the needle tips of those immense claws began sinking into the chumash powers shell of withdrawal ton s mouth was wide open so were michaels and yolandas and mine we were all shouting for all we were worth but i couldnt hear any of us not even me the garuda birds feet disappeared into nothing you couldnt see them they were just gone i stopped shout ing my heart went into my mouth the garuda bird wasnt a power that had had to hide itself away to keep from going extinct the belief of hundreds of millions of people fueled it never in my most dreadful nightmares had i imagined that it wouldnt be able to overcome the chumash powers that hid inside the nothing if once it broke their shell the birds next roar carried a note of pain it flapped its case of the toxic spell dump wings again almost a real flap this time for dust rose in a choking cloud from the dry dirt of the dump through the dust i saw more of the garuda birds leg than i had before its coming out i cried coughing another flap more dust still another wingbeafc then with a pop in my head that felt like the psychic equivalent of the one youd make by sticking your finger into your mouth against the inside of your cheek its feet came all the way out of the nothing in its daws writhed the lizard yolanda grabbed me and kissed me on the cheek a good thing she did too because tony sudakis slapped my back so hard i might have staggered off the warded path and into the dump if she hadnt been holding on to me no matter how joyful he was michael manstein didnt do things like slapping people on the back he shouted bril liantly reasoned david the similarity between lizards and snakes was enough to touch off the garuda buds instinctive antipathy yeah i said which i admit wasnt a fitting response to praise like that but i was too busy watching the fight above my head to get out more than the one word the chumash lizard was an alligator lizard the size of the biggest anaconda you ever saw if you live in angels city you know about alligator lizards the re the most common kind of lizard around here the material ones can get more than a foot long with yellowish bellies and dirtbrown backs striped with black for critters their size they have large sharp teeth the ones on the chumash lizard looked to be a couple of inches long and it had a whole mouthful of them alligator lizards also have little short legs which makes them look even more ophidian than most lizards theyre related to glass snakes which arent snakes but lizards with no legs at all my guess my hope was that that would just make the garuda bird madder the lizard made horrible hissing noises and bit at the garuda birds legs however huge and fierce it was though it had no more chance against the bird than an ordinary alli gator lizard would have against an eagle that decided to have a reptilian lunch harry turtledove crunch with a noise like a monster cleaver biting into a side of beef the garuda bird bit off the lizards head and about the front third of its body ichor spattered down all over the dump luckily it didnt splash any of us talk about your hazardous materia magica the chumash lizards body convulsed and thrashed even more wildly than before even material lizards are hard to kill lizards that are also powers but all the thrashing didnt stop the garuda bird from gulping down the rest of the lizard michael tapped me on the shoulder i believe you may now definitively declare one chumash power extinct he yelled you know what i yelled back i dont miss it a bit dreadful thing for an epa man to say isnt it i find myself less scandalized than i might be under other circumstances michael said with another earsplittmg bellow the garuda bird tried to poke its clawed feet into the nothing again it was hard work but the bird didnt have to back up and make a second effort slowly but surely talons toes and feet sank into the chumash powers sphere of encyshnent and disappeared the bird let out a painfilled screech like the one it had made when it seized the lizard it started flapping its wings again in that halfmaterial way it had used to force itself out of the nothing feet toes talons reemerged and then with another of those psychic pop s the garuda bird was free once more it didnt come out of the nothing emptyfooted either its claws held what the chumash called the great eagle i will admit a golden eagle with a body the size of a siberian tigers is pretty great under other circumstances as mi chael had put it up against the garuda bird the chumash eagle might as web have been a sparrow the eagle unlike the lizard didnt try to fight it wrig gled twisted broke free and streaked for the sky i feared it would get away it seemed so much more graceful in the air than the ponderous garuda bird but the contest wasnt only or even mostly bird body against bird body it was case of the toxic spell dump magic against magic too and the garuda bird had not only its native indian potency but also all the souping up the lold kobold works had given its sorcerous systems it didnt just fly it was destined for space it shot after the eagle faster than the eye could follow high in the sky the eagle tried to dodge if it couldnt flee the garuda bird maybe it could outjink it but no one of those immense feet closed on it and this time there was no escape i heard a despairing shriek fade and die hover ing above the dump the garuda bird devoured its prey a couple of big feathers came spiraling down into the contain ment area all that was left of the chumash eagle well have to decontaminate those yolanda said as soon as you do theres another chumash power that wont show up in the barony of angels again i said as an epa inspector i felt bad about that as somebody who was wondering whether hed still be alive five minutes from now i figured id worry about the longterm consequences of the great eagles demise later if there was a later high overhead the garuda bird let out a roar that made all its earlier cries seem like whispers it folded its wings and stooped like a hawk onto the nothing i braced myself use lessly i knew when that bulk hit the earth wouldnt just shake it would quake san andreas notwithstanding a split second before the birds talons seized the nothing another psychic pop sounded in my head this one bigger than the other two put together the talons closed on empty air the nothing was gone somehow sorcerously of course but dont ask me about the kobold works proximity spells because i dont know from nothin the bird stopped in midair without touching the ground i looked out at the far wall of the devonshire dump and it seemed only as far away as it should have the sense of the imminent immanence of something eminently dreadfuls becoming dreadfully evident was gone too i looked over at tony sudalds i think you can tell the cacodemons to shut up i yelled at him he flipped me a salute casual but i thought not faked and trotted back toward his office as he did so the harry turtledove garuda bird rose into the air and headed east back toward burbank that took more weight off my mind my guess was that the bird would have stayed around had it sensed any remaining trouble just the same i walked over to the spot on the path from which id first noticed the nothing a million years ago thats what it felt like anyhow i wasnt quite there yet when the cacodemons closed their mouths sudden silence hit me as hard as the squalls of alarm had before i knew just where that spot was now i looked out across the weedstrewn dirt toward the nothing and saw nothing i was never so glad not to capitalize an n in my whole life i think theyre gone i said words which ranked right up there with the first dme i told judy i love you i believe you are correct michael said what we sensed in my opinion was the chumash powers abandoning any contact with this side to keep the garuda bird from reaching into their encystment dragging them out one by one and destroying them thaumaturgic analysis will even tually confirm or refute this but it is a tenable working hypothesis im with you yolanda said if they went away like that they wont be back she wiped her forehead with a sleeve im not sure she really grasped just how bad a hazmat shed helped hold at bay but none of what her team did for a living was easy perkunas and the nine suns i hope not tony sudakis clutched his amber amulet in one beefy fist let me use your phone one more time i asked him ill call professor blank at ucac hes been running a study for me to find out whether the chumash powers really have become extinct i think we can safely say two of them have but hed be the best fellow to evaluate whats become of the others be my guest sudalds waved me toward the blockhouse it wouldnt have done a bit of good against what had almost come forth from the dump but suddenly it looked strong and secure again i got hold of blank he was still in his office wondering i case of the toxic spell dump suppose whether the building was going to collapse around him when i told him what had happened at the dump he let out a sigh of relief so heartfelt even phone imps couldnt spoil it then promised to send his research team out as fast as carpets could get from ucac to chatsworth since it was heading into late afternoon that wouldnt be any too fast but the urgency level had gone down too then i called legate kawaguchi to see how the consta bles were doing at chocolate weasel him i didnt get instead some other constable bawled in my ear you cant talk to him bud whoever you are hes down at the war and im headin that way myself he hung up with a crash that that phone imps did an uncanny job of reproducing that sent me out of tonys office on the run i filled him in on what blank had said then passed on the rest of the word to michael the only thing that can mean is chocolate weasel i think i said wed better get over there as fast as we can i concur michael said yolanda her last name i finally had the chance to notice on her badge was simmons said wheres this chocolate weasel place sounds like we might do some good there too your team is welcome to follow my carpet michael said will the health of the gentleman who collapsed suffice for the venture im okay the gentleman said and sat up to try to prove it he still didnt look okay but he was game anyhow all the stuff in here just overloaded my protective systems for a minute there its liable to be worse at chocolate weasel i said but he shook his head he didnt think it was possible i envied him his innocence the security guard put down the footbridge for us and we trooped out then the fellow took off his uniform cap and bowed which made me feel great the guard might not have know whod done what but summoning the garuda bird wasnt something you could ignore thanks to the cacodemons announcing an emergency harry turtledove evacuation traffic around the dump was unbelievably snarled we passed chocolate weasels address on to the hazmat team and followed them instead of the other way round they had constabulary lanterns on their carpets which helped move people out of their way about halfway to chocolate weasel we met headon a rush away from that area i gulped remembering what the constable whod answered kawaguchis phone had said about a war maybe he hadnt been exaggerating a constable in full combat gear material and thaumatur gic was turning back traffic heading in chocolate weasels direction the hazmat teams lanterns got them through yolandas shouted encouragement and our epa sigils did the job for us you know michael i said just once today id like to fly away from the scene of a disaster i have considerable sympathy for this point of view he answered however yeah i said when duty cabs youd better do it doing it and liking it though were not the same critter when yolanda asked another constable exactly where we were going he directed her to a command post at the comer of nordhotf and sotos the reason that was the command post i discovered when we followed her there was that it was as close to chocolate weasel as you could get without being in immediate danger of getting yourself messily lolled sure enough legate kawaguchi was there in uniform and helmet not constabulary department standard issue but samuraistyle with the man of his clan affixed to the forehead to help protect him against malignant magic he didnt act surprised to see me good afternoon inspector fisher i must admit you were not in error con cerning the nature of that building ahead he pointed east i looked that way myself a thin column of smoke rose from the chocolate weasel facility tell me thafs not what im afraid it is i said to kawaguchi i wish i could he answered they are tearing the hearts from victims and kindling fires in their chests we face case of the toxic spell dump the apparition not only of huitzilopochtii but also of hue hueteoti the fire god in proper aztedan ritual that practice occurs only at the completion of the five empty days between the end of one year and the start of the next michael said as if objecting not so much to the slaughter as to its taking place outside canonical limits sometimes he can be quite exasperating kawaguchi said my guess is that the re going outside the usual pattern to try to bring the powers to full potency outside their native land michael said grudgingly yes i suppose such a proce dure might be efficacious it remains most irregular however you see what i mean where are they getting their victims i asked to me that was more important than whether they were following all their own rules for the sacrificial rites i thought about the two guys at the spells r us place whod let me borrow the spellchecker i thought about them spreadeagled on an altar with their chests hacked open i wanted to be sick resistance backed by thaumaturgy of a high order began as soon as our first units responded into the parking lot kawaguchi answered my best guess is that several employ ees volunteered to become the initial victims to trigger their powers presence here again this seems likely michael agreed i nodded too kawaguchi probably had the right of it despite his curiously bloodless way of describing sacrifices of the bloodiest sort but constables who see so much blood in their work need to ward themselves from the reality of what they do with mildseeming words after all words have power too then something else occurred to me you said those were the initial victims have there been more unfortunately yes an unknowable but large number kawaguchi said because of the strength of the powers evoked within the chocolate weasel building we have been compelled to draw back our lines several times the perpe trators have taken advantage of this to raid surrounding businesses and homes we do not know the precise status of harry turtledove all individuals captured but some will almost certainly have been employed to nourish huitzflopochdi and hue hueteod i thought about some poor lunk whose stomach decided to growl while he was flying up nordhoff hed spot die golden steeples pub in grab himself a burger and end up with his stillbeating heart torn out of his body just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time youd have to be a very thoroughgoing calvinist to find the mark of divine plan in that then i had a worse thought much worse id been acting on the assumption that the people from chocolate weasel had something to do with kidnapping judy if she was hidden away somewhere in the building when the constables flew into the lot god forbid i whispered i tried not to think about it to tell myself it was impossible but i knew too well it wasnt just then the roof of the building that housed chocolate weasel started burning a lot brighter it wasnt an ordinary flame it wasnt even like the flame from a salamander which is powered from the other side but manifests itself here this flame you didnt just see you felt it in the place where prayers come from i close my eyes but that didnt help my soul still felt scorched huehueteod legate kawaguchi and michael said in the same breath quietly michael added one must con clude that the sacrifices within the building have reached a critical mass allowing him to manifest himself fully in angels city i wonder how long we have to wait for huitzilopochtii i said numbly he being a greater power more sacrifice will be neces sary to bring him onto this side michael answered hueheuteods manifestation however will only speed his translation from the aztecian gods realm on the other side to our present location thanks for the encouragement i said michael gave me a puzzled look then recognized irony and nodded the flames on the roof leapt higher after some delay case of the toxic spell dump thick smoke began to rise as real flames joined the spectral ones emanating from huehueteod i wondered how the people inside the chocolate weasel building were faring now that it burned around them maybe huehueteod protected them from the flames so they could go on sacrificing or maybe theyd just keep doing what they were doing until they burned to death every faiui has its martyrs willing even eager to die for the greater glory of the powers they reverence i wished the aztecians would have shown their piety another way kawaguchi was shouting into a constabularymodel eth emet set it held two different imps so he could both send and receive messages he looked toward the burning build ing dien to michael and me are you gentlemen familiar widi the hanese ideogram for the term crisis i am michael said i might have guessed he would be he went on it combines the ideograms for danger and opportunity kawaguchi looked surprised and maybe a little disap pointed thata pale blond chap had stepped on his lines but he nodded and said exactly so and developments here have now reached die crisis stage if in the next few minutes huitdlopochdi succeeds in manifesting himself as dior oughlyas huehueteod has that was die danger all right if it happened angels city was in more trouble dian it had ever known the only prob lem was i didnt see any sign of the opportunity i have been in touch with the archdiocese of angels city kawaguchi said they will do what they can for us an acute strategic move legate michael said nodding in approval the power based at rome successfully over came diose centered on tenochtidan almost five hundred years ago widi luck it will do so again alevai i said a most uncatholic endorsement of his sentiment but i didnt stop worrying or even slow down the spainish whod brought christianity to aztecia were fanatics nothing else but diey had to be or else they never would have tried it but over the years die church has harry turtledove turned fat and lazy and rich and comfortable the fanatics were in the chocolate weasel building now doing their best to fuel the revival of the old aztecian gods balance of powers i thought and shivered what are we waiting for i asked kawaguchi exorcists to come and try to drive huitzilopochtii back to the other side before he can fully establish himself here the constable you will have gathered was a worn dour fellow now he surprised me with a walltowall smile the response the cardinal offered me was nowhere near so half hearted i wished he hadnt said halfhearted not when you thought about how huitzilopochtii and huehueteod were being summoned into angels city but the cardinal that stiff necked erseman id thought he was on the fanatical side when he refused to grant the burned thomas brothers monks a dispensation for cosmetic sorcery most of the time i still thought that kind of fanaticism out of place in our century but right this minute it might end up saving all our asses and maybe our souls too kawaguchi kept watching the sky had quetzalcoad shown any sign of manifesting himself along with the other aztecian powers i would have tried to get hold of burbank again to see what the garuda bird could do against the feathered serpent as things were though i didnt see how the bird could help i wondered what kawaguchi was waiting for whatever it was i hoped it would be good and powerful something nasty something else nasty i mean was going to happen inside that building any minute now i could feel it coming in the same part of the inner me that felt the growing pres ence of huehueteod like a bad sunburn suddenly kawaguchi pointed i spotted a flying carpet way above the usual flyways and ignoring their traffic grid as if it didnt exist maybe it had a constabulary clearance that overcame all the antiflying invocations that gave peo ple and business their privacy or maybe it was under the control of a higher power case of the toxic spell dump as it got closer i saw it was a big carpet a freight hauler and heavily loaded it was gold with a white cross the colors of the vatican flag i knew the vatican rug would also bear a wovenin legend in white in hoc signo vinces but it was too high and too far away for me to be able to read that it was heading straight over the chocolate weasel build ing huehueteods magical fire flamed up to meet it i was afraid the flames would bum down the carpet and everybody on it but one thing i give the catholic church it has a saintly hierarchy in charge of looking out for more different things than all the bureaucrats in dsfcc put together st florian watches specially over those who must contend with fire i have no idea whether his power would have been enough to overcome huehueteod down inside die chocolate weasel building but it sufficed to keep die god from crisping die caipefc one of die monks riding die carpet i could see his bare pate shining in die late afternoon sun tipped a big earthen ware urn down onto die roof of die chocolate weasel building dien anodier and another and anodier mediodical as if he were on a carpet bombing run over alemania in die second sorcerous war those ums and whatever they held were heavy i could hear diem smashing on and maybe dirough die roof from several blocks away and whatever was in diem was spec tacularly efficacious the constant heat on my soul that radiated from huehueteod went away as if my spirit had suddenly dived into a clear stream he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he refresheth my said ran dirough my head i turned to kawaguchi and michael manstein and asked what are diey dropping on diem they bodi stared at me as if i were an idiot then michael said thats right you are jewish as if reminding himself veiy gendy he went on its holy water david oh all right i was an idiot in fact i was doubly an idiot not only was die stuff thaumaturgically potent in and of harry turtledove itself it was also perfect symbolically what better to oppose fire of any sort than its opposite among the elements once chocolate weasel took all the punishment it had umed from the carpet kawaguchi blew a long shrill blast on a whistle swat teams yolandas hazmat crew and the epa hazmat outfit swarmed toward the chocolate weasel building ordinary constables the guys with mostly passive sorcerous gear and merely physical weapons the grunts followed in their wake they were thrown back twice before kawaguchi said more to himself than to me or michael this time this time they moved forward the swat team wizards carried holy water sprinklers like the ones the loki guards in burbank packed those hadnt been enough to protect them against the growing might of the aztedan powers before now those powers had been reduced by bombardment from on high so to speak and now the swat teams advanced cautiously toward the parking lot in front of chocolate wea sel then toward the building itself i got distracted at that point the archdiocesan carpet floated down and landed just a few feet from me good afternoon inspector fisher one of the monks on it said i wondered it i might see you here today somehow it seems fitting brother vahan i exclaimed it certainly does i trotted over to shake his hand were you the bombardier up there i was indeed he said with a sober nod god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform not scriptural but in this case accurate a curate no youre an abbot my mind gibbered i forced myself back to the hereandnow what do you mean i mean that i was in the cardinals office beseeching him on bended knee to reconsider his prohibition against my brethrens use of cosmetic sorcery to restore their appear ance when legate kawaguchis communication reached his eminence he thought me an appropriate agent for the task requested and i was pleased to obey him in this instance case of the toxic spell dump brother vahan was stubborn to the point of being bull headed if he kept after the cardinal to change his mind once hed decided to do something you dont do that if youre in monastic orders you are after all sworn to obedience along with poverty and chastity my guess was that brother vahan wouldnt have said a word about the cardinals decision had it affected him for his monks though hed argue a good man and i could see why the cardinal would have wanted him on that carpet who would have more strength of purpose going up against the probable destroyers of the thomas brothers monastery than its abbot as to the other i gather his eminence told you no again i said his thick eyebrows virtually the only hair he had on his head twitched upwards from what do you infer that you said you were happy to obey him in this instance i answered i took it to mean you werent happy about the other most jesuitically reasoned his thin smile said he was teasing me it went away too soon td rather he had refused me this and granted the other many could have done what i just did but who except me will speak for my brethren i didnt know what to feel pleased with myself for under standing the way brother vahans mind worked angry at the cardinal for sticking to his refusal like a pricldeburr or pleased his eminence had the gumption to commit his best to a crisis those last two were inextricably mixed which only complicated things more faint across a couple of hundred yards came shouts from the constables and then pops of pistol fire normally pistols are nothing to scorn theyre about the most dangerous me chanical hand weapons around after everything id been through that day those pops and the clouds of gunpowder smoke i saw rising from the parking lot seemed about as consequential as the firecrackers whose cousins they were kawaguchi pulled out his own pistol cocked it checked his flint and then trotted down nordhoff toward chocolate weasel michael and i started after him but a constable harry turtledove about the size of both of us put together shook his head and rumbled that wouldnt be smart he stepped in front of us and spread his arms wide to make sure we listened to him since he was doing a pretty good impression of the great hanese wall i stopped so did michael that meant we had to wait waiting is harder than doing when youre doing you dont have time to worry when youre waiting if youre anything like me you think about all the things that could go wrong id waited for the garuda bird id waited for die carpet from the archdiocese i was waiting again i was sick of it i waited anyhow peering down nordhoffto see what i could see not too much not for a while then i heard more pis tol pops and then people started coming back up the street some of them were constables some prisoners with their hands in the air as they got closer i saw that several sets of those upraised hands were red with drips running down toward the elbows i heard someone make a sick gulping noise and realied a moment later it was me one of the swat team wizards was carrying an obsidian knife another one walking beside him kept spraying it with holy water i gulped again that knife i had no doubt belonged in the devonshire dump if ever spells were guaranteed harmful to the environment theyre the ones that go along with human sacrifice i recognized one of the prisoners jorge vasquez he saw me at about the same time i saw him i thought about making some crack about his getting shut down for epa violations along with everything else but i kept my mouth shut even captured he looked too smart and tough for me to want to twit him behind him came legate kawaguchi who was busy load ing another charge of powder and ball into his pistol as he walked along brother vahan called to him do any within that building require my services kawaguchi finished ramming home the ball before he looked up for last rites and such you mean brother he shook his head just corpses in there case of the toxic spell dump martyrs brother vahan said his voice grim their reward shall surely come in heaven i wondered about that was somebody who got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time a martyr in the same sense as a person who deliberately invited death for the sake of his faith im neither catholic nor theologian so i cant tell you what brother vahan should have been thinking by the standards of his church that was the least of my worries anyhow i lunged for kawaguchi in a way that almost made him level his newly loaded pistol at me did you i choked on fear and had to force myself to go on did you find judy in there ib my relief he slipped the pistol back into its holster then he said inspector fisher i neither searched exten sively through ae chocolate weasel building nor closely examined the bodies of the victims around the altar some thing else to be decontaminated i thought kawaguchi was continuing so long as you understand these limitations sir i can state to you that i did not see a corpse matching the description of your fiancee in that that abbatoir kawaguchi talks like an upperlevel constable as if every word he says is going to show up in a written report or as courtroom testimony real soon now for him to pick a word like abbatoir all at once i was glad the very large fel low in the blue uniform hadnt let me follow the legate i was also gladder than i could say that subject to his careful limitations he hadnt found judy if i chose to believe that she wasnt there because he hadnt found her can you blame me michael said legate can we lend any further assis tance we hadnt lent kawaguchi much assistance before that id noticed michael is usually too precise to make a slip like that but after everything that had happened during the day can you blame him either thank you sir but i think not kawaguchi answered he turned to me inspector fisher you did your best to warn me of the magnitude of this threat i must concede that at the time of our telephone conversation i did not have a full appreciation of it my apologies for that error harry turtledove who would have believed this i said my guess was that kawaguchi still didnt have a full appreciation of what hed been part of today put what happened here together with our desperate struggles back at the devonshire dump let both containment efforts fail and angels city goes light off the map and who could say what was happening else where in die confederation or would have followed azbedan success here maybe wed put a spike in the wheel of the third sorcerous war david i shall take you back to westwood now michael said in a tone that brooked no argument i wasnt in a mood to argue anyhow now that the terror which had kept me hopping most of the day was easing i could feel myself sub siding into something with all the crisp dedsiveness of a bowl of tapioca pudding more boneless with every step i walked over to his carpet we headed down toward the ven ture freeway i told myself i never wanted to see st ferdinands valley again when we got to the confederal building michael got off the carpet and headed for the entrance instead of going home he gave me a bemused look when i fell into step beside him i may as well keep working i told him the more i have to do the less time i have to worry ah he said the anodyne of distraction which is what id just said but i hadnt managed to boil it into four words if i didnt have anything urgent on my desk i figured id write up what id been through today the epa like any government agency thrives on documentation and i must confess that ive been indoctrinated to the point where i sometimes dont believe something is real until its commit ted to parchment on the other hand if moses had had to fill out all the epa forms parting the red sea would have required the bible would be written in egyptian only one message waited for me from a woman named susan kuznetsov i frowned trying to remember who she was then name and face matched the nononsense gal from the baronys bureau of physical and spiritual health whod reported little jesus corderos apsychia to me i asked my watch the time going on six mistress case of the toxic spell dump kuznetsov had impressed me as the hardworking type so i called her back sure enough i got her inspector fisher she said i thought she sounded pleased id expected youd be gone for the day i just got back in i told her what can i do for you inspector the cordero family has been contacted by a consortium styling itself slow jinn fizz she answered this consortium mentioned the possibility of instilling a soul into the infant something they had been given to believe was impossible unlike too many poor and poorly educated fami lies he corderos called me for advice instead of allowing themselves to be taken in by probable charlatans my pre liminary investigation however indicates that slow jinn fizz may perhaps be able to deliver on some of its claims i called you to leam whether ifs yet come under epa scrutiny yet as a matter of fact i was out there myself right around the time jesus cordero was being born i said when i didnt go on right away susan kuznetsov said and are they flimflam men like so many outfits widi im pressive claims you know i dont really think so i answered i think the re right on the edge of making psychic synthesis possi ble and i think the procedure may well have important benefits for apsychic patients and give them at least a chance at life after death really she sounded surprised you recommend the procedure dien i didnt say diat i told her and then explained i dont knew where or from whom the pieces of soul the jinni are synthesizing come from or whether slow jinn fizz is solving one problem now at the expense of widespread psychic depletion years maybe even generations down die line ifs certainly a tempting technology but you know who the tempter is i certainty do she said so youd suggest the corderos stay away from it if shed asked me diat the day before i would have said yes thanks to modem medicine jesus cordero had every chance of living to a ripe old age and psychic synthesis harry turtledove would be investigated and refined until people understood all the gremlins in the process that would be the right time for him to have a soul implanted but after what had happened at the devonshire dump and then at chocolate weasel i felt less easy about that wait fordevelopments approach just because the odds said you were likely to lead a long life didnt mean you would a big piece of angels city had almost gone up in flames if you were an apsychic could you afford to take a chance like that would you want to knowing extinction awaited mistress kuznetsov i said carefully the epa hasnt taken a position on slow jinn fizz and what it does before we do wed have to weigh shortterm benefits against lower grade longterm risks my guess is that the technology wont be allowed out of the experimental stage and into general use for many years i know that much already she answered the people from slow jinn fizz said as much to the corderos and i give them credit for it what im realty asking is what would you do if that were your kid if its my kid i worry about saving him first and every thing else later i said isnt that what being a parents all about but just because thats what id do doesnt mean it makes good public policy thats fair she said let me put it a different way then would the epa have kittens if the slow jinn fizz experimen tal protocol expanded to include jesus cordero right now the answer to that is no i said too much else bigger stuff was going on for us to worry about slow jinn fizz right now but i didnt tell that to susan kuznetsov i hoped that one day things would slow down to the point where wed be able to worry about the problems synthesized souls present no doubt they were important but they werent worldthreatening so for now theyd just have to wait and besides i told myself how much environmental damage on the other side would manufacturing a soul for one little boy cause not much surety and it would do so much good for jesus cordero case of the toxic spell dump you know of course which road is paved with good inten tions so do i so does the epa the real question wasnt what would happen when one apsychic kid got a soul the real question was what would happen when jinnetic engi neering and jinnsplicing techniques began stirring up the psychic material of the other side on a large scale i didnt have any answers for that neither did anybody else the epas job was to make sure we found those answers before exploiting those techniques got us into trouble not afterwards but to give jesus cordero a series of one case a chance at life after life why not mistress kuznetsov said inspector i want to thank you for being flexible youre going to make the corderos very happy and as for jesus he wont understand whafs hap pened for a long time yet but when he does hell be eternally grateful i hope so anyway i said the technique is experimen tal and from what ramzan durani told me it hasnt yet undergone the test of mortality but when youre in that position you have to grasp at straws dont you thafs myview as a public health officer certainly susan kuznetsov said i wasnt sure how the epa would view the matter if youd said you wanted to add a thousand people to the experimental list i would have given you a different answer but one little boy and one ive met yes the law of contagion does remind us of how impor tant personal contact is doesnt it i was just afraid youd be working against contagion as i often have to do rather than allowing it full scope not this time i answered quietly letting jesus cordero have a chance to beat apsychia wasnt as big a thing as thwarting the chumash powers or keeping huitzilopochtfi and his fiery fiiend from establishing themselves in angels city but it felt just as good maybe better as susan kuznetsov had said this was personal i only wished the rest of my personal worries were doing as well no word of judy none at all to keep myself from thinking of that and what it might harry turtledove mean i plunged into the environmental impact report on what importing leprechauns into angels city was liable to do to the local thecology i made more progress in an hour and a half than i had in the past two weeks no wonder now i could make my prognostications secure in the knowledge that the wee folk werent going to have any adverse effect on the chumash powers id taken care of that myself in spades eventually i supposed id get around to feeling bad about siccmgthe garuda bird on them an epa man after all is supposed to protect endangered powers not extermi nate them from their point of view i couldnt really blame the lizard and the great eagle and the rest for wanting to overturn the balance of powers and twist things back to the way the d been before the first europeans touched the new world but along with a couple of hundred million other people i live in the world thats sprung from the european expan sion and as michael manstein said wed done more and better with this land than its original inhabitants would have in the same length of time so while i figured id eventually get round to feeling bad it wouldnt be any time real soon speaking of michael he poked his head into my office about then im going home now he said terhaps you should do the same he clearly wasnt used to me working longer hours than he did he was right i went home i ate something dont ask me t what then went to bed worries or no i slept almost as j soundly as if id been in ephesus the aftermath of nearly dying a couple of times during the course of a day if my alarm dock hadnt screamed me awake i might be snoring yet no sooner had i got to the office than the phone started yelling i came this close to knocking over my cup of cafete ria coffee grabbing for it environmental perfection agency david fisher inspector fisher this is legate shtro kawaguchi angels city constabulary department kawaguchi spoke as if he were introducing himself for the first time inspector case of the toxic spell dump fisher interrogation of the suspect jorge vasquez has led us to your fiancee mistress judith adier i let out a whoop that rattled my windows thafs won derful legate when can i see her he didnt answer right away my joy crashed into dread is she all right unfortunately inspector fisher i must tell you she is not kawaguchi answered you will perhaps remember that an aztecian power variously called the craclder the page and the one called night was involved in the abduction of mistress adier yes of course i said from what our forensics man has to say inspector it ap pears that the one called night to use the name with which you appear to be most famijiiar has carried mistress adiefs spirit into the realm known as the nine beyonds we have recovered her body she appears to be physically unharmed she will eat or drink if food or water is placed in her mouth but as for anything more than that im very sorry inspec tor fisher but at present it is just not there what do we do then i asked hoarsely our preliminaiy and tentative thaumaturgic efforts to restore her to herself have failed she does not seem as responsive to certain rituals as we had hoped kawaguchi paused i believe you are jewish is mistress adier also yes that may account for part of it then most rituals designed to counter the craclder assume a catholic victim and would be less efficacious in rescuing one from a differ ent faith while we continue to do our utmost i suggest you also pursue every flyway that occurs to you otherwise inspector i can offer no guarantee that mistress adlers body and spirit will ever be reunited xi ii took my troubles down to madame ruth you know that medium with the goldcapped tooth she had an office down on th and vine i hoped she could help with a prob lem like mine when erasmus had been so dreadfully hurt as the thomas brothers monastery was torched she and i nigel cholmondeley managed to access him where every one else had failed i was praying shed be able to do the same for judy in her green silk dress and the matching scarf she used to cover her hair she put me in mind of nothing so much as an enormous watermelon wearing too much makeup but her looks didnt matter not to me they didnt she and her eng lish partner were the local experts on virtuous reality and from what id seen of the technique i figured it offered the harry turtledove best chance of rescuing judys spirit and bringing it back to this side where it belonged madame ruth heard me out then slowly shook her head back and forth i dunno inspector fisher she said this aint gonna be as easy as gettin hold ofwhatshisname the scriptorium spirit was you dont just wanna access your fiancees spirit you wanna download it too thats one fresh problem if you say thats one you mean there are more i said what are they two good ones offhand she answered ones in the spiritual realm we were able to build our own kinda place to meet the spirit erasmus thats what he goes by in if your girlfriends already stuck in the nine beyonds were gonna hafta go in there and haul her out like i said that aint gonna be easy i wondered what walking through a simulation of the nine beyonds would be like could even virtuous reality pretty up something with a handle like that so anyone except a power named the one called night would want to go there i had my doubts but i also had no choice not if i wanted judy back i asked whats the other problem madame ruth coughed and looked down at her desk an elephantine effort at discretion its not spiritual she said its more materiallike if you know what i mean she stopped there after a couple of seconds i figured out what she was fly ing at tm sure judys medical insurance will cover your fees i said its one of the blue scutum plans and it has an excellent thaumaturgy benefits package thafs okay then she said nodding briskly i understood that she had to show a profit but what would judy have done without insurance got stuck in the nine beyonds forever because no one would come after her without crowns on the barrelhead or ended up bankrupting herself to pay the fees afterwards nothings simple these days will you try to help her i asked lemme talk with my partner this is gonna take both of us she said and got up to go next door i didnt age more case of the toxic spell dump than eight or ten years in the few minutes she was gone she came back with cholmondeley weedy as ever in her wake she must have read my face because she said its okay mr fisher well give it a try i started gasping out thankyous but nigel cholmondeley cut me off time for all that later old chap if we succeed meanwhile where is mistress uh adier now located kawaguchi had told me that her bodys at the west hills temple of healing i said where the rest of her was well cholmondeley and madame ruth already knew about that madame ruth was looking through her appointments scroll were on for this afternoon and tomorrow morning too she said we can work her in tomorrow afternoon though if thats okay wit you she looked at me i nodded i wanted them to drop everything and rush right out to take care of judy but everybody else they were working for felt his case was the most important one in the world too madame ruth said its okay mr fisher maybe even better than okay this gives us a chance to square things with the constables and with the west hills place so as we can be all set up and ready to go i nodded again cholmondeley unrolled his own scroll inked a quill and scribbled a note we shall see you there then at half past one he stuck out a bony hand i clasped it then walked out of madame ruths office i wanted to get back to my own shop as soon as i could i was using vacation time for this visit crazy how you keep track of the little things even when the big ones in your world are falling every which way there was a rack of news stands outside madame ruths building i stuck a quartercrown into the waiting palm of one of the little vending demons took away a copy of the ac times i figured yesterdays goingson would be page one stuff and so they were the flight of the garuda bird across st ferdinands valley isnt something you can easily ignore neither is the emergency evacuation of the neigh borhoods surrounding the devonshire toxic spell dump sure enough both of those got plenty of ink though the harry turtledove reporters seemed confused about just what had happened that didnt bother me the whole truth here probably would have set off a panic we didnt need especially since things were back under control one of the reporters quoted matt arnold out at the lold works he gave the impression hed turned the garuda bird loose as a preorbital flight test then went on about the next step in the space program after the bird got us into low orbit lold was designing new sorceware to work the indian rope trick from some spot on the equator miles straight up to geosynchronous orbit from which mages could project sorcery over big parts of the globe day and night nobody asked me but i thought lold ought to work on a new rope too the mess at chocolate weasel made page one too but only as a big industrial accident not a word about the sacri fices not a word about any connection to the mess at the devonshire dump what really got me though was the rest of the headlines the aztecian emperor had ordered his entire cabinet exe cuted it was the times said the first general cabinet massacre since the time when azteca almost joined the first sorcerous war on the alemanian side the new ministers were supposed to be more inclined toward improving rela tions with the confederation than their predecessors had been or else i read between the lines thered also been some sort of disaster outside dstc but i didnt even glance at that story i just headed over to westwood to go back to work when i got up to my floor bea was coming down the corridor as i stepped out of the elevator shaft she asked about judy and gave me her best in a way that sounded as if she really meant it im sure she did too bea cares about people sounding as if you care though isnt so easy then she said you and michael have done some very important work lately and under extremely trying circumstances i want you to know i know it and i couldnt be more pleased case of the toxic spell dump thank you i said but you know what i think id rather have spent all that time in a nice dull staff meeting her head went to one side i realized id stuck my foot in my face im going to understand that the way i hope you meant it she said to my relief more in sorrow and in amusement than in anger she let me escape then so escape i did to the smaller problems left behind after the spectacular collapse of the bigger ones i plugged away at the leprechaun study lining up values for my variables so i could get rolling on the crystalball prognostications maybe next week i had to call the angels city archdiocese for some of the data i needed the catholic church has lived side by side with the wee polk on the emerald isle for the past fifteen hundred years and knows more about em than anybody these days try as i would though i didnt get a whole lot done people kept coming in to congratulate me and wish me the best phylhs rose jose even if the papers were being coy the folks i work with knew what id done maybe michael had talked with them i dont know its not that i didnt appreciate their dropping by but they kept distracting me from what i was trying to do and when i got distracted i had a hard time pulling my mind back where it was supposed to be i also kept trying to crystalball it in my head to work out where in the big picture the events in angels city really fit what did thwarting the chumash powers have to do with the liquidation of the aztecian cabinet for instance some thing sure but what as with the leprechaun study i was missing data here though the catholic church wasnt the place that had em i called central intelligence back in dstc and asked for henry legion i listened to a long silence on the other end of the ether then the ci operator asked whos calling please david fisher from the epa out in angels city one moment sir if that was one moment you could live a long lifetime in three or four of them at last though someone came back on the line a new voice but not harry turtledove henry legions mr fisher im sony to have to tell you that henry legions essence has undergone dissolution he gave his country the last full measure of devotion his name will go up on the memorial tablet commemorating our agencys heroes and martyrs he shall not be forgotten i assure you what happened i exclaimed and to whom am i talk ing im afraid i cant answer either of those questions sir security the new voice said im sure you understand good day thank you for your concern the phone imps re produced the sound of a handset clunking into its cradle i hung up too and stared at the phone for a while what ever henry legion had been doing it cost him everything i knew id never leam all the answers i wanted not with him gone i was back to my own guesses for better or worse probably worse after seeing a little ways into his secret secretive world i was blind again i wondered if his passing had anything to do with the extermination of the sitting aztecian cabinet or perhaps with the disaster outside dsfcc the times had mentioned did some sort of war try to start there too and get suppressed as it had in angels city more things id never know not without hemy legion to ask since id never know sitting around wondering was just a waste of taxpayers crowns i buckled down and tried to do my job but things came slow slow maybe i suddenly needed a crisis breathing down my neck like a hungry were wolfto make myself perform lord what a horrid idea i flew into tile parking lot of the west hills temple of heating about ten past one the next afternoon then flew around inside the lot for the next ten minutes looking for a space for my carpet i wouldnt have been late not for anything when i told the receptionist who i was and for whom i was looking she said go up to the fifth floor mr fisher mistress adier is in right across the hall from the case of the toxic spell dump intensive prayer unit just follow the ipu signs and you cant go wrong famous last words i knew well this time the gal was right the signs took me straight to didnt know what to think about judys being where she was should i have been glad she was so close to intensive prayer in case she needed it or worried she was there because they were afraid she would need it being me i worried when i opened the door to discovered a constable sitting in one of the uncomfortablelooking chairs in there he carefully checked my epa sigil and said youre fine mr fisher but we have to be sure before he went back to his book by then id forgotten all about him seeing judy again took everything else out of my mind she didnt look bad but then she always looks good to me so i wasnt in any real position to judge her color was good her eyes were open she was breathing normally to that much i can objectively attest but i soon noticed that even if her eyes were open they didnt track i walked across her field of vision a cou ple of times but she took no notice of me she didnt say anything when she moved on the bed she didnt adjust the covers afterwards her body lay there but not the rest other that was off in the nine beyonds the realm of the one called night madame ruth and nigel cholmondeley came in just then accompanied by a fellow in a white lab robe who intro duced himself to me as healer ah murad i look forward to learning to apply virtuous reality to healing situations he said this will be an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my knowledge wonderful somebody who saw judy as a guinea pig nothing more i wondered how hed like enhancing his knowledge of what getting flung out a fifthfloor window felt like he looked pretty sharp maybe he could leam to fly before he hit the ground i made myself relax by his lights hr murad was only doing his job what he learned from judy might help him harry turtledove treat somebody else but that didnt mean i had to like him and i didnt nigel cholmondeley was carrying a case large enough that he had to be stronger than he looked he set it on the empty bed next to judys flipped open the brass catches and took out four of the bigeared virtuous reality helmets id last seen in the constabulary station he looked at the setup in the room fretfully clucked his tongue between his teeth forming a circle under these cir cumstances wfll be rather difficult he said making the a m rather so broad i thought hed never finish pronouncing it madame ruth was bluntly practical well just turn her around she said if be easy if her head ends at the foot of he bed hr murad took care of that moving judy with a practiced gentleness that said he might have a bedside man ner after all madame ruth rounded on the constable hey you be useful move some chairs around for us she ges tured to show what she wanted the constable gave her a dirty look but did as she asked him he put one chair at the foot of the bed close by where judys head now rested and one more to either side at that end of the bed while he was taking care of that nigel chol mondeley set a virtuous reality helmet on judy she didnt react at all as it covered her eyes and ears when he was done cholmondeley turned to me and said you sit here here was the seat right across the footboard from judy cholmondeley and madame ruth took the other two seats grunting madame ruth got up from hers and arranged judys arms so her wrists and hands dangled off the sides of the bed oh capital cholmondeley said as she sat back down now we shall be able to maintain die personal contact so essential in this exercise he handed me a virtuous reality helmet i put it on the world went black and silent from my earlier experience i knew i was supposed to take the hands of die people to either side of me i groped for them at first i didnt find them i wondered what was wrong until i realized madame ruth and cholmondeley needed to put on their helmets too case of the toxic spell dump i wished i were holding one of judys hands but that wasnt how the medium and the channeler had set things up and i had to assume they knew what they were doing no sooner had that thought crossed my mind than nigel chol mondeleys left hand caught my right a moment later madame ruths right hand took my left in a warm damp fleshy grasp and a moment after that the psychic circle complete we were on the odier side madame rudi had warned me we wouldnt be going back to die garden where wed questioned erasmus so id been braced for worse i wasnt braced for what we encountered were here sure enough nigel cholmondeley said as soon as he spoke i could see his virtuous image but where is aere i asked to help him see me a bad place madame ruth said springmg into appar ent being very bad as in my earlier venture into virtuous reality diey bodi appeared idealized to my second sight cholmondeley hand some widi more meat on his scrawny bones madame rudi minus about half of her corpulent self and her screechy toughguy accent as before i couldnt see myself at all i couldnt see any sign of judy eidier not as before i couldnt see anydiing but my spirit guides the nine beyonds were dark as an underground cave at midnight my sight had been totally obscured when i slipped die virtuous reality helmet over my eyes what i was sensing now felt darker dian totally obscured i dont know how but it did it was just dark like a cave it didnt feel as if we were inside one if wed been in a garden before my guess was diat we were in jungle now jungle on a moonless starless night a million miles or maybe farther from anydiing of mans though i knew my body was back in a cool room at die west hills temple of healing die air that seemed to be around me felt hot and wet and smelled as if dungs i didnt want to know about were just beginning to rot somewhere not far enough away things were moving diere too and i didnt know what harry turtledove case of the toxic spell dump they were because i couldnt see them whatever they were i didnt think they meant us well this was not a place where we were meant to be a sudden sharp noise made the self i didnt have start in alarm it sounded as if something had stepped on a dry twig although where you could have found a dry twig in that stifling humidity i couldnt tell you i remembered the one called night was also known as the crackler having remembered i wished i could forget again i turned to madame ruth how are we supposed to find judy in all this we were somewhere in one beyond even if we somehow went over every inch of it and i was afraid it had a lot of inches that left eight more to search we were liable to be there forever or maybe twenty minutes longer the emperor hadrians death poem ran through my mind animula vagida blandula little soul wandering gentle guest and companion of my body into what places will you go now pale stiff and naked no longer sporting as you did if id perceived myself as embodied in that dread ful place i would have burst into tears the image fit only too well what i feared was happening to judys spirit well do the best we can mr fisher madame ruth answered beyond that i dont know what to tell you this domain is not shaped by us alone the power who dwells here influences our perceptions we must attempt to move and hope we find ourselves guided toward mistress adier shed warned before we set out that this wouldnt be as easy as contacting erasmus had been she hadnt warned how bad it would be maybe she didnt know till we tried it virtuous reality is a technology thats just opening up which means one of the things its practitioners are still discovering is what can go wrong i got the feeling that if anything went seriously wrong in the nine beyonds hr alt murad would learn some things he hadnt expected and some new intrepid explorers of vir tuous reality would have to try to rescue three more spirits lost in this suffocating place would they have any better fortune than we did madame ruth had said we had to try to move to explore the nine beyonds and hope we found judy move we did but it wasnt easy the nine beyonds resisted every meta physical motion we made we cried out but everywhere in vain it was as if we were drunk as if the nine beyonds themselves were having sport with us mocking our search we might as well have been wading through mud through quicksand through hot dinging slime and it felt as if the area in which we stood and moved was growing smaller all the time with everything perfectly black all around us with madame ruth and nigel cholmondeley the only things my second sight could perceive i dont know how i got that impression but i did that led me to another interesting question if interesting and horrible are syno nyms what would happen if it closed real tight around us someexperiments youd rather not see performed espe cially on you no sooner had i thought that than i discovered i wasnt the only one feeling the invisible closing in voice tight with concern nigel cholmondeley said i think we had best withdraw lest we be overwhelmed by that which lurks in darkness here how do we get away i asked break me circle free your hands madame ruth said quicldy that hadnt been easy even when we were leaving the vir tuous reality garden remembering you had an actual physical body that could do things was tough making it do those things tougher and not for me alone i watched the virtuous images of cholmondeley and madame ruth twist in concentration as they struggled to make their bodies respond to their wills no doubt my own virtuous image bore a similar grimace in their second sight madame ruth had been right we needed to hurry some thing was breathing down the neck i hadnt brought along to the nine beyonds i didnt know what the one called night could do to me but i was very conscious of operating on the powers turf or rather muck if it took hold of me just then one of us harry turtledove managed to get a hand loose and break the circle coming back wasnt like returning from the garden i seemed to be falling and falling in a forever compressed into maybe a sec ond and a half worse still i thought the one called night was falling after me falling faster than i was reaching out with black black hands in which never a star would shine under the virtuous reality helmet my eyes flew open i saw only darkness there too but it was a darkness i knew the familiar darkness of this side unlike the blacker than black of die nine beyonds i knew what to do about this i yanked the helmet off my head and sat blinking in the mellow afternoon sun i got my helmet off just ahead of nigel cholmondeley and madame ruth their faces their real everyday faces not the idealized images they bore in the realms of virtuous reality were pale and haggard as yours would be as mine surely was after such a narrow escape cholmondeley leaned forward pulled off judys virtuous reality helmet her face showed nothing just as it had before the helmet went on her spirit hadnt been in there to expe rience what wed gone through madame ruth wiped sweat from her forehead with one sleeve i didnt think the sweat had anything to do with wear ing the helmet jesus she muttered it tried to follow us back too bloody right it did cholmondeley also sounded shaken to the core i think it used mistress adier as its con duit it controls her spirit after all i never heard of that i said nor had i cholmondeley answered nor so far as i know has any practitioner of virtuous reality of course there is the caveat that anyone encountering the phenome non at full strength so to speak is unlikely to remain a practitioner of virtuous reality or indeed of any trade there after he essayed a laugh it came out as a series of nervous little barks the procedure was unsuccessful hr murad asked he hadnt been there with us lucky him buddy youre lucky were lucky ifs us sittin here case of the toxic spell dump talking to you and not the one called night madame ruth said nigel cholmondele s nod in support of that was as herkyjerky as his laugh had been i stood up i felt as if id been away from my body for a long time slogging through the steaming lighdess swamps of the nine beyonds the physical part of me though the part that hadnt left the chair rose now so smoothly that i knew virtuous reality had fooled me again before hr murad could turn judy the right way around on her bed i leaned over the footboard and looked down into her face her eyes were open and looking back at me nothing showed in them any more than it had before no recognition of me no awareness of where she was i kept looking down into the blackness other pupils was the one called night hiding in that blackness peering back at me through those portholes into this side while it held her spirit trapped in the nine beyonds i had no way to tell when i stepped back the healer did put judy back where she belonged nigel cholmondeley was glumly packing the virtuous reality helmets back into their travel case he set a hand on my arm terribly sorry old man i truly am id hoped for better results so did i i looked at judy again if we couldnt get her spirit back from the nine beyonds she was going to stay in that bed for the rest of her life eating when they fed her drinking when they gave her water wiggling every now and then for no reason at all and what would happen when she died could her spirit break free of the one called night even then i shivered all over and the room wasnt that cool in a way she was even worse off than jesus cordero with no natural soul of his own he at least had hopes of getting an artificial one from slow jinn fizz but what could ramzan durani do for judy whose spirit was stolen rather than absent what could anyone do hr murad stepped in front of madame ruth as she was about to go out the door wait please he said in the tone of somebody trying not too hard to be polite about giving harry turtledove an order we have not yet fuby examined the etiology of your treatments failure madame ruth looked down her nose at him she was taller than he was as well as wider if you dont get out of that doorway sonny im gonna squash you flat you ask nice maybe web talk about it later right now i need a drink or two a whole lot more than i need you she advanced hr murad retreated nigel cholmondeley followed in her mas sive wake i followed too leaving judy was a knife stuck in my heart but staying there with her like that hurt even worse i felt another sleepless night coming up id had too many of those lately and earned every one of diem excuse me i called to cholmondeley and madame ruth as they were about to step on the slide back down to the lobby they both paused sorry like anything we couldnt help ya mr fisher madame ruth said tm just glad we got ourselves back to this side in one piece too bad we couldnt bring your girl friend with us most unfortunate nigel cholmondeley agreed for judy especially i said at which the two of them had the grace to nod that gave me the nerve i needed to go on if i can come up with anything that would give us a better chance would you be willing to take another try at rescuing her from the nine beyonds they looked at each other i didnt like the look it said not on your life bud madame ruth opened her mouth to answer and id bet a big pile she was about to say that out loud cholmondeley raised a finger to stop her he was the smooth man of the pair what he said was it would have to be something quite extraordinary mr fisher which was also no but sugarcoated so it went down sweeter besides he wouldnt want to drive away business by coming right out and saying virtuous reality just couldnt do some tricks so he let me hope a needleeyes worth maybe but hope the last thing at the bottom of pandoras box and gen erally running too many lengths behind trouble ever since but it was all i had so i clasped it to my bosom case of the toxic spell dump what i didnt have was any idea of what i might come up with that would give us a better chance in the nine beyonds the one called night seemed to rule the roost there why not it was his roost if we could make him confront us on neutral ground so to speak wed have a better chance of making him release judys spirit but how the nine beyonds were his home on the other side i didnt see any way to force him out beat him on his home ground then wed tried that already with no luck that left nothing i could see madame ruth and nigel cholmondeley had already slid away i stood by the slide doing my best to come up with the brilliant idea to save the day its always easy in the adventure stories id even done it myself when i summoned the garuda bird to the devonshire dump not this tone another sleepless night this time i mean it literally when it got to be about one in the morning i just gave up and made myself a cup of coffee if i was going to be awake i might as well be awake i figured somehow id stagger through the next day and somehow after that id sleep meanwhile meanwhile i prowled around my flat for want of any thing better to do i cleaned it cleaner than it had been since just before the high holy days the year before when i moved the couch and chair to clean under them i found close to a crown and a half in loose change so i even turned a profit on the deal i read an adventure story paid some bills wrote some let ters all the things you do in slack time i wrote to people who hadnt heard from me in so long i hoped the shock wouldnt send em on to the other side every so often id get up from the kitchen table which doubled as desk and go back in the bedroom not to try to go to sleep id given up on that id push back the curtain and look out at the night it was very dark out there no moon just a couple of stars i could see i might have thought harry turtledove it looked really black if i hadnt almost been trapped in the nine beyonds that afternoon next to that place angels city night was high noon in the desert back out to the kitchen for another cup of coffee as i had once or twice before i wished for an ethemet set to give me some noise to be lonely with with quiet all around me i couldnt keep from thinking and none of my thoughts were ones i wanted i went back to the bedroom again stib night outside what a surprise my alarm clock told me it was half past four maybe i was imagining things but i thought the horological demon sounded slightly worried at having me awake and prowling around at that hour maybe i alarmed it for a change i sat down on the bed the state i was in that proved an other mistake it made me remember all the times judy and i had lain there together and how unlikefy we were to do it again my eyes filled with the easy tears that can come when youre half underwater with exhaustion an effect of the law of contagion i dont know out to the kitchen again this time for breakfast you stay up all night you get hungry i was washing the dishes when a pigeon landed on the tile roof above me with a noise like a flying carpet crashing into the side of a hill in the fog there have been times when that kind of predawn rackets bounced me out of bed in a fright if id been asleep it might have happened again as things were i welcomed the noise it showed something besides me was alive and moving i finished washing the dishes dried them and put them away then i took a shower and after that i went back into the bedroom and got dressed to face the new day facing the day in fact was easy when i opened he bed room drapes the eastern sky was brilliant pink shading toward gold at the horizon it got brighter by the second as i watched finally the sun crawled up into sight another day had started i didnt feel too bad not physically mentally spiritually a different story the sun rose higher as the sun has a way of doing what case of the toxic spell dump had been a black mystery out past my window was revealed as what a surprise romantic hawthorne a not particularly exotic suburb of angels city i started to turn my back on the toofamiliar panorama then stopped with one foot in the air before i fell over i spun around and ran for the little book by my phone i was just about sure i had that number but not quite i checked i had it i called it hello through two phone imps i recognized that groggy tone id had it myself the too early in the morning when charlie kelly called me and got me and judy and maybe the whole world into the mess we were in i didnt care i started to talk i found a parking spot right at the comer of thirtyfourth and vine settled my carpet into it and settled me down to wait id got there twenty minutes before i was supposed to meet him hed promised hed come hed even sounded eager to help which to my way of thinking only proved he didnt fully understand the situation that comer wasnt one of he swankier ones in angels city and it wasnt an angel who sauntered past and gaveme the eye it was a succubus swinging her hips fit to make the pope sweat but my mind was on other things she muttered something i was lucky enough not to catch and walked on down the street two spaces in front of me a carpet pulled out and headed up vine within half a minute another one slid into the space tony i exclaimed gladly promises or no id feared hed find some reason not to come before six in the morn ing youre liable to promise anything just to get a pest off the phone but here he was grinning like a man whos had some sleep anyhow lets go dave he said ive read a lot about virtuous reality you think im gonna throw away a chance to check it out from the inside if hed had any sense he would have he must not have had sense he gave me a shot in the ribs with his elbow and went into the office building ahead of me he was singing harry turtledove something in lithuanian i caught perkunas name but that was all before id met tony i wouldnt have understood that either my legs are longer than his by the time we got to madame ruths office i was a couple of strides in front of him i opened the door and went in tony on my heels if i told you madame ruth looked delighted to see me id be tying mr fisher she said as patiently as she could which wasnt very we told you yesterday we couldnt do anything more for you no thats not quite what you said i answered nigel cholmondeley said you couldnt do anything unless i came up with something extraordinary well here he is mr antanas sudalds i wasnt making all the sense i might have more than a day without sleep will do that to you tony grinned something extraordinary hey i like that madame ruth did not look amused why is he extraordi nary she asked why is he extraordinary wise guy was what her tone said so i told her why in detail and probably repeating myself more than a little i watched her eyebrows or rather the painted lines that showed where they used to live theyd ridden high and skeptical on her forehead when i started but the longer i talked the lower they got when i finished she just said wait here both ofyouse she walked out came back a minute later with nigel chol mondeley okay buster tell him what you just told me so i did i doubt i was any smoother the second time around than i had been the first by the time i was through cholmondeley was rubbing his long horsy chin in specula tion when he spoke it wasnt to me but to tony sudalds my principal objection sir is doubt that perkunas is a power sufficiently powerful please forgive the play on words to achieve the effect desired in the nine beyonds the thunderer not powerful enough tony was a man of direct action i was afraid hed take some now pitching cholmondeley through a wall for instance but he didnt he just said listen once upon a time not so long ago a fanner case of the toxic spell dump invited the devil to his daughters wedding he didnt really want him there so he said the christian god the virgin and a bunch of saints were coming too the devil didnt care then the fanner told him hed invited perkunas and the devil stayed away he remembered how the thunderer had beaten the tar out of him the last time they met if he can do that you think he cant handle something like the one called night madame ruth and cholmondeley looked at each other im no psychic but i could read their minds anyhow perku nas had to be one tough smart power to have survived so long in the predominantly christian thecosystem of europe i wouldnt have wanted to run him up against huitzilopochtii or huehueteoti but the one called night wasnt a power on their order of magnitude himself the other variable in the equation was that perkunas hadnt gone down to hell to beat the tar out of the devil could he do it in the nine beyonds even with the advantage id outlined to the virtuous reality practitioners i had no idea i did know i wasnt going to bring it up if the medium and the channeler didnt i was willing to take any chance at all to go after judy again i wanted to persuade them to try again too because i couldnt reach the nine beyonds without em gentlemen do please excuse us nigel cholmondeley said we shall have to consult with each other on the proper course of action to take they went over into the next office which was cholmon deleys last time theyd done that i hadnt heard a thing now madame ruths screeches came right through the wall a moment later so did cholmondeleys shouts i was glad theyd identified what they were doing as a consultation if they hadnt id have called it a brawl but everything was sweetness and light when they came back into madame ruths office madame ruth glared at me scowled at sudalds glared at me again then she said lets go i gaped just like that just like that she said weve got nothing calendared harry turtledove till late this afternoon and either well be able to bring this off by then or eke well end up stuck in the nine beyonds and we wont gotta worry about it so come on on we came tony and i flew to the west hills temple of healing each on his own carpet that sort of thing adds to angels citys traffic nightmares but it was more convenient for both of us because wed be going home in opposite direc tions besides i didnt want to endanger anybody but me if i fell asleep at the fringe we got into the west hills parking lot within a couple of minutes of each other then stood around waiting for chol mondeley and madame ruth i figured theyd be a little while they had to pack up their gear before they flew over tony smoked a cigarillo while we waited hed just ground it out under his heel when their carpet settled itself a couple of spaces over from mine we can go straight up cholmondeley said as he hauled the case toward the doorway i called ahead to make sure mistress adier isnt undergoing any other spiritual therapy at the moment he was more efficient than id given him credit for good i said from the bottom of my heart for it also meant they hadnt had to transfer judy to the ipu or any thing like that they were supposed to call and let you know when they did that but id been away from home all mom ing she hadnt got worse then where she was struck me as bad enough we went up to the fifth floor together waiting for us in judys room along with the constable was hr murad he and madame ruth exchanged unfriendly looks i felt like reminding them they were on the same side but they remembered by themselves murad arranged the chairs for the virtuous reality circle before anyone asked him to and he remembered that circle would have an extra member today this time i shifted judy to the foot of the bed however much id hoped it would it didnt feel as if i were touching the woman i loved her flesh might have been there on the bed but her essence wasnt case of the toxic spell dump nigel cholmondeley slid the virtuous reality helmet onto her head as before he and madame ruth took the seats to either side of her i sat on the other side of madame ruth with tony between me and cholmondeley from his case cholmondeley passed us virtuous reality helmets the room went black as i slipped mine on again as before a few seconds undignified fumbling followed with ab of us trying to find our neighbors hands and then we were back in the nine beyonds blacker than black hot wet fetid somehow i got the idea the one called night knew we were there faster than he had before i couldnt see anything but the space around me already felt tight and strained as if my spirit was trying to fit into a pair of pants a couple of inches too small for it boy this may be the other side but its sure not the highrent district tony sudalds said when he spoke he became visible to me in the midst of the darkness when i met him i thought he looked like somebody whod been a good football player till the competition got too big for him to handle well his virtuous reality image was about seven feet tell and maybe four feet wide through the shoulders big enough to make a good football team not just a player other than size though it looked like tony this is what i warned you about i said mostly to make myself known to him madame ruth and nigel cholmon deley spoke up too and appeared in my second sight as they did so no trace of judy i hadnt expected one but you never give up hope cholmondeley turned to tony sudalds if this is to work it had best work soon the advantage of surprise dont you know he said the longer the one called night has to gather his resources against us the worse our likely plight okay tonys virtuous voice was nearly an octave deeper than the one he really had he reached inside the shirt that had grown with his torso pulled out the little amber amulet id seen him use the first time i walked into his office here though it didnt seem like just amber it shone like a tiny piece of the sun and shed real light through the gloom of the nine beyonds looking at trees and mud and stagnant harry turtledove water wasnt much but it beat looking at hostile smothering black nine ways from sunday in that rumbling thunderous voice tony sudalds called perkunas thunderer hear your loyal subject do for us trapped here in the nine beyonds as you did for the morn ing star at her wedding give us i pray you the nine suns in the sky hed sworn by perkunas and the nine suns a couple of times enough to make me think his god might have some power in the nine beyonds that the one called night wouldnt expect if ever a power seemed ideally suited to in fluence anothers home environment this was the time i waited for what felt like forever though i knew time was to say the least arbitrary in the realm of virtuous reality then that glowing bit of what had been amber flew off the chain around tonys neck and streaked for the black sky surely youve wished on a falling star there in the nine beyonds i wished on a rising one up and up the shining spark flew no matter how high it rose it didnt get any dimmer its progress halted directly over what would have been my head if i could have sensed myself in virtuous reality another pause and then a great explosion of light enough and more to dazzle the eyes i didnt have here the sky stayed black but suddenly nine suns blazed there in the most beautiful ring id ever seen by jove nigel cholmondeley murmured no tony said smugly by perkunas light spread over the nine beyonds for the first time since the one called night shaped his realm from the raw stuff of the other side i could see what was around me and in a different way i could perceive the whole domain at once i could be wrong but i thought each of the nine suns illuminated a different beyond i sensed all nine beyonds all ill say about them is that even illuminated each was less attractive than the next if the one called night had designed this place for his personal comfort well if you ask me he should have hired a decorator case of the toxic spell dump and there off in the distance and yet at the same time close enough to reach out and touch i saw something that didnt belong in this dark jungle judy i cried the one called night might have tried to hide her but he couldnt not with perkunas nine suns blazing down from the black sky no sooner had i called her name than she stood there beside me as ive said virtuous reality images have a way of improving on mundane reality not you understand that i ever thought judy needed improving on but seeing her there made me understand all at once how beatrice must have looked to dante dante hadnt needed virtuous reality to see that way but dante was an artist and a genius me im just an epa man however it had come to me i knew id cherish judys virtuous image the rest of my days you know what else by her expression i didnt look half bad to her either she said thank you david i was beginning to be afraid id never get out of this dreadful place i never lost hope but i was worried when the one called night hid me from you the last time you came here whenever that was i wondered if anyone could sense me but you found a way i never lost hope either i said i the light that fibed the nine beyonds got dimmer i looked up into the sky the nine suns were still there but they seemed to fade more with every apparent second i watched we have to escape at once madame ruth said urgently this is the domain of the one called night perkunas and the nine suns may have taken him by surprise but perkunas is not the ruling power here my colleague is correct nigel cholmondeley said we must break the virtuous reality circle remember your fleshly forms will them to separate one from the other to loose the hands you are now holding quickly i concentrated on the body id left behind at the west hills temple of healing remembering i had hands let alone moving them took more effort than i thought i had in me and all the while the nine beyonds got darker and harry turtledove darker and darker i felt the power of the one cabed night closing in around us and then i was back in room again i was still holding hands with tony sudakis and madame ruth so i hadnt been the one to let go that was the first thing i noticed as i did turn loose of my companions and snatch the virtuous reality helmet off my head only then as i blinked against light that seemed much too bright did i realize the one cabed night hadnt tried to chase us as we left his domain this time you have to understand all that passed through my mind in a fraction of a second and a small fraction to boot then i stopped caring about it because judy had taken off her helmet too she was sitting up in her bed looking over her shoulder at me and smiling bright as all nine suns put together i smiled back so did tony nigel cholmondeley hr murad and the constable whod been keeping watch on her she wasnt wearing her own clothes just a pure white healing gown of virgin linen and all it had in back was a couple of ties that didnt do much to hold it together when judy figured that out she squeaked and wiggled around so the part of the gown that actually covered her was frontways to us then she said to me david i think youd better introduce me to these people you got to me through virtuous reality didnt you thats right i said and did as shed asked after the hel los and thankyous i went on you told me you wanted to get involved in the new technology i dont suppose you wanted to see it from the inside out though no she shook her head so her hair flew every which way a judy gesture id seen since the day i met her it made any tiny doubts id had disappear she was back on this side fully and completely it was still interesting she added td recognize all of you from the way i saw you in the nine beyonds but you david you looked just the same to me cholmondeley and madame ruth gave me an odd look i didnt understand for a second and then i did you need to be a person of unusual virtue brother vahan say to keep case of the toxic spell dump your normal appearance in virtuous reality my ears got hot must be love i muttered very likely nigel cholmondeley said after all were it not for the love you bear for mistress adier she would still be trapped on the other side that only made my ears hotter back in the nine beyonds id idealized judy into an image id cherish all my life while shed seen me just as i am which was the greater compliment i couldnt begin to tell you the constable pulled out a sheet of parchment and a pen where the rest of us were exalted he stayed businesslike can you describe the motivations of the alleged perpetra tors who caused your spirit to be projected into the realm on the other side termed the nine beyonds mistress adier he asked formally you mean why they sent me there judy said sure enough a copy editor to the core she shook her head again they didnt tell me much which was probably sensible from their point of view i think they just didnt want to have to worry about my escaping for a while they had some sort of big plans afoot though i know that much they kept say ing theyd deal with me properly once this other thing whatever it was happened that reminded me she didnt know what had gone on at the devonshire dump or chocolate weasel it also explained why she hadnt been at the chocolate weasel building but i didnt want to think about what those people had intended to do to her once they got the power theyd sought as fast as i could i filled her in on what had been hap pening on this side while she was elsewhere she nodded soberly saying that fits in well with what we were talking about before they kidnapped me im just glad we managed to foil it not we mistress adier tony sudalds said him he pointed right at me if he hadnt thought to summon the garuda bird wed all have been in the soup somebody had to do something i said seeing the admiring look judy was giving me i added what i think ill do is hire tony to do my advertising for me the other thing harry turtledove a you have to remember is that if it hadnt been for his perku nas and the nine suns we couldnt have rescued you yeah but you were the one who thought of that too and made madame ruth and cholmondeley here go along with it even when they werent what youd call enthusiastic tony said the virtuous reality duo nodded vigorously well if you insist on giving me the credit you know what i said tm gonna take it everybody laughed and clapped hands judy said do i have any clothes here besides this peep show of a gown now that im living in my body again all i want to do is check myself out of here where exactly am i anyhow this is the west hills temple of healing mistress adier hr murad said he opened the closet pointed to a tunic and trousers these are the garments in which you were discovered they have been laundered subsequent to their detailed examination by the constabulary i dare say theyd needed laundering too i wondered how long judys body had worn them and soiled them while her spirit was trapped in the nine beyonds she must have been thinking the same thing for she said theyll do to get me out then i think ill bum them as you wish mistress adier hr murad said one formality yet remains before you can be released judy gave him a classic makeitsnappy look it took effect hastily he went on i must certify you as sound before sending you down to the business office go ahead then judy said visibly composing herself as one who worked with magic she knew the importance of adhering strictly to rules and procedures to give hr murad his due he made the examination the formality hed told judy it would be he took her pulse and blood pressure then said please recite the creed of your faith shma yisroayl adonai dohaynu adonca ekhod judy said and then for good measure repeated it in english hear israel the lord our god the lord is one hr murad made cryptic notes on her chart when he was case of the toxic spell dump through scribbling he said i have the pleasure of pronouncing you physically and spiritually sound then please leave all of you and let me get dressed she said adding david when im done with their business people will you take me home sure i said well have to let the long beach and angels city constables know youre well theyll both want to talk with you but i went on quickly to keep her from throwing the bud vase on the night table at me we dont have to do it right now ill take care of that the ac constable on guard duty said he grinned til give you a fade while though thanks judy said we all trooped outside hr murad went off to see another patient nigel cholmondeley and madame ruth headed for the slide so did die constable i turned to tony sudakis thanks more than i can say no problem he brushed it aside tm just glad every thing worked out listen i gotta get back to work i hope i see you around long as youre not investigating my dump theyll send somebody else out there from now on i told him tve got a conflict of interest he grinned slapped me on the back and took off i waited in the corridor right across from me was a sign with big red letters intensive prayer unit all visitors must be blessed before entering i just looked at it gladder than i can say that judy hadnt had to pass through those portals she came out of her room i had to show her where the business office was down on the ground floor she knew nothing of how shed come here but what id told her the business people were inclined to be huffy with her until she said the magic words blue scutum then suddenly everything was easy though she did have to spend a while filling out the bs forms at last we went out to the parking lot and buckled our selves onto my carpet before we took off i leaned over and gave her a kiss she grabbed me we hugged for a while before i puddled up i started flying her home i took every thing slow and easy keeping in mind how tired i was harry turtledove it was the middle of the day so traffic was easy practically everybody at her block of flats had gone to work we had to use my entry talisman she didnt have hers oh god its good to be here she said when we went in the curtains were open she shut them then she went into the kitchen and opened the icebox i heard her duck in distress have to throw most of this stuff out but oh good theres still some beer in here beer i echoed she clucked again this time at my foolishness for the cup of roots she explained as if i werent very bright and at the moment i wasnt she came back into die front room where i was standing like a lost soul she did her best to remedy that this loss she gave me well if my eyelids were window shades theyd have been flapping on their spindles from being yanked up too hard heres what im going to do she said ticking off points on her fingers neat and organized as usual tm going to drink the cup of roots im going to get out of these clothes never ever put them on again and take a shower to help me forget i was wearing them then im going to put on some thing i hope youll think is more interesting and try and thank you property for getting me back from the nine beyonds how does all that sound wonderful i said hoarsely good it sounds wonderful to me too she gulped down the cup of roots then took off her clothes right there in the middle of the living room when i tried to grab her she skipped back away from me go sit down she said i do want to get clean i wont be long i prom ise all right all right i said and went over and sat down to prove it she nodded in approval and headed off toward the bath room the water in there started to run i fell asleep on the couch judy eventually forgave me though she hasnt let me for get about it all i ever wanted from the minute i landed in the devonshire dump case was to get tilings back to normal case of the toxic spell dump again brushing the edge of armageddon is for saints and heroes not a working stiff like me i have to say im making progress judy and i set our date and i solemnly promised to stay awake for the wedding and the night after too youd better or ill have it with some body else she told me but we were both joking and we both knew it so that was all right i still havent caught up on all my work im gaining but ive spent so much time in court lately that i havent been at my desk as much as id need to dig out from under the back log but helping give the people who kidnapped judy and almost wrecked angels city plus god knows how much of the rest of the confederation just what they deserve has its own satisfaction and for that matter i wont be out of court even after those trials are done one thing i did manage to accomplish was the report on the environmental impact of introducing leprechauns into angels city i didnt see any problems with it especially after the chumash powers became irrelevant to the prognostication after bea read the report she said nice things about me in monday staff meeting or so im told i wasnt there at the time somehow i bear up under the dis appointment but save our basin decided to contest my findings so that case should drag on more or less into eternity my guess is that any possible damage the wee folk might cause would cost less to fix than all the litigation about them but im just a dumb inspector they dont pay me to make policy and ive been working on one other thing not long after all the commotion ive been talking about here i happened to notice a tiny item in the times to the effect that one char les kelly an assistant administrator with the environmental perfection agency back in dsfcc had resigned and been replaced by a chap named gupta singh did charlie jump or was he pushed i didnt know then and i dont know now i looked at the little story and thought about how much trouble had come about and how much more could have come about from the way hed handled the devonshire dump case not only had he given it to me harry turtledove informally hed been coy about feeding me information i needed like anything and then hed fled like an exorcised demon when i counted on him most people had died in part because charlie didnt handle his job the way he was supposed to even more to the point as far as i was concerned id almost lost the most important person in my life i know that on a cosmic scale my priorities there are skewed but i dont weigh myself on a cosmic scale and what had happened to charlie because hed screwed up and chickened out hed left his job and he might not even have been forced out of it that was all it didnt seem enough somehow i know what youre thinking youre thinking i took out a compact on him sony no bloody vengeance isnt my style besides i dont know any mages who know that kind of demon and i didnt care to go looking for one charlie wasnt worth jeopardizing my soul for either but still i left it in the back of my mind the place where things stew while you take care of more immediate concerns finally just before i got called to the witness box one day i had an idea i liked unfortunately doing something about it didnt prove as easy as id hoped the first time i called back to dstc i couldnt get the information i needed frustrated but not i resolved beaten i put the idea back into the stewpot and let it simmer while i went on with the rest of my life a couple of days later while i was gulping down a burger at the courthouse cafeteria better than the one at the con federal building but not much i knew where i could get my answer once youve made connections youre a fool if you dont use them so i called central intelligence identified myself and asked to speak to the fellow whod let me know henry legion had shuffled off this mortafcoil i didnt have a name with which to identify him but i hoped ci would be able to get around that sure enough inside a minute he was saying good day mr fisher im glad everything worked out well for you and your lady case of the toxic spell dump well i shouldnt have been surprised that central intelligence knew about such things thanks i managed what can i do for you today he asked i told him what i wanted and why i wanted it til only use it the once i promised if you like ill take a formal oath on that no need mr fisher he said the phone imp in my ear reproduced a curious scratchy noise i identified as a chuclde just between you me and the wall id say youve earned the right to use it any way you like dont stay on the ether now ill call you back in a couple of minutes with what you need i hung up pretty soon just as promised the phone yarped i answered it wrote down what the chap from cen tral intelligence gave me thanked him again and hung up then all i had to do was wait since i was doing this for my convenience not charlies i waited till saturday night my sabbath was over so i could use die phone without the slightest sin and i didnt have to get up early and go to work the next morning that counted too for what i had in mind i was yawning when i picked up the phone at my flat but i didnt care i called the number id gotten from central intelligence charlie kell s home phone i listened to the racket it made hello even with phone imps between us charlie sounded drowned in sleep hello charlie i answered brightly this is dave fisher out in angels city how are you this morning jesus he said his voice a littie clearer do you have any idea what time it is since id asked my alarm clock i knew down to the min ute your time its i said just the same time when you called me here to get me into the devonshire toxic spell dump case it turned out all right no thanks to you he started to splutter i hung up you know what phones arent so bad after all
