true when little women the play reopened to many readers the pages of little women the book that delightful chronicle of family life dramatist and producer learned from many unconscious sources the depth of louisa m alcotts human appeal standing one night at the back of the theater as the audience was dispersing they listened to its comments on the play a wonderful picture of home life only we dont have such homes said a big prosperouslooking man to his wife with a touch of regret in his voice yes agreed his young daughter a tall slender graceful girl as she snuggled down cosily into her fur coat and tucked a bunch of violets away from the touch of the frosty night it is beautiful but daddy it isnt real there never was such a family but it is real there was such a family and in letters journals and illustration this little book gives the history of the four little women the alcott girls whom louisa immortalized in her greatest story anna who is meg in little women louisa the irrepressible and ambitious jo elizabeth the little beth of the book and abba may the graceful and statuesque amy rare influences were at work in this ideal american home where the intellectual and brilliant father was gifted in all ways except those that led to material success and the wise and gentle mother combined with her loyalty and devotion to her husband a stanch practical common sense which more than once served to guide the frail alcott bark through troubled seas following her remarkable success as a writer of short stories louisa m alcott was asked for a book she said at first it was impossible but repeated requests from her publishers brought from her the announcement that the only long story she could write would be about her own family little women resulted and in erecting this house of delight for young and old louisa alcott builded better than she knew her jo has been the inspiration of countless girls and the manysidedness of her character is indicated by the widely diverging lines of endeavor which jos example has suggested to the girl readers of the story in the case of the two editors both from early childhood found their inspiration in jo one patterning after her idol sought success in a stage career beginning to act before a mirror with a kitchen apron for a train and a buttonhook for a dagger the other always with a pencil in hand first copied jo by writing lurid tales for the weekly sensation papers and later emerged into newspaper row it was more than a year after the success of little women as a play had become a part of theatrical history that they visited the scenes hallowed by the memories of the little women they wished to see concord together so they made a sentimental journey to the house of alcott the sun was shining and the air was crisp just such a day as miss alcott described in the plumfield harvest home the last chapter in little women they spent hours in orchard house touching reverently the small personal effects of louisa m alcott seeing the shelf between the windows in that little upper room where she wrote and dreamed they even climbed to the garret and wondered which window was her favorite scribbling seat with a tin kitchen for her manuscripts a pile of apples for her refreshment and scrabble the bewhiskered rat for her playfellow through the woods back of orchard house they followed the winding pathway to the hall of philosophy half hidden among the trees where bronson alcott had his conversations where emerson and thoreau were often heard and the most intellectual debates of the century took place at sunset they visited sleepy hollow the resting place of the alcotts with emerson thoreau and hawthorne close by a goodly company neighbors still as they were for so many years when they made concord americas literary shrine evening came and the two pilgrims read together the alcott journals and letters the ink was faded the quaint oldfashioned writing was hard to decipher but beginning with a letter to louisa written by bronson alcott when his daughter was seven years old they read on until the dawn only one result could be expected from such an experience they asked permission to publish the letters and such portions of the journals as would most completely reveal the rare spiritual companionship existing between the alcott parents and children and asking they were refused because of a feeling that the letters and journals were intimate family records to be read not by the many but by the few this same sentiment withheld the dramatization of little women for many years you forget they argued holding fast to the dimly written pages that bronson alcott and louisa alcott are a part of americas literary heritage they belong to the nation to the world not alone to you this course of reasoning finally prevailed but not without many months of waiting and thus with the consent of the alcott heirs the book of little women letters from the house of alcott came to be chapter ii i the alcott boy once upon a time in the little town of wolcott connecticut was born a boy destined to offer to the world new and beautiful thoughts he was laughed at and misunderstood but the thoughts were truth and they have lived although the boy grew weary and old and passed on the boy was amos bronson alcott he was a country lad used from infancy to the rugged life of the farm with its selfdenial and makeshifts the seeming disadvantage however proved quite the opposite his close communion with nature brought him nearer to the truths of life for him god ceased to be a mythical object to be studied and read about on sunday but as he roamed the fields and climbed the hills the lad found him in the rocks and the woodlands and in the sparkling streams he became a reality the boy and god were friends of schooling he had little when work at the farm permitted he attended the country school near his fathers house our copies he told his little daughters were set by the schoolmaster in books made of a few sheets of foolscap stitched together and ruled with a leather plummet we used ink made of maple and oak bark which we manufactured ourselves with this i began keeping a diary of my doings this was when the boy was twelve his hours at school were few but as he went about his daily tasks on the farm his thoughts grew and grew until his mental stature far exceeded his physical he read as he guided the plow along the furrow sometimes unmindful of his work until a sudden punch from a neglected handle as the plow struck a stone would bring him back to earth with a thump he sowed seeds in the moist sweet earth but his face was turned to the skies and he knew the clouds and the stars when he gathered firewood his eyes were keen for the soft dainty mosses the clinging lichens as he picked berries for the home table he never missed the whirr of a bird wing or passed unnoticed the modest flowers half hidden in the soil nature was his library and she spread out her choicest treasures to this growing boy a love for all of gods creations characterized him he was fond not only of the growing things in the wood but of all life his love for animals amounted almost to a passion one reason for his being a strict vegetarian and insisting upon bringing up his little family on a vegetable diet but in boyhood it was not always clear whether humanity or the craving for knowledge made him so considerate of the plodding team in the field never was team more carefully tended many were its hours of grazing when the noonday sun rode high in the heavens and the alcott boy book in hand curled up under the shade of a gigantic elm and read until the shadows began to lengthen but these lapses were only occasional for the lad was faithful to his tasks except when he yielded to the lure of the printed page when scarcely more than a child he began to keep a record of his books and his reading showing the first traces of the reflective introspective quality of mind which later led him to set down in letters and unpublished manuscripts his inmost thoughts he cultivated the same habits of thought in his children one reason doubtless for louisas accurate and realistic descriptions of the lives of the four little women of the alcott family his favorite books in boyhood and for that matter in manhood were the bible and bunyans pilgrims progress which he read and reread and commented upon years later he mentions in his journal that he made it a practice to read pilgrims progress every year which is a remarkable record to the modern boy and girl who find it difficult to struggle through that wonderful allegory even once bronson alcott took his chance and made a steppingstone of every difficulty each obstacle he encountered in getting an education created in him an even stronger determination to gain one the modern boy has the world of books opened wide to him through the library and the free school the treasures of art are spread out before him in the museums he is surrounded by helps the boy of today is studied as an entity the boy of the last century could tell quite a different story so the alcott boy passing long hours in the woods reading thinking getting close to nature and to god walked as one apart seeing the invisible while still a boy he began casting off the garment of a conventional creed and to think for himself of god the creation of life unconsciously putting from him the trammeling cumbersome conventions with which man has often hidden truth out of this the man alcott emerged a great soul ii the alcott man with bronson alcott the craving for knowledge was scarcely stronger than the craving for adventure so it is not surprising that in the first flush of young manhood he did not settle down to life on the farm he longed for the great world lying beyond the hills and valleys of peaceful new england he wanted experience and experience he had he went south hoping to teach school as he had original ideas on the training of children unsuccessful in this he decided to be a peddler naпvely remarking that honesty of purpose could dignify any profession think of the courage of this boy for he was scarcely more than a boy a philosopher at heart living in a world of dreams and books his ambitions all for intellectual rather than material achievement tramping the southern countryside undauntedly peddling buttons elastic pins and needles and supplying all the small wants of the country housewife often he encountered rebuffs sometimes he had a hearty welcome for the visit of the country peddler was eagerly awaited by the children at times when night came and he was far from the shelter of an inn he had to beg a lodging from some planter on one such occasion as he entered the grounds he saw a huge sign beware the dog a shout from the house also warned him and he saw dashing toward him a savagelooking dog powerful enough to have torn to pieces the slender young peddlerstudent but his love for animals triumphed alcott stretched out his hand the huge creature stopped short then recognizing a friend and a fearless one he bounded on tail wagging barking joyously snuggling his nose into the young mans palm which he licked as he escorted his newfound friend to the house animals always recognized in alcott an understanding comrade from most of these trips alcott brought back money to add to the scanty funds at home but on one memorable occasion the love of finery proved stronger than the necessity for saving and he returned to the farm penniless but dressed in the latest fashion having used his savings for a wardrobe that was the wonder of the countryside that one debauch of clothes satisfied him for life after that his tastes were markedly simple with him the dandy period was shortlived indeed that he repented bitterly of this one excess of folly is shown in his journals where he sets down minutely what to him was a mistake that amounted almost to a sin as a rule he was singularly free from folly his thoughts were too high his ideals too lofty for him to be long concerned with trifles such as clothes and the next expenditure mentioned in his journal is for the vicar of wakefield and johnsons rasselas ever impractical one likes him the better for the little human moment when the vanities of the world overcame him at last he secured a school and then began the realization of his ideals regarding the teaching of children his methods were original and highly successful especially with the very young he established a mental kindergarten and the fame of his teaching spread abroad through his work as a teacher he achieved his greatest happiness for it led to his meeting with the woman who was destined to become his wife as the result of correspondence between himself and mr may of brooklyn connecticut whose attention had been attracted to the work of the young teacher alcott then twentyeight years old drove from the wolcott home to brooklyn where he met abigail may of boston who was visiting her brother with both it was love at first sight a love that grew into a perfect spiritual union it seemed almost providential that bronson alcott should have come into abigail mays life at just this time when her heart had been touched by its first great sorrow the loss of her mother hitherto she had been a lighthearted girl fond of dancing and of the material side of life the young philosopher with his dreams and his ideals brought a new interest into her now lonely life and all that was spiritual in her nature responded as he freely discussed his plans and ambitions with her in her he found both sympathy and understanding a year of letterwriting a frank and honest exchange of thought brought out the harmony of their natures and developed in both a sense of oneness laying a firm foundation for the comradeship which was not broken through all the years even when the wife and mother passed into the great beyond the alcottmay courtship was ideal retaining the heaven that lay about him in his infancy keeping his close companionship with god and gods great laboratory nature bronson alcott demanded something more than mere physical attraction in choosing his wife a certain quaint circumspection characterized their lovemaking abigail may once wrote mr alcotts views on education were very attractive and i was charmed by his modesty and long after their engagement she spoke of her lover as her friend he was and so he continued to be in the highest sense of the word so satisfying were those friendshipcourtship days that apparently both were loath to end them for another twelvemonth passed before the announcement of their betrothal and it was nearly three years from the date of their first meeting before their marriage in kings chapel boston where the brother who had been the means of bringing them together performed the ceremony as their marriage day approached there was little festivity and none of the rush that usually precedes a modern wedding everything was simple quiet and sure this is bronson alcotts letter asking a friend to act as best man at his wedding dear sir permit me to ask the favor of your calling at col mays at oclock precisely on sunday afternoon next to accompany me and my friend miss may to kings chapel with esteem a b alcott thursday may franklin st so began the alcott pilgrimage their fortune consisting of love and faith and brains in these they were rich indeed and thus closed another chapter in the life of the gentle philosopher of whom ralph waldo emerson once said our alcott has only just missed being a seraph chapter iii the alcott children for some months after their marriage the alcotts lived in boston where the young enthusiast taught a school for infants again his fame as a teacher traveled and he received an offer from the quakers of philadelphia to start a school there an offer so tempting that the alcotts moved to germantown pennsylvania where anna and louisa were born eugenics and prenatal influence were not discussed then as they are today but in the alcott family nearly a century ago they were being thought and lived bronson alcott and his wife considered children an expression not of themselves but of divinity and as such to be accepted as a trust rather than as a gratification of their own human longing for fatherhood and motherhood they felt it their parental privilege rather than their duty to aid the human development of the child and thus further the fulfillment of its destiny each little soul was humbly asked for and reverently prepared for from the moment they knew their prayer had been granted the individuality and rights of that soul were respected it was considered as a little guest that must be made happy and comfortable carefully cherished mentally and physically while its fleshly garment was being prepared and the little personality made ready for its earthly appearance how careful they were of every thought and influence for to both parents this period was the most sacred and wonderful in their lives and in the lives of their children the depth of his joy and the simplicity of his faith are exquisitely expressed in the lines which bronson alcott wrote before the birth of his first child anna to an expectant mother the long advancing hour draws nigh the hour when lifes young pulse begins its mystic play and deep affections dreams of form or joy shall be unveiled a bodily presence to thy yearning heart and fond maternal eye the primal soul a semblance of thine own its high abode shall leave and dwell in day thyself its forming parent a miracle indeed shall nature work thou shalt become the bearing mother of an infant soul its guardian spirit to its home above but yet erewhile the lagging moments come that layeth the living conscious burden down firm faith may rest in hope accordant toils shall leave no time for fear nor doubt nor gloom love peace and virtue are all born of pain and he who rules oer these is ever good the joyous promise is to her who trusts who trusting gains the vital boon she asks and meekly asking learns to trust aright louisa the second child born on her fathers birthday was the most intellectual and the most resourceful of the alcott children reflecting in her own buoyant personality the happy conditions existing before and at the time of her birth when her father had attained his greatest material prosperity and was also realizing his mental ambitions in his little school and her mother was temporarily relieved from the cares that so often weighed heavily upon her shortly before the birth of elizabeth the father makes this entry in his journal the advent cometh daily am i in expectation of beholding with the eye of sense the spirit that now lingers on the threshold of this terrestrial life and only awaits the bidding of the reaper within to usher itself into the presence of mortals it standeth at the door and waiteth for admission to the exterior scene of things let the time come two little ones in advance await its coming and greetings of joy shall herald its approach the birth of elizabeth is followed by this entry in his journal at sunset this day a daughter was born to us one of the most trying of the alcott familys experiences came after the birth of elizabeth when bronson alcott again in boston aroused a storm of protest with his radical teachings and his advanced interpretations of the bible shocked that the city where he expected to find sympathy and encouragement should have repudiated him his school disrupted and abject poverty his lot broken mentally and physically he met with another cruel disappointment in the death of his infant son yet even then there was no word of bitterness and no mention is made in his journal of the fathers grief indirectly it is expressed in a subsequent entry announcing the birth of the fourth daughter abba may she was born under sunny skies the storm had passed and the alcott family had removed to concord where they enjoyed many of their happiest years a presage of may alcotts artistic gifts her queenly bearing elegance and charm all familiar to readers of little women is found in this entry in the fathers journal july a new life has arrived to us july th she was born with the dawn and is a proud little queen not deigning to give us the light of her royal presence but persists in sleeping all the time without notice of the broad world or ourselves providence it seems decrees that we shall provide selectest ministries alone and so sends us successive daughters of love to quicken the sons of life we joyfully acquiesce in the divine behest and are content to rear women for the future world as yet the ministry is unknown in the culture of the nations but the hour draws near when love shall be felt as a chosen bride of wisdom and the celestial pair preside over all the household of mankind bronson alcott did not feel his responsibility as a father alone he appreciated his own debt to his children the mental and spiritual help that came to him through them an appreciation that found expression in this poem entered in his journal before the birth of elizabeth june invocation to a child she comes from heaven she dawns upon my sight oer earths dark scenes to pour her holy light in sense and blest the infinite to see and feel the heavenly mystery to be she comes in natures tenderest fondest name daughter of god tis she the same the same mine is she too my own my latest child myself wrapt in divinity yet unbeguiled blest infant gods and mine yet to me given that i might feel anew my beings heaven in love and faith to urge my human way till conscious time be lost in immortality love thee i will for thou didst first love me my faith shall quicken as i dwell on thee thy spirit lift me from this grave of things and bear me homeward to the king of kings chapter iv the alcott baby book bronson alcott wrote the first baby book a book which throws new light on the character of the lovable philosopher showing one of new englands intellectual leaders as a very human and lovable man as well as a fond and foolish father his baby book however contains no minute record of the first tooth or when the baby began to say goo and pitty light rather it is the fathers earnest effort to learn how early in life the infant mind begins to awaken to indicate comprehension thought or logic as maeterlinck studied the bee so alcott studied his children and his findings are a revelation even today when the study of the child has become a science mr alcott considered vital the development of the childs individuality and mind the body seemed to him of secondary importance for this disregard of the material care of his family he has been severely censured but not recognizing in his own life the claims of the body devoting all his energies to mental growth it is not surprising that he found his fatherly duty in the guidance of his childrens minds his firm faith in the admonition seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you was to him excuse enough for considering the intellect more than the body his practical shortcomings reaped a rich and unexpected reward in the next generation for louisa m alcott would probably not have developed her original and highly entertaining literary gift without the vicissitudes caused by her fathers impractical nature and his sublime faith that at all times and in all emergencies the lord would provide he did provide but louisa was usually the channel and many of her stories were written under the whip of stern necessity doing without has its advantages the alcott children never overfed overentertained overburdened to baby boredom with dolls and toys and games developed appreciation observation and ingenuity the creative faculty was aroused they found resources within themselves what a handbook louisa might have written on how to be happy though poor mrs alcotts keen sense of humor a characteristic inherited by louisa often came to her rescue and allowed her to get fun out of a harassing situation in a letter to her brother colonel may praising her husbands intellect she laughingly comments upon his disregard of physical necessities i am not sure that we shall not blush into obscurity and contemplate into starvation but to get back to the baby book or as mr alcott called it the psychological history it was started with a high and unselfish motive it was developed to an astonishing degree its purpose and scope are best expressed in this extract from mr alcotts journal the history of a human mind during its progressive stages of earthly experience has never as yet i believe been attempted faithfully compiled from verified data it would be a treasure of wisdom to all mankind replete with light to the metaphysical and ethical inquirer comparative philosophy deduced from an observation of man during all circumstances and stages of his existence is a thing yet unthought of among us from such a work the unity of humanity might be revealed when anna was born the father began keeping a record of her physical and intellectual progress when she was seven weeks old her mother wrote it seems as if she were conscious of his observations and desirous of furnishing him daily with an item for this record the following excerpt from the fathers diary shows how well anna succeeded in her baby attempt i am much interested in the progress of my little girl now five months old which i have recorded from the day of her birth this record has swollen to a hundred pages i have attempted to discover as far as this could be done by external indication the successive steps of her physical mental and moral advancement moral advancement of a baby five months old birth of louisa on november his thirtythird birthday and also the natal day of his friend ellery channing the poet mr alcott chronicles an interesting event how interesting the father little dreamed nor how important not alone to the house of alcott but to the world under the heading of circumstances the father thus records the birth of louisa may alcott a daughter born on the th ulto my birthday being years of age this is a most interesting event unless those ties which connect it with others are formed the wants of the soul become morbid and all its fresh and primal affections become dim and perverted few can be happy shut out of the nursery of the soul while the new england philosopher was studying the development of his little daughters and deducing therefrom facts for his psychological history these same little daughters were developing him for as the child nature unfolded the fathers understanding of childhood expanded thus the baby book grew the influence of children i regard as important to my own improvement and happiness it is also necessary to the prosecution of my studies dwelling in the primal regions which i wish to explore they are the purest manifestations of its phenomena and the only subjects from which humanity is to be interpreted in its purity when anna was three years old and louisa eighteen months the father writes in his journal i passed some time with the children fitting up their playthings conversing with them and learning as far as i could through the subtle meaning of looks accents and gestures their thoughts and feelings the avenues to the spirit are all open but how dim are our perceptions how cold our sympathies to appreciate the pure and bright things which glitter in the arena of the young mind how little of this fairy land do we know we whose early associations have all been swept from the heart over whose spirits have passed the cold winds the pelting storms withering and destroying the hearts young verdure what is there to unite us with the spirit of a child what have we in common with its joyous yearning for the beautiful its trust in human sayings its deep love for those on whom it relies for attention and support its vivid picturing of ideal life its simplicity its freedom from prejudice and false sentiment where are these to be seen in our dim nature he might have answered the question by looking within himself child companionship kept alive the spirit of the alcott boy which constantly shone through the mans philosophy as the boy saw in every rock and tree and flower an expression of the infinite is it any wonder that the man should have recognized gods higher manifestation in the child and should have written in his journal these lines which are the very glorification of fatherhood and reveal the sacredness with which he looked upon his stewardship he who deals with the child deals did he know it with the infinite within the young spirit committed to his care are infinite capacities to be filled infinite energies to be developed and on him devolves the amazing responsibility sacred personal all his own of filling these capacities unfolding these energies from the stores and life of his own spirit this is his office as a parent but how can he who knows nothing of the infinite within himself call it forth and direct its forces in others from the first louisa must have shown strong individuality and unusual tendencies for mr alcotts notes on louisa are entitled observations on the vital phenomena of my second child a more vital lovable contradictory specimen of childhood cannot be imagined blessed with her fathers brilliancy of mind her mothers quick wit and love of fun louisa furnished a problem for endless study she was less than two years old when her individuality had so asserted itself that her father found himself puzzled and admitted that elements were finding their way into his observations of whose origin he could give no account my analysis however accurate and elaborate was still imperfect and i was left in doubt i had made no provision for the admission of innate influences from the mind itself here is a quaint little record of the alcott babies school days when anna was four years old and louisa a little more than two at school anna reads marks and listens to conversations and stories louisa works with her in all except the reading and marking they have a playroom where they enjoy their own amusements uninterrupted by the presence of adults often a bar to the genuine happiness of childhood anna reads simple sentences from leffanochs primer writes intelligibly on tablets and slates and is improving in work and manners this of a baby of four a spiritual and moral inventory of the progress of anna and louisa is set down by the father when his daughters had reached the dignified ages of six and four the children have improved under my training anna who has been with me more of the time than louisa has been greatly benefited she is happier more capable of self control more docile and obeys from love and faith she has fine elements for excellence moral and intellectual if she does not evince a pure and exalted character it will be our failure not hers in the improvement of her natural endowments louisa is yet too young for the formation of just views of her character she manifests uncommon activity and force of mind at present and is much in advance of her sister at the same age example has done much to call forth her nature she is more active and practical than anna anna is ideal sentimental louisa is practical energetic the first imagines much more than she can realize the second by force of will and practical talent realizes all that she conceives but conceives less understanding rather than imagination the gift of her sister seems to be her prominent faculty she finds no difficulty in developing ways and means to obtain her purpose while her sister aiming at much imagining ideal forms of good and shaping them out so vividly in her mind that they become actual enjoyments fails when she attempts to realize them in nature she has been dwelling on the higher and more speculative relations of things both represent interesting forms of character both have wide and useful spheres of action indicated in their conformation and will doubtless if continued to us be real blessings that they did prove real blessings the history of the alcott family has shown illustration a bronson alcott at the age of from the portrait by mrs hildreth page how many fathers ever acknowledge their spiritual debt to the gift of fatherhood as has bronson alcott i know not how much more spiritual i am from the parental relation he writes how much i have been indebted to them for the light that hath dawned upon my own mind from the radiance of their simple spirits certain it is that the more i associate with them in the simple ways they love the more do i seem to revere verily had i not been called to associate with children had i not devoted myself to the study of human nature in its period of infancy and childhood i should never have found the tranquil repose the steady faith the vivid hope that now sheds a glory and a dignity around the humble path of my life childhood hath saved me out of his theories his studies and meditations came a sublime ambition a desire to become a laborer in the field of the soul infancy i shall invest with a glory a spirituality which the disciples of jesus deeply as they entered into his spirit and caught the life of his mind have failed to bring forth in their records of his sayings and life i shall redeem infancy and childhood and if a saviour of adults was given in the person of jesus let me without impiety or arrogance regard myself as the childrens saviour divine are both missions both seek out and endeavor to redeem the infinite in man which by reason of the clogs of sense and custom is in perpetual danger of being lost the chief obstacle in the way of human regeneration is the want of a due appreciation of human nature and particularly of the nature of children home and its influence upon children meant much to mr alcott and in all his writing the nearest approach to a protest against the poverty he was called upon to endure was when for a time he was obliged to give up that home deep is the pathos that lies between the lines of this entry in his journal home for children i deem it very important to the well being of my children to insure them a home at least their means of improvement are limited their pleasures are abridged the domestic relations so vital to virtue to all that lives in the heart and imagination are robbed of their essential glory and the effect is felt throughout the character in after life i feel that my duty as a father cannot be fully carried out when i am thus restricted whether we can yet improve this condition remains to be determined the home was reestablished and such a home an influence felt throughout the world the inspiration of every book louisa alcott wrote chapter v letters and conversations with children happiness reigned in the alcott home and poverty seldom brought with it a shadow the girls had toys and a variety of them rag dolls kittens gingerbread men and barnyard animals the latter skillfully cut out of cake dough by the mother who had a genius for inventing surprises as they grew older they delighted in private theatricals some of their plays written by anna and louisa have been published under the title of comic tragedies they are thrillingly melodramatic thickly sprinkled with villains and heroes witches and ruffians lovely ladies in distress gallant knights to the rescue evil spirits and good fairies gnomes and giants all are direfully tragic and splendidly spectacular louisa as a child showed the dramatic quality which later found artistic expression in her stories on a rainy afternoon the children were never at a loss for entertainment they acted in the attic or played dolls in their own playroom and such dolls old joanna of whom louisa has drawn a lifelike picture in little women is today in existence battered scarred but none the less precious one foot carefully bandaged after the armynurse method poverty was made interesting at christmas a tree was hung with apples nuts and popped corn and small trifles made by the children were fastened to the branches father and mother made much of the spirit of the christ birthday which was celebrated in simple wholesome fashion in vivid contrast to the modern christmas festival the alcott letters and journals show tremendous intellectual activity on the part of the small atoms of humanity who came to grace the alcott home anna and her father held moral and intellectual discussions when anna was four louisa was writing a daily journal before she could more than print as soon as a child could read family reproofs were administered by notes from father and mother to the erring one not only pointing out the fault but how to correct it the father encouraged his daughters to study themselves and to write down their thoughts their journals in consequence reflect the characteristics of each one and are storehouses of information louisa poor little soul in her happy hoydenish childhood found time one day in a fit of mentality to set down in black and white her chief faults one of her most serious according to the selfimposed confession was love of cats a sin which easily beset her all her days for she inherited her fathers love of animals and of children widely varied in character and temperament were the four alcott girls anna the first reflected the beauty the happiness and the romance of the alcotts first year of married life louisa born some eighteen months later when father and mother had grown even closer together through the new bond formed by the love of their little daughter embodied a deeper stronger surer character she was decisive with a determination and surety of self and brilliancy of mind that reflected the best in both parents elizabeth the third child was in some respects the most beautiful character of all about her from the hour of her conception seemed to hover a spiritual protecting love seemingly from earliest infancy she stood on the borderland of the spiritual world in flesh all too fragile to retain the spirit which remembered and longed notwithstanding the love with which she was surrounded to return to the mystical beauty from which she had come a child of dreams and fancies loving all that was harmonious she entered this life at twilight she left it at the dawn a coming and going typical of this dream child who was lent for a little time to make the world more glad the birth of amy is also symbolical the one sunnyhaired sunnyhearted girl of the family who came with the rising of the sun she seemed made for love sunshine and happiness and had them all but she was brave to face hardships and equally ready to accept comfort and luxury a queen the father called her the morning of her birth and so they brought her up the little snow queen the wise fostering love of the father the helpful understanding watchfulness of the mother are reflected in their letters to their children time was not considered wasted that was devoted to these letters of gentle admonition and kindly counsel there was no discussion of faults or mistakes in the alcott household reproofs remained little secrets between father and daughter or mother and daughter and the effect of this wise and constant watchfulness grows more apparent as the children advance from childhood to girlhood and on to womanhood they were taught to know themselves they were taught too the relation of the christ child with their own childhood beautifully expressed in some of the letters from bronson alcott to his eldest daughter it was the fathers habit to write each child on her birthday anniversary and at christmas anna was six years old when he gave her this beautiful description of the coming of the christ for anna to my daughter anna a longer time ago than you can understand a beautiful babe was born angels sang at his birth and stars shone brightly shepherds watched their flocks by their light the babe was laid in his mangercradle and harmless oxen fed by his side there was no room for him nor his mother in the inn as she journeyed from her own home this babe was born at this time of the year his name was jesus and he is also called christ this is his birth night and we call it christmas after him i write you this little note as a christmas gift and

ourselves entirely to its soft desires i live my dear daughter to be good and to do good to all and especially to you and your mother and sisters will you not let me do you all the good that i would and do you not know that i can do you little or none unless you give me your affections incline your ears and earnestly desire to become daily better and wiser more kind gentle loving diligent heedful serene the good spirit comes into the breast of the meek and loveful to abide long anger discontent impatience evil appetites greedy wants complainings illspeakings idlenesses heedlessness rude

that my daughter may know much of the last and little of the first of these feelings i shall try every day to help her to the knowledge and love of this good spirit i shall be with her and as she and

for your reading the vase of flowers fair the desk beside the window where the sun shines warm and bright and there in ease and quiet the promised book you write while i sit close beside you content at last to see that you can rest dear mother i can cherish thee louisa lived to see her hope realized and the dream of many years a beautiful reality like most writers louisa was moody and in her hours of depression and despondency she looked upon her work as a failure and herself as a useless drag upon the family at such times marmee invariably came to the rescue and persuaded her discouraged daughter to use the pen she was ready to lay down even in louisas childhood when her only promise of future literary achievement were her tragedies and melodramas of lurid style little gifts show the mothers faith and pride in her daughters work so did her letters of which this is an example dear louisa i sometimes stray about the house and take a peep into the journal your pages lately are blank i am sure your life has many fine passages well worth recording and to me they are always precious anything like intellectual progress in my children seems to compensate for much disappointment perplexity in my own life do write a little each day dear if but a line to show me how bravely you begin the battle how patiently you wait for the rewards sure to come when the victory is nobly won

bye from your loving elizabeth birthdays were always celebrated with much rejoicing in the alcott household the gift made secondary to the spirit of the day from the time they were old enough to print the alcott children on the mothers birthday made her some little gift accompanying it with a note abba may or may as she was always called at nine years old began in prose but lapsed into poetry dear mother i wish you a very happy birthday i hope you will find my present useful and when you wear it think of me i have taken a greatdeal of pleasure in making it for you please take this present mother on your birthday with the dearest love and wishes of your little daughter a with mrs alcott hardship poverty the grief of seeing her husband misunderstood and often scoffed at never lessened her love for him or her contentment in the marriage relation the year following her marriage in a letter to her brother she wrote my father has never married a daughter or son more completely happy than i am i have cares and soon they will be arduous ones but with the mild constant and affectionate sympathy and aid of my husband with the increasing health and loveliness of my quiet and bright little anna with good health clear head grateful heart and ready hand what can i not do when surrounded by influences like this ideals were never shattered illusions if so they may be called were never lost by mrs alcott through the stormy years that laid between the first happy months of her married life and the sunset days when all her burdens were laid down to her the husband who was so long denied material success and intellectual sympathy ever remained the lover and friend her admiration for him was unbounded her faith in him complete so high she held him in heart and mind that it was difficult even for those who loved him most to appreciate her estimate of him as poet philosopher and sage concerning the most famous portrait ever made of bronson alcott done in crayons by mrs richard hildredth wife of the historian and aunt of the portrait painter george fuller which beautiful as it was did not satisfy the wifes ideal mrs alcott writes a tinge of the incomprehensible lies softly around it a field of atmosphere as if she had worked with down from an angels wing rather than with a crayon as if the moonlight had cast a shadow on the lights of her picture and a divinity had touched with a soft shade the dark portion of the figure mrs hildredth has changed the costume from a dress suit to a mantle draped about the shoulders this i do not like the chaste simplicity of mr alcotts dress is more in character and keeping with the severe simplicity and rectitude of his life louisa admirably describes her fathers appearance as she met him at the cars his dress was neat and poor he looked cold and thin as an icicle but serene as god after such a testimony from such a daughter he can afford to dress shabbily contentment whatever her lot was an attribute of marmee she underestimated herself always unquestionably louisa inherited her literary gift quite as much from mother as from father and flashes of the quaint humor so delightful in the daughters books are found in the mothers letters to a friend she writes my gifts are few i live love and learn and find myself more content every day of my life with humble conditions louisa alcott never laid claim to poetic gift but on a few occasions her verses take to themselves true poetic beauty one of the most exquisite of these poems was written by her on the death of her mother and was first published anonymously in the masque of poets of transfiguration in memoriam mysterious death who in a single hour lifes gold can so refine and by thy art divine change mortal weakness to immortal power bending beneath the weight of eighty years spent with the noble strife of a victorious life we watched her fading heavenward through our tears but ere the sense of loss our hearts had wrung a miracle was wrought and swift as happy thought she lived again brave beautiful and young age pain and sorrow dropped the veils they wore and showed the tender eyes of angels in disguise whose discipline so patiently she bore the past years brought their harvest rich and fair while memory and love together fondly wove a golden garland for the silver hair chapter vii childrens diaries the alcott children were brought up to think for themselves to reflect and to give expression to their thoughts never laughed at they were not afraid to speak or write of what was in their minds each kept a diary and no incident that concerned the little girls was too trivial for mention in the record of the day these incidents collected give a more comprehensive view of the alcotts as a family than do the fathers voluminous journals illustration anna bronson alcott from a daguerreotype page when anna was ten she gravely explains under date of april father was too unwell to come down stairs and mother ironed louisa and i helped a little while i wrote my journal and a journal for louisa as she thought she could not write well enough i had no other lessons than that we watched a little spider and gave it some water to drink in the afternoon mother read loud the story of the good aunt or part of it while we sewed on the clean clothes i mended up the holes and louisa and lizzy sewed on a sheet in the evening we played mother lets us play in the evening we went to bed soon this sewing bee recalls the long evenings in the march home described in little women when the four girls and the mother sewed dutifully on sheets for aunt march dividing seams into countries discussing europe asia africa and america as they stitched when she was twelve annas literary aspirations sought a vent in attempted poetry later she collaborated with louisa in writing the comic tragedies annas confidante and comrade louisa was frequently the victim of these poetic effusions her reception of which gives quite a line on her ardent temperament this entry in annas journal for april is eloquent this morning i rose pretty early after breakfast i read and wrote stories in the afternoon i wrote some letters and the following one to louisa louisa dear with love sincere accept this little gift from me it is with pleasure i send this treasure and with it send much love to thee sister dear never fear god will help you if you try do not despair but always care to be good and love to try in the evening i read in a book called stories on the lordsprayer i talked with louisa after i went to bed and she pinched me on my leg two or three years later anna writes monday mother went to boston and louisa and i cleaned house all day i love order above all things and i take great pleasure in seeing all neat about the house tuesday i worked hard till oclock when we all met to sew while mother read aloud from miss bremers brothers and sisters it is most beautiful such a happy family i think miss bremer would make a lovely mother the mothers in her books are so sweet and she has beautiful idears about familys i love to read natural stories wednesday th we rose very early and eat breakfast i think it is a dreadful thing to grow old and not be able to fly about but then i suppose i shall not care about flying when i grow older still it is horrid to think about being an old woman all wrinkled and blind i wish i could keep young forever i should love to live among all those i love and be with them all the time reading was a part of the daily routine in the alcott household and annas taste for german recalls vividly certain episodes between meg and john brooks in little women friday th i read one of krummachers parables in german i think they are very beautiful the language is so elegant i love to hear beautiful words and these stories are told so simply and are full of such sweet thought i found a great many which have never been translated and i intend to try myself to translate them i think it is the pleasantest thing i do to read german it is such a splendid language i mean elizabeth shall learn to read it she will enjoy it so much saturday th in the afternoon i sewed and louisa read me a very silly story called the golden cup i think there is a great deal of nonsense written now a days the papers are full of silly stories sunday th i have been reading lately a very beautiful book given me by my mother it is characteristics of women by mrs jameson i like it very much it is a description of shakespears heroines portia is my favorite she was so noble and i liked the trial scene better than any of shakespears that i ever read i think this part is beautiful let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he love he make a swan like end fading in music i think this was a beautiful idea i passed a pleasant morning in school translating one of krummachers beautiful parables i find great pleasure in this i like german better than i do french i want much to study italian i have tried myself several times but cannot manage it without help i think i should be very happy if i could go to school i think about it most all the time and when i am in bed i imagine myself in boston going to miss peabodys school with other girls and know that i am learning something and i think i lead rather too solitary a life i love to see people mother read in the afternoon from miss sedgwicks letters it was about the germans she says they are a very cheerful people and though poor yet they always have a happy smile and cheerful face that their manners are beautiful they are so kind and simple i know i should love them for i like everything german except their food which i think must be horrid greasy cabbage and sour bread that seems bad i should think they are so fond of beautiful things music poetry and flowers that they would not like such stuff september friday st i walked before breakfast the sun was bright and there was a cool wind the lane was full of beautiful flowers and the grass was green and fresh i had a lovely walk and gathered a bunch of goldenrod spirian and gerandia everything was so beautiful that all my unhappy thoughts of last night flew away i sometimes have strange feelings a sort of longing after something i dont know what it is i have a great many wishes i spent the day in the usual manner sewing and studying in the evening louisa and i walked through the lane and talked about how we should like to live and dress and imagined all kinds of beautiful things sunday rd i sewed all day and mother read from miss sedgwicks letters i will write a piece of poetry as i have nothing very pleasant to write about oh when thy heart is full of fears and the way is dim to heaven when the sorrow and the sin of years peace from thy soul has driven then through the mist of falling tears look up and be forgiven and then rise up and sin no more and from thy dark ways flee let virtue oer thy appetites have full and perfect mastery and the kindly ones that hover oer will ever strengthen thee and though thou art helpless and forlorn let not thy hearts peace go and though the riches of this world are gone and thy lot is care and woe faint not but journey ever on true wealth is not below oh falter not but still look up let patience be thy guide bless the rod and take the cup and trustfully abide let not temptation vanquish thee and the father will provide louisa composed these lines which i think are beautiful she is a beautiful girl and writes as good poetry as lucretia davidson about whom so much has been written i think she will write something great one of these days as for me i am perfect in nothing i have no genius i know a little of music a little of french german and drawing but none of them well i have a foolish wish to be something great and i shall probably spend my life in a kitchen and die in the poorhouse i want to be jenny lind or mrs seguin and i cant and so i cry here is another of louisas pieces to mother god comfort thee dear mother for sorrow sad and deep is lying heavy on thy heart and this hath made thee weep there is a father oer us mother who orders for the best and peace shall come ere long mother and dwell within thy breast then let us journey onward mother and trustfully abide the coming forth of good or ill whatever may betide helpfulness was encouraged in the alcott household habits of industry were carefully fostered the alcott children worked when they worked played when they played but wasted hours were unknown they were taught to make the most of every day when anna was seventeen she wrote in her diary august thursday th lizzy and i are making plans for spending our days usefully here is mine plan rise at half past bathe dress and walk till half past dress and bathe the children breakfast at work till school till work till sew till practice till hear lizzy recite german and french till supper this will keep me pretty busy but i find i accomplish so much more when i have a plan and certain times for certain things i never can do things without order i like to have something planned for every moment of the day so that when i get up in the morning i may know what to do i wish i could be learned an entry in louisas diary during the fruitlands period gives this insight into one of her average days when a child of eleven i rose at five and after breakfast washed the dishes and then helped mother work i took care of may in the afternoon in the evening i made some pretty things for my dolly father and mr lane had a talk and father asked us if we saw any reason for us to separate mother wanted to she is so tired i like it but not the school part or mr l note too that when it came to a conference concerning family affairs the father asked the advice of his elevenyearold daughter instead of following the more customary method of withholding from her the family confidence and deferring discussion of plans until the children had gone to bed know thyself was ever the aim of bronson alcott in the training of his children and mr lane at fruitlands followed this same line of mental development this is one of his sample lessons which louisa alcott has copied into her journal sample of our lessons what virtues do you wish more of asked mr l i answer patience love silence obedience generosity perseverance industry respect selfdenial what vices less of idleness wilfulness vanity impatience impudence pride selfishness activity love of cats in this same lesson comes the twelveyearold louisas explanation of the difference between faith and hope faith can believe without seeing hope is not sure but tries to have faith when it desires louisas love of nature her trained habits of thought her poetic imagination and her keen appreciation of beauty are indicated in this entry in her journal written at fruitlands in or when she was a child of ten or eleven i wrote in my imagination book and enjoyed it very much life is pleasanter than it used to be and i dont care about dying any more had a splendid run and got a box of cones to burn sat and heard the pines sing a long time had good dreams and woke now and then to think and watch the moon i had a pleasant time with my mind for it was happy chapter viii girlhood and womanhood familiar to every reader of little women is the march familys quaint brown house with its many windows its oldfashioned garden its homely homelike air its unfailing hospitality this home as described by louisa m alcott is a picture of the alcott home at concord the scene of the girlhood and young womanhood of the alcott children many of louisas books were written there little women was lived there in concord anna met john pratt and the first love story in little women is annas life romance there little beth passed from the material to the spiritual life and amy first developed the artistic talents which later caused her work to be sought for by art museums and private collectors annas marriage was a great trial to louisa for from early childhood the two girls had been inseparable companions and after annas marriage louisa learned to look upon john as her brother louisas diary in the april following the passing of elizabeth touches upon the change of homes in concord the absence of may who was studying art in boston of elizabeth and of anna april came to occupy one wing of hawthornes house once ours while the new one was being repaired father mother and i kept house together may being in boston anna at pratt farm for the first time lizzy absent i dont miss her as i expected to do for she seems nearer dearer than before i am glad to know she is safe from pain age in some world where her innocent soul must be happy death never seemed terrible to me now is beautiful so i cannot fear it but find it friendly and wonderful illustration abba may alcott from a photograph page amys artistic efforts and her failures in little women are taken from mays actual experiences in concord turning the career of the youngest of the alcott girls into a romance earlier in little women than it actually occurred in life doubtless prevented louisa alcott from chronicling the artistic success of her youngest sister a success to which she largely contributed and in which she took great pride may alcotts pictures are found today in art museums and in leading private collections in this country and abroad her copies of turner are remarkable in the kensington gallery in london students are given them to study in preference to the originals several fine examples are in american museums and a few are owned by members of the alcott family when the alcotts moved into orchard house the girls painted and papered the interior themselves may filled the nooks and corners with panels on which she painted birds and flowers over the fireplaces she inscribed mottoes in old english characters the study in orchard house was the real center of the household for the chimney piece ellery channing wrote an epigram which may alcott painted upon it and which has been used in the stage reproduction of little women the hills are reared the valleys scooped in vain if learnings altars vanish from the plain in orchard house today walls doors and window casings are etched with may alcotts drawings many preserved under glass including a miniature portrait of a little girl naпvely and modestly inscribed the artist high thoughts and cheerful minds triumphed over poverty in those concord days shortly after the familys return from fruitlands louisa wrote for ellen emerson the fairy stories flower fables she was at the time only sixteen this was her earliest published work and it was many years before she achieved literary fame although as did jo in little women she materially helped in the support of the family by writing lurid tales literature rather than commerce freed the alcotts from the burden of debt louisas fame was the result neither of accident nor of a single achievement but had for its background the whole generous past of her family her hospital sketches were her letters home when she was serving as hospital nurse during the civil war little women is a chronicle of her family louisa certainly made good use of the vicissitudes of the alcotts she always saw the funny side and was not afraid to make book material of the home experiences elevating or humiliating her books number between twentyfive and thirty nearly every one takes its basic idea from some real experience the books written by the alcott family including some eight or ten published by mr alcott louisas output and one or two written by may fill two shelves of an alcove devoted to concord authors in the alcott town library annas little sons familiarly known in the alcott household as freddie and johnnie or jack gave to bronson alcott in his later days fresh opportunity for his favorite study childhood to both boys came frequent messages and gifts from grandpa grandma and aunt louisa louisa alcott sent to freddie this poem on his third birthday a song for little freddie on his third birthday down in the field where the brook goes lives a white lammie with a little black

greetings to their younger grandson grandma alcott to johnny th birthday june th giving song all day long under the elm or willow with sunshine shed on the little head that rests on grandmas pillow to and fro let it go while inside piping cheery as he takes his rest in his hangbirds nest lies grandmas little deary grandpa alcott to johnny june th a fine little sword for gallant capt jack as he marches down the hill his army at his back no giants will it kill since its only made for show and the best way to fight is a kiss for a blow in these days of private secretaries laborsaving devices and specialization it is difficult to comprehend the obstacles that louisa alcott encountered in writing her day was filled with other tasks housework sewing teaching nursing yet the pen was never idle the busy brain was never still her power of concentration made it possible for her to write under harassing conditions this is her own description of her methods of work my methods of work are very simple and soon told my head is my study and there i keep the various plans of stories for years sometimes letting them grow as they will till i am ready to put them on paper then it is quick work as chapters go down word for word as they stand in my mind and need no alteration i never copy since i find by experience that the work i spend the least time upon is best liked by critics and speakers any paper any pen any place that is quiet suit me and i used to write from morning till night without fatigue when the steam was up now however i am paying the penalty of twenty years of over work and can write but two hours a day doing about twenty pages sometimes more though my right thumb is useless from writers cramp while a story is under way i live in it see the people more plainly than real ones around me hear them talk and am much interested surprised and provoked at their actions for i seem to have no power to rule them and can simply record their experiences and performances materials for the childrens tales i find in the lives of the little people about me for no one can invent anything so droll pretty or pathetic as the sayings and doings of these small actors poets and martyrs in the older books the events are mostly from real life the strongest the truest and i yet hope to write a few of the novels which have been simmering in my brain while necessity and unexpected success have confined me to juvenile literature i gave mrs moulton many facts for her article in famous women and there are many other sketches which will add more if they are wanted the first edition of jos boys was twenty thousand i believe and over fifty thousand were soon gone since january i know little about the sales people usually ask how much have you made i am contented with a hundred thousand and find my best success in the comfort my family enjoy also a naughty satisfaction in proving that it was better not to stick to teaching as advised but to write illustration louisa may alcott from a daguerreotype page with all her love for her father irreverent louisa delighted in making fun of him the complacent philosopher with his voluminous journals his several books in manuscript his liking despite the brilliancy of his conversations for the written rather than the spoken word was a wasteful user of paper and a careless dispenser of ink that her father enjoyed her goodnatured banter is shown by the fact that in his journal he has entered the following poem written by louisa at nineteen from louisa on my nd birthday nov th to father a cloth on the table where dear plato sits by one of the graces was spread with the single request that he would not design new patterns with black ink or red and when he is soaring away in the clouds i beg hell remember and think though the blackbirds are fair his cloth will be fairer for not being deluged with ink may plenty of paper of pens and of quiet to my dear pa forever be given till he has written such piles that when on the top he can walk calmly on into heaven chapter ix friendships and beliefs rare friendships existed among the great minds of that period when transcendentalism in america was first talked and lived a close bond of sympathy uniting bronson alcott emerson thoreau ellery channing margaret fuller and elizabeth peabody such association made its impress upon the alcott daughters annas diary is filled with references to visits with the emersons louisas deal less with the family and more with the intellectual life of the great philosopher whom she made her idol through life he was her stanch and understanding friend the apostles of the newness was the scoffing term applied to these literary giants of new england by those who lacked the mental and spiritual insight to recognize greatness in others this attitude of ridicule was largely responsible for the continued attacks upon the dial a quarterly issued by the transcendentalists edited from to by emerson margaret fuller george ripley and thoreau between its modest covers were many of the intellectual masterpieces of the time its rare volumes are still treasurehouses of literature which today command any price mr alcott selected its title and was to a large extent responsible for its policy his orphic sayings in the dial now looked upon as classics were the butt of the press at the time and the derision of boston society in these orphic sayings he gave this remarkable definition of reform reforms are the noblest of facts extant in time they work for eternity dwelling with men they are with god conversation among these friends was neither trivial nor useless and in the alcott circle which included emerson thoreau theodore parker william henry channing james freeman clarke elizabeth peabody mrs cheney and other of the early transcendentalists later on augmented by james russell lowell and nathaniel hawthorne a series of drawingroom symposiums was established with alcott whom emerson called serious and superior as a leader much of the substance of these conversations is found in the alcott journals and in the unpublished manuscripts of the poetphilosopher in concord the alcotts once more enjoyed the literary companionship they craved emerson was a near neighbor thoreau had his cabin at walden where he had established a community of one to and from boston came others of the transcendental group and concord became the center of thought for new england thinking however was not the only occupation of bronson alcott dreamer he was but he delighted in toil and ever upheld the dignity of labor not ashamed nor afraid to work for hire as a laborer in his neighbors field while nightly conducting drawingroom conversations with a company of peers and students when thoreau built his cabin alcott helped him they cut the trees from emersons grove while emerson was abroad they built a summerhouse for him on his grounds it stood for many years a picturesque temple of friendship william henry channing mentions a morning spent there reading margaret fullers italian letters may alcott has made drawings of it which were published in a volume of concord sketches that also contained her drawing of hawthornes house mr alcott practically rebuilt orchard house for his own family mrs child a friend of mrs alcott thus describes this home which is now preserved as a memorial to louisa m alcott and is visited by thousands every year when they bought the place the house was so very old that it was thrown into the bargain with the supposition that it was fit for nothing but firewood but mr alcott had an architectural taste more intelligible than his orphic sayings he let every old rafter and beam stay in its place changed old ovens and ash holes into saxon arched alcoves and added a washerwomans old shanty to the rear the result is a house full of queer nooks and corners with all manner of juttings in and out it seems as if the spirit of some old architect had dropped it down in concord thoreau master builder himself has paid to bronson alcott this tribute one of the last of the philosophers connecticut gave him to the world he peddled first her wares afterwards as he declares his brains these he peddles still bearing for fruit only his brain like the nut its kernel his words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are aquainted with and he will be the last man to be disappointed when the ages revolve he has no venture in the present but though comparatively disregarded now when his day comes laws unsuspected by most will take effect and rulers will come to him for advice emerson who saw the boy mind beneath the philosophers dignity said tenderly of bronson alcott he is certainly the youngest man of his age we have seen when i looked at his gray hairs his conversation sounded pathetic but i looked again and they reminded me of the gray dawn even his friends to say nothing of louisa occasionally poked fun at him for chronicling so minutely all his thoughts ellery channing called his library encyclopediea de moimeme en cents volumes yet these journals and records are now worth more than the fine library he collected and in which he delighted emerson has thus described the origin of the fruitlands community on the invitation of james p greaves of london the friend and fellowlaborer of pestalozzi in switzerland mr alcott went to england in mr greaves died before his arrival but mr alcott was received cordially by his friends who had given his name to their school alcott house ham near london he spent several months in making acquaintance with various classes of reformers on his return to america he brought with him two of his english friends chas lane and h c wright and mr lane having bought a farm which he called fruitlands at harvard mass they all went there to found a new community the fruitlands experiment and its failure have been immortalized by louisa alcott in her transcendental wild oats the detail of it is thus described by a friend of the alcott family who had the story from bronson alcott himself the crop failures necessitated the community living on a barley diet as anything animal was not allowed not even milk and eggs now and then they gave a thought as to what they should do for shoes when those they had were gone for depriving the cow of her skin was a crime not to be tolerated the barley crop was injured in harvesting and before long want was staring them in the face the alcotts remained at fruitlands till midwinter in dire poverty all the guests having taken their departure as provisions vanished friends came to the rescue and mr alcott concluded with pathos in his voice we put our little women on an oxsled and made our way to concord so faded one of the dreams of my youth i have given you the facts as they were louisa has given the comic side in transcendental wild oats but mrs alcott could give you the tragic side indeed it was always mrs alcott who could have given the tragic side skillfully as she kept her worries hidden her own family indignant because bronson alcott could not better provide the material needs for his family on more than one occasion besought the faithful wife to leave him a letter from her brother urging this step drew forth from her a defense of bronson alcott which the husband enters in his journal as follows november passages of a letter from my wife to one who misapprehends and perverts my life and purposes if i do not mistake the spirit as well as letter of your remark you would have us believe that a righteous retribution has overtaken us or my husband and we are one and that the world is justly punishing him for not having conciliated it by conforming to its wills and ways you say that my husband was told ten years ago that the world could not understand him it perhaps fell dead on his ears and ever will there is no human voice can convince him that the path he has chosen to tread thorny bleak solitary as it is is not the right one for him just so did that man of nazareth whom all the world profess to admire and adore but few to imitate and these few are the laughingstock of the christian community they are branded as visionaries and fools but this little band when alone and disencumbered of idle observation enjoy the recital of their privations they have been reviled but they revile not again they know sorrow and are acquainted with grief and yet there is joy in that group of sinless men such as angels might desire to partake of i am not writing poetry but i have tried to place before your mind in as brief but clear a manner as i am able our real condition and mr alcotts merit as a man who though punished and neglected by a wicked world has much to console and encourage him in the confidence and cooperation of some of the wisest and best men living ten such were they permitted in their several vocations to act as teachers preachers and printers would save our wicked city from the ruin that awaits it but they are turned like the nazarene into solitary places to lament the blindness and folly of mankind who are following the vain and fleeting shadow for the real and abiding substance but to return to mr alcott is he to sell his soul or what is the same thing his principles for the bread that perisheth no one will employ him in his way he cannot work in theirs if he thereby involve his conscience he is so resolved in this matter that i believe he will starve and freeze before he will sacrifice principle to comfort in this i and my children are necessarily implicated we make and mean to make all the sacrifices we can to sustain him but we have less to sustain us in the spirit and therefore are more liable to be overcome of the flesh he has for a long time gone without everything which he could not produce by labor from his own place that no one could in truth reproach him with wantonly eating of the fruits of anothers labor he was sent for by friends in hingham to talk with them which he did two evenings his expenses were paid and put into his hands as a slight compensation for the benefit they felt he had conferred upon them by his conversations i should like to copy the note accompanying it but you never care to see how his fellow fanatics rave on these holy themes life duty destiny of man thus he occasionally finds a market for his thoughts and experiences which though inadequate to our support is richly prized as the honest gains of an innocent and righteous labor you spoke of his poetical wardrobe whether in satire or in a worthier spirit i cannot tell however spiritual he may have become there is still enough of the carnal to feel the chills of winter and the chiller blasts of satire his tatters are the rags of righteousness and keep him warmer than they would anyone whose spirit was less cheered and warmed by the fires of eternal love and truth an appreciative account of mr alcotts famous school in the masonic temple boston is found in the record of a school edited by elizabeth peabody published in republished in the conversations with children on the gospels edited by mr alcott in two volumes appearing in caused such a commotion in boston as to result in the downfall of the temple school reading these conversations today one is impressed with the modern quality of their thought they were forerunners of that higher criticism which with the bible student now supplants the old blind acceptance without reflection of even obscure biblical passages on philosophy and religion mr alcott and miss peabody delighted to talk and write their discussion of the existence of evil is startlingly modern i do not think that evil should be clothed in form by the imagination writes miss peabody to mr alcott i think every effort should be made to strip it of all individuality all shaping and all coloring and the reason is that evil has in truth no substantial existence that it acquires all the existence it has from want of faith and soul cultivation and that this is sufficient reason why all cultivation should be directed to give positiveness coloring shaping to all kinds of good good only being eternal truth in reply the philosopher thus comments in his diary evil has no positive existence i agree with miss peabody but it has usurped a positive place and being in the popular imagination and by the imagination must it be made to flee away into its negative life how shall this be done by shadowing forth in vivid colors the absolute beauty and phenomena of good by assuming evil not as positive but as negative i shall always love you for loving alcott writes emerson to his schoolmate and lifelong friend the reverend w h furness he is a great man the god with the herdsman of admetus his conversation is sublime yet when i see how he is underestimated by cultivated people i fancy none but i have heard him talk in the midst of slander and petty persecutions alcott writes in his diary for april i have been striving to apprehend the real in the seeming to strip ideas of their adventitious phrases and behold them in their order and powers i have sought to penetrate the showy terrestrial to find the heavenly things i have tried to translate into ideas the language and images of spirit and thus to read god in his works the outward i have seen as the visage and type of the inward ever doth this same nature double its design and stand forth now before the inner now before the outer sense of man at once substance and form image and idea so that god shall never slip wholly from the consciousness of the soul emerson weary of seeing his friend misunderstood urges him to give up teaching and become an author picturing as his golden view for alcott that one day he will leave the impracticable world to wag its own way sit apart and write his oracles for its behoof write let them hear or let them forbear he thunders the written word abides until slowly and unexpectedly and in widely sundered places it has created its own church the unreality of evil as taught and believed by alcott nearly a century ago laughed and scoffed at then was twentyfive years later practically the foundation of a belief which gained its first foothold in new england and with headquarters in boston has spread until today its followers and churches circle the civilized globe a newold religion based on the literal acceptance of the teachings of christ what today is called metaphysical teaching was in the alcott period scoffed at as transcendentalism mr alcotts strict adherence to a vegetarian diet was also the topic of ridicule from public and press although the alcott children seemed to thrive on it and certainly as fouryearold louisa once remarked did pitty well for a wegetable diet louisa in her journal gives this sample of the vegetarian wafers they had at fruitlands vegetable pluck your without flesh diet and body from sweet repose the orchard diet there animal food do not snatch could be no and nightmare it from the bloodshedding shamble war appollo eats no snuff is no less snuff flesh and has no though accepted beard his voice is from a gold box melody itself bronson alcott constantly sought selfimprovement and the shortcomings of his early education were more than offset by his untiring study realizing at one time his lack of a vocabulary he comments in his journal that to rectify this he has just bought two books a symposium of melancholy and hunter on the blood in their memoirs of bronson alcott f b sanborn and w t harris have thus summed up his character he was the most filial son the most faithful lover the most attached friend the most generous philanthropist of his time and when he died he left fewer enemies than any man of equal age can have provoked or encountered in so long a career in his study of childhood mr alcott sought first to reach the mind recognizing that as the god within us he encouraged individuality in his children trying in their earliest years to make them think for themselves all through his teaching runs the boys friendship with god and his sense of oneness with his maker was a part of the divine heritage he passed on to his daughters he records in his diary a conversation with anna who was four and louisa who was two after reading to them the story of jesus which he made so vital that given their choice they asked for it in preference to a fairy tale anna remarked that jesus did not really die they killed his body but not his soul her father asked what is the soul anna the little fouryearold replied its this inside of me that makes me feel and think and love and said the father what became of jesus soul anna replied it went back to god whereat little twoyearold louisa asked why isnt dod inside of me a note in the fathers diary at the birth of elizabeth records annas first interview with her sister elizabeth a few hours old and a day later comes this record anna and louisa interview their sister louisa two years old wishes to have the baby sister put in her arms when fouryearold anna says warningly treat her very carefully louisa she comes from god what a beautiful thought to give a child of the divine mystery of birth instead of asserting what he intended to make of his children alcott encouraged the child to make itself beginning when it was a small baby treating it as an individual giving it opportunity to use its mentality instilling principles of right and wrong by suggestion alcott never commanded you dont wish to do that was his way not exacting blind obedience but expressing his conviction that the child wished to do right to him god was love he had no fear of god for perfect love had cast out fear this same spirit was manifested in all his children to them the change called death was not to be dreaded it was a stepping forward and upward this thought that death is not the end but the beginning is expressed in one of louisas most beautiful poems thoreaus flute we sighing said our pan is dead his pipe hangs mute beside the river around it wistful sunbeams quiver and musics airy voice is fled spring mourns as for untimely frost the bluebird chants a requiem the willowblossom waits for him the genius of the wood is lost then from the flute untouched by hands there came a low harmonious breath for such as he there is no death his life the eternal life commands above mans aims his nature rose the wisdom of a just content made one small spot a continent and tuned to poetry lifes prose haunting the hills the stream the wild swallow and aster lake and pine to him grew human or divine fit mates for this largehearted child such homage nature neer forgets and yearly on the coverlid neath which her darling lieth hid will write his name in violets to him no vain regrets belong whose soul that finer instrument gave to the world no poor lament but woodnotes ever sweet and strong o lonely friend he still will be a potent presence though unseen steadfast sagacious and serene seek not for him he is with thee a visit to sleepy hollow suggests life not death giant trees stretch their branches over marble and granite monuments as if in benediction there is no death for god is life they seem to say for them there is no death emerson lives today the great philosopher so do thoreau hawthorne bronson alcott and others of that mighty company and who shall say that louisa alcott is dead she lives in the hearts of thousands and will go on living through the love they bear her bronson alcott was a true disciple of jesus christ he lived the example set by his master not alone in words and thoughts but in deeds he lived through and beyond misunderstanding ridicule poverty to see his teachings respected his name honored to see the first glimmer of the new light which was beginning to break over the world the sunrise at his own sunset this thought is embodied in the last poem louisa alcott ever wrote to my father on his eightysixth birthday dear pilgrim waiting patiently the long long journey nearly done beside the sacred stream that flows clear shining in the western sun look backward on the varied road your steadfast feet have trod from youth to age through weal and woe climbing forever nearer god mountain and valley lie behind the slough is crossed the wicket passed doubt and despair sorrow and sin giant and fiend conquered at last neglect is changed to honor now the heavy cross may be laid down the white head wins and wears at length the prophets not the martyrs crown greatheart and faithful gone before brave christiana mercy sweet are shining ones who stand and wait the weary wanderer to greet patience and love his handmaids are and till time brings release christian may rest in that bright room whose windows open to the east the staff set by the sandals off still pondering the precious scroll serene and strong he waits the call that frees and wings a happy soul then beautiful as when it lured the boys aspiring eyes before the pilgrims longing sight shall the celestial city rise chronology it has been particularly the aim of the editors to lift these little women letters out of the biographical and into the narrative class for this reason dates have not been used with any degree of liberality and chronological facts have been minimized however as this is a
