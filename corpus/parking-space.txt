 parking space parking space published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million rd june the wind swirls outside the window blowing grey poisonous gas against the surface and although i cant hear the noise through the thick vacuum sealed glass i sometimes imagine i can imagine that the chemical storm buffets and blows me i know id die in a second if i ever did stand out on the surface of the grey empty planet which i can see through my window but the sense is hard to shake off im not quite over the novelty of my window which looks out of my new garage this miraculous space bolted by a technician onto the front of my three storey townhouse but something about the bleakness of the alien planet outside grips me whenever i enter the room and colours the experience alien planet outside the window in islington what is this nonsense of course its not an actual alien planet its earth dead and ravaged yet despite the fact that this bleak realm is definitely earth it is still entirely alien an artists impression of everything which might have gone wrong but didnt a stark illustration of how miraculous it is that life exists here in this earth at all i stand in my room stare out my window and consider what could have been if this universe had not decided to be so kind to us st october its been six months since they installed my room and still the dog wont come in stupid mutt he drops to the floor at the sound of the summons ears flat to his face as though id called him for a bath begging me to free him from the responsibility to obey his master so i leave him be and he slopes back into the hallway glancing back fearfully at me as i reenter the garage myself there is i admit an atmosphere in my room in ghost stories they sometimes describe a haunted space forever cold because of the spirits which stalk the floorboards and hide in the cupboards and regardless of what the thermostat on the wall says this area is never warm but as i peer through the thick muddied window of the room my super garage model deluxe i know it cant be that there are no ghosts in this room in this place nothing ever lived in this realm so nothing ever died i never believed in ghosts in my world a rationalist to the end so why on earth would i believe in them here in this other dead planet th february i can hear sandy my little one in the street shrieking at her big sister kel because of some perceived slight but my attention is drawn away from this as it so often is back to the bleak emptiness outside my window i dont even know why they put a window in so little light makes it through the grime and the dust but whenever im parking or stashing my tools i become caught up in it a whole world empty dead an unshaded replica of our own planet its amazing sometimes i wonder how i drag myself away th may despite the extra heaters ive employed my garage still never gets any warmer the warm air blowing in from the street forms a misty haze on the doorway as it meets the icy cold of the room outside the front entrance i noticed old henry one of the neighbours leaning against the entrance to the garage and watching me a look of grim fascination on his face as he interrogates the space which one year ago had not existed or had existed forever but somewhere else what a ridiculous thing to do old henry told me when i announced wed purchased a room to discover something as miraculous as multiple universes and turn it into real estate we are capable of such big things yet we make them so small i laughed but felt a little affronted old people just dont get it sometimes what was that thing douglas adams said something about all inventions made in ones formative years being miraculous and very much in the expected run of things but everything over the age of forty being voodoo something like that but on a busy street like mackenzie road parking was at a premium and the option to acquire three additional parking spaces was not to be sniffed at okay for an old codger who hadnt driven in his whole life to make such judgements where did he ever walk except to the little prince pub on the cally besides i needed somewhere to park my lexus where it couldnt be scratched by envious locals and earth no would suit me just fine dead nowhere the papers nicknamed it although the boffins called it terra fifty years ago old henrys equivalent wouldve have been moaning about the internet or walkmans a hundred years ago telly would have been the end of the world before that the novel would have been the death of civilisation time for old henry to enter the twentytwenties i reckon i admit when i first heard the boffins had found a way to break through into an alternative reality i too had more exciting visions of other worlds of quantum possibilities like in that old tv programme sliders they show it on scify classic all the time i dreamt of a billion worlds in which i lived as a rockstar or a junkie a scientist or a priest but when they discovered the only world they had access to was barren and empty these dreams quickly passed there were two earths two earths they could find anyway one dead and one alive so and what after the first was prised open there was speculation millions more might also turn up but the boffins have so far failed to open any others mostly they say this is it weve gone as far as we can go two earths then ours fragrant and full of life and the other ammonia streaked and seedless as lifeless and useless as the moon a black shadow imprint of the earth initial excitement at the prospect of multiple worlds and endless possibility was quickly superseded by news articles decrying the enormous wedge of money spunked away by the team down in oxford just to break open the shell of a coconut containing nothing worse than nothing since a number of researchers died as the atmosphere flooded in from dead nowhere into the lab and stripped the skin from their bones learning and discovery for its own sake were mentioned in some more reputable news outlets but since the other earth appeared more or less untouched in billion years and was deadly and inhospitable but mostly people just griped about it quiet desperation might once have been the english way but these days low level grumbling was the first order of the day bloody waste of time except except everything is useful to the imaginative mind the moon was barren and empty but as a result of our visits there everything from cat scanners to cordless drills had been invented so the waste was only there to those of limited imagination a young silicon valley researcher i think she was called kelly abramovich had spotted then patented an angle no one else had thought of i remember listening to her plummy london accent on some american public radio broadcast talking about how the idea had come to her whilst visiting one of her fathers factories shed watched this highvis coated crowd of workmen loading boxes up near newcastle and about to justify her very very expensive education began designing concrete blocks to connect our two planets little pockets of our earth sewn into the lining of that dead world she told some american guy maybe ira glass the purpose of which will be real estate to serve the mundane purpose of car and property storage i often stand outside and look at it still in wonder a doorway big enough to drive a car through like an oversized version of the doors from monsters inc but thin enough to fit across the front of any average sized house the doorway sat in my front garden and the room sat in dead nowhere deadsville uk both a million miles off and still a wafers breadth away initially the startup proposed the new world as vacuum sealed living space real estate in the new world but this was quickly ruled out the coldness which seeped through the supposedly impermeable breeze blocks made prospective owners shudder and reject them despite their relative cheapness and convenience compared to normal london property prices people whod previously lived in oneroom windowless basements in barking said no thank you very much to five room mansions in fulham sorry theyd tell the estate agent it just dont feel right so the vision was reappraised and refined reduced down to furniture storage and car parking loads of storage companies went bust at the beginning why stick your stuff in big yellow when you can add a football pitch sized cupboard to your bedroom th november when i first stood in my new garage i reckoned at first that the dislike id heard about stemmed from the view the swirling deadly mass of grey and the dead acidic landscape which reminded me of a late turner painting gone terribly wrong but i dont know anymore because even if you close your eyes and ignore the dead vista of terra in front of you there remains a sense the other world is observing you hostile and malevolent and even after all this time this sense has not passed its as though the garage were a splinter under the skin of the dead earth which the other planet knows instinctively shouldnt be there while youre in its view you feel a deep sense of rejection of being rejected by a planet being rejected by a universe silly since the other world is so obviously barren but so many people report discomfort well you have to wonder ive listened to so many theories about what led the other planet to be such a bleak terrible lifeless place and our earth so rich full and lush but no one really knows at some point millions of years ago something happened which meant the spark of life which flourished in our world was extinguished there god might not play dice with the universe so maybe he flips coins instead theres this fella who stands on the corner of chapel market outside the markses and bible aloft tells anyone who will listen that dead nowhere is hell waiting for all us sinners if we fail to repent unusually for i rarely have sympathy for religious types i can see where hes coming from im glad its safely sealed on the other side of that thick glass the two earths are siblings one a professor of neuroscience seeking to do only good in the world the other an estate agent his mind set only upon despair i should stop these musings are stupid i know yet each day after i drive my car into the other world i find i lose a block of time observing the massing clouds of swelling grey gas outside gas which would strip the skin from your bones im told thankful for the thick wide window which protects me st january happy new year im in a strange mood today new years blues no doubt i should go up to be with the family but more and more i find myself drawn to this view the wind swirling and blasting my window with dust i dont know why sometimes i think i see movement in the dead world i imagine i see figures in the distance although when i grab my daughters national geographic telescope to interrogate the landscape theres never anything there of course its the movement of the dust im sure making shapes which through the haze make me think of languorous figures muscular stretching and standing upright under a dying sun each time i do this i shake my head at my foolishness the world is dead my imaginings change nothing nd january the dust is up again today swirling roaring clouds of grey particles which belie the sunny north london street upon which my children currently play skating back and forth upon pink thin roller blades which rattle and scrape along the pavement whilst old harry chats to their mum on the stoop i turn to join them but think i hear a rap of some particle clipping the window behind me it sounded hard and sharp and i turn back in surprise unsure what i expect to see but only find the usual howling winds and nothing more how could there be anything but still i stupidly press my face to the glass and peer this way then that trying to see what do i think ill see the ghost of xmas neverwas i told the missus about the noise but she told me to shut up and that the whole bloody place gives her the creeps never mind my daft tales of ghosts tapping on the window i understand how much she hates the room she doesnt need to tell me she virtually runs in and out when she has to get some of the gardening tools and pointblank refused my offer to buy her a new car on the grounds shed have to park it in there id rather get the tube she told me th march today i definitely saw something move im sure of it as i commenced my daily commune with the mist i watched the unending terrain visibly bubble and shift the hard rock surface momentarily liquid before my eyes so i reached for the phone misdialling twice because my hands were shaking no sir the helpful indiabased call centre operative told me there were no seismic activities in that part of the world broadly speaking the continental shapes and seismic seasons of that planet mirror our own but i hesitated i thought i saw a face in the stone ground i know it makes no sense but the operator chose to ignore this statement his tone reminds me of my own in mums last days as i tried to convince her the nice nurses werent trying to steal her shoes im assuming there were no earthquakes in islington today sir i confirmed the assumption then i would suggest not worrying sir the operator paused sir do you look out of the window much sir we hear from a number of our customers that if they stare out at the world then they see things which arent there hallucinations sir weve been advising our customers not to look but the window is there i tell him expressing a truth i hadnt realised how can i not look weve arranged for the installation of a number of lcd windows to be fitted over the old real windows in an effort to make the atmosphere in the room more conducive to relaxation i can arrange it as part of your current contract no charge sir rd july today when i stand in front of the window in my garage it peeks into my small courtyard garden onto kids toys and a broken garden table which i really do need to fix soon they installed it last week and although i can no longer see the dead nowhere in the frame im still drawn to the same spot i know its still there i can chose any view but whatever i go for i still think constantly about the ghost world behind it i dont miss seeing it exactly but a black rose of paranoia has blossomed in my heart as it occurs to me this black dead planet still watches me but now away from our returning gaze who watches it st july i changed the view on my window again today to show a rolling flower filled meadow but the illusion fools no one i know the scene which truly lies beyond and im more troubled than i could have dreamt at its absence nd october i dont know why i did it it seems so irrational so unlike me the window lies in tatters at my feet the glass shattered and scattered across the white concrete floor ripped from the wall the grey world there again in all its sombre glory theres a broom just over by the wall but ill clear up later i need to look out there its crazy i know but as i looked at the representation of a million bluebells i thought id heard the glass behind cracking and just knew the acrid empty world behind was about to pour through and kill us all yet when i crowbarred the window down from the wall i saw the same empty broken world grinning back at me maybe i should just cancel my contract and get rid of this dead space this thought is stillborn cancellation isnt a serious option besides there are thousands maybe tens of thousands of these rooms all over london now maybe a hundred thousand across the globe and the thought they would be there but unwatched by my eyes seems unbearable id rather get rid of the car than the room i need to see it last night the earth bubbled and shifted again i saw it i didnt call it in though they wouldnt believe me but for a moment there in the liquid rock i thought i saw a thousand faces staring back up at me cruel black eyes watching me and then gone i knew they couldnt be real the world was dead all the scientific surveys were clear on this and if there were any ghosts then they would have been lost strays from this world whod wandered in by mistake i would have phoned it in but who would believe me in a moment theyd gone and even i began to doubt what i had seen th december there was a story on the news last night about how loads of people were getting rid of their rooms and the missus asked if we could get shot of ours but i just shook my head i virtually live in there now i told her im working on a project a surprise for her birthday but each time i feed her this lie i see a frown of scepticism a slight shake of the head and you know how much i love that car i plead then breezily come on love dont be a wimp it just a door into nowhere bit like getting the train to your aunts in south london only less dangerous rd february today i slept in my room last night in an my dads old armchair swaddled in blankets keeping guard over the window and when i awoke knocked over a half drunk can of fosters all over the floor spreading out across the cold concrete its saturday morning and i opened the door to find a snow white day had been born of the cold february night sky somewhere in the distance i heard a scream of what might be fear or pain or delight islington might have gone all upmarket in the last thirty years but the old islington the cally as the regulars at the pub call it well theres always the sense it wasnt far away like dead nowhere the real city awaits in the darkness now opening the entrance to my room i feel the kick of the cold air exhaling warm breath which turns to fog before dissipating like last nights sleep terrors i resolve to visit the loo to rinse and refresh then return to keep guard its a saturday after all plenty of time to work on the project the missus appears from the front door with some post in hand and a look of vague distrust in her eyes alright love she shakes her head and im not sure if its in answer or in disgust you know she says opening the gate and then pointing over my shoulder i really dont think you should sleep in there i was just up late working on i give up on the lie because shes suddenly wailing a bleak empty bleat falling from her cold lips and i turn to look back into my room it takes me a moment but of course i think there it is looking through my window i see a blackeyed beast glaring back at me sharp battleship grey teeth bared in a snarl a heavy sledge hammerlike object made of what looks like black metal grasped in clawlike hands the end of the weapon appears encrusted in what looks like diamonds it scrapes the reinforced glass with an almost tender touch before pulling it back to aim it at the centre of the opening before it strikes its cold eyes fall back upon me and im rocked by a pang of recognition i know him we have spent so long together now and i know him we edge over across towards the window and will that glass hold become the last words i will ever hear my wife say the beast shatters the glass with a single blow and springs through moving like some sort of insect a thousand or a hundred thousand more like him clambering up behind from beneath the blank terrain roaring at us a chemical stench burns my nose as this army from the dead earth pours through the shattered glass ripping and smashing the hole wider pouring into the street more screams reach me but im gone now i know that my children i think no not my children but they are gone too im sure and for what real estate my companion all these days approaches me and has stopped looming over me and observes my panic with a look of something like pleasure in its eyes i dont even consider trying to run ive waited here for him all this time i knew this was coming where would i go he runs a speculative clawed finger down my face and i feel blood bead and begin to stream down my nose then it plunges its middle claw into my head piercing into my skull forcing its way through my shattered forehead as though it were egg shell the last thing i hear is my wife whimpering incoherent moans fading to nothing a vision drops into my cranium like a coin in a slot machine deposited by this beast and i see i see i see me through his eyes a small creature i see my blank eyes looking out of a small window in a grey concrete box on a dead planet the glow of our delicious vibrant world seeping into theirs and then i know hunger the hunger waking from a million or billion year sleep a new vision replaces this of a vast green planet full of life and nature and massive biodiversity the creatures of this world seem both strange and familiar at the same time enormous beasts which look to be a cross between horses and elephants reptilian cats stalking the undergrowth brilliantly coloured insects flood the skies in watery waves nothing like those from my world there are no people humans i mean although there are peoplelike creatures creeping in the shade of the trees peering up into blue skies although these people appear to be more monkey or even bird than human chirruping at each other instead of talking this world is beautiful unspoilt and when i inhale i drown in the cleanest most beautiful air ive even known the smells are glorious reminding me of summer days spent as a child in the new forest is it possible to be happier than this i wonder the dream slows and i sense a nervousness in my fellows a blackening of the sky chills me the people squawk and scurry screeching in shrill tones at this unexplained event i look up and see them falling or flying so many of them that they blot out the sun i look at my hands realise i am one of these people and emit a pleasurable squawk at the realisation holding my fingers to the sky watching through strange bony fingers oh god watching them fall on us i witness the beasts dropping from the cold blue emptiness and then i am somewhere else again falling from the sky im am the beast now i share a lifetime of memories of worlds destroyed made dust then floating drifting through space we floated through space for so long swimming on the currents of space in mute in near death hibernation clinging together like a rock an asteroid of existence a clenched fist looking to land a blow searching we see it in the distance a tiny speck a blue green orb sparkling in the night it takes so long to reach it but reach it we will we will be fed again as we reach the innocent globe we descend upon it dropping from the blue and stripping every ounce of life from the space below we are the hunger which can never sated for an age we feed stripping every molecule of life from this place until we are done the green orb now grey dusty scraped clean all consumed every last molecule until only the beasts were left alone not even bacteria escaped but then it hits me again the hunger growing in a stomach which at the height of harvest never felt full still we are patient creatures we do not allow our hunger to end us so we kneel upon the dead soil and sink into it to wait to wait forever if necessary for something to come but we did not have to wait forever i hear the sound of movement the sound of them traipsing across our dead world in big yellow plastic suits building a million fragile little doors for us back into their world as my hunger grows so does my strength we are coming then i am back gazing up through blood and tears at this eternal beast at the end of the universe as the stars begin to die out one by one will he be all that is left i wonder as they begin their rampage if this time they will temper their hunger surely the starvation of a billion year sleep would teach them to measure their resources and not allow their new well to run dry somewhere as the world fades the real world screams become faint and i hear a growling wolf laugh inside my head as a final thought is deposited dinnertime
