chapter one three bodies the man who was waiting on the shore looked like a farmer he wore the right kind of clothes and his van which was parked on the dirt road above the beach was suitably covered in mud it was midnight on the first monday in october and for the next thirty minutes he had to wait there he stared out to sea he was alone as he knew he would be it was planned that way this beach was always empty at this time of night no cars drove along the dirt road the clouds were low and thick it would be difficult to see the boat until it was close that was planned as well after he had waited twenty minutes he heard the sound of a quiet engine from the water and then saw a black rubber boat low in the water approach the shore the engine stopped when the boat was about thirty feet from the shore the farmer looked around there were no people no cars he carefully put a cigarette in his mouth and started to smoke it a mans voice came from the boat on the water what kind of cigarette is that lucky strike the farmer answered satisfied the man in the boat asked luke sam replied the farmer the man in the boat was khamel not sam and luke knew it luke had often heard of khamel but he was not sure that they had met before khamel had many names and many faces and he spoke several languages he was the most famous and most feared killer in the world he was the best at first twenty years ago he had killed for political reasons but now he would kill anyone anywhere if the money was right luke was excited khamel was going to be working in america he wondered who was going to die whoever it was the killing would be quick and clean and there would be no clues at dawn the stolen van stopped at a hotel in georgetown part of washington dc the political capital of the united states of america khamel got out of the van without a word to luke they had not spoken throughout the journey and luke had been careful not to look at khamel he didnt want to die he didnt want khamel to think he could recognize him the room in the hotel was ready of course the curtains were tightly closed the car keys were on the table the gun was in a briefcase next to the bed he had received three million dollars already for this job he would phone his bank in three hours to ask whether the next four million had arrived while he waited he practised his english in front of the mirror the job would be over by midnight tonight so another three million would reach his bank by midday tomorrow by then he would be in paris it was satisfactory he allowed himself a short sleep the supreme court is the highest court in the usa it consists of nine judges who hear only the most difficult cases in the country those cases which might actually threaten the constitution judges are appointed to the supreme court by the government so a republican government will try to get republican judges appointed and a democratic government will try to get democrats appointed judges become members of the supreme court for life they can retire if they want but if not the job ends only with death judge rosenberg was so old that he found it hard to stay awake sometimes even during trials he was a liberal and proud of it he defended the indians the homosexuals the poor the blacks the mexicans and the puerto ricans some people loved him for it but more people hated him throughout the summer there had been the usual number of messages threatening death to the judges of the supreme court and as usual rosenberg had received more than the others the fbi had to behave as if the judges really were in danger although they were threatened year after year and it was very rare for anything to happen when it did it was usually a single madman whose daughter had died in a road accident or something the political groups made a lot of noise but it was easier for them to bomb buildings than people and especially people who were as well guarded as the supreme court judges rosenberg refused to have fbi guards in his own home he had lived to be ninetyone and was not afraid of death judge jensen had different reasons for not wanting guards in his house he wanted to be able to come and go as he pleased both of them allowed the guards to wait outside in cars or on foot but they could enter the house only when they had permission a little after ten at night when the house was dark and still the door to a bedroom cupboard opened and khamel came quietly out he was dressed in running clothes he had shaved off his beard and coloured his hair blond silently he went down the stairs he knew there were two fbi men in a car that was parked on the road outside the front of the house he knew there was another guard ferguson walking around the house outside rosenberg and his male nurse were asleep in the downstairs bedroom outside the door khamel fitted a silencer on to his gun he stepped inside put the gun to the head of the nurse and fired three times the hands and legs jumped but the eyes stayed closed and there was no sound khamel quickly reached across to the grey old head of judge rosenberg and shot three bullets into it he watched the two bodies for a full minute and then went out to the kitchen he opened the back door waited until ferguson appeared in the back garden and then called his name he knew that the nurse often invited ferguson in for a cup of coffee and something to eat ferguson obediently came into the kitchen khamel fired three bullets into the back of his head and he fell loudly on to the table khamel left the gun there and went out of the back door as soon as he reached the road at the back of the house he began running he was just another american out for his nightly run in the dark of the montrose theatre glenn jensen sat by himself and watched the men on the big screen in the front of the theatre he was dressed in ordinary clothes clothes that no one would remember and wore dark glasses too nobody would know that he had been here he came to this homosexual film theatre once or twice a week and not even his fbi guards knew about it it was easy to get out of the house there were several apartments in the building and the two fbi men could watch only one entrance at a time all he had to do was change his clothes and drive away in a friends car he liked the montrose because the films went on all night and there was never a crowd tonight there were only two old men sitting together in the middle of the theatre and holding hands jensen watched their backs and wondered if he would be like them in twenty years at fortyfour he was the youngest of the supreme court judges he was not a favourite of either the republicans or the democrats but had been a safe appointment for the republican president four years ago he was not particularly liberal except in cases involving homosexuals and those where industry threatened the environment he usually tried to judge his cases according to their rights and wrongs rather than any political opinions a fourth person entered the theatre where jensen and the two old men were now enjoying a film in which several young men were in bed together he wore tight jeans a black shirt an earring dark glasses and a moustache khamel the homosexual he smiled when he saw jensen there the information they had given him was good at the old men left the theatre arm in arm jensen did not look at them he was too busy watching the film khamel moved like a cat to a seat behind jensen he pulled some rope from round his waist and wrapped the ends round his hands he suddenly put the rope around the front of jensens neck and pulled backwards and downwards jensens neck broke over the back of his seat just to make sure khamel twisted the rope until it bit deeply into jensens neck and held it there for two minutes an hour later he was waiting at dulles airport for his flight to paris chapter two political planning the phone woke the president at in the morning he listened to the voice for a minute and then jumped out of bed eight minutes later he was in the office fletcher coal his chief of staff was waiting for him what the hell happened the president asked coal walked up and down in front of the presidents desk we dont know much he said theyre both dead two fbi men found rosenberg at one am his nurse and guard were also dead three bullets each very clean very professional while the fbi were at rosenbergs house they heard that the police had found jensens body in a homosexual club voyles called me and i called you hell be here in a minute rosenberg is dead the president said yes at last rosenberg and the republican government had not been friends i suggest you go on tv in two or three hours time and tell the country about it all mabry is already working on your speech we dont want to leave it until later because we want to be the first to tell them the press already have the news i didnt know he was a homosexual theres no doubt about it now this is the perfect crisis we didnt cause it we didnt do anything wrong the country will be shocked and theyll turn to you youre going to be more popular than ever and next year youll be elected again for another four years its great and i can get two new men into the supreme court exactly thats the best bit theyll be your men and theyll be there for ever youll have a first list of names by tomorrow are there any suspects not yet the president smiled voyless fbi men were supposed to protect the judges werent they good i want you to leak that information to the press maybe we can get rid of voyles too when voyles arrived a moment later the president and coal tried to look worried voyles told them that there were no suspects yet and the president asked for a list by five oclock that evening they agreed that the killings must be connected voyles denied that his men had been careless rosenberg and jensen are dead because they refused to let us guard them properly he said were guarding the other seven and theyre still alive at the moment the president said and looked at coal they almost smiled they could easily make voyles look stupid and inefficient over this business voyles knew it too he was going to have to be careful the president or rather coal who told the president what to think wanted his head and the press would eat him alive back in his office he ordered a full enquiry into the murders darby shaw woke up a little before dawn after fifteen months of law school at tulane university in new orleans her mind refused to rest for more than six hours the work had not been so hard at her first university in phoenix arizona where she had specialized in environmental science then she decided to become a lawyer and to defend the environment in the courts the price was hard work and more hard work there were some rewards however she turned over in the bed to look at the man sleeping next to her thomas callahan was one of the most popular teachers in the university he was fortyfive years old but seemed a lot younger he drank a lot wore jeans drove a porsche lived in the french quarter and managed to make even constitutional law interesting he was also good in bed and for the first time in his life he had stayed with one woman for more than a few weeks darby and he had been together now for several months she smiled and wondered what her fellow students would think only her very best friends knew the secret she turned the tv on and suddenly there was the president she listened for a minute and then shook thomas awake thomas wake up listen to this she turned the sound up louder callahan sat up and stared at the screen still half asleep he understood what the president was saying though rosenberg murdered he said darby knew that rosenberg was his hero jensen too she said the president finished his speech and darby switched the tv off no suspects according to the president callahan said i can think of at least twenty groups who wanted rosenberg dead darby said starting with the kukluxklan yeah but why those two judges ok lots of people wanted rosenberg dead but why jensen why not mcdowell or yount theyre both more liberal than jensen maybe they both just got killed on the same night by chance darby suggested without believing it no i dont think so said callahan these are the first supreme court judges ever to be murdered and then two in one night there must be some connection between the murders but you know the worst thing that fool president will be able to fill their places that means that eight out of the nine will be republicans we wont be able to recognize the constitution in ten years this is awful perhaps thats why they were killed thomas someone or some group wants a different supreme court filled with republicans but why jensen he was appointed by a republican i dont know but there must be some connection maybe theres a clue in the cases the supreme court was due to hear this year the library will have that information i think ill spend some time on this today chapter thee no clues denton voyles put eric east in charge of the case on thursday east reported back to voyles with a list of their top suspects there were a number of political groups especially the underground army the kukluxklan and the white defenders but also some individuals who were rich enough to afford the kind of professional killer who had obviously done this job there was nelson muncie who had lost his daughter in a sex killing in florida the police had caught the man who was black but thanks to rosenberg the man had walked free there was clinton lane whose son was a homosexual who had died of aids the problem with all these suspects however was that the killings were so professional and clean that there were no clues except for the gun and the rope there were not even any clues about how the killer had entered rosenbergs house still voyles and he agreed to have between five and twenty men investigate each suspect or group of suspects in the law library and on the computers of tulane university darby shaw was gathering pages and pages of information what was the connection between rosenberg and jensen she could see reasons for killing one or the other but not both together but there had to be a single reason thomas callahan slept late and alone darby had been too busy to see him since wednesday now it was friday morning he made some coffee and as he drank it watched the busy french quarter through his window what was it he had to do oh yes phone gavin on monday he was going to washington for a conference about constitutional law he and his old friend gavin verheek were going to meet and get drunk together on monday evening gavin had been a friend ever since law school he and callahan were the only two in their year who refused to go into private practice and get rich while callahan had become a teacher verheek had joined the fbi as a legal adviser when verheek came on the phone he said thomas how are you its tenthirty im not dressed im sitting here in the french quarter drinking coffee and watching the world outside what are you doing well here its eleventhirty and i havent left the office since they found the bodies on wednesday morning it makes me sick gavin the president will get two nazis on to the supreme court i suppose youve already seen the list i bet your office is already checking that theyve lived good clean lives go on gavin tell me whos on the list i wont tell anyone else no chance ill only tell you this your names not on the list im so disappointed hows the girl which one come on thomas the girl shes beautiful and brilliant and gentle oh and rich she has red hair and the longest legs youve ever seen wow whats her name darby shaw but i havent seen her for a couple of days shes trying to solve the murders all by herself why dont you tell me who did it and then i can tell her and shell come back to me dont you read the papers we have no suspects not one at least i tried are we going to meet on monday i hope so voyles wants us to work day and night until the computers tell us who did it ill expect a full report on monday gavin not just the gossip why dont you bring darby how old is she nineteen twentyfour and shes not invited ill see you on monday at seven pm in the usual restaurant ok ok see you darbys enquiries had brought her to the court in lafayette of all the supreme court cases due to be heard in the next few months there was one that could explain the killings she needed to see the courts files on the case when the clerk brought them to her table however her heart sank there were lots of files each inches thick the case was seven years old only one person was involved but he had hidden behind thirtyeight different businesses which had used no fewer than fifteen law firms over the last seven years she pulled her chair in to the table and began to work chapter four ideas and information the meeting east and voyles had with coal and the president did not go well not only could they not report any progress but they had to admit that investigations like this could take many months then coal handed voyles a list of eight possible members of the supreme court two of whom would fill the places left empty by rosenberg and jensen we want a report on these people in ten days voyles he said and make sure the press doesnt get to hear about them you know we cant promise that voyles said we cant guarantee no leaks as soon as we start to dig around these people someone will realize whats going on the fbi cant guarantee secrecy coal said youd better keep this out of the papers voyles voyles jumped out of his chair listen coal he shouted why dont you investigate these people yourself dont start telling me what to do the president tried to make peace all were saying is do your best voyles he said these people are young and theyre good republicans theyll be giving the constitution shape long after im dead so its important to me that the two who become members of the supreme court are clean so that they can stay there for ever so no drugs no unusual sexual habits nothing like that ok yes mr president but we cannot guarantee total secrecy i understand just try your best yes sir callahan went round to darbys apartment with a pizza and a bottle of wine he hadnt seen her for four days he rang on her doorbell who is it she called through the door thomas callahan he said do you remember me the door opened and callahan stepped in are we still friends he asked and gave her a kiss of course ive just been busy so what did the great detective find she was opening the bottle of wine and didnt answer straight away she poured wine into two glasses and they went and sat together on the sofa she put her legs up on to him and he stroked them he repeated the question nothing really i was following a path and it took me somewhere i even typed it up as a brief but i dont think its worth anything what youve been running around playing detective for four days and refusing to see me and now youre just going to throw it away its over there on the table if you want to see it she said i dont want to see it now he said we have more important things to do im going to be away in washington for a few days remember ill read your brief and then well talk about it but not till weve been to bed ok she pulled him towards her and they kissed long and hard there was a cleaner in the white house whom everyone called sarge he was old very black and had white hair he wore dark glasses all the time and everyone thought that he was half blind in fact sarge could see very well he could see round corners he had been working in the white house for thirty years now cleaning and listening cleaning and seeing he knew which doors stayed open and which walls were thin no one ever noticed him his son cleve was a policeman this is how it worked cleve would contact gray grantham of the washington post and arrange a meeting sarge and grantham would meet no one knew how grantham got his political information but it was always good and always correct sarge never talked to anyone except grantham and he didnt tell even him everything he found out this time they met at glendas a little cafe on fourteenth street sarge was able to tell grantham two of the people on the list of possible supreme court judges chapter five an implausible theory verheek had drunk too much the night before with callahan as he had known he would what had he said had he given away any secrets he remembered explaining that the connection between rosenberg and jensen was not political the connection was so obvious that for several days no one in the fbi had seen it they were killed because the killer could get to them it was as simple as that they werent guarded as well as the others of course this still didnt answer the question why someone wanted two supreme court judges dead he remembered that they spent most of the evening talking about their student days together in washington and about women callahan had given him a copy of the brief his girlfriend what was her name darby had written about the death of the two judges callahan had said it was an interesting theory she didnt believe it nor did he but it was worth reading verheek pulled the brief out of his briefcase now and started to read it it was better written than most briefs and he enjoyed it the theory was implausible but no one else had thought of it it was worth considering he would show it to eric east the phone went four times the answering machine came on but the caller left no message the phone went again and the same thing happened again the third time grantham climbed out of bed and answered the phone it was still dark yes is that gray grantham of the washington post it is whos calling i cant give you my name ok why are you calling i saw your story yesterday about the white house and the possible next two supreme court judges good but why are you calling me so early in the morning im sorry im in a pay phone im on my way to work i cant call from home or the office what kind of office im a lawyer great washington was home to half a million lawyers private or government id rather not say ok anyway why did you call a hesitation i may know something about rosenberg and jensen grantham sat up straight what exactly are you recording this no should i i dont know mr grantham id prefer it if you didnt record this ok whatever you want im listening can you trace this call i could but youre at a pay phone what difference would it make youre right im just frightened you see i think i know who killed them now grantham was standing thats valuable information it could get me killed do you think theyre following me who dont worry tell me your name you can call me garcia thats not your real name is it of course not but its the best i can do ok garcia talk to me im not certain you understand but i think i accidentally saw something at the office that i was not supposed to see do you have a copy of it maybe do you want to talk or not i dont know what will you do if i tell you something first try to find out whether its true we wont print the names of the killers of two supreme court judges in a hurry believe me there was a very long silence garcia are you still there yes i need to think about this i might call you later ok if thats what you want sorry i woke you up the phone went dead grantham pushed seven numbers on his phone waited and then pushed six more another wait and then four more the small screen on his phone showed him a row of numbers he wrote them down on a piece of paper the pay phone was on fifteenth street east and k o lewis voyless secondincommand met with coal alone because the president was out of washington they had two bits of information for him first they told him that cameras at the airport in paris had recorded the arrival from dulles of the killer khamel coal thought about this for a minute what if khamel was involved in the killings what does it mean it means well never find him lewis replied nine countries around the world have failed to find him for the last twenty years it means that he was paid a lot of money by someone or some people here to do the killings so we know or we think that khamel did the killings but it doesnt really help us does it no youre right ok what else have you got for me lewis looked at east theres no real progress to report except except what well theres this theory which has appeared in the last twenty four hours a law student in new orleans wrote it up as a brief we call it the pelican brief heres a copy of it voyles liked it but he was afraid it could hurt the president how read it youll see this time garcia called grantham during office hours he didnt tell him anything new he was still frightened and uncertain they agreed that he would call again at lunchtime the next day the call came from a pay phone on pennsylvania avenue later when the president returned coal told him about the brief the theory is implausible he said but voyles likes it he probably doesnt believe the theory any more than anyone else but weve made him look bad over these killings so far and he wants revenge hes going to investigate this new suspect if the press get to hear about the investigation that could be bad for you wed better do something about it is the suspect someone we know yes coal explained what was in the brief did we get a lot of money from him millions one way or another said coal but the president preferred not to know the various ways in which money came in especially when they werent always perfectly legal chapter six hunted thomas was drinking too much over dinner she didnt like it and she told him so he wanted to prove that she was wrong so he drank even more they had an argument after dinner outside the restaurant he pulled the keys to his porsche out of his pocket thomas no youre too drunk to drive give me the keys he held on to the keys and set off in the direction of the car park he couldnt walk straight and his foot kept slipping off the pavement into the road she followed him but stayed some way behind she was too angry and just wanted to get back to her apartment alone he shouted something over his shoulder about how he could drive better when he was drunk she stood with her arms crossed on the other side of the car park and watched him put the key into the lock it took him three or four attempts then he was inside and she lost sight of him between two other cars she heard him start the engine though the explosion knocked her to the ground she lay there for a moment and then jumped to her feet the porsche was a ball of fire darby ran towards it screaming his name bits of the car were still falling all around her and the heat stopped her thirty feet away she screamed with her hands over her mouth a second explosion tore through the car and pushed her back she fell and her head hit the side of a parked car hard everything went blank for a minute then there were people everywhere and voices shouting whose car is it call was there anyone in it she was repeating the name thomas someone put a cold cloth on her head she heard the sound of the police and firemen coming and then there were red and blue lights everywhere a black man was bending over her are you all right miss he asked thomas she said wheres thomas miss whos thomas asked the man was he in that car she nodded and then closed her eyes she could hear men shouting in the distance they were all over by the burning car she sat up and was sick between her legs then she felt better she got up and walked away she knew who the bomb had been for her and she knew why she had to hide they were hunting her were they behind her even now she wandered deep into the french quarter found a cheap hotel and paid for a room with her card as soon as she was in the room she locked the door and curled up on the bed with all the lights on mrs verheek answered the bedside phone its for you gavin she called into the bathroom where he was shaving he came and took the phone from her hello he said angrily who could be calling this early in the morning this is darby shaw do you know the name yes we share a friend did you read the little theory i wrote yes the pelican brief as we call it and who is we verheek sat up straight she was not calling for a friendly chat why are you calling darby i need some answers mr verheek im frightened to death its gavin ok ok gavin wheres the brief why whats wrong ill tell you in a minute just tell me what you did with the brief well i read it and then i passed it on to someone else who passed it on to denton voyles who liked it has anyone outside the fbi seen it i cant answer that then i wont tell you whats happened to thomas all right yes its been outside the fbi but i dont know exactly where and i dont know how many people have read it hes dead gavin he was murdered last night someone put a bomb in the car i was lucky gavin was shocked where are you are you safe new orleans who knows if im safe they must be after me too it was me they really wanted ill have some men come and get you darby you cant stay on the streets then ill catch a plane and ill be there by midday i dont think so thomas is dead because he talked to you why should i want to talk to you give me your number at work i may call you later ok but darby just tell me did he feel any pain there were tears in her voice no it was very quick then she put the phone down she could let herself cry now because there wouldnt be time later crying could get her killed chapter seven keep moving it was nearly time for the presidents daily meeting with voyles by now he was tired of the whole business he just wanted to get his men into the supreme court coal was telling him something but he wasnt really listening voyles and coal hated each other so much now that coal had to leave the office whenever voyles came they had nearly fought last time it didnt matter to coal whether he was in or out of the office there were enough hidden microphones and cameras for him to listen and watch any conversation there the president felt better knowing that coal was at least watching he greeted voyles warmly at the door and led him over to the sofa for a friendly chat voyles was not impressed denton the president said i want to apologize for coals behaviour last time he can be stupid cant he voyles said knowing that coal was listening yes hes very clever and works amazingly hard but he goes too far sometimes anyway thats all behind us now i want you to tell me all about this pelican brief how seriously are you taking it voyles tried not to smile this was great he had managed to get coal and the president worried we are investigating all suspects mr president he replied we have fourteen men on this one i dont have to tell you denton the president continued how much damage this theory could do if the press heard about it we wont tell the press mr president i know all im saying is that i want you to pull back from this one the theory is crazy anyway and i could really get hurt do you understand what im saying are you asking me not to investigate a suspect mr president im just saying that you must have better things to do with your men the press is watching this investigation closely you know how they are they dont like me at all so why dont you leave this one alone and chase the real suspects is that what youre asking me to do im not asking you denton im telling you to leave it alone for a couple of weeks if you need to go back to it later of course you must but im still the boss around here remember gavin stayed near voyless office until the secretary let him in he couldnt believe it when voyles and lewis told him that they were no longer investigating the pelican theory my best friend is dead because of that brief he said he was killed by a car bomb someone is worried about the brief dont you think the brief has already been very valuable to us gavin lewis said yeah it let you play some games with the white house gavin said bitterly but theres a girl out there running for her life what am i going to tell her darby made sure she could not be followed in the crowds in the shopping district she bought some new clothes and hid her hair under a hat she went into the sheraton hotel and found a row of pay phones first she called mrs chen who lived in the apartment next to hers no she had not seen anything yes there had been a knock at her door early this morning then she called gavin where are you he asked let me explain something for now im not going to tell you or anyone else where i am clear yes but dont go home im not a fool theyve already been there what did mr voyles say i havent been able to see him youve been at the office for four hours gavin i expected you to do better be patient darby patience will get me killed ive got to keep moving she saw a face he walked among the tourists at the hotels front desk he was trying to look as though he belonged here but his eyes were searching the face was long and thin and he wore round glasses he was a little over six feet tall gavin listen to me she said i have to go i can see a man ive seen before about an hour ago ok take care darby and call me again soon ill try chapter eight photos and phone calls the photographers name was croft he was parked on pennsylvania avenue in granthams volvo because it had a phone the pay phone was easy to see about fifty yards in front of the car with his powerful camera he could almost read the names in the phone book a large woman was using the phone at the moment at the woman put the phone down and walked away from nowhere a young man in a suit appeared and walked over to the phone croft felt sure that this was the man he picked up his camera and looked through it the man was pushing numbers on the phone and looked nervous he kept looking this way and that croft took a couple of pictures the phone in the car went three times croft didnt pick it up it was grantham at the office signalling that this was their man croft used a whole film on the first camera when the man had finished talking on the phone he walked straight towards the volvo along the pavement beautiful croft took several more pictures with a second camera and stopped well before the man could possibly see inside the car an easy job grantham got plenty of excellent pictures from croft garcia didnt look spanish despite the name he had chosen he looked like thousands of other young lawyers up and down the country from garcia he got nothing it didnt matter he let him talk about his wife and child and how frightened he was one day and one day soon garcia would give him the information whatever it was from sarge he got a copy of a white house document naming khamel as the probable killer of rosenberg and jensen this was good there was little in the office files about khamel and only two pictures which looked like two different people but he wrote it up into a story and they decided to use both pictures and the story on the front page the next day the phone was going after twentyfour hours on the run she had drunk a bottle of wine the night before and fallen asleep on her bed in the marriott hotel but first she had cut off her long red hair and coloured it black they would be expecting blonde they would also be expecting her to run away so despite her fears she stayed in new orleans they would be watching all the police stations so she had stayed away from them the phone was still going she picked it up and heard darby this is gavin now she was awake how did you find me we are the fbi we have our ways wait let me think of course you can trace me when i use my cards to pay for things how stupid of me but if you can find me they can find me too they could be outside the door now stay in small hotels then and pay with cash now listen im coming to new orleans its thomass funeral tomorrow i think we should meet tonight you have to trust me darby what did voyles say gavin hesitated were taking no action at this time thats lawyer talk gavin what does it mean i dont want to talk on the phone thats why we have to meet no tell me why voyles is doing nothing about this im not sure why honestly what do you think gavin do you think thomas was killed because of the brief yes thanks if thomas was murdered because of the brief then we know who killed him and if we know who killed thomas then we know who killed rosenberg and jensen am i right probably thats good enough probably means yes when a lawyer says it but the fbi is still doing nothing about my suspect calm down darby lets meet tonight and talk about this i could save your life she carefully put the receiver of the phone under the pillow she threw her things into a bag and left the room she walked up two floors to the seventeenth then took the lift down to the tenth then she walked down the stairs to the ground floor she hid in the womens room for half an hour and then left the hotel on dumaine street in the french quarter she found an empty cafe with a phone at the back she called verheek where will you stay tonight she asked him at the hilton ill call late tonight or early in the morning can you get the washington post down there you should read it today i cant wait ill speak to you later she bought a post and read it at another cafe if the report was right it fitted in with her theory the local paper had a picture of thomas on the second page with a long story about the explosion the police were looking for a white female whom several witnesses had seen there at the time she looked slowly at the photo of thomas he was so handsome tears filled her eyes alice stark darbys best friend got the key to the apartment from mrs chen and let herself in she had been there plenty of times before and everything looked all right nothing was out of place the whole apartment was tidy the kitchen smelled of stale food it was dark when she got there but darby had told her not to switch on the lights and certainly not to open the curtains she used a torch to see her way around she sat down at the computer and turned it on she looked for the files darby had mentioned but they werent there by the light of the torch she looked in the boxes of diskettes they were empty alice returned the key to mrs chen and walked half a mile to where she had left her car she met darby as arranged in the restaurant and she told her what she had discovered darby did not seem surprised and refused to answer alices questions verheek was angry she had said she would call him now it was midnight and she still hadnt called he could save her life if she called he had to do something he decided to visit a few student bars to find out if anyone knew her and had seen her recently he got back to his room at three in the morning there were no messages she hadnt called was she still alive chapter nine searching for darby another phone call from garcia the man still wouldnt talk why was he calling him before dawn on a saturday theyd had the same conversation every time that he had to think about the safety of his wife and child that he had seen something in his office but there was never anything new grantham had just gone back to sleep when the phone went again hello it was not garcia this time it was a female voice is this gray grantham of the washington post he must get an unlisted telephone number it is and who are you

empty room on the third floor of a student building that looked out over the university church she sat with her face to the window and saw his parents and brother arrive students and staff came in twos and threes she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes then she saw him it was the thinfaced man with glasses he was wearing a coat and tie he walked towards the church looking carefully in every direction first they kill him then they come to his funeral ten minutes later he came back out of the church he looked sad as if thomas had been a friend he put a cigarette in his mouth and walked past some parked cars and behind the church two minutes later another man got out of one of the cars and followed him the two of them reappeared after a minute walking together now then thinface disappeared down the street while the other man who was short returned to his car and waited for the funeral service to finish the cubans lowered the small rubber boat into the water from their ship they heard the sound of the little engine as the man went west through the darkness towards the coast he would never use a commercial airline again the photographs in paris were embarrassing for a professional like himself and his client was not pleased now he was going to have to do two jobs in a single month which he had never done before but this one would be easy just a young woman in the hotel room in new orleans he spoke on the phone to a man calling himself mr snellen tell me about her he said there are two photos in the briefcase khamel opened the case and took out the photos ive got them shes beautiful it will almost be a pity to kill her yes but all that red hair has gone we found some hair on the floor of a hotel room she has coloured it black where is she now we dont know she has stopped using her cards to pay for things she took out a lot of money from her bank and since then she has disappeared we think shes still in new orleans though someone was in her apartment

and threw it across his hotel room chapter ten another body the first thing she did when she woke up on sunday morning was listen was the door opening was the floor outside making a noise when she was sure she was safe she thought about thomas she remembered their times together she remembered how he loved her it was a surprise for him the first time he had really been in love and she loved him too after a few minutes of thinking about thomas she thought about them she had to think like them too to stay alive where would they be today where could she go was it time to move hotels again yes did they know that she was now a blonde she felt hungry she had hardly eaten for days this hotel didnt do breakfast on sundays so she had to go out she left by the back door through the kitchen he saw her when she reached burgundy street the hair was different but she couldnt change her long legs he started to follow her khamel was practising his english when the phone went it was sneller shes here he said one of our men saw her this morning he chased her but she noticed him and lost him in the football crowds khamel said so how am i supposed to find her if your men cant tell me where shes staying it might not matter sneller said theres an fbi lawyer in town the fool has been visiting bars and asking questions about her spreading his name around hes asked anyone who knows her to contact him at his hotel the hilton my men will continue trying to find the girl and you can stay close to him hes in room he was callahans best friend she might call him gavin was lying on his bed watching tv it was eleven at night he would wait until twelve and then try to sleep he had decided to go home tomorrow if she didnt call he couldnt find her it wasnt his fault even taxidrivers got lost in this city

tall are you about five feet ten inches and how much to you weigh about a hundred kilos i usually lie about it im going to start doing some exercise ill see you tomorrow gavin i hope so he put the phone down and smiled great at last he said out loud he went into the bathroom for a shower when he came out the room was dark dark but he had left the light on hadnt he he started to walk over to the light switch the first blow caught him in the throat he fell to his knees which made the second blow easy it landed like a rock on the back of his neck and gavin was dead khamel switched on a light he lifted up the body and put it on the bed he turned the sound on the television up loud opened his bag and took out a cheap gun he held it to the right side of gavins head and fired then he carefully put the gun in gavins right hand and curled the fingers around it it wouldnt take a doctor very long to find out how gavin had really died but khamel didnt need very long by the evening of the next day he would be out of the country he opened up the receiver of the telephone and took out the little microphone he pulled the recorder out from under the bed finally he checked that the cupboard where he had waited was clean then he left the room no one had seen him enter and no one saw him leave chapter eleven riverwalk grantham couldnt find out anything about the brief even sarge hadnt heard of it when darbys call came through to his office on monday morning he had nothing to tell her it doesnt matter ill tell you everything soon i think i dont want to die without telling the world

amounts of money to help the president get elected easy its public information ill have it by the time you call do you have a copy of the brief no but i remember it all and you know whos doing the killing yes and as soon as i tell you your life will be in danger too tell me now not so fast ill call you tomorrow after the phone conversation grantham went in to see his boss smith keen he explained the situation to him keen was excited but said even if she tells us whats in the brief we cant print the story well need an independent witness im working on it grantham said and told him about garcia this is going to be big keen said this is going to put the post right back up at the top she arrived on riverwalk at eleven she sat in a restaurant and nervously drank a coffee while watching the people pass she didnt see thinface or shorty or anyone else she recognized at she got up and walked towards frenchmens bend if he wasnt there by she would leave but he was there wearing the black shirt and carrying a newspaper he looked nervous too she liked that at exactly twelve oclock he walked into the shop and went to the back she came up behind him and said gavin he had practised gavins voice for hours but wasnt sure he had it exactly right he turned around quickly and said darby then he pretended to cough she wouldnt expect the same voice from someone with a cold lets get out of here he said follow me she said darby took his hand and led him out of the shop and towards the river have you seen them he asked no but theyre around somewhere where are we going just come with me youre walking too fast darby it will look strange to people let me make a phone call i can have men here in ten minutes and then well be safe he was pleased with himself he sounded just right no she said but she slowed down they joined the queue for the riverboat bayou queen the boat will take us to where ive parked a car she explained then we get out of here fast khamel was uncomfortable he was wearing a great many underclothes so that he would look as fat as verheek but he could wait an hour until they were out of the city and then the man with the gun pushed his way through the queue he had killed before but never in such a public place the queue was moving but he was getting through it the man and the woman were just about to step on to the boat when he reached them he pulled the gun out of his pocket held it to the mans head and fired he disappeared through the crowd gavin was falling to the ground darby screamed and moved back in horror hes got a gun a woman shouted and pointed at gavin who was on his hands and knees with a small gun in his right hand blood poured from his nose and chin and formed a small pool under his face his head was hanging down until it nearly touched the ground he was speaking some words in a language darby didnt recognize hes egyptian someone in the crowd said he fell forward dropping the gun into the water and died in a widening pool of blood darby walked away as the crowd moved forwards to see the dead man and two policemen started to push their way through she left riverwalk after dark she had bought new clothes and wore a new coat as well she waved at a taxi how much to take me to baton rouge she asked thats a long way the driver said you should go by bus or train how much she asked again one hundred and fifty dollars the man said after a moments thought heres two hundred she said get me there fast thomas had talked to her about his friend gavin verheek she knew he wasnt an egyptian chapter twelve darby explains voyles sent east down to new orleans to learn the truth about verheeks death lewis brought the news to his office denton when are we going to start taking this pelican brief seriously he asked people keep dying because of it wed better investigate it it must be mattiece i know voyles said well send down a team of men but i dont want the fool in the white house or coal to hear that were investigating it i want to surprise them when the president told me to leave the brief alone i was carrying a small recorder in my pocket ive got every word loud and clear if we find that the brief is accurate the press will love us and we can let them know that the president told us not to investigate it thatll be the end of him and coal lewis said happily i know hell have no chance in the election next year weve got him they smiled at each other but what about mattiece lewis said if he hadnt killed all those people we wouldnt have thought the brief was right he must be crazy there are rumours that he is voyles replied ive spoken to the cia they had men in new orleans they dont know where mattiece is hes probably not in this country he owns houses all over the world well need their help to get him they were following the girl too but they lost her in chicago airport she could be anywhere by now she could be dead lewis said mattieces men are following her as well grantham traced two old photographs of her one from her high school one from her first university he pinned them up beside his desk she was beautiful she called him as she had promised he had read about the killing of a lawyer in new orleans and she told him the true story she also told him about the other killing which had not appeared in the newspapers then she said can you come to new york tomorrow grantham of course itll only take a few hours but please call me gray he looked at the photographs of her ill ring tomorrow morning to tell you where to meet me and tomorrow ill tell you who killed rosenberg and jensen do you know who did it i know who paid for the killings i know his name i know his business and his politics and youll tell me tomorrow if im still alive a pause perhaps we should talk immediately he said they met in her room in the st moritz hotel in new york they chatted for a while getting to know each other it was the first normal conversation darby had had for a week and it was a great pleasure they sent out for some food and after they had eaten he switched on a recorder and she told him a story for centuries the mississippi river has been carrying mud down to the sea where the river meets the sea marshes have spread out over an enormous area these marshes are the home for a great many rare and unusual animals birds reptiles and fish then oil was discovered there in the oil companies began to destroy the marshes where the river mud had been creating new land now the sea was able to wash the land away since the discovery of oil tens of thousands of acres of louisiana marshland has gone every fourteen minutes another acre disappears under water in an oil company owned by victor mattiece found a very rich oilfield worth thousands of millions of dollars mattiece wanted it all he knew that others would buy the surrounding land if they heard there was a major oilfield there so he pretended that nothing had happened he stopped work there and waited slowly and patiently as the years passed he bought the surrounding land he created new companies lots of them so that no one would know that he was the buyer at last he was ready to begin drilling then a small environmental group called green rescue made a legal request to the courts to stop the drilling the request was unexpected because for so long louisiana had profited from the oil companies the court in lafayette agreed that all drilling should stop until the case was settled mattiece knew that this could take years he was dangerously angry he spent weeks with his lawyers making plans but every move they made was disallowed by the courts people were sympathetic to green rescues case a lot of wildlife was at risk the marshland where mattiece wanted to drill was home to a great many rare and beautiful sea birds including brown pelicans there were very few of these pelicans left when people thought about the case they thought about the pelicans at last the case came to trial green rescue lost and that was not surprising mattiece had spent millions of dollars and had the best lawyers in the country but the judge still forbade the drilling to start the pelican was a protected bird under louisiana law and green rescue werent finished yet they would take the case all the way to the supreme court how long would it take to reach the supreme court gray asked between three and five years by then rosenberg would be dead anyway yes but it might be a democratic president who was choosing the judge to take his place mattiece couldnt take that chance and jensen was always soft on environmental cases mattiece needed two republican judges in there both of whom were supporters of big business can you prove that all the companies involved in buying the land in louisiana are owned by mattiece its in the brief and ive written it all out for you and then theres the photograph tell me seven years ago before the president was elected he was in new orleans getting money for the republicans although mattiece stays out of the public eye he was there that day and some clever photographer got a picture of him shaking hands with the president both of them are smiling and they look like old friends its beautiful i can easily find a copy of that this whole thing is beautiful its the biggest story since watergate maybe even bigger gray turned off the recorder and sat back in his chair they were silent for a short while then he asked do you think mattiece himself chose rosenberg and jensen no im sure he had advice from a lawyer hes got lawyers all over the country gray sat up again does he have any in washington yes there are two firms there who do some work for him brim stearns and kidlow is one of them the other is white and blazevich a very old republican firm but why are you interested gray quickly told her about garcia maybe he works at one of those two firms he said that would make it much easier to find him they were both tired she asked him to sleep on the sofa in her room that night so that she could get a good nights sleep for the first time for days he agreed she was so beautiful that he would do anything to be close her he would even sleep on a fivefoot sofa chapter thirteen washington darby worked in the library all morning and rang grantham at midday she had been reading lists of the members at both the washington law firms that worked for mattiece there was no one called garcia on either list of course there were four spanish names among the lawyers who worked for brim stearns and kidlow but none among the who worked for white and blazevich she rang gray with this information from a pay phone in a cafe on sixth avenue as she turned to leave she saw the short man who had been looking for her in new orleans he was here in new york walking the streets he didnt look inside the cafe however for the moment she was safe but it was time to leave new york two hours later she was at newark airport when this was all over if she was still alive where could she go she thought of the thousands of islands in the caribbean no one could find her there she no longer wanted to practise law all she wanted to do was reach her twentyfifth birthday and maybe her thirtieth too croft spent a week waiting outside the offices of brim stearns and kidlow there were plenty of lawyers who looked as young as garcia and they all dressed similarly in dark suits but there was no garcia he was sure of it some of the people employed by the white house didnt work at the white house some were so secret that their offices were elsewhere and very few people knew of their existence matthew barr was one of these shadowy people he was riding in the back of the car with coal coal was silent while barr read the pelican brief when he had finished barr said id love to know how much of this is true so would we coal said what did the president say about it he agreed that the theory was implausible so he asked voyles not to investigate it really and what if its true then the president has got problems me too they rode in silence for a while and watched the traffic then coal said we need to know if the brief is true if people are dying its true why else did callahan and verheek die there was no other reason and coal knew it i want you to do something find the girl no go to mattiece and talk to him it wont be easy he isnt exactly listed in the phone book you can do it youve done more difficult things for us in the past youve done worse for us too and you think victor will trust me and tell me his secrets why not youre not a policeman you can help him you can tell him that the press will have the story soon and so it would be a good idea for him to disappear then hell trust you what if its true what will you do next the first thing will be for the president to appoint two naturelovers to the supreme court that will show people that we really care for the environment then at the same time he will get the fbi to start an official investigation into victor mattiece barr was smiling with admiration what about the photograph he asked easy its seven years old we say that in those days mattiece was a good citizen not a madman as he is now anyway by sunday ill tell you where he is ive got a man working on it be ready to leave darby called gray at the next morning at his office im here she said where are you calling from gray asked im staying at the tabard inn i saw an old friend in new york and decided it was time to leave i hope i didnt bring any of them with me i bought two plane tickets with my card for them to follow but i paid cash for the one i really used even then i changed planes four times if they follow me here they must be magicians if i see any of them here i think ill just surrender when do we meet meet me in the restaurant here at nine tonight but gray dont use your own car hire another one and be ready to stay away from your home and office for a few days ive booked you a room at the marbury hotel surely the office is safe darby im not in the mood to argue if youre going to be difficult gray ill simply disappear im sure ill live longer out of the country anyway ive got to go now you be careful the marbury was close to where his boss smith keen lived and there were some things they had to talk about the next morning he rang keen from his room and they arranged to meet outside the front of the hotel in fifteen minutes while they drove around in keens car they discussed various ways in which they could use the information they had they agreed that finding garcia was the key to the whole story without garcia they had little more than rumour and an unlikely theory they hoped that garcias information really was as important as they were guessing it was she had told him to stay off the streets and to eat in his room after keen had left him near his hotel he bought a sandwich and a cup of coffee and returned to his room an asian cleaning woman was working outside his room did you forget something sir she asked gray looked at her what do you mean you just left your room sir and now youre back i left two hours ago no sir a man left your room ten minutes ago she hesitated and looked at his face closely but now i see that it was another man sir he walked quickly to the stairs and ran all the way down to the ground floor what was in his room nothing important just some clothes nothing about darby her phone number at the tabard inn was in his pocket he had to find her and quick chapter fourteen curtis d morgan darby spent the day in the georgetown law library reading and taking notes about the members of the washington law firms that mattiece used it was boring work and her mind often wandered she thought a lot about thomas matthew barr went to new orleans where he met a lawyer who told him to fly to a certain hotel in fort lauderdale florida he wouldnt tell barr what was going to happen there but when barr arrived he found a room waiting for him a note at the front desk of the hotel said he would receive a phone call in the early morning he called fletcher coal at home at ten and told him the news she stepped on the note when she opened her door it said darby im in the garden its urgent gray she locked the door went downstairs through the restaurant and out into the garden she found him sitting at a small table half hidden behind a wall why are you here she demanded in a whisper he told her what had happened and what hed done for the rest of the day he had spent it riding round the city in a dozen different taxis waiting for dark then he came to the tabard he was certain that no one had followed him she listened she watched the restaurant and the entrance to the garden and heard every word i have no idea how anyone could find my room he said did you tell anyone your room number he thought for a second only smith keen but he didnt have time to tell anyone else where were you when you told him in his car she shook her head slowly i told you not to tell anyone didnt i you think this is all a game its not gray its real this isnt just a great newspaper story which is going to make gray grantham famous and win him prizes ive seen people die god knows how many times ive been close to death myself these people are dangerous and theyre professionals they know about you and the washington post theyve probably been listening to you since you wrote the first story about this matter theyll have microphones hidden in your apartment your car and your office it looks as though theyve got microphones in keens car as well do you understand what im saying last night at dinner we tried to pretend we were two normal people getting to know each other but that wasnt real this is real she was right of course he felt like a schoolchild in front of an angry teacher you can stay here tonight she said and tomorrow ill find you another small hotel after breakfast the next morning she got on the phone she rang the georgetown law school and pretended to be from white and blazevich she said that their computers were not working and that for the sake of her records she needed to know which students had worked for white and blazevich last summer she waited with her hand over the mouthpiece of the phone and looked at gray the secretary from the law school came back on the phone seven of them darby said thank you she wrote down their names and do you have their addresses please we need them for our records she wrote down this information too that was brilliant gray said when she had finished now all we need to do is find as many of these students as we can show them your photograph of garcia and hope that one of them recognizes him and can tell us his real name why couldnt we just wait outside the firms building until he came out and then follow him thats what croft was doing at brim stearns and kidlow too risky it seems likely that white and blazevich were involved in some way in the killings there are people who know my face and we know theyre looking for you too what if theyre guarding white and blazevich they would see us and then wed be dead they hired a car and began to try to find the seven students gray found two of them at home and darby spoke to another as he was leaving a class at the school none of them recognized garcia they met at and compared notes at eleven students were leaving their classes and she found another of the seven students but he too knew nothing a fifth was working in the library she didnt like answering darbys questions but she admitted that she didnt know garcia only two left edward linney and judith wilson wilson was expected back at her apartment at one oclock so gray spent the rest of the morning trying to find linney but he was not at home and no one at the school seemed to know where he was they hadnt seen him for several weeks they drove together to judith wilsons apartment she wasnt there at one so they waited she arrived an hour later gray jumped out of the car ran up to her and caught her at her front door he showed her the photograph and darby saw her shake her head linney had better be good he said as he got back into the car but where is he i hope we find him today she said because tomorrow i leave the country if we dont back at the law school one of his fellow students at last told them where he was in a private hospital he was well on the way to becoming an alcoholic and his parents had ordered him to spend some time there the nurse at the front desk of the hospital told gray that mr linney was in room but refused to let him see him gray asked to see the manager and while the nurse was fetching him gray whispered to darby room she left the waitingroom and boldly walked to his room she knocked and went in the young man looked surprised to see her im sara jacobs she said i work for the washington post may i ask you a question yes but how did you get in i just walked in you worked at white and blazevich last summer didnt you do you recognize this man she showed him the photograph yes hes whats his name i cant remember he works in the oil and gas department darby held her breath linney closed his eyes and thought morgan yes thats it his surname is morgan but i cant remember his first name whats this all about ill tell you later darby said and left gray was waiting for her back in the car she didnt say anything but immediately looked at the notes she had taken in the law library there he was garcia is curtis d morgan she said lets go chapter fifteen two appointments after five hours at sea in the small fast boat every bone in matthew barrs body was aching and he was wet and cold his only companion had been a man called larry who was extremely tall and looked very strong larry had met him in fort lauderdale and had not said a word to him since then they landed in a country barr believed was the bahamas a car took them to a small airfield where a lear jet was waiting the flight took about fortyfive minutes another car took them to a large house barr had no idea where they were barr was met by a man who called himself emil who led him round the outside of the house to a sunroom im afraid you must take off your shoes emil said with a polite smile and be careful not to step on the towels inside barr saw that towels were lying on the floor of the sun room making paths around the room a door on the other side of the room opened and victor mattiece came in barr stared mattiece was an extraordinary sight he was extremely thin and had long grey hair and a beard he wore only a pair of black sports shorts his toenails were yellow and very long he looked completely crazy sit over there he said pointing at a chair dont step on the towels when barr was seated mattiece asked what do you want he was staring out of a window the president sent me barr began he did not fletcher coal sent you all right we need to know whether the pelican brief is true have you read it have you yes does mr coal believe it to be true i dont know hes very worried thats why im here mr mattiece we have to know what if it is true then we have problems mattiece turned away from the window looked at barr and said do you know what i think i think coal is the problem he let too many people see the brief barr could not believe what he was hearing the man who had ordered so many deaths was blaming someone else for the situation is it true mr mattiece thats all i want to know behind barr a door opened without a sound larry in his socks and avoiding the towels stepped silently into the room mattiece walked over to the door and said softly of course its true he left the sunroom and went into the garden now what barr thought larry put the rope round barrs neck and barr did not hear or feel anything until it was too late mattiece did not want blood on the floor so larry simply broke his neck they reached the building where white and blazevichs offices were before five oclock she was wearing a dress and gray said she looked just right she could tell that he liked the way she looked and she found to her surprise that it didnt make her angry just a little sad about thomas she walked up to the secretary at the desk who said can i help you yes i have an appointment at five oclock with curtis morgan my name is dorothy blythe the secretarys mouth fell open and she said nothing darbys heart stopped is something the matter can you wait a moment the secretary said she got up and disappeared into another room run darbys mind was telling her run theres something wrong here but before she had time to do anything the secretary returned with a man good afternoon he said im jarreld schwabe one of the partners of the firm you say you have an appointment with curtis morgan yes is there a problem theres nothing in his appointment book well thats your fault not mine and what was the meeting about she felt weak i dont see why i have to tell you that why cant i see mr morgan because hes dead she was in shock dead yes schwabe said he was mugged in the street im sorry i can see this has been a shock for you she decided to act really upset she didnt want them to ask any more questions she wanted them to think that she was just a weak young woman im sorry she said i think id better go ill phone again for another appointment schwabe led her to the lift himself edwin sneller knew that he and his men had been wasting their time in new york the place was just too big then at last she moved some money from her bank in new orleans to granthams bank in washington snellers client owned the bank so he received any information he asked for that meant that she was in washington and that she and the reporter were working together he had two men with him and he had asked for more they had to do the job quickly but he felt less confident without khamel the girl had escaped so far and she could be hiding anywhere he would start with the washington post building grantham had to come back there some time gray found curtis d morgans address in the suburbs and they drove out together to the house mrs morgans father however refused to let them in to see her gray left his business card so that she could call him if she wanted to he told her father that morgan had spoken to him three times just before he died is that the end of garcia darby asked as they drove away well see tomorrow he said how do you feel at the moment do you feel safe ill be glad to sleep in your room tonight just like i did in new york but i dont have a sofa here she said where would you sleep she was smiling and this was a good sign but then she remembered callahan im not ready gray im sorry she rested her head on his shoulder while he drove the car im still frightened to death she said chapter sixteen morgans story beverly morgan called gray at four oclock the next morning my father would be angry with me if he knew i was calling she said the reporters were horrible to us after curtis was killed but i need to talk to someone she asked him how he knew her husband and gray explained about his phone calls and the murders of rosenberg and jensen he spoke to her patiently for a long time until he won her confidence what do you think he knew she asked i have no idea if he had written something down on paper where would it be in our lockbox in the bank but thats where all his legal papers were so ive already looked in there i did find another key in his desk though last saturday gray held his breath a key to another lockbox yes a box at first columbia bank thats odd because weve never used that bank i wasnt in a hurry to go to the bank and look in the box because i already had all his legal papers maybe it was even something i wouldnt want to see would you like me to look in the box for you gray asked i hoped you would say that yes please ill come round and get the key now he and darby drove to the bank the next morning mrs morgan had given gray written permission to open the lockbox so the clerk let them into the strongroom it didnt take them long to empty the box all it held was a thin envelope darby opened the envelope when they were back in the car inside was a document written by morgan and properly signed by a legal witness the document started since you are reading this i am probably dead it was a powerful first sentence in the document morgan described who he was and where he worked he said that he often worked for one of the firms clients who was called victor mattiece the partner in charge of mr mattiece was f sims wakefield morgan explained the louisiana case and how important it was to mr mattiece it was important to white and blazevich too since mattiece had promised them a share of the profits from the oil on or about september the document continued morgan had been in wakefields office collecting some files when he returned to his own office he found that by mistake he had picked up a note from wakefields desk together with the files a copy of the note was joined on to morgans document the note was dated september and was from marty velmano another partner it read sims tell our client that the court will be easier on him if rosenberg is retired the second retirement is a bit unusual it is jensen who as you know has those other problems the note amazed and frightened morgan realizing its importance he made a copy of it and returned the original to the bottom of the pile of files ten minutes later wakefield came into his office looking pale and worried they found the note under the files and wakefield asked morgan if he had read it morgan said no wakefield looked at him very closely but seemed satisfied that night he left the papers on his desk very tidy the next morning he could see that someone had searched his desk he began to see velmano in wakefields office more than usual wakefield stopped him working for mattiece then rosenberg and jensen were killed he was sure that mattiece had ordered the killings he thought that people were following him he had decided to hide his copy of the note together with this document in a bank in case he was killed he was very frightened that was the end of the document the thinfaced man watched the car come fast round the corner and park illegally outside the post building the man and the woman jumped out of the car and ran past him into the building he had a gun inside his jacket but it all happened too fast smith keen and the posts lawyer vincent litsky read through morgans document when they had finished gray said well gentlemen theres your independent witness can we print darbys story now keen and litsky looked at each other keen left the office for a few minutes to speak to the newspapers owner when he came back he said ok gray we do the story how long will it take you to write it i already know the shape of it gray replied i only have to write the details it should take me about two hours its eleven oclock now keen said try to finish it by three litsky needs time to read it before we print with darbys help he finished the story on time keen and litsky read it and made some changes darby was watching something out of the window when ive rewritten the story gray said when keen and litsky had finished i have to make some phone calls well be back at half past three keen said theyre outside darby said softly when keen and litsky had left the room who are i was watching a man standing on the corner he looks innocent enough hes just standing there drinking coffee from a cup but hes been there a long time i saw him earlier as well and just now when you were talking i saw the short man who chased me last week come up to the coffeedrinker they talked for a minute and then the short man disappeared again theyre just waiting for us to leave the building chapter seventeen time to trust someone the first phone call was to a friend of grantham at the fbi phil this is gray grantham ive got the recorder on that sounds serious go on were going to print a story tomorrow about the rosenberg and jensen killings were going to name victor mattiece as the man behind the killings and also two of his lawyers here in washington well connect this story with the killing of verheek in new orleans we believe the fbi knew about mattiece early on but refused to investigate at the request of the white house we want to give you the chance to comment there was silence phil are you there yes i think so any comment im sure we will have a comment but ill have to call you back ok ill look forward to it in fact it was voyles himself who called back about ten minutes later he demanded to speak to smith keen what are you doing smith he said were still investigating mattiece its too early to be sure what have you got does the name darby shaw mean anything to you keen asked yes we have the pelican brief denton and im sitting here looking at darby shaw i was afraid she was dead no shes not and she and gray grantham have an independent witness to support the brief its a big story denton we need to meet ill come round in twenty minutes ok keen put the phone down and smiled he was amused at the idea of the great f denton voyles coming round to his office for a meeting the next phone call gray made was to fletcher coal in the white house coal agreed that mattiece had given large amounts of money towards the presidents election but denied that mattiece and the president were close friends he had to admit that he was familiar with the pelican brief when gray asked why there had not been an immediate investigation of mattiece coal angrily denied that the white house had tried to slow down such an investigation then voyles arrived with k o lewis keen took him into his own office and gave him a copy of the story to read while gray made the third phone call he rang white and blazevich and was put through to marty velmano for the third time he explained that he was recording the conversation mr velmano gray said were printing a story in the morning which names your client victor mattiece as the man behind thekillings of rosenberg and jensen good said velmano well take you to court by the time were finished mr mattiece will own the washington post mr velmano we have a copy of the pelican brief have you heard of it silence we also have a copy of a note you sent to sims wakefield on september in the note you suggested that your clients position would be a lot better without rosenberg and jensen on the supreme court silence mr velmano are you there yes we wanted to give you the chance to comment do you have any comment youre going to destroy me velmano said voyles and lewis entered the room with smith keen keen introduced them to darby and gray voyles smiled at darby and said so youre the one who started all this no sir she said i think it was mattiece they sat around a table voyles had a piece of paper he said im going to read you something this is official and you can use it in your paper anything else lewis or i say is unofficial and you cant use it is that clear keen and grantham said yes all right voyles said we received a copy of the pelican brief two weeks ago and showed it to the white house on the same day it was personally delivered by k o lewis to fletcher coal eric east was also present at the meeting we thought it was worth investigation but nothing happened for six days until gavin verheek was murdered in new orleans the fbi began a full investigation into victor mattiece involving over four hundred men we believe victor mattiece to be the main suspect in the murders of rosenberg jensen thomas callahan and verheek and we are trying to find him did the white house interfere with your investigation of mattiece grantham asked this is now unofficial voyles said you cant use it ok ok yes the president asked me not to investigate mattiece he said it could be embarrassing to the government i recorded the conversation they could hardly believe what they were hearing he recorded the president i will not allow anyone to hear that recording voyles continued unless the president denies what i have just told you anyway will you use the official story ive given you will you put coals name there on the front page along with everyone else yes i think he belongs there keen said good said voyles can you give me some early copies of the newspaper tomorrow morning i want to take them round to him myself and watch his face hell take the blame keen said it will be the end of his career but hell make the president look innocent yes i think youre right said voyles now id like to speak to miss shaw alone please if thats all right with her ok she said but grantham stays all right when everyone else had left the room voyles asked what are you going to do next first tell me who killed gavin verheek she said it was khamel and khamel was the one who was shot in the head as you were holding his hand by the river who killed him we think it was someone from the cia we know the cia were investigating mattiece in a small way in his oil business mattiece had connections with some unfriendly arab countries so the cia were already keeping an eye on him when they saw a copy of the pelican brief they sent a few men down to new orleans to look after you darby got up and went to the window it was dark outside now they didnt do a very good job then she said there are men out there now who have been following me for a week or more one of them chased me in new orleans so i dont think hes cia mattiece is so crazy that hell go on trying to kill me even after he goes to prison if you catch him we can help voyles said we can get you out of the country it was time to trust someone she took a deep breath all right she said ill go and make the arrangements voyles said alone in the room darby walked into grays arms its going to be all right now he said holding her its over youre safe im going alone gray she said ill call you when im ready chapter eighteen away from it all by pm only four lawyers remained in the offices of white and blazevich they were velmano sims wakefield jarreld schwabe and a retired partner named frank cortz cortz finished a phone conversation with one of victor mattieces staff that was strider he said theyre in cairo in some hotel mattiece wont talk to us and of course he isnt coming back over here strider says hes behaving very strangely theyve told the boys with the guns to leave town immediately the chase is over so what are we supposed to do asked wakefield were on our own said cortz mattiece isnt going to help us there was silence around the table as they all looked into the future then velmano said grantham only mentioned me and sims you two may be ok and ive got enough money saved to spend the rest of my life hiding in europe its all right for you wakefield said i cant hide ive got a wife and six children i think you should go home and tell your wife what to expect velmano said i cant do that wakefield said he got up and left the room a minute later they heard the sound of a single gunshot from his office after eight days in the sun of the virgin islands her skin was brown enough and her hair was returning to its natural colour she walked miles up and down the beaches and ate nothing except fish and fruit she slept a lot the first few days she looked at her wrist and then remembered that her watch was in a bag somewhere she didnt need it here she woke with the sun and went to bed after dark but now she was waiting so she had looked at her wrist it was almost dark when the taxi stopped at the end of the small road he got out paid the driver and looked at the lights as the car disappeared back up the road he had one bag he could see a light from the house between the trees at the edge of the beach and he walked towards it he didnt know what to expect he knew how he felt about her but did she feel the same she was waiting at the back of the house looking out to sea with a drink in her hand she smiled at him put down her drink and let him come to her they kissed for a long minute youre late she said this is not the easiest place to find gray said even when you have directions i know she said thats the idea its beautiful though isnt it it is you are too lets go for a walk she said he changed into a pair of shorts and they walked together on the beach hand in hand you left early she said i got tired of it ive written a story a day since the big one and they kept wanting more i was working eighteen hours a day yesterday i said goodbye i havent seen a paper for days she said coals finished the president will be ok i dont think he did anything really bad hes just stupid he wont get reelected though you read about wakefield yes that was in the last paper i saw theyve got schwabe they want velmano too but hes disappeared of course mattiece is in deep trouble and theyre after four of his men too they walked in silence along the beach she put her arm round his waist and he pulled her closer ive missed you she said softly he breathed deeply but said nothing how long will you stay she asked i dont know a couple of weeks maybe a year it depends on you lets take it a month at a time ok gray perfect the end
