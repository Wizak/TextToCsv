that no man may him bote bede or elles that devocioun of somme and contemplacioun causeth swiche dremes ofte or that the cruel lyf unsofte which these ilke lovers leden that hopen over muche or dreden that purely hir impressiouns causeth hem avisiouns or if that spirites have the might to make folk to dreme anight or if the soule of propre kinde be so parfit as men finde that hit forwot that is to

decembre the tenthe day whan hit was night to slepe i lay right ther as i was wont to done and fil on slepe wonder sone as he that wery was forgo on pilgrimage myles two to the corseynt leonard to make lythe of that was hard but as i sleep me mette i was within a temple ymad of glas in whiche ther were mo images of gold stondinge in sondry stages and mo riche tabernacles and with perre mo pinacles and mo curious portreytures and queynte maner of figures of olde werke then i saw ever for certeynly i niste never wher that i was but wel wiste i hit was of venus redely the temple for in

vulcano that in his face was ful broun but as i romed up and doun i fond that on a wal ther was thus writen on a table of bras i wol now singe if that i can the armes and also the man that first cam through his destinee fugitif of troye contree in itaile with ful moche pyne unto the strondes of lavyne and tho began the story anoon as i shal telle yow echoon first saw i the destruccioun of troye through the greek sinoun that with his false forsweringe and his chere and his lesinge made the hors broght into troye thorgh which troyens loste al hir ioye and after this was grave allas how ilioun assailed was and wonne and king priam yslayn and polites his sone certayn dispitously of dan pirrus and next that saw i how venus whan that she saw the castel brende doun fro the hevene gan descende and bad hir sone eneas flee and how he fledde and how that he escaped was from al the pres and took his fader anchises and bar him on his bakke away cryinge allas and welaway the whiche anchises in his honde bar the goddes of the londe thilke that unbrende were and i saw next in alle this fere how creusa daun eneas wyf which that he lovede as his lyf and hir yonge sone iulo and eek ascanius also fledden eek with drery chere that hit was pitee for to here and in a forest as they wente at a turninge of a wente how creusa was ylost allas that deed but noot i how she was how he hir soughte and how hir gost bad him to flee the grekes ost and seyde he most unto itaile as was his destinee sauns faille that hit was pitee for to here whan hir spirit gan appere the wordes that she to him seyde and for to kepe hir sone him preyde ther saw i graven eek how he his fader eek and his meynee with his shippes gan to sayle toward the contree of itaile as streight as that they mighte go ther saw i thee cruel iuno that art daun iupiteres wyf that hast yhated al thy lyf al the troyanisshe blood renne and crye as thou were wood on eolus the god of windes to blowen out of alle kindes so loude that he shulde drenche lord and lady grome and wenche of al the troyan nacioun withoute any savacioun ther saw i swich tempeste aryse that every herte mighte agryse to see hit peynted on the walle ther saw i graven eek withalle venus how ye my lady dere wepinge with ful woful chere prayen iupiter an hye to save and kepe that navye of the troyan eneas sith that he hir sone was ther saw i ioves venus kisse and graunted of the tempest lisse ther saw i how the tempest stente and how with alle pyne he wente and prevely took arrivage in the contree of cartage and on the morwe how that he and a knight hight achatee metten with venus that day goinge in a queynt array as she had ben an hunteresse with wind blowinge upon hir tresse how eneas gan him to pleyne whan that he knew hir of his peyne and how his shippes dreynte were or elles lost he niste where how she gan him comforte tho and bad him to cartage go and ther he shulde his folk finde that in the see were left behinde and shortly of this thing to pace she made eneas so in grace of dido quene of that contree that shortly for to tellen she becam his love and leet him do that that wedding longeth to what shulde i speke more queynte or peyne me my wordes peynte to speke of love hit wol not be i can not of that facultee and eek to telle the manere how they aqueynteden infere hit were a long proces to telle and over long for yow to

the reverence and leyde on him al the dispence that any woman mighte do weninge hit had al be so as he hir swoor and herby demed that he was good for he swich semed allas what harm doth apparence whan hit is fals in existence for he to hir a traitour was wherfor she slow hirself allas lo how a woman doth amis to love him that unknowen is for by crist lo thus hit fareth hit is not al gold that glareth for also brouke i wel myn heed ther may be under goodliheed kevered many a shrewed vyce therfor be no wight so nyce to take a love only for chere for speche or for frendly manere for this shal every woman finde that som man of his pure kinde wol shewen outward the faireste til he have caught that what him leste and thanne wol he causes finde and swere how that she is unkinde or fals or prevy or double was al this seye i by eneas and dido and hir nyce lest that lovede al to sone a gest therfor i wol seye a proverbe that he that fully knoweth therbe may saufly leye hit to his ye withoute dreed this is no lye but let us speke of eneas how he betrayed hir allas and lefte hir ful unkindely so whan she saw alutterly that he wolde hir of trouthe faile and wende fro hir to itaile she gan to wringe hir hondes two allas quod she what me is wo allas is every man thus trewe that every yere wolde have a newe if hit so longe tyme dure or elles three peraventure as thus of oon he wolde have fame in magnifying of his name another for frendship seith he and yet ther shal the thridde be that shal be taken for delyt lo or for singular profyt in swiche wordes gan to pleyne dido of hir grete peyne as me mette redely non other auctour alegge i allas quod she my swete herte have pitee on my sorwes smerte and slee me not go noght away o woful dido wel away quod she to hirselve tho

we ben deceyved for though your love laste a sesoun wayte upon the conclusioun and eek how that ye determynen and for the more part diffynen o welawey that i was born for through yow is my name lorn and alle myn actes red and songe over al this lond on every tonge o wikke fame for ther nis nothing so swift lo as she is o sooth is every thing is wist though hit be kevered with the mist eek thogh i mighte duren ever that i have doon rekever i never that i ne shal be seyd allas yshamed be through eneas and that i shal thus iuged be lo right as she hath doon now she wol do eftsones hardily thus seyth the peple prevely but that is doon nis not to done al hir compleynt ne al hir mone certeyn availeth hir not a stre and when she wiste sothly he was forth unto his shippes goon she in hir chambre wente anoon and called on hir suster anne and gan hir to compleyne thanne and seyde that she cause was that she first lovede eneas and thus counseilled hir therto but what when this was seyd and do she roof hirselve to the herte and deyde through the wounde smerte but al the maner how she deyde and al the wordes that she seyde whoso to knowe hit hath purpos reed virgile in eneidos or the epistle of ovyde what that she wroot or that she dyde and nere hit to long to endyte by god i wolde hit here wryte but welaway the harm the routhe that hath betid for swich untrouthe as men may ofte in bokes rede and al day seen hit yet in dede that for to thenken hit a tene is lo demophon duk of athenis how he forswor him ful falsly and trayed phillis wikkedly that kinges doghter was of trace and falsly gan his terme pace and when she wiste that he was fals she heng hirself right by the hals for he had do hir swich untrouthe lo was not this a wo and routhe eek lo how fals and reccheles was to breseida achilles and paris to enone and iason to isiphile and eft iason to medea and ercules to dyanira for he left hir for iole that made him cacche his deeth parde how fals eek was he theseus that as the story telleth us how he betrayed adriane the devel be his soules bane for had he laughed had he loured he moste have be al devoured if adriane ne had ybe and for she had of him pitee she made him fro the dethe escape and he made hir a ful fals iape for aftir this within a whyle he lefte hir slepinge in an yle deserte alone right in the see and stal away and leet hir be and took hir suster phedra tho with him and gan to shippe go and yet he had ysworn to here on al that ever he mighte swere that so she saved him his lyf he wolde have take hir to his wyf for she desired nothing elles in certein as the book us telles but to excusen eneas fulliche of al his greet trespas the book seyth mercurie sauns faile bad him go into itaile and leve auffrykes regioun and dido and hir faire toun tho saw i grave how to itaile daun eneas is go to saile and how the tempest al began and how he loste his steresman which that the stere or he took keep smot overbord lo as he sleep and also saw i how sibyle and eneas besyde an yle to helle wente for to see his fader anchises the free how he ther fond palinurus and dido and eek deiphebus and every tourment eek in helle saw he which is long to telle which whoso willeth for to knowe he most rede many a rowe on virgile or on claudian or daunte that hit telle can tho saw i grave al tharivaile that eneas had in itaile and with king latine his tretee

god me blesse ioves halt hit greet humblesse and vertu eek that thou wolt make anight ful ofte thyn heed to ake in thy studie so thou wrytest and evermo of love endytest in honour of him and preysinges and in his foikes furtheringes and in hir matere al devysest and noght him nor his folk despysest although thou mayst go in the daunce of hem that him list not avaunce wherfor as i seyde ywis iupiter considereth this and also beau sir other thinges that is that thou hast no tydinges of loves folk if they be glade ne of noght elles that god made and noght only fro fer contree that ther no tyding comth to thee but of thy verray neyghebores that dwellen almost at thy dores thou herest neither that ne this for whan thy labour doon al is and hast ymaad thy rekeninges in stede of reste

no why quod he for hit were impossible to my wit though that fame hadde al the pyes in al a realme and al the spyes how that yet she shulde here al this or they espye hit o yis yis quod he to me that can i preve by resoun worthy for to leve so that thou yeve thyn advertence to understonde my sentence first shalt thou heren wher she dwelleth and so thyn owne book hit telleth hir paleys stant as i shal seye right even in middes of the weye betwixen hevene erthe and see that whatsoever in al these three is spoken in privee or aperte the way therto is so overte and stant eek in so iuste a place that every soun mot to hit pace or what so comth fro any tonge be hit rouned red or songe or spoke in seurtee or in drede certein hit moste thider nede now herkne wel forwhy i wille tellen thee a propre skile and worthy demonstracioun in myn imagynacioun geffrey thou wost right wel this that every kindly thing that is hath a kindly stede ther he may best in hit conserved be unto which place every thing through his kindly enclyning moveth for to come to whan that hit is awey therfro as thus lo thou mayst al day see that any thing that hevy be as stoon or leed or thing of wighte and ber hit never so hye on highte lat goo thyn hand hit falleth doun right so seye i by fyre or soun or smoke or other thinges lighte alwey they seke upward on highte whyl ech of hem is at his large light thing up and dounward charge and for this cause mayst thou see that every river to the see enclyned is to go by kinde and by these skilles as i finde hath fish dwellinge in floode and see and trees eek in erthe be thus every thing by this resoun hath his propre mansioun to which hit seketh to repaire as ther hit shulde not apaire lo this sentence is knowen couthe of every philosophres mouthe as aristotle and dan platon and other clerkes many oon and to confirme my resoun thou wost wel this that speche is soun or elles no man mighte hit here now herkne what i wol thee lere soun is noght but air ybroken and every speche that is spoken loud or privee foul or fair in his substaunce is but air for as flaumbe is but lighted smoke right so soun is air ybroke but this may be in many wyse of which i wil thee two devise as soun that comth of pype or harpe for whan a pype is blowen sharpe the air is twist with violence and rent lo this is my sentence eke whan men harpestringes smyte whether hit be moche or lyte lo with the strook the air tobreketh right so hit breketh whan men speketh thus wost thou wel what thing is speche now hennesforth i wol thee teche how every speche or noise or soun through his multiplicacioun thogh hit were pyped of a mouse moot nede come to fames house i preve hit thus tak hede now be experience for if that thou throwe on water now a stoon wel wost thou hit wol make anoon a litel roundel as a cercle paraventer brood as a covercle and right anoon thou shalt see weel that wheel wol cause another wheel and that the thridde and so forth brother every cercle causinge other wyder than himselve was and thus fro roundel to compas ech aboute other goinge caused of othres steringe and multiplying evermo til that hit be so fer ygoo that hit at bothe brinkes be althogh thou mowe hit not ysee above hit goth yet alway under although thou thenke hit a gret wonder and whoso seith of trouthe i varie bid him proven the contrarie and right thus every word ywis that loude or privee spoken is moveth first an air aboute and of this moving out of doute another air anoon is meved as i have of the water preved that every cercle causeth other right so of air my leve brother everich air in other stereth more and more and speche up bereth or vois or noise or word or soun ay through multiplicacioun til hit be atte house of fame tak hit in ernest or in game now have i told if thou have minde how speche or soun of pure kinde enclyned is upward to meve this mayst thou fele wel i preve and that the mansioun ywis that every thing enclyned to is hath his kindeliche stede that sheweth hit withouten drede that kindely the mansioun of every speche of every soun be hit either foul or fair hath his kinde place in air and sin that every thing that is out of his kinde place ywis moveth thider for to go if hit aweye be therfro as i before have preved thee hit seweth every soun pardee moveth kindeiy to pace al up into his kindely place and this place of which i telle ther as fame list to dwelle is set amiddes of these three heven erthe and eek the see as most conservatif the soun than is this the conclusioun that every speche of every man as i thee telle first began moveth up on high to pace kindely to fames place telle me this feithfully have i not preved thus simply withouten any subtiltee of speche or gret prolixitee of termes of philosophye of figures of poetrye or colours of rethoryke pardee hit oghte thee to lyke for hard langage and hard matere is encombrous for to here at ones wost thou not wel this and i answerde and seydeyis a ha quod he lo so i can lewedly to a lewed man speke and shewe him swiche skiles that he may shake hem by the biles so palpable they shulden be but tel me this now pray i thee how thinkth thee my conclusioun quod he a good persuasioun quod i hit is and lyk to be right so as thou hast preved me by god quod he and as i leve thou shalt have yit or hit be eve of every word of this sentence a preve by experience and with thyn eres heren wel top and tail and everydel that every word that spoken is comth into fames hous ywis as i have seyd what wilt thou more and with this word upper to sore he gan and seyde be seynt iame now wil we speken al of game how farest thou quod he to me wel quod i now see quod he by thy trouthe yond adoun wher that thou knowest any toun or hous or any other thing and whan thou hast of ought knowing loke that thou warne me and i anoon shal telle thee how fer that thou art now therfro and i adoun gan loken tho and beheld feldes and plaines and now hilles and now mountaines now valeys and now forestes and now unethes grete bestes now riveres now citees now tounes and now grete trees now shippes saillinge in the see but thus sone in a whyle he was flowen fro the grounde so hye that al the world as to myn ye no more semed than a prikke or elles was the air so thikke that i ne mighte not discerne with that he spak to me as yerne and seyde seestow any toun or ought thou knowest yonder doun i seyde nay no wonder nis quod he for half so high as this nas alexander macedo ne the king dan scipio that saw in dreme at point devys helle and erthe and paradys ne eek the wrecche dedalus ne his child nyce icarus that fleigh so highe that the hete his winges malt and he fel wete inmid the see and ther he dreynte for whom was maked moch compleynte now turn upward quod he thy face and behold this large place this air but loke thou ne be adrad of hem that thou shalt see for in this regioun certein dwelleth many a citezein of which that speketh dan plato these ben the eyrish bestes lo and so saw i al that meynee bothe goon and also flee now quod he tho cast up thyn ye see yonder lo the galaxye which men clepeth the milky wey for hit is whyt and somme parfey callen hit watlinge strete that ones was ybrent with hete whan the sonnes sone the rede that highte pheton wolde lede algate his fader cart and gye the carthors gonne wel espye that he ne coude no governaunce and gonne for to lepe and launce and beren him now up now doun til that he saw the scorpioun which that in heven a signe is yit and he for ferde loste his wit of that and leet the reynes goon of his hors and they anoon gonne up to mounte and doun descende til bothe the eyr and erthe brende til iupiter lo atte laste him slow and fro the carte caste lo is it not a greet mischaunce to lete a fole han governaunce of thing that he can not demeine and with this word soth for to seyne he gan alway upper to sore and gladded me ay more and more so feithfully to me spak he tho gan i loken under me and beheld the eyrish bestes cloudes mistes and tempestes snowes hailes reines windes and thengendring in hir kindes and al the wey through whiche i cam o god quod i that made adam moche is thy might and thy noblesse and tho thoughte i upon boece that writ a thought may flee so hye with fetheres of philosophye to passen everich element and whan he hath so fer ywent than may be seen
