when a man reaches ninety years of living he is tempted to look back on his life to evaluate to consider his triumphs and his mistakes often he might think what if i had done this instead of that or if only i had that to do over well i dont have time for that kind of nonsense i look forward have always done so im a scotsman who has lived most of his long life away from the land of his birth america is my home i have made my family and raised my children here i have watched my grandchildren grow for nearly sixty years i have loved one woman lived with her admired her worked with her and worked around her when there wasnt any other way my anna is all that is precious to me between us well weve had a hell of a time im a rich man oh not just in dollars and possessions and property but in family family comes first thats something else that always was and always will be part of my life my anna and i made three children between us two sons and a daughter my pride in them is nearly as great as my love i have to admit though that it was necessary at one time to nudge these three strong individuals along to remind them of their duty to the macgregor name to the macgregor line i regret to say that my children were a bit slow in this area and their mother worried so with a little help they married well by well i mean they found the mate of their heart and those unions gave anna and me two more daughters and another fine son to dote on good stock strong blood to match a macgregor now i have eleven grandchildren three of them honorary macgregors though they be campbells by name campbells god help us but good children they are despite it they all have been the joy of our later years annas and mine as we watched them grow from babes to adults like their parents theyre slow to do their duty to understand the richness of marriage and family it worries their grandmother day and night im not a man to stand by and watch my wife fret no indeed i am not ive considered this carefully my three oldest granddaughters are of marriageable age they are strong intelligent and beautiful women theyre making their way in this world well on their own such things so anna has taught me are as important for a woman as for a man with laura gwendolyn and julia i have a lawyer a doctor and a businesswoman on my hands bright and lovely are my girls so the men ill pick for them to build their lives with must be rare men indeed ill not have them settle for less than that ive got my eye on a fine trio of lads all come from good strong stock handsome lads too ah wont they make lovely couples and give me pretty babes one at a time is the plan its best in such matters to give each one my full skill and attention so im starting with laura shes the eldest after all if i dont have young laura smelling orange blossoms by christmas my name isnt daniel macgregor once shes settled down i have just the boy in mind for my darling gwen julia might be the toughest nut of the three but im working on that just a little push is all ill give them im not a meddler after all just a concerned grandfather in the winter of his life and i intend for it to be a very long winter im going to watch my greatgrandchildren grow and how the devil am i to do that if these girls dont marry and get me babies i ask you hah well were going to see to that so anna wont fret of course part one laura chapter contents next it took six rings of the phone to reach a corner of her sleeping brain by the eighth she managed to slide a hand out from under the blankets she smacked the alarm clock first and slammed the cheery face of kermit the frog to the floor it was the third dead kermit that year her long unadorned fingers patted along the glossy surface of the walnut nightstand finally gripped the receiver and pulled it under the covers with her lo it rang ten times with the blankets over her head laura macgregor winced at the booming accusation then yawned did ten times one more ring and id have been calling i was seeing you lying in a pool of blood bed she managed and snuggled into the pillow sleeping good night its nearly eight oclock when in the morning hed identified the voice now knew which one of his granddaughters was burrowed in bed at what daniel macgregor considered the middle of the day a fine bright september morning you should be up enjoying it little girl instead of sleeping it away why he huffed lifes passing you by laura your grandmothers worried about you why she was just saying last night how she could barely get a moments peace of mind worrying about her oldest granddaughter anna had said nothing of the kind but the ploy of using his wife to finagle his family into doing what he wanted them to do was an old habit the macgregor appreciated traditions s fine everything dandy sleeping now grandpa well get up you havent visited your grandmother for weeks shes pining just because you think youre a grownup woman of twentyfour doesnt mean you should forget your dear old granny he winced at that a bit himself and glanced toward the door to make certain it was firmly shut if anna heard him refer to her as a dear old granny shed scalp him come up for the weekend he demanded bring your cousins got a brief to read she muttered and started drifting off again but soon make it sooner were not going to live forever you know yes you are ha ive sent you a present itll be there this morning so get yourself out of bed and prettied up wear a dress okay sure thanks grandpa bye laura dumped the receiver on the floor burrowed under the pillow and slid blissfully back into sleep twenty minutes later she was rudely awakened with a shake and a curse damn it laura you did it again what she shot up in bed dark eyes wide and glazed black hair tangled what left the phone off the hook julia macgregor fisted her hands on her hips and smoldered i was expecting a call i ah her mind was an unfocused blur laura shoved her hands through her sleeptousled hair as if to clear it mornings were just not her time of day i think grandpa called maybe i cant remember i didnt hear the phone julia shrugged i guess i was in the shower gwens already left for the hospital what did grandpa want when laura continued to look blank julia laughed and sat on the edge of the bed probably just the usual your grandmothers worried about you i seem to remember something about that smiling a little laura plopped back onto the pillows if youd have gotten out of the shower faster youd have caught the call then grandma would have been worried about you she was worried about me last week julia checked her antique marcasite watch ive got to run look at this property in brookline another one didnt you just buy another house last month it was two months ago and its nearly ready to turn over julia shook back her curling mane of flamecolored hair time for a new project whatever works for you my big plan was to sleep until noon then spend the rest of the afternoon on a brief laura rolled her shoulders fat chance around here youll have the place to yourself for the next few hours gwen has a double shift at the hospital and i dont expect to be back until five its not my night to cook ill pick something up pizza laura said immediately double cheese and black olives its never too early for you to think about dinner julia rose smoothed down the mossgreen jacket she wore over pleated trousers see you tonight she called on her way out and dont leave the phone off the hook laura studied the ceiling contemplating the sunlight and considered pulling the covers back over her head she could sleep another hour dropping off at will or whim had never been a problem for her and the skill had served her well in law school but the idea of pizza had stirred her appetite when there was a choice between sleep and food laura faced her biggest dilemma laura tossed the covers back as food won the battle she wore a simple white athletic tshirt and silk boxer shorts in electric blue shed lived with her two female cousins all through college and now for two years in the house in bostons back bay the thought of grabbing a robe never occurred to her the attractive little town house one of julias recent renovations and their newest home was decorated with an eclectic mix of their three tastes gwens love of antiques vied with julias appreciation for modern art and lauras own attraction to kitsch she jogged downstairs trailing her fingers over the satin finish of the oak railing glanced briefly through the etchedglass window in the front door to see that it was indeed a brilliantly sunny fall morning then swung down the hall toward the kitchen though each of the cousins had a fine mind conscientiously applied to their individual areas of expertise none of them was especially gifted in that particular room still theyd made it homey with soft yellow paint setting off the deep blue counters and glassfronted cabinets laura had always been grateful that the three of them had melded so well gwen and julia were her closest friends as well as her cousins along with the rest of the macgregor brood as laura thought of them the extended kin of daniel and anna were a closeknit if diverse family she glanced at the sapphireblue cat clock on the wall its eyes diamondbright its tail swinging rhythmically she thought of her parents and wondered if they were enjoying their muchdeserved holiday in the west indies undoubtedly they were caine and diana macgregor were a solid unit she mused husband and wife parents law partners twentyfive years of marriage the raising of two children and the building of one of the most respected law practices in boston hadnt dimmed their devotion she couldnt conceive of the amount of effort it took to make it all work much easier she decided to concentrate on one thing at a time for her for now that was law correction she thought and grinned at the refrigerator for right now that was breakfast she snagged the walkman lying on the counter and slipped on the headphones a little music with the morning meal she decided and cued up the tape royce cameron parked his jeep behind a spiffy little classic spitfire convertible in flaming red the kind of car and color he mused that screamed out officer another speeding ticket here please he shook his head at it then shifted his gaze to study the house it was a beaut that was to be expected in this ritzy area of the back bay and given the lineage of the owners boston was the red sox and paul revere and boston was the macgregors but he wasnt thinking of money or class as he studied the house his cool blue eyes scanned windows and doors a lot of glass he mused while the crisp autumn breeze ruffled his thick minkcolored hair a lot of glass meant a lot of access he started down the flagstone walk with its brilliant edgings of fall blooms then cut across the neat sloping lawn to consider the atrium doors that opened onto a small patio he tested them found them locked though one good kick he thought one good yank and hed be inside his eyes stayed cool his mouth hardened in a face full of planes and angles it was a face the woman he nearly married had once called criminal he hadnt asked her what she meant by that as theyd been well into their skid by then and he just hadnt wanted to know it could be cold that face and was now as he calculated access into the lovely old house which undoubtedly was packed with the antiques and jewelry rich women of a certain class enjoyed his eyes were a pale chilly blue that could warm and deepen unexpectedly his mouth was a firm line that could curve into charm or straighten to ice a small scar marred his strong chin the result of abrupt contact with a diamond pinkie ring that had ridden on a curled fist he skimmed just under six feet with the body of a boxer or a brawler hed been both now as the freshening breeze whipped the wave of his collarlength hair into disarray he decided he could be inside with pitifully little effort in under thirty seconds even if he didnt have a key to the front door he walked back around gave a quick loud series of buzzes on the doorbell while he gazed through the fancy glass of the entryway looked pretty he thought with the etching of flowers on frosted glass and was about as secure as tinfoil he buzzed one more time then took the key out of his pocket slid it into the lock and let himself in it smelled female that was his first thought as he stepped into the foyer onto polished parquet citrus oils flowers and the lingering whiff of a nicely seductive perfume in the air the staircase was a fluid sweep to his right the front parlor a welcoming opening to his left tidy as a nunnery he thought with the sensual scent of a firstclass bordello women to royces mind were an amazement it was pretty much as hed imagined the beautiful old furniture the soft colors the expensive dustpatchers and he thought noting the glitter of earrings on a small round table the pricey baubles one of them left sitting around he slid a mini tape recorder out of the back pocket of his jeans and began to make notes as he wandered through the large canvas splashed with wild colors that hung over the cherrywood mantel caught his eye it should have been jarring that bold scream of brilliance and shape in so quiet a room instead he found it compelling a celebration of passion and life hed just noted the signature in the comer dc macgregor and deduced that the painting was the work of one of the many macgregor cousins when he heard the singing no it couldnt in all honesty be called singing he decided turning the recorder off and slipping it into his pocket as he stepped back into the hall screaming howling perhaps caterwauling he reflected were better terms for such a vocal massacre of one of whitney houstons anthems to love but it meant that he wasnt alone in the house after all he headed down the hallway toward the noise and as he stepped through the doorway into a sunny kitchen his face split with a grin of pure male appreciation she was a long one he thought and most of it was leg the smooth golden length of them more than made up in his estimation for the complete lack of vocal talent and the way she was bending over head in the fridge hips bumping grinding circling presented such an entertaining show no man alive or dead would have complained that she sang offkey her hair was black as midnight straight as rain and tumbled to a waist that just begged to be spanned by a mans two hands and she was wearing some of the sexiest underwear it had ever been his pleasure to observe if the face lived up to the body it was really going to brighten his morning excuse me his brow lifted when instead of jolting or squealing as hed expected even hoped she continued to dig into the fridge and sing okay not that im not enjoying the performance but you might want to take five on it her hips did a quick enthusiastic twitch that had him whistling through his teeth then she reached for a note that should have cracked crystal and turned with a chicken leg in one hand and a softdrink can in the other she didnt jolt but she did scream royce held up a hand palm out and began to explain himself with the music still blaring through her headset all laura saw was a strange man with windblown hair faded jeans and a face that held enough wickedness to fuel a dozen devils aiming for his head she winged the soda he nipped it onehanded an inch before it smacked between his eyes but shed already whirled to the counter when she sprang back she had a carving knife gripped in her hand and a look in her eyes that warned him she wouldnt think twice about gutting him with it take it easy he held up both hands kept his voice mild dont move dont even breathe she said loudly as she inched along the counter toward the phone you take one step forward or back and ill cut your heart out he figured he could disarm her in about twenty seconds but one of them most likely him would need some stitches afterward im not moving look you didnt answer when i knocked im just here to it was then that he got past looking at the face and saw the headphones well that explains it very slowly he tapped a finger to his ear ran it over his head to the other and said with exaggerated enunciation take off the headphones shed just become aware of the music over the blood that was roaring in her head and ripped them off i said dont move im calling the cops okay royce tried an easy smile but youre going to look pretty stupid since im just doing my job cameron security you didnt answer when i knocked i guess whitney was singing too loud he kept his eyes on hers im just going to get out my id two fingers she ordered and move slow that was his intention those big dark eyes of hers held more temper and violence than fear a woman who could face a strange man down alone kitchen knife in hand without trembling wasnt a woman to challenge i had a nineoclock to assess the house and discuss systems she flicked her gaze down to the identification he held up an appointment with whom laura macgregor she closed her free hand around the phone im laura macgregor pal and i didnt make an appointment with you mr macgregor arranged the appointment she hesitated which mr macgregor royce smiled again the macgregor daniel macgregor i was to meet his granddaughter laura at nine and design and install the best security system known to man in order to protect his girls the smile flashed charmingly your grandmother worries laura took her hand from the phone but didnt put down the knife it was precisely the kind of thing her grandfather would do and exactly what hed say when did he hire you last week i had to go up to that fortress of his in hyannis port so he could check me out facetoface hell of a place hell of a man we had a scotch and a cigar after we did the deal really she arched a brow and what did my grandmother have to say about that about the deal about the cigars she wasnt there when we closed the deal and since he locked the door of his office before he got the cigars out of a hollowedout copy of war and peace i have to conclude she doesnt approve of cigars laura let out a long breath set the knife back in the wooden knife block okay mr cameron you pass he said youd be expecting me i take it you werent no i wasnt he called this morning said something about a present he was sending i think she shrugged her hair flowing with the movement picked up the drumstick shed dropped and dumped it in the wastecan how did you get in he gave me a key royce dug it out of his pocket and put it into the hand laura held out i did ring the bell several times uhhuh royce glanced down at the softdrink can youve got a good arm ms macgregor he shifted his gaze back to her face cheekbones that could cut glass he thought a mouth fashioned for wild sex and eyes the color of sinful dark chocolate and possibly the most incredible face ive ever seen she didnt like the way he was looking at it savoring it she thought with a stare that was arrogant rude and unnerving you have good reflexes mr cameron or youd be lying on my kitchen floor with a concussion right now might have been worth it he said with a grin that tried to be disarming but was just wicked and offered her back the soft drink ill get dressed then we can discuss security systems you dont have to change on my account she angled her head and gave him a look that encompassed him from his overly appreciative expression to his dontmesswithme stance yes i do because if you keep looking at me that way for another ten seconds you will have a concussion i wont be long she sailed by him royce turned as she passed so that he could enjoy watching her walk away on those endless fascinating legs and he whistled through his teeth again one way or the other he thought with a long appreciative sigh laura macgregor was a knockout chapter contents prev next in the law offices of macgregor and macgregor laura sat at a long oak table surrounded by books shed buried herself in the library all morning determined to find an additional precedent for the brief she was refining on her latest assignment when her parents returned the following week shed have it perfected her mother was trying the case of massachusetts v holloway and laura was doing research on it for her but shed developed an emotional attachment to this particular case if she handled the paperwork the legwork the hours of research she might earn a seat beside her mother in the courtroom and maybe just maybe shed be allowed to question a witness she wanted the intensity of the courtroom the drama of judge and jury she understood the value of research the necessity of planning every move and every eventuality of a trial case shed read and study until her eyes crossed but by god she was going to earn her stripes and eventually her own caseload amanda holloway had killed her husband there was no question about the deed but guilt by law was another matter shed been battered emotionally and physically for five miserable years five years of broken bones and a broken spirit laura thought it was easy to say she should have walked out she should have run and never looked back in fact laura sometimes caught herself thinking just that but amanda holloway hadnt walked and she hadnt run in the end she had snapped one night during the heat of high summer after another beating another rape she had taken her husbands service revolver and emptied the clip into him while he slept the pity of it laura thought coolly was that shed waited more than an hour after the rape an hour equaled premeditation the fact that john holloway had been a cop with a file full of commendations also didnt help matters some might think that justice had been done that night but the law trod a colder line and laura was determined to use the law to keep amanda holloway out of prison royce really enjoyed watching her just now she didnt resemble the woman whod sung in her underwear or the coolly polite one whod worn a simple sweater and discussed alarm systems with him shed tamed that waterfall of dark hair into a complicated braid that lay down the center of her back she had simple gold drops at her ears and a slim gold watch on her wrist along with the wink and flash of a diamond tennis bracelet her white silk blouse was very tailored and a navy blazer hung over the back of her chair the room smelled of leather polished wood and woman just now he thought laura macgregor looked classy expensive and utterly unapproachable unapproachable royce mused unless a man had seen her hips wiggling about in a pair of silk boxers he leaned on the doorjamb you look like a lawyer her head shot up he admired the speed with which she recovered surprise was no more than a flash in those dark chocolate eyes before they cooled i passed the bar last summer i am a lawyer do you need one not at the moment but ill keep you in mind the fact was hed kept her in mind for the better part of a week windswept hair that intriguing little scar those damnthedevil eyes combined to make him a man a woman couldnt help wondering about since she didnt want to wonder she wanted him gone the offices are basically closed until the end of the month so the receptionist told me downstairs but im not here to hire you or your parents he walked in his movements making her think of a cat poised to spring and edged a hip on the table why are you here i had a job to look over in the neighborhood i thought id let you know well start installing your system saturday morning thats fine im sure my grandfather will be pleased hes got the right idea protecting what matters to him hes proud of you and your cousins it shines right out of him when he talks about you lauras eyes softened and her body lost its defensively rigid posture hes the most wonderful man in the world and one of the most exasperating if he could hed tuck all of us into his castle in hyannis boston can be a dangerous city for a pretty young girl royce said in a deep burr that mimicked daniel and made lauras lips twitch not bad a little more volume and youd have almost nailed him and hes right it can be youre three single women living in a big house filled with expensive things easily fenced merchandise one of you is the daughter of a former us president and all of you granddaughters of one of the richest men in the country and youre beautiful all of that makes you potential targets were not fools mr cameron royce were not fools she repeated we dont walk into dark alleys open the door to strangers or pick up men in bars well slim thats commendable her shoulders were tightening again my grandfather is overreacting but if installing a complicated security system eases his mind then thats what well do but you dont think you need security i think my cousins and i are perfectly safe in our own home do you consider having a man walk into your kitchen while youre dancing in your underwear safe you had a key and i wasnt in my underwear id have been inside as easily without the key as with it and what was it if it wasnt your underwear pajamas she snapped oh well then thats different royce grinned down at her enjoying the sizzle of temper in her dark eyes look you install the damn system well use the damn system now ive got she strained backward when he leaned down what are you doing he drew in a slow breath just getting the full impact i like your perfume and his eyes gleamed with amusement youre awfully jumpy all of a sudden i dont like being crowded okay he eased back just a subtle movement of that compact body that didnt give her quite the distance she would have liked how long are you going to be at this he asked waving a hand at the stack of law books until its finished why dont i come back around seven we could get some dinner no she said it firmly and shifted in her chair to give an open book her attention are you involved obviously i dont mean with work slim i mean with a man thats none of your business could be i like the way you look the way you smell i like the way you talk the way you move it would be interesting to find out if i like the way you think he ended as her narrowed eyes lifted and fixed on him do you want to know what im thinking right now he smiled then grinned then roared with laughter no if you change your mind about the meal youve got my number oh yeah ive certainly got your number he chuckled started to rise then saw the label on the folder nearly buried under a stack of books holloway he murmured then looked back at laura the homicide yes i knew john holloway did you shed liked his laugh nearly been charmed enough by it to reconsider dinner now both her voice and her eyes went frosty do you number many spousal abusers among your friends i didnt say we were friends i said i knew him he used to be a cop so did i this time when he started to straighten she put a hand over his her eyes were focused on his face now calculating considering did you work with him no we worked out of the same precinct for a few months a while back i was transferred he was a good cop he was she shut her eyes oh thats typical he kicked his wife around for years but he was a good cop wear the blue and stick together im not a cop anymore royce noted mildly and i didnt know much about him off the job he did the work he made the collars he closed the cases i wasnt interested in his personal life im very interested in his personal life shed watched his face while he spoke he didnt give away much laura mused but shed go with her hunches you didnt like him did you no why not just personal taste he made me think of a loaded gun with a broken safety sooner or later it goes off youd still have contacts on the force know people who knew him cops hate talking to lawyers but maybe because lawyers put scum back on the street before cops can clean up the stain she took a steadying breath amanda holloway isnt scum she simply had the bad judgment to marry scum that may be but i cant help you he rose stepped back ill be at the house between eightthirty and nine on saturday he smiled again a quick quirk of lips as much as id like to see them again i wouldnt wear the pajamas youll distract my crew so what does he look like in the mirror over the bathroom sink lauras gaze shifted from the already dark lashes she was coating with mascara to her cousins face who this excop security expert that grandpa hired to keep us safe from bostons nefarious criminal element gwen leaned over lauras shoulder so that their heads were close no one would have taken them for cousins much less as they were connected on both the macgregor and blade branches of the family tree cousins twice over gwens hair was a shiny reddishgold cap short as a boys in contrast to lauras sweep of raven tresses gwen had inherited her mothers coloring the creamy skin the eyes that edged from blue into lavender the rich blond hair that hinted of red she had a small almost delicate build as well a combination that gave the deceptive illusion of fragility she could when necessary put in a double shift at the hospital work out in the gym for an hour and still have fuel left over she was laura thought beautiful brilliant and bossy are you going to try to tell me you dont remember what he looks like gwen prompted hmm no i remember i was thinking of something else hes attractive enough i suppose details laura the truth is in the details gwen arched a brow cameron right a good scottish name that would please grandpa definitely gwen ran her tongue around her teeth is he married i wouldnt think so laura went back to the unnecessary mascara he wasnt wearing a ring when he put the moves on me and hes what about thirty somewhere around id guess her gaze shifted again hunting are we no collecting data hes single attractive runs his own business thirtyish and a cameron my assessment is that grandpa picked him out for you we already know that laura set the mascara down and picked up her lipstick grandpa hired him to install a security system which hell be doing today gwen sighed then rapped the top of lauras head lightly with her knuckles hello youre not usually so slow im talking matrimony matri on a choked laugh laura set down the tube of lipstick not a chance why not grandpas been making noises for the past year about how not one of his grandchildren has the common sense or the sense of duty to settle down and raise a family and grandmas pining for babies to bounce on her knee laura finished dryly im telling you theres no way hes fixed on royce cameron as a potential grandson the man isnt the type an overprotective grandfather chooses gwen perched on the long rosecolored counter because theres something dangerous about him you can see it in the eyes something not quite tame mmm sounding better and better for a lover sure i imagine hed be amazing in bed laura smirked as she brushed back her hair i doubt thats what the macgregor would have in mind idly gwen picked up the lipstick swiveled the creamy red tube up and down on the contrary id say it would be exactly what hed have in mind the boy has spirit she continued in a deep exaggerated burr hes got fire in his blood hell breed strong sons and daughters ridiculous but laura experienced a sick sensation deep in her stomach thats absurd he couldnt he wouldnt could and would gwen disagreed succinctly and so far id say its working what do you mean what are you talking about i mean its saturday morning gwen angled her wrist to check her watch just eight oclock on a saturday morning when you dont have to be anywhere not only are you up but youre dressed youre wearing mascara which you dont even need and lipstick and she leaned forward and sniffed your best perfume im only and shes got a new blouse lying out on her bed julia added as she stepped into the doorway and leaned against the jamb a red silk blouse aha a red silk blouse for a saturday morning at home gwen slid off the counter patted lauras shoulder my diagnosis honey is a strong case of physical attraction i am not attracted to him im just im thinking of going shopping thats all christmas shopping so im up and dressed you never shop on saturday julia pointed out ruthlessly you hate to shop period which i find very sad and you never start your christmas shopping until the middle of december im making an exception annoyed laura maneuvered by them both and stomped toward her room the blouse lay on the bed like a bright red alarm she hissed at it then slamming her door she decided to wear it anyway she liked strong colors she thought as she yanked it off the bed she liked silk why shouldnt she wear the damn thing she muttered to herself as she buttoned it up she was not attracted to royce cameron in the least he was far from her type the man was arrogant rude and selfcongratulatory and she reminded herself hed seen her at her most ridiculous and in the fourth place she thought as she slipped on dark gray trousers she wasnt looking for a relationship not that a man like royce would be interested in something as civilized as a relationship but for herself she wanted a few more years of absolute freedom a man in general and a mate in particular could wait she heard the front door buzzer sniffed she took her time putting on her shoes then to prove to herself that she didnt care how she looked to royce or any other man that morning deliberately turned away from the mirror before heading downstairs he was in the foyer a scarred leather jacket faded jeans dark tousled hair he was talking to julia and gwen and he laughed at something julia said laura made it halfway down the stairs before he turned his head before those oddly intense blue eyes with their dark fringe of lashes met hers before that slow dangerous smile curved his mouth before her heart gave one jerky kick that warned her she might be in trouble after all morning slim he said giving her a very slow onceover nice shirt chapter contents prev next royce didnt pursue women he particularly didnt pursue a woman who indicated a lack of interest or one who was sending out mixed signals when he met a woman who attracted him he let her know it straight out no games no pretenses he figured it was up to the woman in question to pick up the ball from there since laura macgregor wasnt picking up the ball hadnt even acknowledged that hed tossed one in her direction he should have shrugged it off forgotten her and gone about his business but he wasnt having any luck in doing that it had been nearly three weeks since he first saw her four days since he last saw her and she was still on his mind not just the picture of her in that sexy little outfit shed worn in the kitchen though that image certainly popped into his mind with annoying regularity it was her face that hounded him he thought the cold courage in it when shed whipped up that knife and faced him down it was the intelligence and determination in her eyes when shed spoken of law and justice it was the cocky smile curving that incredibly tempting mouth as shed walked down the stairs the day he began the installation of her security system it was he was forced to admit the whole damn package in his small crowded office off boylston he rubbed his tired eyes ran his hands through hair badly in need of a trim she was keeping him up at night and it was ticking him off what he needed to do was pull out his address book and find a companionable woman to spend an evening with someone uncomplicated and undemanding why in the hell didnt he want someone uncomplicated and undemanding hed be damned if he was going to pick up the phone and call laura hed asked her out shed refused hed told her hed be available if she changed her mind she hadnt changed it he hadnt made a fool of himself over a female since he was twelve and fell madly in love with his best friends older sister the sixteenyearold goddess marsha bartlett hed mooned over her for two months followed her around like a slavish puppy and suffered the taunts of the entire seventh grade of saint annes elementary marsha bartlett had never paid any attention to him and had gone on to marry an oral surgeon and royce didnt moon after females anymore grow up cameron he ordered himself and turned back to his computer screen to fiddle with the proposed security system on an office building in south boston when the phone shrilled he ignored it until the fourth ring swearing he snatched it up obviously his secretary was off powdering her nose again cameron security and this would be cameron himself royce recognized the voice there was no mistaking that fullblooded scot it would be mr macgregor good just the man im after youve seen to my granddaughters the systems up and operative and the bill he thought the hefty bill was in the mail its the best money can buy im counting on that boy i want my wifes mind at rest she frets so you said and you tested the system personally as you requested any attempt to break in or undermine the system sends an alarm straight to the nearest cop shop and my own personal beeper good good but those girls have to use it to be protected theyre young you know and busy with their interests my wifes worried that they may be careless and forget to turn it on altogether mr macgregor i can only guarantee the system if its in use exactly exactly why i was telling anna just this morning that youve done everything you could do but shes got this in her mind now and is worrying on it i was thinking just to soothe her we could do a test if youd go by sometime tonights as good a time as any and just see if you can get inside hold it let me get this straight you want me to break into your granddaughters house well you see if you manage to do it then well know we need to adjust the matter a bit and if you cant well then i can ease my wifes mind shes old daniel added in a low voice keeping an eagle eye on the doorway i worry about her health were more than happy to pay you for your time and trouble do you know what the cage time is for nighttime breaking and entering mr macgregor daniel laughed heartily indeed hed picked a rare one for his laura now royce as a former officer of the law im sure youd know that well enough and youd know how to be sure you werent caught at it i meant to tell you that im considering having a new security system installed here at my home its a large house and id want only the best cost would be no object royce leaned back in his chair and stared meditatively at the ceiling are you bribing me mr macgregor indeed i am mr cameron are you an enterprising young man indeed i am and this is going to cost you whats money compared to the peace of mind and safety of those we love royce tipped back in his chair waited a beat ive met a lot of demons and clever people in my life mr macgregor you could give lessons daniels roar of laughter had royces ears ringing i like you lad damned if i dont camerons strong stock you get back to me when youve checked this matter out and well arrange for a time for you to come up here and modernize my security it was going to earn him big bucks royce calculated the zeros as he slipped out of the moonlight and into the shadows of the grand old trees that guarded the house he stood studying the dark windows it was easy enough for royce to think like a thief hed handled countless burglaries during his years on the force it was for that very reason that hed decided to go into private security most people had no idea how vulnerable they were while they dreamed in their beds he approached the house as a thief would using the trees and hedges for cover the wellestablished grounds added to the ambience and also blocked any nefarious enterprises from the view of neighbors and street traffic if he was a smart bande man and royce had decided he would be hed have already taken the time to study the house the accesses the security hed have worn khaki work clothes carried a clipboard and come in broad daylight no one would have looked at him twice but instead here he was in the middle of the night responding to the request of an overly canny overly protective scot hed have known the alarm system was hot of course if he had a solid knowledge of electronics and royce had decided to get into the spirit of the job and assume that he as thief had a degree in electronics amused at himself he set to the task of undoing his own work fifteen minutes later he stepped back scratched his chin he was damn good he decided not quite as good a thief as he was a security expert the system was very close to foolproof if he did say so himself if he hadnt designed it personally he would never be able to work his way through the backups and safety checks to override it since he had designed it he could have gotten in if hed wanted to get in by working another ten minutes or so but a thief would have to be very determined very educated and very lucky to have gotten even this far the macgregor he decided could sleep easy satisfied he started to step back when a light flashed on laura macgregor stood in full view on the other side of the atrium door dark hair down to her waist a bright yellow tshirt skimming her thighs and a louisville slugger gripped in her hands he watched her mouth fall open when she recognized him and her eyes catch fire what the hell are you doing her voice was muffled by the glass but he caught the drift spot check he said loudly back customers request i didnt request any spot check your grandfather did he watched those furious eyes narrow saw her hands shift their grip on the handle of the bat as if she were going to swing away regardless then she spun around giving him a bloodpumping view of leg and snatched up the phone royce scratched his chin again his fingers brushing absently over the ridge of scar if she was calling the cops he was going to be in for a long night of explanations he had enough friends on the force to cushion the worst of it but he knew those same friends would toss him in a holding cell just for the amusement factor the fee for the spot check doubled moments later laura slammed down the receiver she strode to the control unit for the alarm system punched in the code then flipped the locks on the door youre both idiots you and my grandfather you called the macgregor of course i called him do you think im going to take your word when youre standing outside the door wearing breakingandentering black and carrying burglars tools i ought to bash you with this on principle she added before tipping the bat against the wall your restraint is appreciated his grin flashed humor sparking his eyes like summer lightning look at it this way your grandmother can now sleep peacefully at night my grandmother always sleeps peacefully its him exasperated she threw up her hands the movement had the tshirt sliding dangerously high the man stays up at night dreaming up ways to complicate all our lives its his one driving goal to drive his family insane at least i have the satisfaction of knowing his ears will be ringing for the rest of the night busted his chops huh smiling royce took advantage of the situation and moved closer if youd been in bed like you were supposed to be youd never have known i was here id have been gone in another two minutes he reached out to toy with the ends of hair that draped to her elbows in a soft black curtain why arent you in bed i was hungry she muttered me too he moved a little closer deciding that fate had put the chair exactly there to prevent her from backing away whatcha got her heart was thudding against her ribs now she felt the winged side of the armchair press into her back he looked more than dangerous at the moment with his eyes hot his smile wicked he looked fatal he looked tempting look pal i keep walking in on you in your pajamas he let his gaze wander down lazily before sliding it up again and placing his hands on the chair on either side of her dont you think its a little too much to expect me to keep walking away her skin tingled as little pulses of excitement danced over it i expect you to take no for an answer do you he leaned in just a little a brush of bodies the feather of breath over her mouth i would have sworn you were expecting this he lowered his mouth toward hers stopping an inch before contact he saw her eyes darken heard the long intake of breath knew she held it he waited while his blood surged waited until he knew they were both suffering kiss me back he demanded and crushed his mouth to hers she couldnt have stopped herself in that long moment when their eyes held desire had poured through her like heated wine in the instant when their mouths met need had slammed into her like a velvet fist in the shuddering time the kiss deepened pleasure streaked through her like light she moaned wrapped her arms around him and met greed with greed this was no gentle exploration no easy sampling it was all heat and hunger passion warring against passion strength pitted against strength she was wild tastes and silken textures she was arousing scents and soft sighs her mouth was pure sin and was rapidly driving him beyond reason his hands tangled in her hair dragged her head back so that he could have more still more of that impatient erotic mouth let me have you he tore his lips from hers to race them over her jaw down her throat i her head was spinning her breath came in ragged gulps wait just wait why i need to think she put her hands on his shoulders straining back i wasnt thinking blue eyes fixed on her chocolate brown ones dark hair tousled on both of them he skimmed his hands in one long stroke down her sides i can fix it so neither one of us is thinking again im sure you could she kept her grip firm locked her arms to ensure some distance but it wasnt nearly enough back off a minute it wont change anything im still going to want you youre still going to want me back off anyway it cost him but he dropped his hands stepped away far enough or should i just back out the door so you can pretend this didnt happen i dont have to pretend anything lauras spine straightened if i hadnt wanted that to happen it wouldnt have happened im responsible for my own actions royce fair enough why arent we rolling around on this fancy rug finishing what we started thats blunt thats honest all right were not rolling around on the aubusson because i dont have sex with men i barely know he nodded tucked his hands into his pockets it was lowering to realize they werent entirely steady thats fair enough too his lips curved when he saw the surprise then the speculation flit over her face didnt expect me to be reasonable did you slim no i didnt which just proves my point i dont know you she braced but didnt evade when he stepped close again when his hands slid up her arms to her shoulders then back down to her wrists royce cameron he said quietly thirtyone single excop currently selfemployed no criminal record i had a couple of years of college but it didnt suit me i like big stupid dogs loud rock italian food and dangerous women amusement darkened her eyes thats informative but not entirely what i meant i figure its a start do you want to know more she knew he had to feel the way her pulse was hammering under his fingers apparently i do tomorrow night seventhirty well try the italian food all right well try the italian food she didnt move kept her eyes on his when he leaned forward and caught her bottom lip between his teeth i really like your mouth i could spend hours on it she thought his grin flashed before he turned away but her vision had blurred lock up slim and reengage the system yeah she took two slow breaths in and out it occurred to her that the system so to speak had already been breached chapter contents prev next gwen burst into the bathroom wearing underwear and full makeup i just ran my last pair of black panty hose im a desperate woman minell bag on you laura called from the shower im four inches taller than you are i said desperate julia doesnt have any dark hose i dont have time to run out for any and greg will be here in fifteen minutes laura poked her head out from behind the curtain a date with dr smarm its not a date snarling gwen snatched a pair of hose from the jungle of delicates hanging on the drying line its a hospital function and hes my escort hes a creep hes chief surgical resident chief creep laura corrected and turned off the shower and all he wants to do is add another notch in his scalpel then hes going to be bitterly disappointed gwen sat down on the toilet lid and began to pull on the hose why didnt you go with jim proctor hes a nice enough guy engaged two weeks ago kindergarten teacher oh hooking a towel at her breasts laura stepped out better to go alone than with greg the operator cocktails and dinner at dr and mrs pritchets mrs pritchet frowns on extra women at her table gwen stood swore damn it these bag on me i told you they would found a pair julia came in waving a package of hose like a flag these are why my drawer wouldnt close all the way they were stuck behind it thank god gwen grabbed them and sat again to make the exchange youre all dressed up laura commented noting julias long velvet gown of deep green countryclub deal peter ah old reliable laura walked out into the bedroom to contemplate her own closet peters all right just a little too earnest julia wandered out watched laura debate between red silk or blue wool now you seem to have the hot date of the evening were just going to hear some music dancing third date in two weeks julia wiggled her brows the red definitely its a little its a lot julia corrected a lot everything his eyesll pop out of his head and plop on his shoes feeling stubborn laura pulled out the blue were not really dating were just seeing each other gwen stepped out well when youre tired of seeing him can i have him ha ha it is the third date julia pointed out first date is the test second is a review but the third well thats the big one thats when you move from dating to relationship we dont have a relationship i dont want a relationship can i have him gwen asked again then bubbled with laughter at lauras seething look come on laurie whats wrong with being interested in a gorgeous available intriguing man count your blessings then she rolled her eyes as the buzzer sounded thats greg jules go entertain him for a minute will you if he comes on to me again im going to knock his caps loose five minutes gwen promised rushing out just hold him off for five minutes i dont know why she doesnt knock his caps loose julia muttered then taking a deep breath fixed a bright smile on her face and turned to laura hows this try to make it look less like a grimace cant wear the red she ordered then headed down to do her duty she wore the red laura told herself the outfit was simply more suited to an evening at a club she hadnt worn it because it was sexy or because the blend of lycra turned the silk into a curveclinging statement of female confidence and she only wore the high thin heels because the dress demanded them this thirddate business was nonsense she told herself as she hooked on thick gold hoops who was counting after all they were just seeing each other because they enjoyed each others company because they found a lot to talk about and they made each other laugh and when he kissed her her brain exploded she pressed a hand to her jittery stomach okay she admitted yes there was a strong physical attraction but he hadnt pressured her to take it any farther than those braindraining kisses why the hell wasnt he pressuring her it was driving her crazy the way he left her shuddering all but gulping for air and never attempted to lure her into bed not since that first time she was crazy laura admitted hadnt she told him she needed to get to know him wasnt he giving her the time and space to do just that and she was sulking because he wasnt grabbing her by the hair and dragging her off to his cave pitiful when the buzzer sounded she shook her cloud of hair back just seeing each other she repeated as she started downstairs just getting to know each other just two people enjoying each others company for the evening steady now she opened the door smiled he looked good in black the black jeans jacket and shirt suited his darkangel looks youre right on time she told him ill just get my hold it hed grabbed her hands his own sliding up to her wrists like cuffs he indulged himself with a long look the stoplight red fit like skin riding high on smooth thighs dipping low and straight over firm breasts his lips curved slowly excuse me a minute with one hard tug he had her in his arms and his mouth was branding her devouring hers she made a little sound of shock as the heat punched into her then she was free breathless and teetering what was that for to thank you for the dress youre almost wearing his smile was quicker this time it was impossible for him not to be pleased by that dazed look in her eyes youll need a coat slim its cold outside the club was hot and so was the music laura had regained her balance over a glass of white wine at the tiny corner table with its single flickering candle she hadnt thought him the type to sit and listen to blues but he was constantly surprising her why did you leave the force she hadnt realized the question was there until she asked it is that too personal no i figured out i wasnt a team player that i was lousy at politics and that id lost the passion you need to keep going out on the streets to do the job what made you lose it light eyes under dark brows flicked over to hers held lawyers in automatic defensiveness her chin angled everyones entitled to representation under the law yeah thats the law he picked up his club soda rattled the ice in the glass but thats not justice youve got a client right now whod agree with me really and who is that amanda holloway i thought you didnt approve of what shed done its not up to me to approve or disapprove i wasnt inside her head that night but to me shes just one more example of a system thats defective her trial begins in ten days you might be able to help theres nothing i can tell you its obvious you didnt like him i dont like the guy in the apartment across the hall from me theres not a lot i can tell you about him either your mother knows her job laura or she wouldnt be where she is i dont see how you can back away from everything you must believe in you wouldnt have joined the force if you hadnt wanted to help and a few years on it showed me i wasnt making much of a difference she heard something in his voice just a hint of disappointment of disillusionment but you wanted to yeah i did now im making it my own way without the politics and restrictions and im better at electronics than i was at toeing the line you just like being your own boss damn right i do i cant blame you she said with a sigh working for my parents well its a dream theyre wonderful i dont think id have done well in a big firm with all the agendas and carvedinstone policies in so many its all about billable hours and corporate or highprofile clients macgregor and macgregor is about making a difference im surprised they havent been disbarred for a surplus of ethics her eyes narrowed its so easy and so trite to bash lawyers yeah he grinned why resist i should tell you something else what youre incredibly beautiful she eased back angled her head youre trying to change the subject and smart too if we sit here and talk about law were going to argue because its something we come to from different angles why waste the time i like to argue thats why im a lawyer i like to dance he took her hand and stood up thats why were here she stared at him you dance well i never achieved my lifelong dream of joining the bolshoi he said dryly as he led her toward the dance floor but i manage you just look more like the type to go five rounds with the champ than to the words slid down her throat as he spun her out then whirled her back until her body meshed intimately with his oh god well box later the heels brought her facelevel with him so that eyes and mouths lined up he guided her over the floor with smooth intricate steps she didnt have to think to follow couldnt have thought with the way her heart thudded the way the sax wailed the way his eyes stayed focused on hers youre very good she managed dancing is the secondbest thing a man can do with a beautiful woman why not do it right she had to moisten her lips youve had lessons at my mothers insistence which is why i can also go five rounds with the champ in my neighborhood if a guy took dance lessons he either got the stuffing beat out of him on a regular basis or he learned to use his fists thats quite a combination what neighborhood was that south boston oh her head was swimming her pulse pounding thats where you grew up then did your father he dipped her low and slow you talk too much he murmured and closed his mouth over hers as he brought her back up and kept it there as he moved with her as the music pumped over them as her hand slid over his shoulder to cup the back of his neck she felt her stomach drop away her knees turn to water and murmured his name twice against his mouth do you know who i am he waited until her eyes fluttered open and met his do you know who i am now laura she knew what he was asking and understood that every moment they spent together had been a dance with steps leading to this yes i suppose i do come home with me he kissed her again tracing her lips with his tongue until they trembled come to bed with me she didnt care that the music had stopped that the club was crowded she poured herself into the kiss my house is closer how do you know i looked up your address she was smiling as she eased back just in case my cousins are out for the evening she slid her hand down to his linked fingers come home with me i thought youd never ask he kissed her again when they stepped out into the chilly autumn evening the instant they were in the car they were diving for each other i didnt think id be in such a hurry gulping in air she attacked his mouth again im in a hurry drive fast tell me what youve got on under that dress she laughed perfume ill drive fast he slammed the car in gear strap in and keep your hands to yourself i want to live to make love with you she fumbled with her seat belt as he shot out into the street she gripped her hands together in her lap she wanted to use them on him she realized she wanted to use them to tear off his shirt to touch to take to drive him crazy she had no precedent for this wild animal lust snarling inside her tell me something else she demanded your family brothers sisters no none he accelerated coolly threading through traffic and zipping through a yellow light your parents do they still live in the old neighborhood my mother moved to florida with her second husband my fathers dead im sorry line of duty thats the way he wanted it wouldnt you think these people would have something better to do than to be driving around tonight she laughed then pressed a hand to her racing heart god im nervous i never get nervous im going to babble i can feel it youd better talk to me or im going to babble i could tell you what im going to do to you the minute i get you out of that dress royce drive faster he careened around the corner headed up her street and his beeper went off swearing viciously royce dug into his jacket pocket read the code off for me will you all right its its mine royce its my house his eyes hardened he could already hear the alarm shrilling he whipped the car to the curb two houses down from lauras stay here he ordered lock the doors but you cant the police will its my system he slammed out of the car and avoiding the light from the streetlamps slipped into the dark it only took laura ten seconds to decide to go after him she cursed the ridiculously thin heels as she darted up the sidewalk even as she burst into the wash of light pouring out of her windows she saw two figures grappling without a second thought she ran forward her eyes darting right and left in search of a handy weapon terrified inspired she yanked off her shoe and dashed forward leading with the icepick heel then she saw the glint of bright gold hair in the light heard the curse and the grunt as royces fist plowed into a familiar face ian oh my god ian are you all right dropping her shoe she stumbled to where royces adversary was sprawled on the ground god what hit me a rock ian shook his head tried to work his throbbing jaw what the hell is going on here oh honey your lips bleeding im sorry im so sorry she bent forward and kissed him gently im fine thanks royce said from behind her the whip of jealousy stung nearly as much as his abused knuckles he frowned down as the couple on the ground glared at him i take it you two are acquainted of course were acquainted laura stroked ians hair you just punched my brother hell of a punch too ian lifted a hand wiggled his jaw and decided it probably wasnt broken i didnt even see it coming of course if id seen it you wouldnt have landed it come on let me help you inside well put some ice on it stop fussing laura now that his ears had stopped ringing ian took a good look at the man whod decked him it soothed his ego a bit to see the tough compact build and wide shoulders at least he hadnt been taken down by a suit and tie which would have been his sisters usual type ian macgregor he said and held up a hand royce cameron royce gripped it hauled ian to his feet you caught another one he said and tapped a finger to the side of his eye i thought so i was a little off my stride i mean a guy goes to let himself into his sisters house and all of a sudden alarms start screaming lights flashing new security system royce told him i installed it a couple weeks ago yeah well it works ians crooked grin offered a truce want a beer royce judged his man and smiled sure let me disengage this and call off the cops i guess you changed the locks ian began conversationally as he trooped along with royce laura stood where she was off balance on one skyscraper heel her mouth hanging open if that isnt just typical she muttered and hunted up her other shoe men bash each other in the face then theyre friends for life chapter contents prev next i dont suppose youd like to tell me what youre doing breaking into my house at ten oclock on a saturday night ian held the cold bottle of beer against his bruised jaw and smiled at his sister i wouldnt have been breaking in if youd told me youd changed the locks if youd let someone know your plans i didnt have any plans i just decided to swing by for the weekend he grinned over at royce harvard law first year a guy needs a little break i imagine so and as his own plans for the evening had taken an abrupt turn royce decided he had no choice but to take it philosophically but he wished to god laura would change out of that sirens dress and into something dull and baggy where are the cousins theyre out got anything to eat around here he grinned at laura and the gleam in his eye told her he knew exactly what hed interrupted and that he wasnt the least bit sorry im starving you want food fix it yourself she dotes on me ian told royce as he rose to raid the refrigerator want a sandwich royce exchanged one long look with laura why not you know laurie i was going to go up and sponge off grandpa but i just had this urge to see you he beamed at her as he began unloading cold cuts and condiments oh let me do it youre making a mess she nudged him aside then sighed when he slid an arm around her shoulders and kissed her cheek go sit down and drink your beer he sat lifted his long legs to prop his feet on the opposite chair at twentytwo with golden hair a sharpboned face offset by a poets mouth and eyes that were nearly violet he was already doing his best to meet and exceed the reputation his father had left behind at harvard law in his studies and with the ladies so royce tell me how are things in the security business it wasnt a question royce understood it was a statement ian macgregor wasnt budging an inch and had no intention of letting royce get his hands on laura until he was satisfied fair enough royce decided seeing they understood each other royce lifted his beer its a living he said for the next week laura buried sexual frustration in work ian had all but moved in spending each evening each night in the back bay with her then driving back to cambridge in the morning to class he was laura thought an unshakable unmovable guard dog he needs a damn leash she muttered who does honey laura looked up from her files her mother stood in the doorway head cocked brow lifted diana blade macgregors hair was as dark as her daughters and was scooped up in a polished french twist as a concession to the court appearance shed made that morning her eyes were dark and warm her skin a dusky gold thanks to her mix of comanche blood her bronzetoned suit was tailored to set off her slim figure perfect was the word that often came to lauras mind when she thought of her mother absolutely perfect but she wasnt in the mood for family loyalties at the moment your son hes driving me insane ian diana stepped into the room and fought to keep the twinkle out of her eyes ian had told her laura was more than interested in a man whats he doing hes hovering hes smothering me hes got some weird notion hes protecting me i dont want to be protected i see diana perched on lauras desk smoothed a hand over her daughters hair would this have anything to do with royce cameron it has to do with me not needing my little brother running interference with my social life then laura blew out a breath and yes it has something to do with royce id like to meet him your grandfather certainly thinks highly of him grandpa confused laura flipped back her hair and frowned up at her mother he barely knows him he hired royces company thats all you should know the macgregor better than that with a laugh diana shook her head sweetheart daniel macgregor wouldnt have put anyone in your path particularly an attractive man unless he knew all there was to know and then some according to him royce cameron comes from strong stock thats just his scottish bias and youre his eldest granddaughter dianas smile softened a delicate position your father and i put you in i dont see what oh she stood when she caught the movement in the doorway royce sorry your receptionist said you werent busy and to come up thats all right i she detested being flustered was uneasy acknowledging that he could fluster her simply by existing mama this is royce cameron im so pleased to meet you diana rose from the desk to hold out a hand she found herself being assessed by cool blue eyes im sorry royce smiled at her i was just seeing what lauras going to look like when she flowers shes very fortunate in her heritage smoothly done diana mused thank you my husband says that the comanche wear their bones well im sure you want to speak with laura i hope to see you again mr cameron laura ill have a word with ian on that matter we were discussing thanks your mother is impressive royce murmured when diana slipped out and shut the door then he turned to laura comanche yes my mothers part comanche she rose slowly almost in challenge so am i id have to agree with your father you wear your bones well he stepped closer moving around the desk until they were facetoface is your brother hiding in the storage closet she had to chuckle not at the moment well then watching her he slipped his arms around her waist and drew her slowly close closer saw her lashes flutter as he lowered his mouth to touch hers ive got to see you laura alone i know i want its just that everythings so complicated now and kiss me again just kiss me again not patient this time not gentle she could taste the impatience the frustrated desire that echoed inside her and the promise of heat and speed i should have hit him harder his hands slipped to her hips to bring her more intimately against him im going to go find him and hit him again no laura tangled her fingers in his hair let me do it tell your secretary youre going to lunch its ten in the morning a really early lunch royce nipped her jaw then went back to her mouth and its going to last most of the day i really cant his lips trailed down her throat and made her skin sing i shouldnt then came back to hers and set her heart leaping okay just let me laura do you have the file on caine macgregor froze the doorknob still in his hand and stared narrowly at the man who was currently devouring his little girl excuse me he said just coldly enough so that no one would suspect he meant it dad laura cleared her throat wiggled free of royce and cursed the flush that burned her cheeks i was we were were what laura dismissing her caine measured the man and you would be royce cameron a welltoned wolf was royces impression he didnt think the gray at the temples of the bronze hair would affect the mans fangs whatsoever and i was kissing your daughter ive eyes in my head cameron caine said in a tone that would have made his own father swell with pride security right shouldnt you be making someones business safe instead of kissing my daughter in the middle of the morning royce tucked his thumbs in his front pockets he hadnt gotten around to shaving yet certainly hadnt intended to see laura that morning but hed stepped out to do a few errands and found himself standing outside her office he still wasnt quite sure how he was wearing a leather jacket that had plenty of battle scars and jeans that were worn white at the stress points and frayed at the cuffs he had a pretty fair idea what he looked like to a doting father at the moment a rich doting father who wore savile row as if hed been born in it ive just come back from hyannis port i spent the last two days there designing and discussing an upgrade of a security system for your fathers home caines eyes narrowed and flashed is that so interfering old tyrant he muttered striking straight to the core of the matter in that case i imagine youve got your work cut out for you we wouldnt want to keep you from it dad appalled laura gaped at him theres no reason to be rude yes there is royce said mildly you look just like your mother hed know theres every reason to be rude well said caine murmured ill be back royce strolled toward the door pausing when he was toetotoe with caine and im going to kiss your daughter again mr macgregor youll have to get used to it if the two of you think you can stand there and discuss me as if im some sort of trophy were done royce cut her off flicking a glance over his shoulder before he walked out the door for the moment arrogant son of a bitch caine dug his hands into his own pockets and felt a smile twitch at his mouth i like him oh do you running on full steam laura stalked from around the desk and when she was close enough poked her father in the chest with her finger you humiliated me i did not you did too standing there like a a father he finished and took her chin firmly in his hand do you think i dont know what hes got in mind his hands were i know exactly where his hands were laura fired back they were exactly where i wanted them im not a child and im not going to have the men in my family draw the wagons in a circle around me to protect my virtue its my virtue and ill do with it what i choose with whom i choose not if i beat you and lock you up you wont she snorted you never laid a hand on me in your life an obvious oversight which can still be corrected young lady stop it diana rushed in closing the door firmly behind her stop this shouting they can hear you all over the building let them hear laura and caine shouted together lower your voices or im fining you both for contempt of court sit down the pair of you hes the one whos out of order laura tossed her head but she dropped into a chair he embarrassed me in front of royce and he was rude he came in here like some father caine interjected but sat as well neanderthal father laura sniffed and turned her appeal to her mother mama im twentyfour years old does he think ive never been kissed before youd better not have been kissed like that before caine muttered diana the man had his hands on her enough diana held up her hands shut her eyes until she could be certain her own temper was under control laura if youre a hundred and four you have no right to speak to your father in that way and caine she continued just as he began to look smug laura is an adult a responsible intelligent woman and she can kiss whomever she pleases now just a damn minute caine began dont you shout at me diana warned him if he was rude to royce hell apologize in a pigs ill see to it diana said between her teeth searing her husband with a look but at the moment its more important that the two of you behave yourselves this is a place of business tell that to her caine wagged a finger at laura shes the one who was conducting personal business practically on her own desk we were not on the desk laura fumed though they could have been she thought might have been in another minute royce just dropped by to see if id be free for lunch ha was her fathers opinion laura slapped a hand on the arm of her chair you sound just like grandpa oh thats fine insulted caine sprang to his feet i get yelled at when i have a perfectly reasonable reaction to seeing my daughter being swallowed whole by a strange man but you have no objection to having your grandfather pick out what he obviously considers a suitable stud for the next line of macgregors caine diana moaned the word sinking to the arm of a chair herself what what do you mean what are you talking about its plain as the burr in the old mans voice caine told her youre the eldest granddaughter youre of marriageable age its time you were doing your duty he continued mimicking daniels voice finding a suitable husband and getting children of your own lauras mouth worked for several seconds before she could manage to speak then all that came out was a low whistling scream see pleased hed made his point caine hitched up the knees of his trousers and sat back hes picked him out temper had lauras breath strangling in her throat he sent him to me he he selected him so i could so i could breed well satisfied he was off the hook caine examined his cuffs thats a bit cruder than hed have intended ill kill him with my bare hands caine sat up enjoying himself now which one of them grandpa youd best make funeral arrangements she snatched up her coat and briefcase im taking the rest of the day off i have to drive to hyannis laura let her go caine grabbed dianas hand as laura stormed out he deserves it lord how did i ever get tangled up in such a family you wanted my body caine reminded her couldnt keep your hands off me he kissed her fingers still cant im going to give it more effort diana he turned her hand over pressing his lips to the palm in a way that both of them knew undid her i was just looking out for our little girl shes grown up on us caine it happened too fast she lowered her head to his its so hard to keep up i just dont want her rushing into anything with some cameron dads picked out laura chooses her own diana said quietly she always has what did you think of him i dont know he rubbed his wifes knuckles over his cheek it was hard to tell i had this red haze in front of my eyes then he sighed i liked him so did i that doesnt mean he can right here in the office diana for gods sake oh you mean the way we did she tucked her tongue in her cheek disgraceful that was different his brows drew together when she continued to smile at him all right all right maybe it isnt so different he slid a hand up her legs so you want to try the desk see if it still works i think weve given the staff enough to gossip about for one day she leaned closer until her lips brushed his well wait until everyones gone for the day i love you diana he cupped his hand at the back of her neck to linger over the kiss a thousand times more than i did the day you walked into my life were lucky all i want is for our children to be as lucky she brushed her hands through his hair adoring the way silver threaded through gold caine shes going to skin daniel alive i know his grin was quick and wolfish im really sorry im going to miss it chapter contents prev next there was nothing daniel macgregor thought as he leaned back in his massive leather chair in the tower office of his personal fortress like a good cigar and since his wife was out of the house for a few hours he could sneak a smoke without the worry of being caught ah she had his best interests at heart bless her but a woman just didnt understand that a man needed a good cigar in his hand the roll of it between his fingers to help him think to plan which reminded him he had to bribe one of the children to smuggle in another box he was running low content master of his castle he eased back in the wellworn leather of his favored chair and blew smoke at the ceiling his life was as it should be he decided and he was nearly old enough now to relax and just enjoy it as soon as he got the grandchildren settled saw them happily tending to their duties to provide new blood to the macgregor line he would be content to while away his days just as he was doing this morning with happy thoughts and a good cuban his plans for laura were working out right on schedule if the tidbits of information hed managed to shoehorn out of her cousins were anything to go by and hed crowbarred a bit more from royce cameron himself boy thinks hes cagey daniel said to himself and passed some time blowing smoke rings cant outcagey the macgregor oh royce hadnt said a great deal yes hed met laura and her cousins indeed she was an attractive woman hed agreed it was a wonder that some smart man hadnt snatched her up played it close to the vest had royce cameron daniel thought now but hed read between the lines hed watched the boys eyes smitten that was what he was daniel thought with a chuckle hooked good and proper he thought a spring wedding would be suitable unless he could push them into a winter one best not to waste time making babies after all he missed having babies about laura would make a lovely bride he mused she had the look of her mother and diana had been radiant when caine finally talked her into that walk down the aisle of course the boy had taken twice as long to do it than he should have but it had all worked out in the end now the next generation needed a bit of a push hed give the grandsons a bit more time to season but it was time to nudge those oldest girls along daniel considered himself a wily nudger thinking of laura wearing the macgregor wedding veil and walking on caines arm down the aisle brought a mist to daniels eyes such a beautiful girl he thought such a sweetnatured child such a loving macgregor the voice boomed out and nearly had daniel snapping his cigar in two when he jolted he choked on the smoke hed just inhaled and frantically waved his hand to clear the haze of it out of the room with great regret he stubbed the best part of the cuban out while his name reverberated through the house i know youre here ive come to kill you dead grimacing and moving with surprising speed for a man just past ninety years of age daniel shoved the ashtray and stub in the bottom drawer of his desk flicked the lock then yanked open the window still waving at smoke you looking glorious in full fury laura strode through the doorway her finger jabbing the nerve of you laurie sweetheart what a nice surprise he stood by the open window as freezing air rushed in a bull of a man whose red hair had gone snowwhite whose beard was full and lush whose blue eyes had never faded and who was shaking in his boots dont you laurie sweetheart me she slapped both hands on his desk pick a stud out for me will you what am i a broodmare i dont know what youre talking about youve driven all the way from boston he beamed at her while his mind calculated at the speed of light well go down and have some tea you wont be able to swallow it after i strangle you did you think i wouldnt catch on to what you were doing doing i was just sitting here he waved a huge hand toward the desk and was careful to keep it between them doing some paperwork i can get my own man when i want one of course you can darling girl why youd have to beat them off with a stick looking the way you do why when you were no more than minutes old and i held you in my hands the first time i said to your father this is the most beautiful baby ever born in this world so long ago he heaved a long deep sigh and braced a hand on the back of the chair as if he needed the support getting into it it makes me feel old im an old man laura dont pull that on me youre only old when you want to be old schemer scoundrel he blinked tried his best to pale as he patted a hand to his wide chest my heart my hearts palpitating she only narrowed her eyes i can fix that why dont i just stop it for you maybe its just breaking he hung his head breaking in two because my favorite granddaughter would speak to me so disrespect he said weakly nothing carves an old man like the sharp tongue of his favored grandchild youre lucky im speaking to you at all and dont think for a minute you can wiggle out of this by playing that old tune youre healthy as a horse and at the moment i think you have less sense than one now his head came up and his eyes glittered with temper mind that tongue of yours lass ill only take so much even from you and ill only take so much even from you how could you embarrass me this way for gods sake grandpa you hired him for me you needed security his voice wasnt weak now it boomed out like thunderclaps you and my other girls living there in that city on your own i protect what i love and i wasnt having your grandmother fretting herself sick over you thats that he said and thumped his hand on the desk if that was that it would be a different matter she shifted to a new tack walked around the desk and fisted her hands on her hips daniel duncan macgregor you are under oath do you swear that everything you say is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth i dont lie little girl now if youd im not finished with my examination of the accused accused is it accused he roared up so that he could tower over her not a year past the bar and you think you can interrogate me yes sit down please and answer the questions did you or did you not hire royce cameron i said i did his company has a good reputation and for this service you paid him a fee id hardly expect a decent businessman to provide his services for free and did you or did you not encourage him to socialize with your eldest granddaughter one laura macgregor well this is nonsense i never ill remind you youre under oath i never said a bloody word about socializing i might have mentioned that my eldest granddaughter was a beautiful young woman of single status he sat sulking a bit its not a crime i say you threw me at him i certainly did not his smile spread craftily i threw him at you and if you didnt like the look of him you were free to throw him back werent you thats but you didnt throw him back did you laurie she scowled ground her teeth that has nothing to do with it oh it does and you know it or else you wouldnt be here blowing steam in my face youd have had a good laugh and pushed it aside he took her hand before she could snatch it aside gave it a playful squeeze hes smitten with you he is not smitten that he is a man can see these things in another man and i had him here for nearly two full days she did snatch her hand away bribing him two could play the interrogation game daniel thought did he or did he not do satisfactory work at your house how would i know and i dont he did the work and a fine job so that your grandmother and i can rest our minds now if ive a mind to want my own home made safer more secure why wouldnt i call on a man whos proven himself how had the argument gotten off track laura wondered as she rubbed a hand over her temple shed had control of it at the beginning and lost the grip somewhere along the line you know very well its all a plot well of course its a plot all of life is daniel grinned at her hes a handsome lad that royce cameron comes from good stock has made something of himself his grandfather was a fine man that succeeded in distracting her you knew his grandfather oh in passing only a policeman with a strong sense of duty and a good head for scotch and his grandmother was a fitzwilliams a strong line her i knew a bit better his brows wiggled but that was before your grandmother swept me off my feet so maybe when i was looking into some small privately owned companies in the boston area that a businessman might want to pay heed to and i saw the name of royce cameron which was his grandfathers name and took me back a few years i thought would that be millie fitzwilliamss grandson and whats he done with himself defeated laura tugged the open window closed before the two of them froze to death so you made it your business to find out to satisfy my curiosity to see about the grandson of old friends and if when i discovered he was a strong man with a good mind and a decent head for business i tossed a bit of work his way and your granddaughter along with it as i said i tossed him your way nobody held a gun to your head to make you go out dancing with him she set her teeth how do you know i went out dancing with him daniel smiled blandly i have my ways little girl i want to choke you kiss me instead he took her hand again ive missed you laurie ha she said and made his heart swell with pride you never miss anything you old schemer but she kissed him just the same and it only took the slightest tug on her hand to have her sitting on his lap does he know you tossed him my way come now little girl im better than that just what are you going to do about him im going to have a mad torrid affair laura the shock and horror in his voice was almost payment enough for the embarrassment you reap what you sow grandpa and since youve put such a fine specimen of man at my disposal ill use him as i choose until im done with him he jerked her back stared hard into her eyes ah youre joking maybe i am she smiled slowly and maybe im not so you just think about that the next time you play laird with me macgregor now then laurie he broke off when he heard his wifes voice laura daniel is that lauras car outside up here grandma ssh he gave laura a quick shake to dislodge her dont call her up here the womans got a nose like a hound i only had a few puffs damn it ill be right down grandma laura angled her head you owe me grandpa and if you dont remember it i might just let it slip that i saw a couple of cubans taped to the back of your file drawer under s for sneak now he did pale you wouldnt she kept that smug smile on her face as she strolled to the door dont bet on it but because she adored him laura hurried down the stairs before her grandmother could come up they met on the landing with a long tight hug i wish youd told us you were driving up i never would have gone out laura eyed the small mountain of shopping bags busy morning im determined to have my christmas shopping done by thanksgiving this year she slipped her arm around lauras waist and led her to the parlor lets sit down ill ring for some tea id love some tea laura sat watched as anna called for the housekeeper to brew a pot so lovely laura thought as she always did so sturdy she thought of her grandmother as a trailblazer a woman who had pursued her dream of practicing medicine when such careers for women were either laughed at or frowned upon shed not only made the dream reality she had triumphed become one of the top thoracic surgeons on the east coast while raising a family making a home how do you do it grandma do it anna sat sighing a little as she set her feet on a hassock do what all how do you do it all one step at a time oh i swear there was a time a morning of shopping wouldnt wear me out she smiled im so glad youre here now i can sit here and be lazy for a while instantly concerned laura sprang up maybe you should lie down you shouldnt do so much laura her voice was serene warm as sunlight my feet hurt thats all now sit tell me did you drive all the way up here to shout at your grandfather i laura huffed out a breath you know everything i know hes been meddling and expected you a week ago royce cameron must have had quite some effect on you for it to have taken you this long to figure it out hes gorgeous ive seen that for myself i just told grandpa im going to have a mad torrid affair with him oh anna sighed and wiggled her toes i supposed he deserved that but i am laura wondered how many women could say such a thing to their grandmothers i am going to have an affair with him anna said nothing grateful that the rattle signaled the tea trolley being wheeled down the hall she waited until the housekeeper left them alone and poured two cups of tea herself i dont have to tell you to be careful youre a bright selfaware young woman then she sighed ill tell you to be careful anyway i will please dont worry im powerfully attracted to him ive never been so attracted to anyone and i like him i didnt think i would in fact i was sure i wouldnt but i like him a lot and obviously he feels the same way yeah she sipped at her tea then set it aside you know men drive me crazy i really had no intention of ive got so much i want to do and i just dont have time for this kind of complication then grandpa hires him hires him for heavens sake you laugh im sorry darling i shouldnt it might be funny ten or twenty years from now laura muttered right now its just humiliating and then ian decides he needs to play chaperon and wont give me five minutes peace and youd think royce was his best pal ever since he punched him ian punched royce other way but it was a misunderstanding naturally anna said calmly and drank her tea and then dad barges into my office this morning my office and bares his fangs just because royce was kissing me oh annas smile warmed poor caine his baby girl im not youre his baby girl and always will be anna said gently interrupting her i suppose you argued we shouted at each other for a while mama smoothed it out mostly but when he said that grandpa had well the light dawned on how the whole business got rolling so i had to come up and yell at grandpa naturally the macgregors never failed to make their point at top volume anna mused and brushed her hand back to tidy a wave of her sablecolored hair but youve made up now you cant stay mad at grandpa he wheedles it out of you no one knows that better than i and no one loves more than daniel i know she bit her lip she was about to say what she hadnt allowed herself to say before grandma i think i could fall in love with royce if i let myself laura anna reached out took the hand laura held out to her the thing about falling is that you have absolutely no choice it just happens here comes daniel she gave lauras hand a squeeze when she heard daniels heavy tread on the stairs i wouldnt mention that last part to him just yet i wouldnt give him the satisfaction laura said primly and picked up her tea as daniel strode in well well he smiled broadly two beautiful women and theyre all mine chapter contents prev next laura didnt go home she drove back to boston stopped and ate dinner alone to give herself time to think as she saw it she had two choices she could be stubborn attempt to teach her meddling grandfather a lesson and never see royce cameron again that idea didnt make the hotfudge sundae she had treated herself to go down pleasantly on the other hand she could simply allow her relationship if it was a relationship with royce to progress naturally over time she could consider that this blip this interruption in the forward rush of things was a sign to slow down to consider carefully to look before she leaped but macgregors were leapers not lookers and that was why at onefifteen in the morning she was standing outside royces apartment banging her fist on the door the door across the hall opened a crack just enough for her to see a pair of scowling bloodshot eyes peering out at her laura narrowed her own and hissed the door shut again with an abrupt snap she pounded again heard a thump and a curse then saw a narrow light beam under the door she angled her head and smiled blandly certain royce was staring at her through the judas hole an instant later locks rattled open whats wrong he demanded why should there be anything wrong she sailed inside shut the door royce you have a nosy neighbor across the hall he shut the door leaned back against it and struggled to orient himself she looked as fresh and pressed as she had at ten oclock that morning in her tidy pinstriped suit and practical heels he felt as rumpled as last nights sheets in the ragged jeans hed managed to find on the floor and tug on he rubbed his hands over his face heard the crackle of beard against palm then dragged his hands back and through his sleeptangled hair is it one in the morning or did i oversleep laura turned her wrist gave her watch a careful study its am to be exact yeah lets be exact what are you doing here enjoying herself she wandered the tiny living area ive never been up to your place she noted about a weeks worth of dust on scarred furniture newspapers piled on the floor by a sagging sofa a small really excellent watercolor of boston harbor on the wall a highend stereo system on a set of pine shelves and a berber rug that was in desperate need of a good vacuuming now i see why she arched her brows youre a pig i wasnt expecting he caught himself it was one odamnclock in the morning he remembered yeah so what just an observation do you have any wine i didnt want to have a drink since i was driving yeah i think theres he pulled himself up short again his brain was mush it had been years since he had to wake alert at a moments notice you came by for a drink is that a problem she kept the casual pleasant smile on her face and judging the kitchen to be to the left wandered toward it do you want some wine no he stared after her raked his hands through his tousled hair again no help yourself i will he obviously stayed out of the kitchen as much as possible she mused it was neat enough to indicate disuse but she did find a decent bottle of chardonnay in the fridge and after a brief search through cupboards an unchipped glass no frills for you huh i dont spend a lot of time here he moved toward the kitchen watching her pour the wine its just here and i imagine youre funneling most of your profits back into your business which would be wise and frugal are you wise and frugal royce not particularly i just dont need a lot of the extras i like the extras she toasted him and sipped i suppose im highmaintenance she studied him over the rim of her glass his eyes were heavy she noted sleepy sexy his mouth was just a little sulky the jeans werent buttoned and rode low on narrow hips his chest was bare welldefined with a thin white scar slicing just under his left shoulder did you get that on the job get what the scar he glanced down shrugged yeah whats the deal here slim i have a question to ask you okay true or false or multiplechoice just yes or no she made an effort to keep her eyes on his too much study of that tough compact body was bound to distract her were you aware that my grandfather hired you to insure the macgregor line continues huh just yes or no royce its not terribly complicated ill rephrase the question were you aware when you accepted the job to handle house security for me that my grandfather had selected you as you fulfilled his requirements as a potential mate for me mate what do you mean mate his brain was beginning to clear you mean youre kidding i believe that answers the question she started to move by him but his hand snaked out and closed over her arm are you saying that he bought me for you in the nicest possible way thats bull no thats the macgregor laura patted royces hand some men would be flattered really his eyes were narrowed slits of flame blue oh really because she understood and appreciated his reaction she patted his hand again you had no idea what he was up to hes not all that subtle he thinks he is but hes not royce dropped his hand stepped back i got the impression early on i got the idea that he was trying to set something up but i figured that was because you were incredibly ugly a laugh burst out before she could stop it thank you so much no wait he pressed his fingers to his eyes maybe he was having a dream maybe not either way he had to pick his way through it he mentioned you a lot his granddaughter laura bright brilliant beautiful single i thought he hinted pretty broadly and figured you must be desperate for well desperate then i got a look at you and decided id misread the signals she cocked her head now i suppose i should be flattered youre telling me that he set this up so he wants me married and raising a family he thinks youd breed well that id royce held up a hand stepped back again just hold on im not in the market for breeding neither am i thats handy isnt it the old bastard exactly but be careful we can call him that but we dont take kindly when others do she set her glass down well i thought it best to clear the matter up good night just a damn minute he only had to shift to block her path you come here in the middle of the night drop your little bombshell and stroll off i dont think so i thought youd like to know and to know that ive spoken with him and straightened things out thats fine thats your family business he stretched an arm across the doorway resting a hand on the jamb to hold her in and you should know i dont give a damn what your grandfather has in mind he wrapped her hair around his free hand tipping her head back hes not here your fathers not here your brothers not here your cousins arent here her heartbeat thickened no no ones here except you and me so why dont you tell me what you have in mind laura if i have to tell you youre not nearly as quick as i thought you were i want you to tell me exactly there was only one step between them she took it closed the distance i want you to take me to bed i want you to make love with me for the rest of the night is that clear enough thats crystal he swept an arm under her knees her breath caught as he lifted her off her feet before she could shift to wrap her arms around him his mouth was hot and hungry on hers with a little murmur of pleasure she sank into the kiss kicking off her shoes as he carried her toward the bedroom the room was full of shadows the sheets were tangled and the mattress creaked under their weight lifting her arms she drew him closer and let the kiss spin gloriously through her system he yanked her jacket over her shoulders nipping his teeth over her throat as he dragged it free tossed it aside she was slim and eager beneath him arching at a touch sighing at a taste he wanted to savor moment by moment inch by inch but the need he felt was too huge too strong as if it had been strapped down and straining for years as her mouth slid and angled and gave under his he ran his hands over her torturing them both pleasing them both he heard her moan felt her heart trip under his palm then unable to wait tugged her blouse apart her bra skimmed low over the curve of her breasts a shimmering line of satin against silk he closed his mouth over her reveling in the mix of textures she nearly cried out just from that the sensation of lips and tongue on flesh oh but she wanted more she wanted all and she curved up to offer her nails skimming down his back in edgy demand it ached everything he did everywhere he touched brought a low throbbing ache she hadnt known she could want so much that the need for anything could be so sharp so immediate and when his mouth came back to hers she all but wept from the sensation she rolled with him her body fluid energized her breath was sobbing as he dragged off her skirt her mouth seeking flesh was as greedy as his her flesh was smooth hot irresistible her hair all that glorious black silk wrapped around them as they wrestled over the bed struggling to free themselves of the last barriers soft here there firm yielding then demanding he filled himself with her too steeped in her to realize hed never needed anything anyone this desperately when he cupped her her moan was low and long and broken in the dim light he watched her eyes flash open go blind as he drove her over she choked out his name fisted her hands in his hair and went wild she didnt notice that they slid to the floor dragging trapped sheets with them the air was thick and heavy clogging her lungs his hands were quick and rough bruising her skin she flung an arm out as if for balance something crashed then he was inside her forcing her over the edge again where there was nothing to hold on to but him mindlessly she wrapped herself around him matched his violent speed craved more as the storm raged through her she could hear nothing but the roar of her own blood feel nothing but the unspeakable pleasure his body pumped into hers see nothing but his face those lakeblue eyes watching her then as if he knew it was the final thrill she needed his mouth crushed down on hers and they broke free together he gathered himself together enough to roll over so that he lay on the cold floor and she was cushioned by his stilloverheated body then he decided hed die happy if he could stay just like this for the next twenty years or so are we on the floor her voice was slow and slurred as if shed downed the whole bottle of wine instead of less than one glass yeah im pretty sure were on the floor how did we get here i dont have a clue he shifted winced at a small stab of pain when he found the energy to lift a hand and brush his fingers over the back of his shoulder he saw the slight smear of blood theres broken glass on the floor uhhuh and there is now broken glass in my back oh she sighed rubbed her face cozily against his chest than shot upright oh did something break were naked well be cut to ribbons whatever happens ill always say it was worth it with a strength that made her blink he nipped her at the waist and hauled her up until she sat on the bed stay up there until i clean this up i dont think you should damn she squeezed her eyes shut covered them with her hands when the light flashed on is it glass dont step on it i already did he swore ripely making her giggle sorry she said immediately ive never heard those words phrased together quite that way she opened one eye and was immediately contrite royce youre bleeding in a couple of places it was just a drinking glass ive got to get a broom ill tend your wounds she said with a smile that became dreamy as she watched him walk toward the door god youre built disconcerted he stopped glanced back over his shoulder she was sitting on his bed all long slender limbs and tumbled hair same goes slim he murmured and slipped out she bent over the bed and had shaken the glass off the sheet when he came back with a broom and dustpan youll have to launder this there might still be glass in it just toss it over in the corner ill get to it she lifted a brow glanced around the room it had a bed a dresser a chair or at least she assumed that was a chair under the heap of clothing there was a mirror that needed resilvering and a desk that was overpowered by a sleek computer and printer all the comforts of home i told you i dont spend a lot of time here he dumped the glass in a wastebasket then left the broom and dustpan tipped against the wall do you ever actually do laundry she asked him not until i have absolutely no other choice she smiled patted a hand on the bed beside her sit down let me see that cut when he did she clucked her tongue and touched her lips to his shoulder its just a scratch if wed fallen off the bed the other way youd be kissing my butt laughing she rested her cheek on his back hows the foot just a nick ive had worse hmm she shifted ran a fingertip over the scar high on his shoulder like this didnt wait for backup rookie mistake i didnt make it again and this she touched the small mar on his chin bar fight i was just drunk enough not to feel it and stupid enough to have asked for it i stopped making that mistake too reformed are you royce she eased forward to brush her lips against his chin more or less i like that its more or less empowered by the desire darkening his eyes she knelt to wrap her arms around his neck id hate for you to be a completely solid citizen isnt that what you are she laughed bit his bottom lip more or less more id say than less laura macgregor of the boston macgregors his hand rode up her side to brush her breast what are you doing in my bed you could say it occurred to me thats exactly where i wanted to be she nibbled at his mouth i have a habit of going after what i want its a family trait her lips trailed over his jaw and i wanted you i want you take me royce her mouth closed over his and destroyed any hope he had of thinking clearly take me back where you took me before he dragged her hard against him and took her back chapter contents prev next snow buried the east coast and caused schoolage children to dance with joy hard winds blew down from canada and brought bitter cold pipes burst cars stalled and streets turned to ice rinks the brave or the determined crowded the shopping centers and malls to hunt for christmas presents to ponder bright wrappings and ribbons holiday cards arrived in the mail and kitchens smelled of baking boston shivered shoveled out and watched another six inches of snow fall bundled in layers against the cold and armed with a snow shovel laura trooped out to clear the driveway the sunlight bounced off the white ground and stung the eyes so she tumbled a pair of sunglasses out of her pocket the chill air bit her cheeks burned her throat she couldnt have been happier beneath her red ski cap she wore headphones music trilled in her ears christmas music as bright and cheerful as her mood her life she thought as she scooped up the first shovelful of snow couldnt be more perfect shed won her first case the week before just a small propertydamage suit of little consequence to the legal world she thought but she had faced the judge argued her points and she had won she had two new clients who wanted wills drawn up she was just beginning christmas was just around the corner and she couldnt ever remember looking forward to it more she loved looking at the colored lights sparkling on houses at the silly santas and reindeer flying over lawns the glimpses of brightly decorated trees behind windows she even looked forward to braving the crowds and the madness to do her own holiday shopping it didnt matter if julia and gwen rolled their eyes at her when she burst into song or stared dreamily out the window she could laugh off their comments about laura in love she wasnt in love she was simply enjoying the thrilling adventure of a romance with an exciting man that was entirely different if she was in love shed be worried shed sit by the phone and chew her nails waiting for him to call shed think of him every minute of every day plan every night around him shed lose her appetite toss and turn in bed and suffer from wild mood swings none of that was true she decided putting her back into her work well maybe she thought of him a great deal at odd times almost all the time but she didnt sit by the phone she wasnt off her feed and her mood was up and steady had she sulked because he refused the invitation to share thanksgiving dinner at hyannis port of course not shed missed him and certainly shed have liked him there but she hadnt pressed or nagged or wheedled therefore laura concluded as she tossed snow over her shoulder she wasnt in love when hands gripped her hips the shovel went flying she was whirled around before she could manage more than a strangled scream and then she was staring into very annoyed blue eyes she noted that royces head was covered with snow that it coated his shoulders and that his mouth was moving what he shook his head took a deep breath then shoved one end of the headphones off her ear i said what the hell are you doing im clearing the driveway he raked a hand through his dark hair to scatter snow so i noticed did i hit you with that last shovelful she bit down hard on the inside of her cheek and struggled to keep her voice sober im sorry a laugh hitched out poorly disguised as a cough as he narrowed his eyes really i didnt know you were behind me she gave up wrapped her arms around her stomach and let the laugh free i really am sorry but you keep sneaking up on me if you werent blasting music in your ears youd be able to hear the rest of the world and why the hell are you out here shoveling snow because its there and sos my car and i have to get into the office he took the sunglasses off her nose slipped them into the pocket of her coat i dont suppose theres a single young boy in this neighborhood who could use ten bucks for shoveling your driveway im perfectly capable of doing it myself suspicious she fisted her hands on her hips if youre even thinking about saying something insulting like this is mans work ill have to pick up that shovel and brain you with it he caught her chin in his hand drew her face up close to his and smiled in challenge its mans work she let out a sound like a hissing kettle and whirled but he beat her to the shovel go inside he ordered warm up ill take care of it im doing it she gripped the handle of the shovel and frustrated herself with a useless tugofwar its my car its my driveway im not standing here watching you shovel snow oh and i suppose i should take myself off to the kitchen and make you some hot chocolate good idea he knew exactly what he was doing what he was risking when he scraped the shovel under show hold the marshmallows he didnt even flinch when the snowball exploded on the back of his head well play later as soon as i finish this i am not making you hot chocolate coffeed be fine dont you have anything to do dont you work its only seventhirty ive got time and hed needed to see her it was as simple as that hed told himself he was going into the office early then his car had simply ended up in front of her house hed sat in it watching her just watching her shed looked like a column of fire against the snow in that long red coat the red cap snug on her head so hed sat in the car watching her wanting her and it worried him the next missile caught the small of his back he ignored it kept shoveling from the upstairs window julia and gwen studied the scene their noses pressed to the glass how much longer before he grabs her and takes her down gwen wondered out loud three more hits tops agreed ten seconds at the outside after she hits the ground hell be kissing her brainless five seconds max julia declared he works fast how long before she realizes shes in love with him oh nice shot laura thats got to be cold sliding down his neck id say she might be able to delude herself until christmas but thats the cutoff i think she already knows gwen smiled wistfully shes just too stubborn to admit it what about him oh hes hooked did you see the way he was looking at her the way he always looks at her like hed go on looking at her if boston fell into the bay yeah gwen sighed yeah oh here it comes the two of them grinned out the window as royce spun around as laura took one step in retreat its going to be a terrific kiss julia predicted outside laura stopped her backward progress and stood her ground i want that shovel you want the shovel this shovel he winged it distracting her enough to have her watching the flight then he tackled her twisting at the last instant to cushion her fall as they tumbled to the snowy lawn idiot she flung out an arm got a hefty handful of snow before she could rub it in his face he flipped her she lost her breath shivered as snow slipped cold and wet down her collar then found her mouth much too busy for insults he was kissing the cold out of her body the thoughts out of her head the strength out of her limbs she attempted one muffled protest for forms sake then wound her arms around him she wondered the snow didnt melt from the lawn and form a lake and the lake sizzle like a geyser if you think you can get around me that way she began when she could breathe again i did he grinned kissed her lightly your nose is getting red how nice of you to mention it this time she did rub snow in his face then giggling wildly she tried to wiggle away when he swore at her now your whole face is red very attractive he wrestled with her pushed her face into the snow she gave as good as she got so that within three minutes of tussling both of them were drenched covered with snow and breathless let me up you bully her voice shook with laughter as she shoved at him first an idiot now a bully he scooped up snow molded it onehanded her eyes slid to the side focused on the lopsided ball then shifted back to his do it and youll pay he tossed the ball caught it neatly well now im shaking playfully he rubbed the snowball along her jaw up her cheek she lay still with chin angled and eyes slitted and waited for the worst his grin faded slowly her pulse began to kick as the laughter died out of his eyes as his gaze roamed over her face as his fingers began to trace it royce be quiet a minute he said it absently still running a fingertip along those iceedged cheekbones then he lowered his mouth skimmed his lips over them she couldnt have spoken if her life hung in the balance he wanted to believe it was because she was beautiful because her face was exotic unique her body sleek and arousing but he knew it wasnt desire that was working in him now he understood passion need hungers this was more this was all his mouth brushed hers once lightly as if testing some new flavor then again and then it lingered hed never kissed her this way no one had shed grown used to the greed to the urgent demands even craved them but this depthless tenderness was new and it destroyed her her hand slipped limply to the ground everything she was everything she had yielded to him to them to what they had created together when he realized she was trembling he eased back shaken he began to brush the snow off her hair youre cold he said briskly small wonder royce youd better get inside dry off he had to get the hell away from her he thought nearly panicked he had to get a grip on himself he rose quickly hauled her to her feet youve got a yard of hair and all of its wet ill finish the driveway her stomach was churning into knots and her head simply wouldnt stop spinning in slow circles yes all right she wanted to get inside wanted to sit down until she could feel her legs under her again ill ah make that hot chocolate ill take a rain check he moved past her to retrieve the shovel your driveways nearly done anyway and ive got things to do they werent going to talk about what had happened she realized then let out a quiet breath better not to talk about it until she figured out exactly what had happened okay she began backing up youre welcome to come inside and warm up yourself im fine ill see you later later she backed into her car eased herself around it and fled she was out of breath when she got inside and busied herself stripping off her coat unwinding the scarf from around her neck pulling off her cap and headphones it was too hot she decided and yanked off the vest she wore over a cashmere turtleneck she sat on the landing to pull off her boots yanked off the first of two pairs of socks still too hot she thought shed gotten overheated she felt feverish maybe she was coming down with something flu was going around wasnt it flu was always going around shed probably picked up some germ that was why she felt lightheaded and overwarm why her muscles ached and her limbs wanted to tremble shed take something for it shed fight it off then she lifted a hand touched her fingers to lips that still pulsed from him that still tasted of him closing her eyes she laid her head on her knees and admitted the worst shed fallen without feeling the jolt without having the sense to catch herself on the slide she had just dropped headlong in love with royce cameron chapter contents prev next you did very well in court today diana smiled at her daughter as they worked together in the law library thanks laura frowned over the wording of a brief made a notation in the margin it felt good i really appreciate you letting me do the direct on the coroner its very basic testimony but still tricky you handled yourself well the jury paid attention to you and just as important our client trusts you laura worked up a smile only because you do amandas your client youve been a tremendous help to me on this case diana scanned the stacks of books piled on the table but were not there yet are you worried concerned diana said i dont want her to spend a single day in prison because i believe she was defending her life and laura im a little concerned about you why im fine are you absolutely im doing exactly what ive always wanted to do my life is exciting and rich its two weeks before christmas and for the first time in history ive actually finished my shopping mostly what could be wrong you dont mention royce hes fine too laura looked back down at the paperwork i just saw him last night we went to dinner and and it was fine i enjoy going out with him i do think it may be best to slow things down a little weve moved awfully fast to this point and with the holidays coming up theres so much going on its a good time to step back a bit and evaluate diana let out a sigh youre so much like me its almost frightening what do you mean honey you havent once said how you feel about him what you feel for him certainly i did i said i enjoy seeing him we enjoy each other hes a very interesting complex man and i she trailed off undone by her mothers patient gaze and im in love with him ive ruined everything and fallen in love with him it wasnt supposed to happen i went into this relationship with my eyes open im responsible for my own reactions my own emotions its supposed to be a physical relationship between two people who like each other respect each other she cut herself off squeezed her eyes tight i could kill grandpa for getting me into this sympathetic diana covered her daughters hand with hers is it so bad to be in love with an interesting complex man you like you respect you enjoy it is when we set ground rules at the beginning did you not in so many words it was just understood were not looking for love and marriage and family royce was every bit as appalled as i was that grandpa had this harebrained scheme in mind she blew out a breath im all right really im irritated with myself more than anything and i can handle it its just a matter of slowing things down a little of refocusing of being too stubborn or too afraid to risk your feelings maybe laura acknowledged the possibility with a nod but i dont want to lose him and i would if i complicated things id rather have what i have than watch him walk away and youre sure he would im not sure of anything but ive decided to keep things fairly status quo perhaps with a little distance once i have a better perspective ill go from there and distance shouldnt be a problem with the amount of work i have and the holidays she put some effort into making her lips curve up so to circle back to the beginning im absolutely fine with his mood light and the small glossy bag in his hand caine strolled back to the offices hed slipped out to pick up a necklace hed had designed for his wife he could already picture her opening the christmas gift and himself slipping the collar of gold and colored stones around her throat she was he thought going to be very happy when he caught sight of the man starting up the steps to macgregor and macgregor caines mood darkened instantly royce cameron he thought the man who was playing fast and loose with his baby girl cameron royce glanced around and his own mood not too cheery to begin with dropped several levels damn macgregors were everywhere mr macgregor office hours are nine to five he said coolly lauras assisting on a very important case if you want to see her youd best wait until shes done for the day i didnt come to see laura i came to see your wife caines eyes went sharp and hot oh really and do you have an appointment no but i think shell want to see me its a legal matter mr macgregor not a personal one dianas caseload is already overburdened but ive got a few minutes to spare for the first time royce smiled mr macgregor if i had a legal problem youd be the very last lawyer in boston id come to youd like nothing better than to see me locked away for ten to twenty preferably in solitary not at all i was thinking more along the lines of hard labor in a maximumsecurity facility but because caine appreciated a man who knew the lay of the land he opened the door he led the way into the reception area with its antiques and polished woods file this under christmas mollie he asked the woman manning the desk oh mr macgregor its the choker isnt it can i peek just make sure my wife doesnt see it then buzz her will you and see if she has a moment for mr cameron right away but she was already slipping the velvet box out of the bag and opening the lid oh she pressed a hand against the starched jacket she wore oh its the most beautiful necklace ive ever seen shes going to love it distracted caine eased a hip on the desk and took another look himself you think any woman who found this under the christmas tree would know shes adored just look how the sunlight catches these stones baffled royce watched the dignified former attorney general of the united states grin down at a piece of jewelry the way a giddy boy grinned at a jar full of lightning bugs and it struck him that this was a man completely besotted by a woman hed been married to for a quarter of a century how did that happen royce wondered how did it last how did two people possibly live together for a lifetime and still love no comment cameron royce jerked himself back and took a look at the necklace it was exotic deeply colored stones glinting against thick gold he imagined it would suit diana macgregor perfectly and undoubtedly her daughter as well he shifted felt remarkably foolish its impressive he said i dont know much about glitters women do caine winked at mollie right you bet we do she slipped the bag into her bottom drawer and turned a small key ill just buzz mrs macgregor now mr cameron if youd like to have a seat he can come up with me ring my office if and when dianas free mollie caines wolfish grin spread as he turned to royce suit you sure deliberately cocky he shoved his hands in the back pockets of his jeans as he followed caine up straight uncarpeted stairs with a brassandwood rail that gleamed with a mirror shine the place smelled rich was all he could think subtle scents thick rugs leather polish the wainscoting in the hall they walked down had to be mahogany but more it had the feel of a home rather than a place of business it impressed him that anyone could accomplish that or bothered to even try caine stepped inside his office his turf wanting to set the tone his tone he sat behind his desk have a seat cameron want anything coffee royce chose a wingbacked leather chair in deep navy i havent been a cop for while now but i remember how to set up an interrogation im probably as good at it as you are ive been at it a lot longer lets just cut straight to the heart of the matter shall we what are your intentions as to my daughter i dont have any no intentions no plans no designs youve been seeing her for nearly three months now thats right id imagine shes dated a number of other men but this was the only man caine had ever worried about her social life didnt begin with you laura is a beautiful outgoing young woman a wealthy young woman he added keeping his eyes level on royces the flash of heat the snap of insult pleased him enormously you dont want to go in that direction its an undeniable fact do you think i give a damn about her portfolio royces temper snapped shoving him to his feet do you think a man could be with her for five minutes and think of anything but her i dont care what you think of me but you ought to think better of her i do relaxing now caine leaned back in his chair and now i know you do as well you son of a bitch as you say what we think of each other doesnt really matter i love my daughter i also trust her judgment in most cases and have always found her to be a good judge of character she sees something in you and im going to try to accept that but hurt her he leaned forward again with eyes that gleamed cause her one moments unhappiness and ill come down on you like the wrath of god when his phone rang he answered without taking his eyes from royces yes mollie thanks he hung up inclined his head my wife will see you now her office is across the hall because he didnt trust himself to speak knew whatever came out of his mouth at that moment would be bitter and vile royce turned on his heel and walked out control caine murmured and felt a first twinge of sympathy for the man admirable royce diana opened the door herself and her smile was a telling contrast to her husbands frost how nice to see you please come in and sit down would you like some coffee no i dont want anything he set his teeth i dont want anything fury diana mused barely leashed she flicked a glance at the office across the hall and controlled a sigh all right then what can i do for you nothing i dont want anything from any of you and i never did ive got some information you may be able to use on the holloway case oh please sit down i dont want to sit royce snapped out i just want to get this over with and get the hell out of here he stopped himself forced himself to take one long calming breath im sorry its all right i imagine lauras father was difficult i dont think wed better discuss lauras father or laura or anyone named macgregor just now then why dont we discuss amanda holloway i dont know her i never met her i knew her husband slightly when we both worked out of the same house precinct he elaborated did you work with him directly only once we took a call together i hate this he said and finally sat look cops back each other because when you go through the door together youve got to know the one going in with you is with you all the way we took a call domestic dispute the worst guy had been pounding on his wife kids were screaming i restrained the man holloway took the woman her face was bashed up bleeding and shed gone over i mean she was going after her husband now she wasnt going to take it anymore i remember her screaming that when holloway took hold of her he hurt her royce continued i had the man on the floor cuffing him and i heard the woman cry out i saw holloway yank her arm back its a wonder he didnt snap a bone and he shoved her back against the wall i told him to ease off and he said something like the bitch is asking for it that her husband had a right to teach her a lesson and he slapped her backhanded her i had to leave the husband on the floor to drag holloway off the woman royce paused a moment tried to gather his thoughts he had a rep as a good solid cop the men liked him he did the job i told myself hed just snapped that day just lost his grip for a minute but i kept seeing the way he looked when he hit that woman and i knew hed gotten off on it and i knew if i hadnt been there hed have done worse so i reported the incident to the lieutenant would that be lieutenant masterson yeah theres no mention of an incident such as you described on holloways record because the lieutenant ordered me to forget it holloway had been defending himself against a violently hysterical woman bottom line he brushed it off and a few weeks later i was transferred i was ticked off enough to do a little digging in the sixmonth period before i transferred three calls were logged in from holloways house domestic dispute officers responded no charges filed and the reports were buried they closed ranks diana murmured yeah and holloway moved up them beating on his wife whenever he felt the urge youll testify to the incident you were witness to if i have to it doesnt change the fact that she whacked him youre going to go for diminished capacity and this doesnt add that much to the medical records that she was abused continually over the course of years it speaks to the character of the man the despair of the woman and the complicity of the police shed called for help and no one helped she did what she could to survive there was no one else to take her part you have laura has yes and now you have why because maybe itll make a difference and id stopped thinking i could make one and because its important to laura and shes important to you she matters he said after a moment if you need to go over this again ill be available ive got some things to do i appreciate you coming in she offered her hand i very much appreciate it she watched him go out and knew the instant the door across the hall opened well caine demanded he just gave me some weight to add to the holloway defense she looked at caine and hes in love with laura shes in love with him diana shes just shes only a he leaned against the door understanding perfectly diana crossed the hall and cupped caines face in her hands shell still be ours nothing changes that i know i know he let out a windy sigh trust laura to pick a guy whod like nothing better than to kick my ass from here to canada she laughed kissed him and that counselor is one of the reasons you like him chapter contents prev next two days before christmas laura rushed up the steps to cameron security as usual royces secretary was away from her desk laura all but danced to the door of the inner office and knocked briskly got a minute mr cameron she poked her head in saw him on the phone he gave her a comeahead curl of his finger if youre sure this time i can start right after the first of the year no he said firmly then again with a hint of exasperation no mr macgregor i cant do that i appreciate no he said again and rubbed at the headache brewing behind his eyes i understand thanks yes merry christmas it had to be my grandfather laura said when royce slapped the receiver back on the hook of all the mr macgregors hes most likely to cause that reaction hes finally decided on the system he wants at least hes decided again for the moment i think the man wants to keep me on a string for the rest of my life he looked over saw her beaming smile what are you so happy about oh a number of things we really turned a comer on the trial today royce your testimony yesterday made an enormous difference good i know it wasnt a happy day for you but it helped and im hearing rumors that iad and the district attorneys office are going to investigate masterson amanda holloway is going to get justice she leaned over the desk and kissed him thank you i didnt do anything to speak of i thought youd be on your way to hyannis im just on my way home to pick up my bags i wish youd change your mind and come with me you know youre welcome she lifted a brow and i know grandpa has been nagging you for weeks to come up for the holidays i appreciate it but i cant besides im not a familygathering type christmas is for kids and families she shook her head you didnt even put up a tree you bought me that ugly little ceramic one its not ugly its tacky thats entirely different she wanted so much to ask him again to find the right words to persuade him to spend christmas with her to be part of her life but shed resolved to make do and accept what she had ill miss you youll be surrounded by people he smiled a little as he stood up hordes of macgregors even the thought of which unnerves me you wont have time to miss me ill miss you anyway she kissed him lightly she pulled a brightly wrapped box out of her pocket handed it to him whats this a present its traditional i want you to open it christmas morning look i dont have royce say thankyou though he was as miserable as hed been in his life he made his lips curve thank you now say merry christmas merry christmas slim ill see you in a few days she hurried out telling herself it was the sentiment of the season that misted her eyes royce sat where he was continued to sit as the sun slanted lower through his small window as the light dimmed and darkness fell he couldnt avoid it any longer he thought he couldnt keep denying what had happened to him what had become of him it had probably happened the first moment he saw her face when she stood there wearing next to nothing and prepared to hold him off with a kitchen knife how could a man not love a woman like that but it didnt matter how he felt about her hadnt he already argued with himself for days about this single point she didnt just come from a different world she lived in one she was the niece of a president the granddaughter of a financial legend an heiress as her father who hated the sight of him had so acerbically pointed out just in case hed missed those facts he had only to note that she wore diamond studs in her ears lived in a house in the back bay filled with arts and antiques and drove a spiffy car that would cost a year of his annual income in a good year she was harvard law and he was community college and he hadnt even finished that it couldnt possibly work he was deluding himself by even fantasizing about it but hed discovered something in the past few weeks he understood now what put that bedazzled look in caine macgregors eyes when he spoke of his wife he knew now what caused a man to fall so deeply in love it never ended it was finding the unique woman and what knowing her could do to your heart forget it he ordered himself forget her and move on he turned back telling himself he would lock up go home the office looked so empty and his apartment would be even emptier why hadnt that ever bothered him before hed liked his lonewolf status he wanted to come and go as he pleased when he pleased now even the thought of sleeping alone depressed him he rubbed his hands over his face and wondered when hed become such a coward so afraid to take a risk hed gone after her hadnt he hed made the moves and now he was going to let her go because he was afraid she wouldnt want him couldnt want him as much as he wanted her that was bull he dropped his hands he wasnt going to sit around brooding over his beer and feeling sorry for himself he still had some moves to make he grabbed his coat on the way out royce had been right about one thing the house in hyannis was crammed with macgregors and macgregors made noise and lots of it music blasted from the stereo in the parlor in the music room down the long hall lauras youngest cousin amelia blade pounded out christmas carols on the piano and added her strong rich voice to daniels booming baritone from somewhere upstairs male voices carried down an argument in progress laura mused it sounded like the oldest grandchild mac and either dc or duncan hardly mattered she decided whoever was fighting would bicker the point to death then find something else to wrangle over she walked into what the family affectionately called the throne room in honor of the huge highbacked chair daniel presided in during family events there before the wide windows that opened onto a view of the cliffs the christmas tree soared fifteen feet of glossy pine every bough and branch heavy with ornaments and twinkling with lights it would stay lit day and night until epiphany beneath it were mountains of gifts at midnight following family tradition there would be a minor riot of ripping and laughing and love most of all love she thought no matter how they fought no matter how much noise and confusion there was this house was always filled with love and how she hated to think of royce alone on christmas eve i dont know how they do it caine said from behind her he stepped up laying his hands on her shoulders to rub every year they manage to find the perfect tree ever since i was a boy theres been a tree right there at christmas and its always been the perfect tree when we were little before we were old enough to stay up to midnight we always used to sneak down huddle on the stairs and watch for santa to come down the chimney over there laura leaned back against him i dont have a single bad memory in this house and its only occurred to me just lately how lucky i am i love you so much she turned into his arms rested her head on his shoulder it was the catch in her voice that had him lifting her chin and smoothing back her hair when he saw the tears swimming in her eyes what is it baby whats wrong nothing im feeling sloppy and sentimental its the season for it ive decided i dont get sloppy and sentimental nearly often enough you were the first man in my life the first man to ever pick me up and i wanted to tell you that youve never not once let me down youre going to make me sloppy caine murmured and gathered her close there was a thunder of footsteps behind them as a horde of people raced down the stairs shouts threats insults laughter ian and julia have instigated a snow battle laura gave her father a hard squeeze another fine macgregor tradition interested yeah she tipped her head back and grinned we can take them why dont you go issue the challenge and ill be out in a minute youre on he kissed the tip of her nose youve never let me down either laura im proud of who you are good blood she said with a smile strong stock she smiled as he went out raising his voice over the melee to challenge a former president of the united states to a snow war chuckling laura sat on the arm of her grandfathers chair shed go out and join in but she wanted a moment to herself first she would make a wish on the tree she thought as she often had as a child now it would be a womans wish the hope that one day on some snowy christmas eve the man she loved would stand in this room with her laura her head jerked around and for one foolish moment she thought she was dreaming then her smile bloomed royce you changed your mind thats wonderful she rushed across the room to take his hand god your hands are freezing where are your gloves here let me take your coat and you can warm up by the fire i need to talk to you of course she continued to smile but her eyes went cool as she glanced beyond him it was no less crowded in the hallway than it had been moments before but it was dead silent my family she began im not going to be introduced to a half a million macgregors at least not until ive talked to you fair enough she skimmed over several interested faces beat it she ordered without waiting to see if the order was obeyed or ignored she closed the door and tugged royce into the throne room dont worry youve already met a portion of them and youll sort the rest out over the next couple of days i dont know if im staying oh but you may not want me to when im finished something skittered in her stomach but she ignored it well at least take off your coat and let me get you a glass of christmas cheer will brandy do you sure fine whatever he stripped off his coat while she walked off to lift a decanter some tree well its no ceramic tabletop but it does the trick she walked back then tapped her glass against the one she gave him im glad you came that remains to be seen she had a hunch she should sit and without thinking she chose daniels chair it should have dwarfed her royce thought instead she looked regal a queen prepared to rule but hed be damned if shed lop off his head without a fight if somethings on your mind she said carefully you should just say it yeah thats easy for you to say he began to pace remembered he didnt care for brandy and set the snifter down im the one who had to drive up here into enemy territory she had to laugh enemy territory your father hates me oh royce he doesnt hes just doesnt matter he waved her amused protest aside and kept pacing and why shouldnt he i didnt go to harvard i dont own a house im an excop with a struggling business and im sleeping with his daughter in his place id have arranged for a quick quiet murder my father isnt a snob he doesnt have to be the facts are there right there thats reality and even if you push all that aside this wasnt the deal it wasnt the deal what deal he shook his head paced stopped stared at her i want to i have to i need a minute here he walked to one of the windows outside on the rolling lawn at least half a dozen people were pummeling each other with snowballs i dont know anything about this kind of family its not where im from id say this family is unique by almost any standard im not poor he said it almost to himself the business is holding its own i know what im doing he turned away from the window but he decided it was easier to keep moving i dont care about your money it doesnt mean a damn to me if youve got five dollars or five million now she was completely baffled the words themselves were puzzling enough but he looked miserable angry and though it seemed unlikely nervous i never thought otherwise just so you know he muttered to himself then shook his head i can support myself ive been doing it for most of my life youre used to more and thats not a problem for me you should have what youre used to having good im glad you think so because i certainly intend to she stood up royce i wish youd get to the point im working on it his eyes heated glinted dangerously im working up to it you think this is a snap for me i never planned on this i never wanted this he stalked up to her fury bubbling in his eyes get that clear slim i never wanted this wanted what to not be able to go one lousy day without you inside my head to start reaching for you at night when youre not even there to need to hear your voice just hear it to be in love with you in love with me she repeated and sank slowly back into the chair youre in love with me now you hear me out all the way i know you have feelings for me or you wouldnt have let me touch you maybe it started out as just chemistry but its more its a hell of a lot more and if youd give it a chance royce damn it laura youll hear me out he had to move away pull back his control he felt as though he were three stories up and toeing his way across a very thin and shaky wire were good together and i know i can make you happy he spun back your grandfathers on my side here the warmth flowing through her heart was cut off in a snap thats the wrong button to push im pushing it he figures im good enough for you so why shouldnt i think the same good enough for me she repeated almost sputtering thats right ive got a strong back ive got a good mind and i dont cheat and i love you i love everything about you and ill even give learning to live with your family a shot that should be enough for anyone he dug a hand into his pocket and came out with a small box here he said and shoved it at her laura reached for it bobbled it then holding her breath opened the lid her heart took another spin on the roller coaster hed brought with him this time shooting straight up and shouting for joy the deep red ruby gleamed seductively against a circle of gold i figured a diamond was too predictable for you he muttered for us are you proposing to me royce she was pleased that her voice could sound so steady so mild when her heart was still somewhere in the stratosphere its a ring isnt it yes it certainly is and a lovely one she lifted her gaze from it stared into his eyes what its not big enough idiot im waiting youre waiting im waiting she sighed all right lets try this i didnt plan this i didnt want this it wasnt the deal but im in love with you hed opened his mouth his arguments ready huh hear me out enjoying herself now she sat back in the chair laid one arm out youre an extraordinarily attractive man you have your own business and though apparently you occasionally undervalue yourself you have a healthy ego a good brain she pressed her lips and nodded in a considering way and you come from strong stock i believe if were going to use your idiotic turn of phrase youre good enough for me youre in love with me was all he could manage she wondered if she would ever again in the long life she planned for them have him at such a disadvantage yes i am desperately in love with you royce and ive been very brave and stoic ill have you know accepting that you werent in love with me but since you are its different and if you had the sense to ask me to marry you instead of shoving a box in my hand id say yes he was still staring at her but his brain was clearing and his heart his heart was lost i had really good arguments planned to talk you into it do you want me to hear them now no he took another breath im not getting down on my knees i should hope not she got up handed him the box try again it wasnt hard to say it he realized when your heart was full of the words i love you laura he touched her hair at the temple kept his eyes on hers i love you i want a life with you a family with you i want to spend the next sixty christmas mornings with you will you marry me oh that was really good for the first time her vision blurred i want my ring and i want you to kiss me then itll be perfect say yes first yes absolutely yes she leaped into his arms found his mouth with hers it was more than perfect im so glad i found you so glad i found you when i wasnt even looking for you i wished for you she let the first tear fall as he slipped the ring on her finger i wished for you just a little while ago and here you are here we are he murmured the front door crashed someone shouted as footsteps thudded down the hall surrounded theyre going to love you she laughed lifted a hand to his cheek i do and you do have the macgregor on your side her eyes danced as she leaned into him lets go tell him ordinarily id want him to suffer awhile but its christmas hed just love the gift of being right from the private memoirs of daniel duncan macgregor a mans family is his most prized possession it is also his most solemn responsibility i never shirk my responsibilities and i tend well all that is mine ive seen my first granddaughter married what a beautiful bride she was glowing luminous in her long white gown with the veil worn by her grandmother over her shining dark hair such a picture did our laura make that i had to hold my anna close and soothe her the woman gets emotional at such times it was for me a moment of great joy and private satisfaction oh i watched my son caine beam the proud papa as he escorted laura down the aisle to the man who would be her husband the man i personally selected but well just keep quiet about that children tend to become surly at what they mistakenly see as meddling tending is what it is and make no mistake and on that perfect spring day i stood and watched caine grin chuckled to myself as he exchanged manly backslaps with his new soninlaw even dashed a stray tear from my own eye when ian as brother of the bride made a toast to the new bride and groom oh a happy day it was for the clan macgregor my work there is done laura and royce will be happy and theyd best be seeing about giving their grandmother new babies to bounce on her knee anna is already fretting for a greatgrandchild now i can turn my attention to my sweet gwen pretty as a princess is my gwen with a strong spine a serious nature and a romantic heart and a brain god love her the child is bright as the sun still shes like her grandmother and doesnt see that she needs a man beside her children to bring her joy so its up to me to see that she has the right man a man of substance ive already picked him out for her good solid stock he has a good mind a fine heart id settle for nothing less for gwen and be damned if id let her settle for any man who didnt measure up this will take a bit of time but ive time yet a man whos lived as long as i knows all about choosing his moments i can be patient ill take a few months to lay the groundwork im a man who appreciates the importance of a good strong foundation when you intend to build something that will last ill wager my gwen will be planning her own wedding by christmastime and i wont ask for any thanks there either no no thanks will be necessary i look after my own but i wouldnt have to if theyd look after themselves part two gwendolyn chapter contents prev next on three one two three gwen and the emergency room team lifted the twohundredpound man from gurney to table well trained they moved in synch almost a blur of motion as she called out orders intubate him miss clipper gwen knew the fourthyear medical student was eager and had good hands but she watched those hands in training as they worked while the head trauma nurse cut away the bloody tattered jeans of the unconscious man she watched and assessed the patient storing his vital signs in her mind relaying orders to the others while her own hands worked swiftly motorcycles she muttered hello death at least he was wearing a helmet audrey clipper let out a short breath as the tube slid in intubated he should have been wearing body armor lets get blood gases toxicology smells like hed been partying gwen adjusted her protective goggles and went to work on the leg she had to work fast but her hands and her mind were cold and steady the gash on the left leg ran from ankle to knee exposing bone and the bone had snapped clean it was her job to piece the patient back together and get him up to surgery quickly efficiently and alive from the next room a woman continued to scream and sob calling out for johnny over and over in a voice pitched to shatter eardrums this johnny gwen asked flicking a glance through the glass that separated the two treatment rooms john petreski age twentytwo one of the orderlies informed her okay well make sure he can

johnny through the glass panel of the door branson maguire watched what he thought of as a ballet motion teamwork costumes and lights and the strongest light he decided was on the delicate blonde in the incredibly ugly pea green scrubs and clear plastic gown he couldnt see her eyes the wide protective goggles covered them and half her face as well still he knew what she looked like dr gwendolyn blade heiress prodigy daughter of a partcomanche gambler and another prodigy heiress a macgregor hed seen gwens picture in newspapers in tabloids on television during her uncles years of campaigning and the eight years hed lived in the most important house in the country hed seen her photograph crammed with other faces on the massive desk of her grandfather daniel macgregor builder of empires though branson considered himself to be a keen observer he hadnt expected her to be so slight he decided she looked as though she should be wearing gossamer and granting wishes not encased in a bloodsmeared tent and fighting to save lives she moved like a dancer he mused her gestures filled with personal grace effort and efficiency her hair somewhere between red and gold under the bright lights was gamineshort with spiky bangs across the forehead for style he wondered or practicality it would be interesting to find out he stood where he was hands comfortably in the pockets of stonegray chinos and watched her watched everything it was one of his finest skills this watching and he didnt mind waiting for whatever happened next gwen noticed him the face behind the glass dark blond hair that fell to the collar of a navy crewneck sweater cool gray eyes that rarely seemed to blink an unsmiling mouth he made a statement just by existing but she didnt have time to wonder or to give him more than a passing thought but when she had both her patients stabilized through the door and on their way to treatment he was still there she had to pull up short when he blocked her way dr blade gwendolyn blade he smiled now just a quick crooked lift of lips and she saw shed been wrong the eyes werent cool but smokywarm like his voice yes can i help you thats the idea im branson maguire she took the hand he offered automatically had hers squeezed and held yes ouch his grin was both charming and selfdeprecating there goes my ego i guess you dont have a lot of time to read she was tired and wanted five minutes to sit down and fuel up with coffee and she wanted her hand back im sorry mr maguire i dont even as she tugged her hand free she placed the name oh yes detective matt scully boston pd i have read your books youve created an interesting character scullys doing a good job for me im sure he is i dont have time to discuss popular fiction just now so if youll theyre lavender excuse me your eyes his stayed steady and focused in what would have been a rude stare in another man in him it merely appeared a natural state id wondered if it was just a trick of the light but theyre not blue theyre lavender prickles of irritation scraped at the back of her neck it says blue on my drivers license now as i said im a little pressed for time isnt your shift over at two its nearly three the temperature dropped as she drew back an automatic defense for a woman who due to family had lived most of her life in the spotlight why would you know my schedule not just ice he thought impressed sharp jagged ice this pixie could grow fangs ah i take it you werent expecting me no should i have been she glanced back as tina was wheeled out doctor doctor i want to see johnny i have to see johnny excuse me she turned her back on branson and walked over all he heard was the tone the way that frosty voice immediately warmed and soothed the young woman on the gurney subsided into muffled sobs and nodded nice bedside manner doc branson commented when she approached him again you were saying i should have been expecting you this morning your grandfather told me hed set it up set it up and because she was tired she closed her eyes i need coffee she muttered come with me with a swing of her lab coat she turned and marched down the hallway she bore left shoved through a door and into the lounge branson looked everywhere noting filing in his mind the dull colors the cheap chairs the stingy lockers the noisily humming refrigerator the smell of stale coffee that didnt quite mask the underlying stench of hospital cozy do you want coffee sure black she took a pot from the warmer filled two insulated cups and because she knew just what the filth disguised as coffee tasted like added a heap of sugar to her own branson sampled the cup she gave him and shuddered good thing im in a hospital you pump stomachs right its one of my greatest joys i need to sit down she did so crossed her legs and tried to wiggle her toes inside her flat practical shoes look mr maguire bran look she repeated im sorry you were misled my grandfather is well he is what he is hes the most incredible man ive ever met she had to smile at that and it warmed her eyes as he sat on the threadbare sofa beside her yes hes an incredible man he is also set in his ways in his methods and in his goals im sure youre very nice and as i said i enjoy your work but im just not interested uhhuh he risked another swallow of coffee in what exactly in being set up she skimmed long slender and unpainted fingertips through her hair grandpa doesnt think i give enough attention to my social life but i give it the attention i believe it warrants dating just isnt very high on my list right now oh intrigued branson lifted a brow and settled back comfortably in the corner of the couch the shadows under her eyes nearly matched the fascinating color of the irises and made her seem as delicate and appealing as spun glass why because im a secondyear surgical resident and i have other priorities and because she added with a snap i dont choose to date men my grandfather has handselected for me and you dont look like the type who needs a ninetyoneyearold man to set you up with women maybe that was a compliment branson said after a moment i think that was a compliment so thanks then he grinned a lightning flash of humor that had a dimple winking at the corner of his mouth i wasnt planning to ask you out but now im going to have to just to soothe my ego you werent she drew in a breath struggled to adjust her brain was starting to shut down she realized the double shift was catching up with her what are you doing here research he smiled again charmingly at least thats the plan im starting a book i need some hospital and medical data some background some atmosphere color and buzzwords and rhythm that kind of thing daniel said youd help me out let me hang around for a couple weeks play things off you annoy you with questions i see she let her head rest against the back of the couch let her eyes close well this is embarrassing i think its great so how about it you want to go out with me get some decent coffee have sex get married have three kids buy a big house and an ugly dog she opened one eye and nearly smiled again no thanks okay you dont want the coffee im flexible but i still want sex before we get married im firm on that she did smile let out a weary sigh are you trying to make me feel better or more ridiculous either way he set the coffee down the caffeine kick just wasnt worth the loss of stomach lining youre beautiful gwendolyn im telling you that so if i end up hitting on you you wont think its because im trying to score points with the old man her smile remained in place but sharpened like a scalpel men who try to hit on me often end up requiring medical treatment im telling you that in case you need to renew your insurance he puffed out his cheeks okay how about the research assistance i observe in the er a few weeks keep out of everybodys hair i ask questions when its convenient for you and the staff i run certain angles i hope to use for the story by you youre free to shoot them down to suggest how they can be adjusted to ring true she wanted a pillow a blanket and a nice dark room youre free to observe even if i objected you could go over my head which you already in essence have my grandparents have a lot of influence with the administration of the hospital if you dont want to cooperate i can go to another hospital there are plenty of them in boston im being rude im tired she lifted her hands to rub at her temples and struggled to adjust her mood it wasnt his fault hed caught her at the end of a particularly hideous day i dont have a problem giving you a hand with your research as long as you dont get in my way or anyone elses in the er ill answer your questions when i have time and instruct the staff on my shifts to cooperate with you when they have the time i appreciate it and if after were done i ask you out to dinner or buy you a small tasteful gift to show that appreciation are you going to hurt me ill try to restrain myself im on the graveyard shift for the next three weeks no problem i like the night youre exhausted he murmured surprised by the urge to tug her down so that she could rest her head in his lap and sleep why dont i give you a lift home i have my car he angled his head how many people have you patched up whove fallen asleep behind the wheel good point ill sleep here suit yourself he rose looked down at her her eyes were heavy nearly closed the delicate shadows beneath them seemed to deepen as he watched try for eight straight doc ill be back tomorrow he started for the door paused turned back one last point i have full coverage on my medical insurance he stepped into the hall noting that for tonight at least the er was quiet at am he headed out filing away the position of the admitting desk the number of computers the sound his own sneakers made on the tiles of the floor the november wind slapped hard at his face when he stepped outside his hair blew into his eyes as he jingled keys out of his pocket one other point dr dish he mused a man would have to be an idiot not to hit on you and meg maguires son branson was no idiot he climbed into his classic triumph convertible the seat already adjusted to accommodate his long legs as best it could he turned the key smiled at the purr he was a man who loved a welltuned engine and for all her resemblance to a fairy princess branson had already decided gwendolyn blade was a welltuned engine he flipped on the cd player hummed along with verdi and driving away he began to plot in a way that would have made daniel macgregor proud chapter contents prev next it was after ten in the morning when gwen unlocked the door to the house in the back bay a thin icy rain was falling making her hurry inside to shiver in the warmth she didnt bother to call out she knew her cousin julia would be out wheeling some real estate deal and her third housemate laura macgregor had moved out months before when she married royce cameron gwen still missed her the three cousins had roomed together for years and had all but grown up together before that theyd been a threesome from college campus to apartments to the houses julia had begun to acquire knowing laura was wildly happy was everything she wanted but gwen still caught herself glancing up those curving stairs off the foyer and expecting to see laura come flying down them gwen draped her coat over the newel post she had the entire afternoon free she realized and there were dozens of things she could catch up on including a long hot bubble bath but that was going to be her second order of business she decided food was first she headed back into the kitchen rubbing at the ache shed worked into her neck by spending four hours sleeping on the lounge sofa instead of getting into one of the cots shed get one of the physical therapists to give her a neckandshoulder massage before she started her next shift she smelled the roses before she saw them there must have been three dozen pale as snow long stems tucked into a gorgeous crystal vase then spearing up to end in tightly curled buds one of julias men she assumed and indulged herself by sniffing then sighing over the mass of blossoms her romantic heart had a weakness for roses and for foolishly extravagant gestures she crossed to the refrigerator with little hope since laura had moved out the pickings were invariably slim theyd often said julia never ate laura always ate and gwen herself ate only when food was shoved in front of her without much enthusiasm she pulled out a carton of yogurt checked the expiration date on the bottom well what was a week when it came to curdled milk anyway she decided and pried off the lid she closed the door then tugged the note attached to it down to read while she ate gwen hubbahubba on the roses what other secrets are you keeping from me will interrogate you later messages for you on the machine grandpa dont ask me and some sexy voiced man named bran flower guy hmm well as a doctor youd know brans good for you back by six maybe jules frowning gwen read the note again then glanced back at the flowers she stared at the little envelope tucked among the stems she plucked it off the clear plastic holder tapped it consideringly against her palm then with a shrug tore it open they looked like your style thanks in advance for the help bran oh she couldnt quite suppress the giddy little thrill as she looked at the roses mine she murmured and leaning over inhaled deeply then she caught herself stepped back three dozen longstemmed white roses in november was definitely an overstatement a terrific one but nonetheless she was going to have to be more direct in discouraging branson maguire grandpa she mused just what are you up to and what have you done she turned to the answering machine punched for messages and had to grin as daniels voice boomed out hate these damn things nobody talks to anybody just rattles away to machines why arent you girls ever home gwen ive a young friend who needs a bit of help hes a writer spins a good tale but then hes an irishman so what would you expect does well murdering people right and left and tracking down mad killers youll give him a hand darling wont you a favor to your old grandpa hes a nice boy his mama went to college with yours so hes not some strange man off the street julia i spoke with your father he said youre buying another house thats a lass and would it hurt either of you to call your grandmother now and again she worries gwen chuckled combed her fingers through her hair a typical daniel macgregor message she thought delivered at full volume but it seemed harmless enough the son of a friend of her mothers all right then there seemed to be no plot or scheme behind it just a favor an easily granted one satisfied gwen picked up her yogurt again got out a spoon then hit the button for bransons message gwendolyn she paused with the spoon nearly to her lips there was something about the way the man said her name she thought using the romantic whole of it rather than the quick and easy gwen its branson maguire i hope you got some sleep and i hope you like white roses i was thinking if you had the time to spare id appreciate an hour anytime today id offer to buy you lunch or dinner but i dont want to put your back up again id just like to run a couple things by you plotwise if you can manage it give me a call im planning on being in all day if not ill see you tonight she didnt bother to note down the number shed remember thoughtfully she spooned up yogurt it was a reasonable request she supposed thered been nothing really flirtatious in the content or the tone laughing at herself she scooped up another spoonful just listen to yourself analyzing every nuance it was exactly the attitude that had caused her such embarrassment the night before the man was a professional and so was she she could certainly give him an hour if for no other reason than to secretly apologize to him and to her grandfather for being so suspicious she picked up the phone punched in his number he answered on the third ring maguire hello its gwen blade thank you for the roses theyre lovely good did they work work did they soften you up enough for you to give me an hour no but the message i got from my grandfather did i didnt realize our mothers went to college together a couple semesters im told mine went on to interior design and yours apparently went on to a variety of things my mother says that serena macgregor was interested in everything and still is i can meet you at two downtown would be best ive got some shopping to take care of two branson mused after lunch before dinner clever woman twos fine how about meeting me at the boston harbor hotel they serve a pretty great tea yes i know she looked down at the yogurt thought of rich creamy pastries her neglected stomach growled fine two oclock in the main lobby gwen was exactly on time a habit her cousin julia called her most irritating shed taken that long hot bubble bath which had done wonders for the stiffness in her neck and had paged through a paperback copy of die a fine death by branson maguire shed read it before but shed wanted to familiarize herself more with his style of writing before the meeting she would have given precisely the same review and thought with a patients history before treatment or an acquaintances personality before buying a gift she was a thorough and meticulous woman one who had graduated from medical school years before the norm and was now the youngest surgical resident to ever serve on the staff of boston memorial shed worked for it and she knew shed earned it there was no discounting the advantages shed grown up with her family was loving supportive generous they had backed her in every decision she made along the way she also understood that wealth the kind the macgregors could claim smoothed many bumps in many roads but it was the love of medicine the mystery the art the science of it that had sealed her destiny she wandered through the hotel lobby appreciating the grandeur the grace of the ornate coffered ceiling the huge urns filled with towering and exotic flowers the marble and the gilt and she looked branson thought as he stepped off the elevator and saw her like a rich mans collegeage daughter come to town shed changed into a tailored gray jacket and slacks and she had a black overcoat draped across her arm minimum and classic jewelry he observed heirloomquality locketstyle lapel pin small scallops of gold at her ears slim watch with black leather band she also looked alert refreshed and not nearly as fragile as she had the night before youre prompt he said as he walked to her yes an annoying habit of mine i like prompt women he took her arm and turned her toward the elevators wasting time should be saved for when it can be most enjoyed he used a small key to access a floor then turned to smile at her as the doors slid shut you look great got some rest id say he was wearing a soft navy sweatshirt arms shoved up to the elbows over dark jeans his hightop sneakers appeared to have seen many a mile thank you yes where are we going up to my suite her eyes deepened her lids lowered oh he had to laugh gwendolyn you really shouldnt be so trusting and naive people will take advantage relax he added before she could speak ive ordered tea well sit in the parlor its very conventional and its more convenient for me to take notes and avoid interruptions from hovering waiters no hidden agenda all right since i happen to be very hungry i thought you lived in boston i do he took her arm again to lead her off the elevator i live here the press figures its an eccentricity the writer living in a hotel what it really is is a highclass apartment building with daily maid service room service and a really quick turnover of tenants youve got a great smile why are you finally giving it to me my parents essentially lived in a hotel until after mac my oldest brother was born and they often still do both of my brothers live in hotels yearround and my younger sister amelia would if she could get away with it i dont consider the choice the least eccentric right id forgotten casinos vegas atlantic city new orleans europe your familys cost me some money indirectly theres nothing we enjoy more she waited for him to unlock one of a pair of wide double doors then walked into the spacious and smartly appointed parlor she noted the sleek little laptop with fullsize monitor attached on the end of the walnut dining room table there were stacks of books papers coffee cups id say this would be a very quiet and convenient place to work it does the job for now occasionally i get a lowgrade itch to buy a house mow a lawn paint some shutters it usually passes but i expect its going to stick one of these days if it does you should call my cousin julia shes an expert on real estate ah the first jule gwen angled her head yes the press dubbed her that when uncle alan was president she thought it was amusing even at seven julia had a welldeveloped sense of the ridiculous would have been a kick growing up in the white house lets see her brother dcs an artist then theres the lawyer cousins one of them just had a big splashy wedding last spring thats right are we here to discuss my family or your book just making small talk prickly he thought protective daniel likes to brag ive heard enough about his kids and grandkids that i feel as though i know them hes very proud of you i know gwens eyes softened again i tend to be defensive about my family another habit an attractive one thatll be food and drink he said when the bell sounded just make yourself at home she decided the most efficient place to sit was at the dining room table at the opposite end from his workstation she smiled at the roomservice waiter listened to branson joke with him argue goodnaturedly over some football game then watched a folded bill slide discreetly from bransons palm to the waiters how the guy can live in this great city and be a dallas cowboy fan is beyond my understanding branson lifted a bottle from an ice bucket champagne no just covering the bases he screwed it back into the tub of ice well put it back for another time dig in he swept a hand over the plates of sandwiches scones pastries you said you were hungry and you said you wanted to discuss your book with me she picked up the teapot poured two cups yeah okay so what ive got he began as he sat and piled something of everything on a plate is a psychopathic doctor lovely she is just a stunner she yeah i figure you dont see enough good female psychopaths today what i want to do is a kind of play on jekyll and hyde with a twist of black widow and lizzie borden he took a bite of a ladysize tea sandwich youre really perfect am i absolutely youve got the looks not just the beauty i mean the air of fragility the delicate bones the grace and the efficiency id been thinking of making her tall lush and deadly he continued his eyes slatecolored narrow and intense on gwens face but now i realize the contrast is better much i couldnt ask for a better prototype she decided to be amused rather than insulted for a psychopath yeah he grinned and his eyes went from cool to warm smoke do you mind i think im oddly flattered so your villain is a doctor a woman who heals with one hand and kills with the other there you go youre quick he slid forward a bit in his chair his fingers tapping idly on the edge of his plate shes absolutely in control knows exactly what shes doing she enjoys it the power of healing the thrill of destroying of course shes insane but thats a different level so if i made her a surgeon what would her life be like shed be older than you i dont want to complicate it by having her be a genius on top of everything else im not a genius im just a good student gwendolyn youre in med school at harvard years before youre old enough to drink in most states youre a genius live with it he reached for another sandwich as she blinked at him so how much pressure is she going to have to deal with as a female surgeon thats still primarily male territory right the boys club then theres the god complex that arrogance and ego that comes from having your hands inside the human body arrogance and ego youve got them i could see it when i watched you work on those kids yesterday you snap out an order it never occurs to you that it wont be obeyed immediately obeyed he saw it in his head again a perfectly cued loop of film you stride from one room to the next and people come to attention you dont notice because youre used to it you expect it i want that for her that expectation of absolute respect and obedience that confidence in herself while on the other hand shes boiling with rage and frustration you have much rage and frustration gwendolyn good lord he moved fast now or in general he beamed at her i really like your voice highclass frosty sex anyway what im after is the female take on what you have to do to get ahead in the field how you handle both the subtle and overt sexual harassments and advances on the job see i figure she moonlights mutilating men because she finds them inferior irritating obstructive and obnoxious her smile bloomed again coolly amused im beginning to like her good i want you to i want the reader to even while they cringe he piled more food on her plate as he spoke shes bright shes ambitious shes unapologetic a couple of the guys she takes out in the beginning are slime so that makes her more sympathetic then she gets into it gets to enjoy it a little too much thats when shell turn the corner and the demands the pressure the stress of constant lifeanddeath issues and decisions i figure thatll be what finally snaps the connection she has on her humanity gwen decided it was more productive to be amused and intrigued than to be annoyed she selected a watercress sandwich from the hodgepodge hed served her well the pressure is outrageous a number of good doctors wash out simply because they cant handle hospital work the vicious hours the miserable bureaucracy emergencies budget cuts interrupted personal lives she wont have much time for play unless shes very flexible im assuming shes on staff at a major boston hospital right he pulled a notebook over and began to scribble how many hours would she put in a week oh forty to a million he smiled at her put a gorgeous glossy chocolate éclair on her plate where the sandwich had been keep going the hour had run to ninety minutes before she remembered to look at her watch im running behind i have to go if im going to finish my christmas shopping before my shift finish its november im an obsessive overachiever she rose got her coat listen ill go with you shopping he was up helping her into her coat before she could do it for herself and if he took the opportunity to sniff her hair roll his eyes in approval over the top of her head she didnt know the difference i have excellent giftbuying taste and i can pick your brain some more while were at it then i can run over to the hospital with you another obsessive overachiever there you are i love my work he grabbed his coat took gwens arm again you know i was thinking of having her fall for scully they could have some pretty great sex complicate their lives break each others hearts he paused took a moment to study gwens face to enjoy it so do you think hes her type gwen cocked her head she knew a line when she heard one however cleverly it was delivered rough tough and cynical with an affection for poetry he might suit her and shell undoubtedly enjoy trying to kill him thats what i thought he slipped his hand down to hers linked their fingers and pulled her out the door chapter contents prev next so when am i going to meet him because she was cutting wrapping paper with a surgeons precision gwen didnt glance up who julia picked up a silver bow from the colorcoordinated piles gwen had stacked on the dining room table the guy whos good for you she briefly considered hauling out some of her own gifts and getting to work on them but it was only the sunday after thanksgiving and she was feeling lazy good for me gwen laid the shirt box on the paper neatly folded the edge of the wrap under then brought the sides up to overlap exactly one inch flower guy julia yawned and sipped her coffee branson after applying the tape gwen began to fold the first end you want to meet him well youve been seeing him for nearly three weeks and i havent even gotten a peek im not seeing him gwen turned the box around to deal with the other end im just helping him with some research julia sat back in her chair she adored gwen her innate tidiness of habit and mind her generosity of self her quiet humor her unshakable loyalty and her amazing lack of selfawareness hes very attractive hmm that wasnt a question ive seen his photo on the back of his books caught a couple of his interviews on the morning shows hes very attractive i wasnt going to disagree after a brief debate gwen decided on the red ribbon and began to calculate the proper length so youre not interested in him on a personal manwoman type level i havent thought about it gwen with an impatient sigh gwen set the ribbon aside im not interested in being interested and youre beginning to sound just like the macgregor julia grinned dark eyes dancing is that a compliment or an insult you know very well grandpad like nothing better than to see all of us married and raising a dozen children he thought he was sly at thanksgiving dinner all those questions about what boys we might be seeing boys she rolled her eyes then gave up and laughed hell never change whod want him to he was a little more specific with you ah gwennie love how are you getting on with my young writer friend a fine boy that branson clever brain and the irish know the value of family gwen shook her head and neatly tied the ribbon over the box hes obviously fond of branson he set you up no that was my first reaction but i realized id misjudged the situation its harmless julia opened her mouth then closed it with a snap okay if thats the way you want to look at it you ask me hed have pinned you to the wall over it if laura and royce hadnt announced they were expecting then he was too busy wiping his eyes making toasts slapping royce on the back and beaming to remember his plots gwen picked up a huge red bow and sighed were going to be aunties laura looked so happy didnt she yeah feeling a bit misty herself julia sniffled and a year ago she was telling herself and us that she wasnt the least bit interested in a relationship just like youre telling me youre not right now for heavens sake door julia bounced up grinning finish off that patient doc ill get it doesnt have a clue whats going on julia decided as she made her way through the house the woman could cut open and sew up people from morning to night list every bone in the body in alphabetical order diagnose a multitude of diseases conditions and traumas but she didnt know when she was becoming involved in a relationship julia opened the door and saw the other half of that relationship holding a glossy white bakery box doughnuts or danishes she demanded both well come right on in branson stepped inside studying with interest the curvy woman with wild red hair eyes the color of rich chocolate and skin as pure and smooth as top cream she was wearing a thick chenille robe in dizzying stripes and fuzzy bunny slippers branson maguire nice to meet you julia smiled and held out a hand that glittered with rings i recognized you julia macgregor nice to meet you branson took the long narrow hand in his i recognized you isnt that fun i like you already any man who shows up at the door at eleven oclock on a sunday morning with baked goods instantly becomes my friend how do you feel about bavarian cream with chocolate frosting my best friend gimme she snatched the box out of his hand take off your coat stay awhile i think i can find some coffee to go with these that was the plan i thought if dr dish was he broke off grimaced oops little slip dr dish julias eyes danced with delight i like it and since you brought me a few million calories it can be our little secret id appreciate it he laid his coat over the newel post is she around or do we get to eat all of those ourselves shes operating in the dining room this way great house he commented as they started down the hall its my favorite thats why we live here thats right you like to buy houses buy sell rehab restore you like to tell stories mmm they moved through a room with cozy sofas a small stone fireplace a large fluteedged bowl in bleeding blues and greens caught his eye had him stopping to take a closer look my mothers work fabulous shell have an interesting place in history wont she both as a brilliant artist and a dynamic first lady i really like you i did a report on your father when i was in high school he flashed a smile i aced it former president alan macgregor always had a strong stand on education hell be very pleased and because she was too julia took bransons hand and led him into the dining room look whos come bearing gifts she announced gwens head came up the scissors she had in her hand snapped closed oh the little lurch in her stomach surprised her as did the quick urge to fuss with her hair hello branson he brought us pastries so ive decided im in love with him ill get some coffee put these on a plate dont let him get away gwen i think i might want to keep him julia winked at branson and carried the box out into the kitchen actually i think i might be in love with your cousin too without waiting for the invitation he pulled out a chair and sat beside gwen well that was quick was there a faint edge of irritation in her voice branson wondered hoped dont you believe in love at first sight doc no that was a lie she believed in all manner of foolish things when it came to the heart why did you bring us pastries you dont eat unless someone supplies it idly he picked up a blue bow studied it and its my small way of thanking you for the time youve been giving me its very nice when he set the bow down in the pile of gold she automatically removed it and set it in its proper place and unnecessary it hasnt been any trouble his lips twitched deliberately now he picked up a red bow trouble or not its your time and youve been a lot of help he set red on green is the book going well she shifted the bow well enough he grinned when julia came back in with a tray holding a coffeepot cups and a dish piled with his pastries he signaled her by a wiggle of brows then moved silver ribbon onto the red that looks great julia tucked her tongue in her cheek as her cousin meticulously realigned ribbon youre telling me i hope you dont mind but ive already culled out my share to take upstairs ive got a few calls to make drop by anytime bran bring chocolate she gave him a thumbsup sign behind gwens back and sailed out so can i give you a hand with your wrapping no i have a system no kidding he poured the coffee himself and put a glossy cruller on a plate have some sugar i will just a second her focus was on exact alignment as she folded down the corners of the paper how was your thanksgiving noisy confusing greedy wonderful yours pretty much the same he watched her thumb slide over the paper form an edge as straight and sharp as a razor and found her intense concentration to detail utterly adorable im sorry about this gwendolyn but it just has to be done he put a hand on the back of her head angled it and brought his mouth to hers she didnt jerk barely stiffened but he felt her surprise deciding to use that to his advantage he brought his other hand to the edge of her cheek and slid it around her ear into the soft short gold of her hair she tasted fresh he thought like the first warm breeze in early spring hed wondered spent three weeks wondering and he had to ask himself why hed waited so long when she was just so perfect he coaxed her lips apart slipped inside the sound that hummed in his throat was pure approval this had to stop she told herself immediately oh god she felt dizzy hot helpless her blood pressure must be her pulse had to then his teeth scraped gently over her bottom lip and she didnt think at all sweet he murmured losing himself sweet gorgeous gwendolyn his hand slipped down so that his fingers could stroke over the back of her neck make her shiver what have we got here wait she put a hand to his chest surprised that his heart beat as fast as hers when hed seemed so much in control just wait i dont want to branson deepened the kiss before either of them could prepare for it he wanted to pull her down into his lap move his lips from hers to her throat from throat to shoulder and keep working his way down until he got to her toes i said wait she broke free fought for breath for composure for rationality we have an arrangement are you involved with someone else no thats not the point he only lifted his brows do you have a problem with mystery writers of irish extraction she raked a hand up through her hair causing it to spike like a sunflower dont be ridiculous do you consider kissing an unhealthy habit suspicious she slanted a look over at him youre making fun of me maybe of both of us and since ill take that for a no ill confess i think kissing you could become a habit he lifted a fingertip to trace her mouth while his cool gray eyes skimmed over her face im developing a thing for you a thing i havent figured out the definition yet but im working on it or maybe i should call it a condition youd relate to that his fingers trailed down to trace her jaw maybe youd help me explore it study it his eyes met hers curiosity gleamed in them youre nervous he realized with a jolt of surprise and pleasure i would have sworn you didnt have a nerve in your body with the things ive watched you do these past weeks you never flinch you never hesitate you never sag but youre nervous right now because im touching you and that gwendolyn is incredibly arousing thats enough abruptly she pushed back her chair sprang to her feet just stop it im not nervous i just dont want to pursue this now youre lying he chuckled when her eyes went dark with temper thats ticked you off and i cant blame you but the fact is when a woman melts in my arms the way you did a claim of indifference just doesnt ring true i didnt claim indifference gwen said coldly and made him laugh no youre right you didnt my mistake he took her hand ignoring her tugs for freedom the mouth that had so recently seduced her smiled arrogantly dont worry im not going to kiss you again until well until branson im busy gwendolyn im persistent and i want you it cant be the first time youve heard that it was the first time shed heard it delivered with a cocky grin and an overabundance of confidence she hated the fact that the combination excited her if you want me to continue helping you youre going to have to understand and acknowledge the conditions and restrictions no i dont i dont like conditions and restrictions you arrogant insufferable guilty youre afraid im going to seduce you he declared because we both know now that i can well just hold off on that a bit if her voice had been frosty before it now dipped to subzero if you think im a pushover an easy mark you couldnt be more mistaken i dont think anything of the kind i think youre incredibly strong even valiant im amazed by you every day youre selling yourself short if you think the only reason i want you is because you have beautiful eyes and a wonderful body i she lifted her hands let them fall youve succeeded in confusing me thats a start why dont i let you think it over for a while since thats what youre going to do anyway ill see you at the hospital later she let herself relax again nodded yes all right he caught her face in his hands pressed a firm brief kiss to her mouth i guess that will have to hold me until then he told her and strolled out chapter contents prev next she was back on the day shift the first week in december over the years gwen had learned to adjust her body clock as her schedule demanded when it was time to sleep she slept and slept deeply when it was time to wake she woke and woke quickly since she decided to follow her grandmother into medicine into surgery shed allowed nothing to distract her family and work were the focus of her life everything else was incidental including men including she told herself firmly branson maguire hed been conspicuously absent for three days shed decided that hed gathered enough information and atmosphere that her help was no longer necessary and shed concluded that her lack of encouragement for a personal involvement had finally penetrated his undoubtedly hard head she was determined not to be disappointed by that fact carefully she continued suturing a threeinch gash on the calf of a patient who had had a nasty meeting with a tree i was really moving down the hill he told her looking anywhere but at the sterile field and the needle just thought id take the sled for a test run before my kids hogged it he winced at the tug on his flesh guess im a little old for sledding youve just got to watch out for those trees jumping in the way when the door opened and branson walked in her stomach shimmied she completed the next suture without a tremor youre not allowed in here she said mildly i wont get in your way he walked over to look down at the wound ouch he said with a sympathetic smile youre telling me bled like a son of a bitch hold still mr renekee were nearly done here sorry say you look familiar he said to branson seizing on the distraction people are always saying that to me he pulled up a metal folding chair and sat companionably so howd you end up having the prettiest surgeon in boston sew you up ah renekee glanced at gwen noted she remained focused on him it was me a flexible flyer and a tree the tree won its a great day for sledding and if you had to lose to a tree you couldnt do better than dr blade tell me since youve gotten to know her a little bit what do you think i have to do to get her to have dinner with me tonight well i branson go away she didnt blush but embarrassment was a hot little ball in her stomach just a nice quiet dinner he continued she forgets to eat so im just thinking about her health that could work renekee decided enjoying himself you know a doctor proper nutrition that sort of thing exactly wine in moderation of course candlelight restful on the eyes a relaxing meal after a long day its all a matter of taking care of yourself dont make me call security branson mr renekee im going to dress this now youll want to keep it dry ill give you a list of instructions and you need to come back in a week to ten days to have the sutures removed shes got great hands doesnt she branson commented i tell you if i needed stitches i wouldnt have anyone else touch me you know i was thinking of this french place they do some really impressive flaming desserts do you think dr blade would go for that my wife sure would and im sure shes a very discerning woman how about it doc youre done here mr renekee gwen shoved back in her chair wheeling it over to a table and selecting a printout of instructions for caring for sutures id stay off flexible flyers for a while yeah thanks he took the sheet smiled at her you ought to give him a break he told her and walked out i am not having you distract me or my patients while im working incensed and working her way toward being outraged gwen stripped off gloves and gown you are not to enter treatment or examining rooms unless you require treatment or examination and you will most certainly not hit on me while im on duty he couldnt have stopped the grin if he wanted to her voice was all new england frost is it any wonder i cant get you out of my head she made a strangled sound and tossed her gloves away do you require treatment or examination darling if you want to play doctor he stopped himself this time after all there were a lot of sharp implements close at hand okay bad joke ive been working around the clock for the past couple of days when i came up for air you were the first thing that came to mind i figure theres a reason for that and id like to take you to dinner i have plans flexible or inflexible an inflexible hospital fundraiser ill go with you i have an escort an escort he didnt know whether to chuckle over the term or snarl over the idea of her going out with another man sounds tedious greg is a friend an associate and a very charming man who she could admit privately defined the term tedium now if youll excuse me i have work how about breakfast she had to close her eyes branson do you really think im going to give up because some guy named greg is escorting you to a hospital fundraiser she tried a new tack giving him a slow challenging smile perhaps i intend to have breakfast with greg there was a little flare of something directly under his heart quickly banked now youre trying to make me mad okay forget breakfast whens your break why we can run over to my hotel have a quick bout of hot sex and i can get it out of my system youre driving me crazy she surprised them both by laughing take two prozac call me in the morning and go away she started for the door did you mean the callyouinthemorning part she shot a glance over her shoulder and let the door swing in his face all right gwendolyn branson thought as he rocked back on his heels he was just going to have to start playing dirty pull out the big guns and he knew just where to find the big guns a light wet snow was falling in hyannis port it coated the grand old trees that graced the sloping lawn of the castle the macgregor had built branson loved the house with its gleaming stone its elegant windows and its fanciful turrets hed often wondered how he could work it into a book what murder or mayhem would bring the worldweary scully to such a place he mused or as it was for his creator would it be a woman that drew him here a woman branson admitted who was definitely under his skin on his mind and beginning to sneak into his heart hed always figured if he fell for a woman it would come in an explosion of recognition of certainty of passion lust and madness but this was a nagging tug a gentle pull that was drawing him slowly along from basic attraction and into unexplored territory a mystery he thought as he climbed the steps to the great front door with the prideful crest of the macgregors he couldnt resist a mystery needed to pick it apart layer by layer until he found the core if he was indeed falling for gwen he needed to be sure to compile the facts as well as the emotions and damn it he needed a little cooperation it didnt surprise him that anna answered herself or that she looked lovely and trim her dark eyes warmed with pleasure her fine hands reached out for him branson how wonderful daniel will be just delighted i was hoping he wasnt here so that i could convince you to leave him and run off with me to barcelona she laughed and kissed his cheek get your hands off my wife you irish dog his grin fierce and deadly daniel macgregor wide of build and huge of voice descended the grand stairs barcelona is it you think im deaf as well as blind coming around flirting with my wife right under my nose caught well youre a better man than i macgregor to have caught and held such a woman all these years ha pleased daniel caught branson in a bear hug with an energy branson managed to think as the wind rushed out of him that belied more than ninety years of living that silver tongue of yours saved you again come in and sit well have us a drink tea anna said firmly angling her head at her husband he rolled his bright blue eyes anna the boys driven from boston on a cold snowy day hell want whiskey hell get tea and so will you go into the parlor branson ill be right along i tell you a man cant get a whiskey in this house anymore until the sun sets and then hes lucky if he gets more than two fingers with that woman around he had his arm around bransons shoulders propelling him into the parlor with its roaring fire gleaming antiques and artfilled walls tea will do me branson told him i want both our heads clear for the matter ive come to discuss the day a glass of whiskey clouds my brain or that of a good irishman is a dark day in the world daniel sat stretched out his long legs stroked his soft white beard a matter to discuss you say it was the gleam in the twinkling blue eyes that clinched it you know it took me a while to realize that gwendolyn was right with her first instincts gwen all innocence daniel folded his big hands ah thats right shes been helping you a bit with your story and how is that going the help or the story whichever both the storys going very well and shes been a tremendous help so far good good a bright girl my gwennie diamondbright takes after her grandmother a woman you seem to have more than a decent affection for you old meddler branson murmured go by the hospital lad gwens just the one you need daniel smiled broadly hed never thought branson maguire slow if he had daniel would never have picked him for his granddaughter and wasnt she branson sat back and what do you think shed have to say to your scheme do you think shed thank you for dumping me at her feet id say that depended on you what have you done daniel anna wheeled the tea tray in herself shooting her husband an exasperated look nothing ive done nothing at all hes matched me up with your granddaughter branson told her rising to see to the tray himself gwendolyn daniel anna lifted her chin didnt we discuss this type of thing didnt we agree that you would not interfere in the childrens lives its not interfering to see that gwen is introduced to a fine young man like branson here its interest its meddling branson finished and poured tea for anna and i appreciate it its not meddling to daniel broke off and his eyes went shrewd there you see he appreciates it and why shouldnt he a beautiful girl like our gwen smart tidy loving good bloodline you neednt list her virtues branson said dryly and poured a cup for daniel and i hope youll resist listing whatever you consider mine to her and messing this up before ive got it started got it started daniel thumped a fist on the arm of his chair youve had the best part of a month already youre dragging your feet daniel patience anna warned herself surely after a lifetime with the man she had accumulated a mountain range of patience leave him alone if i leave him alone itll be the next century before he comes up to the mark thats why im here see daniel thumped his fist again this time in triumph then he frowned what do you mean your granddaughter isnt cooperating cooperating daniel rolled his eyes well why arent you charming her romancing her do you need it written down boy what a man needs to do to court a woman branson shifted in his chair courting is perhaps the wrong term oh is it those blue eyes became sharp deadly and just what is the term you had in mind when it comes to my granddaughter i dont have one exactly branson held up a hand for peace im very attracted to her im very interested in her what the hell he thought he was among friends im halfway in love with her whats wrong with the other half this time anna only laughed oh he is never satisfied well what the devil good is halfway about anything its far enough for me until i see if shes even going to catch up ive gone a long time without having my heart broken branson told daniel and im hoping to keep it that way my point is you havent gotten to where you are without being an expert at the art of a deal without being able to read people judge their strengths and weaknesses and i know you love your family so you had to consider the pros and cons before you decided id suit gwendolyn theres a smart lad anna is it any wonder im so fond of him dont get too excited branson warned i havent decided if well suit yet but he added before daniel could explode i want very much to explore the possibility since youve known gwendolyn he calls her gwendolyn daniel said misting up a little see how he calls her by her full name anna the romance in it hush daniel anna murmured because indeed she had youve known her all her life branson continued ive only had a few weeks so how about a little insider information some pointers she respects honesty anna said with a telling look from man to man im not planning on being dishonest a dimple winked charmingly as branson smiled im planning on taking advantage of a situation already in place the girl needs to be swept off her feet daniel claimed she was always one for fairy tales she needs to stand on her own feet anna corrected gwen prides herself on her strength and independence she needs moonlight and roses and wooing she needs integrity partnership and respect branson blew out a breath well this is all very helpful then he shook his head in confusion as both anna and daniel burst into laughter did i miss the joke you werent a gleam in your fathers eye nor your father a gleam in his fathers daniel said reaching for annas hand so youve missed it right enough i told you gwen took after her grandmother and so she does the things weve said gwen needs are what she needs just as lovely anna whitfield demanded them sixty years ago from a clumsy scotsman who fell madly in love the minute he saw her in a rosecolored dress at the donahues summer ball and though it took quite a bit of work she murmured i managed to get them all from him and more just be yourself branson and let her be what she is thats how you start gwen profoundly grateful that shed insisted on taking her own car pulled into her drive at midnight if she had ever in the whole of her life spent a more boring evening shed have to have been comatose she didnt object to hospital functions she didnt object to greg but the combination of the two of them in one endless evening had been a study in tedium and if his hand found its way up her leg under the table one more time the surgeon would have required surgery she imagined branson would have made pithy whispered comments about the pompous speeches and have made her struggle not to laugh and lose dignity hed have had plenty to say about the lukewarm and rubbery chicken kiev shed pretended to eat and theyd probably have danced rather than discussed laser surgery for ninety minutes before she finally made her excuses and escaped why was she thinking about branson she shook herself climbed out of the car she hadnt wanted to be with him either what shed really wanted was to be home curled up in front of the fire with a nice brandy and a good book since it was too late for that shed settle for a warm bed and oblivion she was almost at the door before she saw the little potted tree sitting on the stoop in the porch light baffled she crouched down stared at the little stuffed bird attached to a branch from which golden silk pears dripped since the attached card carried her name she tugged it free and ripped it open consider this the first day of christmas bran hed sent her a partridge in a pear tree gwen thought and pressing the card to her breast sighed hugely how incredibly sweet she skimmed her finger over one of the glossy pears and set it swinging smiled foolishly at the colorful plump bird and realized with a suddenness that had her sitting down hard beside the silly little tree that she was in deep and serious trouble chapter contents prev next gwen walked out of or three rubbing cramps out of her fingers the surgery had been long and complicated but shed been pleased to be allowed to assist shed spent the past ten hours on her feet and figured if she was lucky she could clock out shortly and leave the hospital on a high note she saw branson waiting in the corridor and decided the odds of that high note had just improved they told me you were up here sewing some guy back together assisting she corrected but sewing him back togethers close thirtysixyearold man who was very very careless with a chain saw ouch i think hes going to keep his arm she rolled her neck as she pushed the button for the elevator dr merit is the best in the state i dont know anyone else who could have done what he did in there the massive blood loss and trauma the muscle and nerve damage and the patient wasnt the best candidate for a long surgery a good hundred pounds overweight but he could very well be swinging a chain saw to cut down his christmas tree next december did you get yours yet our tree she stepped out into the er relieved that it seemed to be quiet this weekend she took a quick look at the board saw she wasnt needed im going to grab some coffee youre off shift arent you in ten minutes she swung into the lounge headed straight for the pot i didnt think youd be by today i had a few things to deal with he pulled a box out of his pocket heres one of them with the pot in her hand gwen stared at the pretty silver box and bow branson you have to stop this why you cant keep giving me presents why he grinned at her you liked the others and ive got a theme going here the pear tree she thought the lovely little brooch of two turtledoves the silly trio of china hens and four ridiculous chirping plastic windup birds she adored all of them when your theme hits nine dancing ladies youre going to be in trouble ive got plans for that come on open it up he took the pot from her handed her the box then poured two cups himself she was charmed and they both knew it he heard her helpless little sigh as she took off the lid and saw the long chain with five rings intricately braided into it how do you manage this patience determination persistence he set the cups down here let me put it on for you he took the necklace out and draped it over her head where it glowed against her dull green scrubs quite a fashion statement she ran a hand down the chain i shouldnt take it of course you should you want it of course i want it she said with a hint of exasperation its lovely and its charming it made no sense they barely knew each other shed given him no encouragement he simply wasnt the next step shed planned for her life why are you doing this she demanded because ive still got that thing for you he leaned down brushed his lips to hers adoring that mix of confusion and annoyance in her eyes and it seems to be spreading why dont you change into something a little less intimidating and well go out he slid his arms around her waist try that candlelight dinner this time im not dressed for dinner you look wonderful lovely perfect he could feel her hesitate soften sway toward surrender i want to be with you gwendolyn i want to make love with you i cant remember wanting anything quite so much and there are a great many things ive wanted she felt herself sliding into the kiss into him before she could stop herself ive barely had time to catch my breath since you walked into my life dont catch it he said suddenly fiercely impatient let it go and come with me his mouth demanded now possessed severing any thought of protest the thrill whipped through her as he dragged her into the heat under the dark for gods sake gwendolyn let me touch you i want she had her hands on his face threaded her fingers through his dark blond hair fisted them i want you im not being coy or playing games she eased back so that she could meet his eyes it was vital to her to be honest and to be logical i havent wanted anyone else enough to let them touch me it took a moment for his head to separate itself from the storm rising in his body a moment to cool the mind and understand what she was telling him untouched innocent she was the fairy princess after all instinctively he gentled his hold you cant possibly know how much that means i dont want to hurt you im not afraid of that she stepped back pushed a hand through her hair im a doctor i her eyes narrowed when he chuckled what are you laughing at some matters may have to do with the anatomy dr dish but nothing at all to do with medicine doctor what you heard me lord but it was a pleasure in itself to shock her and believe me you wont be thinking like a doctor when i make love with you i havent said you will yet she told him evenly the cocksure grin and allmale ego irritated her enough to have her regain some balance and if you continue to find my lack of experience in this particular area so amusing i dont find your lack of experience in this area amusing at all i find it erotic unspeakably erotic and id like to exchange the dinner for a late supper very late i want to spend a great deal of time giving you he reached out closed his hand over the chain and tugged her closer all manner of experiences in this particular area i havent decided she began and felt a gush of relief as her beeper sounded excuse me she stepped back angled the beeper she wore on her hip so that she could read the code turning she pushed through the doors and hunted up the chief resident on duty good blade i saw you hadnt clocked out weve got a driveby gunshot wounds chest and abdomen twelveyearold male eta two minutes branson watched her transform in front of his eyes from an aroused and irritated woman to cold and sturdy steel she moved fast heading for the heavy double doors even as the sound of sirens punched through the quiet the paramedics hustled the boy in on a gurney with gwen rushing beside them filing away the shouted information on vital signs and treatment that they snapped out at her she yanked on gloves and gown while a nurse strapped goggles over her eyes in seconds her hands were covered in blood the kid wore a bruins line jacket branson noted black hightops a man and woman rushed into the room behind the gurney both of them crying both of them shouting demands pleas questions you cant be in here gwen snapped out as she slid the endotracheal tube into place we have to help him now wallace she ordered jerking her head at an orderly get me six units of oneg stat he needs whole blood hell be all right wont he be all right the woman fought against the orderly on the way to the door he was just walking home from a friends he was just walking home my baby scotty the smell of grief and terror hung in the air overriding even the blood scottys in good hands now wallace said as he urged the parents away from the door dr blades the best you have to let her do her job her hands moved quickly her mind remained cold a stream of blood shot out striking her across the breasts weve got a pumper clamp bps dropping im losing the pulse she ordered ivs tests a type and crossmatch on the victims blood her words punched the air even as her hands fought to heal but in her mind in the cold clear logic of it she already knew it was useless irrigate this i cant see what the hell i found the exit wound somebody get out and push for the pictures i want to know how many bullets went into this boy come on scotty come on stay with me she fought for him sweat sliding down her back unnoticed her eyes were fierce and warriorbright sometimes she knew death could be beaten or if not beaten cheated so much damage in such a small body but she didnt allow herself to think of that only to focus on each step each need each answer time sped by with gowned staff rushing in and out of the doors when he coded she never broke rhythm lets zap him now she snatched the pediatric paddles waited for the tone clear his body jerked but his heart didnt respond again come on damn it come on with the second shock the monitor registered the beat slow sinus rhythm get him a bolus of epi thats the way it was only the two of them now in her mind just the two of them challenging the inevitable just a little longer is or ready for him standing by bp dropping no pulse she swore now and hitched herself onto the table to straddle him bag him hurry up she ordered as she began cpr were losing him his hair was glossy black curls he had the face of a sleeping angel gwen ordered herself not to notice not to think just to act i need another two units of blood get it in him lets go move lets get him upstairs they shoved the gurney through the doors with gwen still atop it working the boys chest even as the parents rushed up tried to cling to the gurney she never took her eyes off the boys face the last glimpse branson had was of the fierce determination in her eyes before the elevator doors closed and when they opened more than two hours later he saw her eyes again and the boys death in them gwendolyn she only shook her head she walked past him to the lobby desk very deliberately she picked up her charts completed her notations and clocked out she said nothing simply walked into the lounge and to her locker im sorry branson said from behind her it happens he was gone when they brought him in he was gone when the bullet cut into his heart she pulled off her scrubs took out a wool blazer you shouldnt have waited branson im too tired to socialize tonight im going home ill take you ive got my car she took out her coat her purse im not leaving you alone when youre churned up this way im not churned up this is hardly the first patient ive lost or the last i will lose she shrugged into her coat found her gloves in the pocket where she had tucked them hours before we did everything we could we used all of the skills available to us thats all we can do her fingers were numb and stiff as she pushed open the door he waited until they were outside until the light snow whirled around them and clung to her hair im driving you home leave me alone she shoved his hand from her arm rounded on him the pressure in her chest was hideous unbearable im perfectly capable of driving myself anywhere i want to go i dont want you i dont need you i dont appalled at herself she stopped pressed her fingers to her eyes im sorry im so sorry no please she shook her head quickly before he could touch her again i need to walk he slipped his hands into his pockets then well walk chapter contents prev next the breeze was brisk the snow a whirl of white flakes in silence they walked toward the river with the sound of traffic a steady whoosh streetlights gleamed christmas bulbs glowed on the near corner a streetside santa rang his bell monotonously as pedestrians hustled by christmas gwen thought was a time for childrens laughter for family for secrets and for joys but to fate if one believed in it one day one season was the same as the next you cant let it inside you gwen said at length her hands were so cold and so tired she tucked them in her pockets instead of taking the effort to pull on her gloves if you do you lose your edge you start to doubt yourself your instincts your abilities then the next time the next patient youre not focused you cant let it in i know that but if you dont let any of it inside you you lose your humanity what makes you care enough to fight the next time for the next patient its a difficult line gwen murmured in response no matter how straight you try to walk it you end up teetering over one side or the other at any point she stopped to look out over the water she loved this place this city with its insane traffic its lovely old buildings its graceful waterways she loved its history and its pride but just now she found no comfort in it it was part of a world that could be cold and cruel to the defenseless i didnt want to lose him in my head i knew would the minute i saw how badly he was damaged but sometimes you get a miracle and sometimes you dont she closed her eyes grateful that branson said nothing that he understood she needed to get it out i can take it i can take the hours the stress the pressure i wanted it i trained for it i can take the paperwork the bureaucracy the rude patients the drug addicts and the selfabusers i can take the wasted lives you see so many of them you almost stop noticing and then suddenly her voice shuddered and she pressed her fingers to her eyes he was only twelve years old he spoke now saying the only thing there was to say you did everything you could do that doesnt seem to matter when its not enough you know better than that he turned her to face him could think of nothing but her as he watched a tear spill out of those soft lavender eyes how many lives did you save today this week this year i know when i see people in pain or distress that i can fix it most of the time i can fix it or at least help and you do he said quietly whatever it takes out of you thats what you do thats what i need to do and i know that sometimes no matter what you do or how hard a team works youll lose thats rational thats real and still pan of me just cant accept it i know that only this morning that little boy got out of bed ate his breakfast maybe he ran for the school bus and daydreamed in class then because he walked down the wrong street at the wrong moment his life is over everything he might have done wont be done she turned to walk again i had to call it she continued he was my patient and i had to call it you have to decide to accept the moment when theres nothing else to be done you look at the clock and note the time then its over i had to go out and tell his parents gwendolyn what you do is courageous its miraculous he took her hands rubbing and warming them instinctively what you feel is courageous and miraculous he brought her hands to his lips it takes my breath away with a sigh she let herself be gathered close let her head rest on his chest im sorry i snapped at you before shh he lowered his lips to her hair here she thought was comfort a man to lean on needing him she lifted her head found his mouth with hers and soothed herself the warmth he gave back eased the ache smoothed the raw edges branson she tried to smile when he brushed tears from her cheeks with his thumbs if you want me ill come with you now his stomach muscles knotted tight the hand on her cheek stilled and with an effort he made it slide down to stroke her shoulder of course i want you but i cant ask you to come with me now but she closed her eyes when he pressed his lips to her brow you inspire me to play by certain rules youre shaky and youre vulnerable it would be easy to convince myself id be comforting you taking your mind off things wouldnt you be id also be taking advantage of the moment i wont do that with you couldnt do that with her he realized because he wanted much more than just the moment with her i dont understand you i thought youd prefer having the advantage not this way our first time together isnt going to happen because youre unhappy or feeling grateful because i listened when i touch you when you let me it wont have anything to do with anything but the two of us if youre being careful because i havent been with a man before im being careful because its you you matter gwendolyn he touched his lips to hers again you very much matter thats why im going to see that you have dinner then im taking you home and if necessary ill tuck you into bed myself to make sure you sleep now she did smile i dont need to be taken care of branson i know thats what makes taking care of you so appealing tonight im not going to give you any choice in the matter youre cold he added and slipped an arm around her shoulder before walking back toward the hospital i appreciate the gesture but im all right now and i do have my own car so you need to eat im not hungry youll eat he said simply just as he caught sight of the little restaurant a half block from the hospital right here is just what you need solid simple american food the service is surly here and the food quality spotty good thatll add a bit of adventure into it his hair glinted gold in the dark as he swung her toward the door dr blade i believe were about to have our first date she looked up at him as he pulled open the heavy smokedglass door scents and warmth rushed out over her foolishly garish christmas balls dangled from the ceiling and cheered her all right why not they were three deep at the bar and voices were a flood of noise in the overheated room she didnt hear what branson said to the hostess but she did see a folded bill pass from his hand to hers and they were seated in the dining section in a comer booth in under ninety seconds this isnt the kind of place where you bribe the maitre d gwen told him as she slid over the worn leather seat worked didnt it his dimple winked you needed to sit down and you needed to do it as far away from the meat market in there as possible its a popular singles spot she said and let her head rest against the high seat a lot of the hospital staff comes here to flirt or cruise for action she laughed at his lifted brow and no i dont come in often because i rarely have the energy to flirt or cruise it wouldnt hurt my feelings if you put a little effort into the first part of that tonight he took gwens hand firmly in his and looked up as the waitress wandered over well order drinks and dinner now he told her and rattled off his choice of wine appetizers and entrees while the waitress scrambled to pull out her pad medium rare on the steak he repeated and well need a bottle of mineral water for the table what did you say your name was crystal she muttered brows knit as she noted down his order crystal wed appreciate it if youd snag a basket of rolls from the kitchen when you bring the drinks by the ladys had a rough day and shes tired youd know how long rough days go he beamed at her looking so sympathetic that crystals irritated scowl smoothed away ill say i do sure ill take care of that for you i gwen waited until the waitress walked off then drew in a breath branson did you just order for me without consulting me it wont become a habit he said easily your brain is tired and its too overworked to be asked to make decisions you need relaxation red meat and time to recharge im providing them and to show my hearts in the right place next time we have dinner you can order for me really she smiled blandly how do you feel about sweetbreads he grimaced i could probably live my entire life happily without sampling internal organs remember that the next time you decide what im going to have for dinner deal whens your next day off ive got a half day saturday and all of sunday will you go out with me saturday night you pick the when you pick the where she arched a brow the marriage of figaro is playing at the conservatory how do you feel about opera i feel very warmly toward opera she blinked twice you do its rewarding to surprise you occasionally he smiled up at the waitress thanks crystal he took a roll out of the basket broke it in two and buttered it before passing half to gwen and im particularly fond of mozart ill pick you up at seven well have a late supper afterward if that suits you yes i suppose it would good then id like you to stay with me let me make love with you and id like you to sleep with me and have a very late very indulgent breakfast in bed sunday morning if that suits you she swallowed bread chased it with the sparkling water hed poured into her glass yes she managed i suppose it would let me see julia demanded the moment gwen stepped into the house oh i wish i could have gone shopping with you laura gwens back and shes got shopping bags is laura here raiding the refrigerator of course julia grabbed a bag and hurried with it into the parlor she claims royce dragged her out this morning to shop for baby things and that she finally pleaded exhaustion what did they buy nothing yet apparently they just mooned id love to have seen royce mooning over bassinets we whittled it down to three choices laura stepped in scooping up spaghetti from a bowl but were having a major style clash over cribs gwen dropped onto a chair across from the heavily decorated christmas tree and curled up her legs you dont look the least exhausted she said accusingly if anything she thought her cousin radiated vitality and health lauras dark eyes shone her golden skin glowed im not but he was making noises about scouting for electronics and i escaped well im exhausted gwen rubbed the bottom of one foot drawing in a deep satisfied breath she smelled pine and cinnamon and sizzling apple wood she smelled home serves me right for waiting until the eleventh hour to look for a new dress i didnt need a new dress you certainly did which i pointed out to you julia dived into the first bag a major date deserves a major dress thats the wrong bag oh julia tucked her tongue in her cheek as she separated tissue paper and drew out a lacy pink gaiter belt id say that depended on your point of view im always running my panty hose gwen began i thought it would be more practical if i then she laughed shrugged all right i wanted to knock his socks off believe me when he gets a load of you in this hes not going to be wearing socks or anything else for long julia slipped out the matching bra a tiny white rosebud decorated its front hook oh honey youll destroy him laura set her bowl down sat on the arm of gwens chair hes the one i want him to be anyone who sends you seven crystal swans would be hard to resist hell be here in a couple hours julia began why dont you hang around and get a load of him i would but i have a hot date with my husband come on gwen lets see the dress all right but remember i spent four hours hunting it down so be kind she took the box out of the shopping bag and rising opened it to pull out a long velvet column in deep rose velvet its beautiful julia murmured you dont think its too much with the jeweled band at the neck and cuffs i think its perfect for you laura reached out to run her fingertips over the smooth material classic elegant its not terribly sexy i tried to find something with a little more less i guess but i kept coming back to this its plenty sexy julia disagreed high neck long snug sleeves the drape to the ankles hell wonder just whats going on under it then when he finds out well you know cpr so hell probably live through it are you nervous laura wanted to know no gwen smiled carefully folding the dress in the tissue again its the right time its the right man its just right now im going to go up and indulge in an incredibly long bubble bath and spend twice as long as necessary on my makeup and hair she gathered up her bags and left the room are you sure about this guy laura asked julia once gwen had headed up the stairs im telling you hes crosseyed over her and hes the first man to ever put that foolish look on her face yeah it is nice to see her look dreamy feeling lazy and content laura stretched her arms where did the macgregor find him old family connection gwen doesnt think grandpa pulled the strings with a laugh laura picked up her bowl again foolish woman he always pulls the strings she cocked her head and you know jules if she ends up in a serious relationship with this man grandpa picked out for her hes going to turn all his attention on you before much longer im on to him julia smiled smugly and for her own amusement picked up a windup santa that looked strikingly like daniel with a few quick twists of the wrist she had him hohohoing forewarned pal she said to santa is forearmed laura snorted at the smug knowing grin on the cheery and bearded face before grinning at her cousin you go right on believing that at precisely seven oclock gwen started down the stairs she felt calm steady relaxed the diamonds her parents had given her when she graduated from med school shot fire at her ears and gave her confidence the froth she wore under the quietly elegant gown made her feel female secretive and amused she laid her wrap over the newel post just as the doorbell rang and her steady system took a quick shuddering leap as she opened the door and saw branson in a formal tux with a spray of white roses in his arms oh how lovely wait he stood just where he was and simply looked at her you are perfect gwendolyn you leave me breathless then i wont tell you how hard i worked at it she smiled took the roses from him i want to put these in water before we go you dont mind waiting no he took her hand and with his eyes on hers lifted it to his lips i dont mind waiting chapter contents prev next the parlor of bransons hotel suite was filled with white roses just opening their fragile petals white candles already softening the air with delicate light and scent a small table was tucked under the window where the drapes were drawn wide to allow the city to twinkle behind the glass silver and crystal gleamed against white linen gwens heart gave a long long sigh do you have elves she murmured just a very efficient hotel staff he slipped her wrap from her shoulders i called just before we left the theater so they could have everything set up youve gone to a lot of trouble no i havent setting scenes is something i enjoy he set her wrap aside lifted her hand to press his lips to the palm and i did this for both of us of course i ordered food without consulting you i think i can let that slide this time cold dishes so we wont have to worry about it are you hungry or should we just work on the champagne for a while champagne sounds perfect perfect is exactly what i want for you tonight he took a single rosebud from the table handed it to her before lifting the bottle of wine from the silver ice bucket the first time i saw you i thought of a ballet efficiently choreographed she angled her head smiling a little at the muffled pop of the cork dancers are much more sturdy than many people think the best are strong dedicated tireless you also made me think of fairies and storybook princesses he handed her the wine also stronger and more resilient than most people think still its difficult not to want to rescue and cherish a princess what would you rescue me from branson for a night one night from reality he touched his glass to hers to fairy tales and happy endings all right she sipped letting the wine bubble excitedly on her tongue but this is real and i dont need to be rescued from it or want to be rescued from it you dont have to seduce me branson im here because i want to be here because i want you seducing you gwendolyn is my very great pleasure he touched a hand to her cheek and lowered his mouth to hers for a quiet kiss she wasnt nervous not yet and he wanted her to be he wanted to watch those wonderful eyes go dark with nerves with needs with knowledge he would layer by layer slide away the practical until he uncovered the romantic she hid inside it was the romantic he would awaken and pleasure and cherish when he found her he would give her everything he had everything he was here he plucked a strawberry from a bowl swirled it into white chocolate taste she opened her mouth as he brought the berry to her lips let the mixture of textures and flavors linger on her tongue its wonderful have more he fed her small bites slipping nibbling kisses between samples and felt her first small shudder youve only to tell me what you like when you want more when you want less still touching only her face he deepened the kiss degree by aching degree when youre ready for all im not fragile but her voice shook he was taking her somewhere shed never been and the first steps were dizzying you dont need to worry not fragile perhaps but precious he took her glass from her unsteady fingers set it aside his eyes were dark and intense in hers and mine tonight her heart did a slow spin in her chest when he lifted her into his arms perhaps it was foolish but the image slipped into her head of a knight armor glinting silver in the sun lifting her astride his white stallion her lips curved as she pressed them to his throat youre overwhelming me i want to i need to the bed was turned down the rose petals strewn over it made her heart stutter candles burned here as well soft shifting light theres no time here he told her when he set her on her feet beside the bed no world but this one no one but us only you gwendolyn and me she believed him this world hed created for her was the only reality she wanted or needed tonight she lifted her arms wound them around him and let herself slide into it into him his mouth was patient persuasive possessive one moment teasing the next she swayed dizzy from the onslaught and the fragile scent of roses and candle wax swirled in her head touch me as if shed spoken it his hands skimmed up her sides cruising over velvet tracing curves more still more his mouth traveled down her throat nuzzling gently to where the jeweled band circled and slowly inch by inch he drew the zipper down her back for the first sampling of flesh silk beneath velvet he thought and already warm it was no effort for him to take care to take time desire for her was an equal match with his need to give he turned her until his mouth could savor the wonderful line the back of her neck the slope of her shoulder when her arm lifted hooked around him his blood took a quick hard leap but his mouth remained patient his hands gentle she shivered arched backward when his hands cupped her breasts when his thumbs brushed the swell and curve of them their moans mixed when he eased the gown from her shoulders and it slipped down to pool at her feet god hed never expected to find such a fantasy beneath hed prepared himself for her body the wonder of it the punch of desire but the pink silk slip the froth of lace had his fingers flexing hard on her shoulders as he turned her to face him again that sudden leap of lust in those smoky eyes had her heart slamming into her ribs when his gaze left hers traveled slowly down she felt her skin go hot her head go light i wanted to surprise you she managed then took an instinctive step back as those eyes nearly black now whipped back to hers there was something not quite civilized in them she was all pink and white like something deliciously forbidden behind thin glass he wanted to smash the barrier and ravish plunder devour he yanked a choke chain on desire and skimmed fingertips only over the subtle swell just above pink silk you stagger me how could he touch her so gently and look at her with such simmering violence her hand trembled as she loosened his tie fumbled a bit as she undid his studs i want to see you there were the nerves he thought tiny fears flickering in her eyes even as she stood her ground and seeing them feeling the tremor of those skilled hands he tumbled the rest of the way into love look at me he murmured when she spread the formal white shirt apart i want to see your eyes when i touch you i want to see what you feel when my hands are on you like this he ran his hand over her skin above the sheer stocking her eyes went wide and her breath caught in her throat as he unsnapped the front garter youre shivering i want you to he flicked the next garter free and more than anything i want surrender he eased her onto the bed covered her body with his his mouth crushed down on hers giving her hints of dark and dangerous needs hotblooded urgency then it gentled leaving her confused and unsteady if the first steps into this world hed created for her had been dizzying these were staggering his lips traveled down savoring flesh his hands traveled up caressing it a sharp lance of heat stabbed her pleasure coated pain as he took possession of her breasts slipping her bra aside then the sharp flare of fire died to warmth no one had ever touched her so no one had ever incited such conflicting and overpowering sensations rose petals clung to her skin sweet romantic kisses candlelight glowed against her heavy eyelids soft romantic light he murmured to her approval promises his voice mesmerizing yet somehow his gentle hands had her pulse pounding like a drumbeat and the lazy brush of his mouth stole each breath before she could draw it in he wanted to give her everything he had to give and he wanted to take everything she was he rolled the stockings down her slim thighs thrilling when her breathing grew thick and her movements restless when she touched him those elegant and competent hands roaming over him fingers seeking flexing he had to take her mouth again or die she moaned when his shirt was tugged away when his flesh slid over her flesh this was what she wanted this intimacy of body to body and mind to mind her earlier nerves forgotten she smiled against his mouth framed his face with her hands pleasure was cool and silky she wrapped herself with it he knew that she floated drifted her lazy sigh was another thrill for him slowly slowly he took her higher until her sighs were gasps until her eyes flew open in shock beneath his her body arched instinctively seeking more sensation spiked into sensation she shook her head once as if to deny what was happening inside her his eyes were on her face intense concentrating on every flicker of emotion that passed over it and his hands oh his hands were so quietly relentless heat slammed into her a ball of lightning the breath strangled in her throat pleasure was suddenly sharp and fierce and endlessly thrilling she heard her own moan all but felt it rise up through her and thicken the suddenly heavy air she shot to a peak over then shuddered down again branson again he didnt want her to catch her breath to clear her mind watching her dazzled by her he urged her to the next wave and when he was sure she was ready when he was certain there would be more pleasure than pain he let himself ride with her he was inside her filling her and moving with him was as natural as breathing she gave herself yielded herself when his mouth came back to hers she met it eagerly when his hands closed over hers she gripped them tightly to complete the union slowly silkily spinning it out savoring it they were mated and they were matched in his eyes she saw her own wonder and her heart filled with joy the moment they rose and fell together he pressed his lips to her throat and knew hed never really made love before hed been as innocent as she because hed never known what it was to be in love with a lover it was everything gwendolyn beautiful strong outrageously sexy gwendolyn she felt happiness bubble branson she said in the same sleepy tone beautiful strong outrageously sexy branson he lifted his head her eyes were heavy and dark her skin was glowing her lips were softly curved im going to have a hard time ever letting you out of this bed was i going somewhere not far anyway he traced the shape of her face with his finger theres a whirlpool tub in the next room is there im thinking i could let you get just that far how would you feel about a hot bubbling bath a glass of icy champagne and a man who already wants to make love with you again id feel very interested wait she took his face in her hands brought his mouth to hers the kiss was warm and deep id wondered what it would be like the first time how i would feel after knowing id shared myself with a man nothing i ever hoped for no foolishly high expectation i ever built up was as wonderful as tonight swamped with emotion he lowered his brow to hers i dont know what to say to you now tell me the night isnt over ill tell you its only beginning and he would tell her when the time was right that he wanted a lifetime of nights with her if he told her now he thought the romantic in her would want to believe it but the practical woman within would doubt when he told her he loved her he wanted no doubts and if he told her now while she was still soft and pliant from loving the romantic in her might give him the answer he needed and then the practical woman would step back assess and decide shed been swept up in the moment when she told him she loved him he wanted no doubts what are you thinking about she asked him he brought himself back smiled i was thinking what i could do to persuade you to put that little surprise you were wearing back on right now no he rubbed a finger over her bottom lip after the tub you could wear it while we have that cold supper she chuckled you want me to wear a garter belt while were eating he bent down to nibble the lip hed just rubbed oh yeah she considered remembered the way hed looked at her when he discovered what shed been wearing under the velvet gown tell you what ill give you a chance to talk me into it in the tub im really good at water sports he warned her and she laughed im counting on it chapter contents prev next she awoke luxuriously as if sliding through layers of shimmering silk her sigh was low and indulgent as she shifted reaching out then soft and sulky when she found herself alone in bed shed wanted him to be there just there so that she could touch that firm warm flesh so that he would turn to her again if they could survive one more again she didnt open her eyes yet it was so nice just to float and dream to feel her system slowly hum to life again shed had no idea the body could be so miraculous none of her studies her training her work had taught her just what marvelous reactions the human system had to sensory stimulation nothing had prepared her for what she was capable of given the right incentives she rubbed her hand over the sheet found it cool and wondered how long hed been gone and when he could come back hed promised her breakfast in bed she remembered and she intended to collect reluctantly she opened her eyes blinked owlishly at the clock well perhaps it was a bit late for breakfast she decided but it was the perfect time for brunch rising she found a soft terrycloth hotel robe on the bathroom door and she bundled herself into it and went to find him he was working at the laptop on the table in the parlor his brow was furrowed in concentration his eyes seemed just a little irritated odd she thought shed imagined him writing with little or no effort words simply flowing out everything he did seemed to come so naturally to him but now he had the look of a man who was struggling with something and was not entirely pleased with the results she raked a hand through her hair to smooth it her body was already tingling it was exciting she realized to watch him work to see him think to know he wasnt aware she was watching part of the excitement might have been that he wore only black sweatpants and to her own surprise she had already imagined how easily she could dispense with them his head came up suddenly he looked at her through her really then his gray eyes cleared warmed and he smiled at her good morning i didnt want to wake you im disturbing your work its not going well anyway it was for a while when he held out a hand she crossed the room threaded her fingers with his i woke up early he told her kissing her fingers one by one i thought you could use a little more rest i dont think ive ever been so relaxed in my life she laughed when he tugged her into his lap or more rested she said lifting her mouth to his i didnt let you get much sleep and i appreciate it he found that sweet spot just at the curve of her neck and nuzzled we can crawl back into bed and order breakfast mmm this is fine for now she shuddered when his hands slipped under the robe and found her and thats even better it was nearly noon before she could think again they were sprawled on the floor of the parlor with her head on his chest he had to smile when he felt her fingers on his wrist taking my pulse doc laughing at herself she drew her hand away i suppose i was its still a little fast he pressed his own fingers to the beat in her throat sos yours he drew her with him as he sat up if i dont feed you we wont be able to even crawl into bed i enjoyed the floor she picked up the robe shed been wearing studying him as he rose as a doctor id like to say youre in excellent shape as a woman she continued as he hauled her to her feet im compelled to say you have a great butt thanks on both counts i was watching you work after i woke up you looked so serious and annoyed certain parts of a story are nothing but an annoyance what part is this she shifted to try to look at the screen of the computer hed left on when she distracted him can i read it no briskly he leaned over and flicking a few keys turned the screen to black well thats definite she frowned at him and rude yeah want me hanging over your shoulder giving opinions when you remove your next gallbladder she was very close to pouting which appalled her who said i was going to give any opinions you would have you wouldnt have been able to help yourself the trouble here darling is while few believe they can perform brain surgery nearly every living soul believes they can write if only they had the time and opportunity he kissed her lightly nobody reads my work until its done except my editor i keep more friends that way well if youre going to be touchy about it i am what would you like for breakfast she jerked a shoulder whatever youve already told me what the storys about she reminded him no i told you the basic conflict and gave you an overview of one of the main characters he knew better than to grin but couldnt help himself are you going to sulk its very attractive actually im not sulking her eyes went dark and moody i never sulk nobody warned me about this he murmured gwendolyn doesnt like to be crossed she pouts i certainly do not are you going to order breakfast or shall i id be happy to he found it just one more facet of her to enjoy the simple illogic of it feeling cheerful he ordered twice as much food as they could possibly eat youll feel better when you have some coffee she set her teeth i feel perfectly fine and i think i have something else that might smooth your feathers theyre not ruffled she said evenly therefore they need no smoothing just the same he strolled off and came back in with a big gold box tied with red ribbon she huffed out a breath branson im not a child who needs to be placated with presents and if i were irritated with you a gift would hardly change the matter this one might he smiled charmingly and you dont know until you open it she didnt want to be placated but found herself too curious to resist it would be the eighth day by his odd and unpredictable calculations the box was heavier than shed expected so she set it on the table and toyed with the ribbon its awfully small for eight milkmaids she commented maybe i switched themes the quick distress in her eyes that she didnt quite manage to hide delighted him open it and find out she pulled the ribbon opened the lid the bowl was gorgeous the interior a glossy summer blue around the outside eight pretty maids sat on buckets and milked foolishly cheerful spotted cows she didnt need to see the signature on the bottom to know whose work it was aunt shelby she murmured how did you manage this i begged actually i begged julia and she used her influence on her mother im told the former first lady found the request amusing she would i love it she spoke quietly as her heart swelled what was he doing to her she wondered how could he make her feel so many different things in so short a time i dont think youll be able to top this one ive an ace or two up my sleeve yet its still a week till christmas she said then on a strangled sob threw herself into his arms i dont know whats happening to me its all so fast i cant keep up just hold on to me wherever were going well get there together i need to find my balance you keep throwing me off she clung to him its as if you know what im thinking what im feeling even before i do its unnerving she sighed and rested her head on his shoulder she didnt know why what hed said earlier played back in her head at just that moment why the words rang in her ears like an alarm but the eyes shed closed opened what did you mean no one warned you hmm she eased back slowly until they were no longer touching and studied his face who have you been talking to about me i dont know what you mean thatll be breakfast grateful for the delay he went to the door she remained calm as the waiter set up the food and she began to think to backtrack and to come to a few logical conclusions youve studied me havent you branson she asked when they were alone again a prototype you once said of course ive studied you he poured the coffee carefully on a professional level we agreed to that at the beginning but were not on a professional level here and one has nothing to do with the other absolutely nothing to do with the other temper simmered in his eyes do you think im using this using whats happened between us for a book is that what youre accusing me of im not accusing you im asking you then the answer is no his gaze narrowed youre not sure you believe that it just seems odd that you know me so well as if youve outlined me as a character i outlined your profession your gender your focus i mixed in audrey the blond med student her ambition and competitive streak and the body language of the head er nurse thats what i do i wasnt taking notes for the damn book when daniel and anna told me about you the wave of shame that had started to crest receded told you what about me he could quite happily have sawed off his tongue temper always undermined control he reminded himself just about you the foods going to get cold you asked them about me whats wrong with that he demanded the chill in her voice put his back up and he knew he was in a corner i was interested in you i wanted to know more about you when shortly after we met for heavens sake they didnt divulge any state secrets he said impatiently you could just as easily have asked them about me daniel would have been more than happy to fill you in with every detail i imagine he knows all there is to know or i wouldnt have gotten within a mile of you she held up a hand took a breath he did set it up didnt he he arranged it all you knew no i didnt not until after id met you and i didnt get the full drift until id gone up to see him what difference does it make i dont like being manipulated maneuvered deceived i havent deceived you gwendolyn she nodded slowly but manipulated maneuvered no the situation but not you frustration darkened his eyes his voice i was attracted to you was i supposed to walk away from that because daniel macgregor decided i should court his granddaughter humiliation and temper waged a war inside her he shouldnt have interfered and you should have told me when you discovered he had all he did was arrange for us to meet if thered been nothing there i would have researched my book giving you a nice acknowledgment in the front of it and it would have ended there she shook her head and walked to the table for her coffee she would have to think about this carefully she decided when she was more calm i dont know how you can defend him he manipulated you every bit as much as me im grateful to him if he hadnt have arranged it id never have met you i wouldnt have fallen in love with you she went very still stared at him when he laid his hands on her shoulders i love you gwendolyn however it came to be doesnt change the result youre what ive waited for without ever knowing i was waiting youre going too fast her stomach jittered as she stepped back weve been steered into this and we havent had time to think i know what i feel i dont she said it desperately i dont ive just found out all this was going on behind the scenes i need time to think this needs to slow down we need to slow down you dont believe me seeing the doubt in her eyes hurt unbearably do you know how insulting it is for you to stand there and doubt my feelings for me to wrap them up like another gift for you and you to hand them back thats not what im doing terrified she rubbed a hand over her thudding heart im telling you we need time both of us no amount of time is going to change the fact that im in love with you and since youre already dealing with the shock of that ill tell you that i want to marry you i want to have children with you there was nothing loverlike in his tone but it wasnt the bite of anger in his voice that had her going pale it was the words themselves marriage good god branson we cant possibly because your grandfather started it no of course not because weve barely had time to why did you sleep with me i her head was reeling she lifted a hand to it surprised to find it was still on her shoulders because we wanted each other and that was all just want just sex you know it was more how can i when you wont tell me she stepped back again fighting for calm youre more clever with words than i branson you know how to use them now youre pushing me with them when i need time to think because he couldnt deny it he nodded all right but i cant take back what i said and i cant change what i feel an hour a year a lifetime im still going to be in love with you youll have to get used to hearing it she wasnt certain she ever could not when her heart swam into her throat every time he said it if we could just take this a step at a time in an abrupt change of mood he smiled all right but youre already several steps behind he leaned down to kiss her lightly though his stomach was raw and his heart aching try to catch up chapter contents prev next gwen all but limped into the house shed missed her dinner break and worked nearly three hours over her shift she wanted to believe her miserable mood was due to that and not because branson hadnt been by the hospital in two days if he was angry with her it couldnt be helped shed reminded herself of that dozens of times since she left his hotel on sunday she was doing the right thing the only thing being sensible slowing down thinking things through shed even resisted calling her grandfather to scold him for his machinations and that she told herself had taken an enormous act of will besides she would be in hyannis port on christmas eve it would be much more satisfying to give him a piece of her mind facetoface relieved to be out of the bitter cold she tugged off her gloves scarf wool cap julia jules you home and sighed when there was no response she and her cousin had barely time enough to bump into each other as they came in and out of the door she needed someone to talk to gwen admitted as she bent down to pull off her boots she needed someone whod listen while she vented someone whod tell her that she was right to be angry she was right to be cautious she was right to step back and analyze the situation shed been maneuvered into ninetyyearold men playing matchmaker she muttered and she headed back to the kitchen thirtyyearold men falling right in line its calculating and its insulting and its unacceptable someone has to make them understand life isnt a game feeling righteous she shoved through the kitchen door and when she saw the big bright box on the table her heart dropped to her knees oh branson she caught herself before the dreamy sigh was complete sucked it firmly back in she was not going to be softened up by some silly gift turning her back on it she headed to the refrigerator julias note was a bold scrawl in christmas red i think you can guess who sent the box by my calculations were up to dancing ladies i have earned huge points for resisting easing it open myself for a quick peek dying to see but i wont be home till late thank god were out of here in a couple of days for the riot that is our family at christmas jules ps bran is one in a million gwen read the postscript and jammed her hands in her pockets damn it youre supposed to be on my side well im just not going to open it this has to be stopped readjusted after the holidays both of us will be able to think more clearly she decided she wanted wine more than food and snatched a glass out of the cabinet and stood there glass in hand staring at the box im not opening it she repeated if were going to put things back on some reasonable sensible level then i i have to stop talking to myself she decided rubbing a hand over her face or im going to end up in the psych ward she got out the wine poured the glass she would have sworn the box at her back was singing her name after one sip of wine she realized she didnt want any after all what she needed to do was go upstairs put on comfortable clothes and all right all right all right ill open it she spun around scowling at the box as she yanked off the cheery redandgreen ribbon its not going to make any difference she muttered i will not be charmed i will not be swayed she tossed the lid aside i will not be oh nestled inside the tissue paper were music boxes a ballerina an ice skater a southern belle a flapper an irish colleen a scottish lassie a tambourinetapping gypsy an elaborately gowned lady poised for a minuet and a fieryeyed senorita nine dancing ladies waiting for her to give them their cue she couldnt stop herself from taking each out admiring each of them in turn lining them up on the table giving in she wound them and stood back grinning foolishly waltzes and charlestons and reels tinkled and clashed and rang as her nine ladies whirled and spun she didnt realize she was crying until her hands covered her damp cheeks oh this has to stop how am i supposed to think when he keeps muddling up my head as the music slowed and died she wiped her cheeks dry it has to stop she said again more firmly then marched out of the kitchen branson let the scene flow through his mind out through his fingers and onto the screen the hardbitten detective scully was about to be singed by the sexual sparks flashing between him and dr miranda kates his objectivity would be lost for a time his career compromised and his heart battered before it was done it would be good for him branson thought it would humanize him scully had been too much in control in his three previous outings this time he was going to fall and fall hard and it was just his bad luck that the woman he tumbled for was a coldblooded killer hed suffer branson mused and be a better man for it he stopped typing pressed his fingers to his gritty eyes whoever had said suffering built character should be dragged out in the street and shot he decided who the hell needed character anyway he wondered what he needed was gwendolyn hed played it wrong there was no doubt about that needing to move branson pushed back from the table and prowled the hotel suite hed made his home he should have told her about the setup the minute he figured it out they might have laughed about it then shrugged it off but it hadnt seemed important or necessary and it hadnt seemed like good strategy he admitted he hadnt wanted to risk her bolting with her principles before he had a chance to romance her then hed been in too deep and hed nearly forgotten how it had all started because he was so steeped in her then hed still ended up blowing it he thought in disgust hed known she wasnt ready to hear that he was in love with her but damn it he was ready didnt that count for something was she really so stubborn so pigheaded that she would let the one small insignificant fact that her grandfather had matched them up stop her loving him back jamming his hands in his pockets he stalked to the window what did he want with a woman like that anyway he stared out at the city the gleam of lights glinting on snow and street the glint of the dark water of the harbor boston was blanketed in holiday spirit he thought friends and family were gathered together out of the cold and wind and he was alone because the woman he wanted wouldnt admit she wanted him he should have bought a third ticket he thought gone along with his parents on the gift cruise hed given them for christmas he could have worked on the ship and enjoyed a nice sail in the greek isles that would have given gwendolyn her time and her distance he scowled at the knock on the door he hadnt ordered dinner yet and the last pot of coffee that had been sent up didnt need replenishing yet whoever it was could go the hell away he thought stalking over he looked through the security peep saw gwen and shut his eyes great he thought perfect he hadnt shaved in two days and he was as surly as a bear woken out of hibernation the doctor sure picked her moments he took a moment to compose himself raked his fingers through his untidy hair and opened the door house call he said and even managed to smile at her you look like you could use one you look exhausted did i wake you did i come at a bad time no you didnt wake me he stepped back cocked his head as she hesitated coming in yes all right her eyes widened at the disarray in the elegant parlor cups glasses bottles were strewn everywhere the dining table was heaped with books papers more cups i kicked the maid out for a couple days branson told her getting a clear look at the mess for the first time i guess id better let her back in ive got coffee we can wash out a cup no i dont need anything her mission took a back seat now to concern you look completely worn out it hasnt been letting me sleep he gestured toward his laptop or much of anything else meaning food exercise fresh air the doctor in her stepped forward branson youll make yourself sick im sorry if the books not going well but its not going well its going terrific im just riding the wave oh so this is what happens when youre not having trouble with the story if it wasnt going well id tell myself i really needed to take a walk get a haircut learn to speak japanese sure you dont want coffee he asked as he headed for the pot yes im sure and you should order up some food some soup ill get to it doc his system was already wired he decided what was one more hit of caffeine in the vast scheme of things you look a little tired yourself we got most of the victims from the bus wreck into er this afternoon what bus wreck she blinked at him on the longfellow bridge icy roads thirtyfive people injured its been all over the news most of the day the news hasnt been part of my little world today he studied her over the rim of his cup she looked a little pale he noted but steady as always and she had yet to take off her coat why dont you sit down ill order something up no not for me i cant stay long ive got a double shift tomorrow making up for taking three days off for the holidays the everconscientious dr blade because he smiled when he said it she relaxed i wanted to thank you for the music boxes theyre charming and they were unexpected i thought you were angry with me did you i know you were im glad youre not anymore now that things are smoothed out i hope we can talk about it after the holidays when life calms down a bit we want to be calm he said quietly we want to be reasonable yes relief flooded her as she walked to him took his hand ill be back on the twentyseventh if youre free oh im free i put my parents on a plane tomorrow for athens your familys leaving town theyve always wanted to go to greece so im sending them on a cruise thats a lovely thing to do but you shouldnt be alone at christmas you know youd be welcome to come to hyannis my grandparents would love to have you he stared at her for so long she felt her heart begin to bump erratically you really dont have a clue do you he murmured you figure everythings just clicked back into an acceptable position no i only thought since you werent angry i am angry he didnt raise his voice didnt throw or break anything didnt threaten to do her bodily harm it was only more confusing shed grown up in a family that had expressed every passion and emotion at full volume it all has to be spelled out for you doesnt it if i shouted if i shoved the table over smashed some crockery then you could logically conclude that im angry well i dont work that way my actions and my feelings arent always simple and theyre not always logical all right she was more frightened more stupefied by his cold control than she would have been by a violent display youre still angry so obviously we still need to talk you hurt me the quiet statement had her eyes filling her heart ripping oh branson im so sorry i never meant to i want that gets to you he shut his eyes and turned away furious with himself for having admitted it the compassion takes over i dont want your compassion or your sympathy or your guilt he turned back and the violence in his eyes was all the more compelling in contrast to the absolute calm of his voice i want you to tell me you love me because you do if i didnt know it if i couldnt see it in your face if i hadnt felt it when i touched you id walk away do you think i enjoy humiliating myself like this no i dont please lets sit down and talk this out havent i said everything already im in love with you i want you to marry me raise a family with me what part of that dont you understand understanding and accepting arent always the same couldnt he see that she needed to decide and decide lucidly what was right and sane and necessary for both of them maybe you believe you love me and maybe i she shook her head moved back quickly i came here tonight to tell you i wont be pressured i wont be pushed he moved fast had her locked in his arms in less than a heartbeat had his mouth on hers in less than two her practical words rang hollowly in her ears as her heart simply melted tell me what you feel now he demanded against her mouth tell me what youre feeling now this instant too much i cant think past it please dont do this he knew that he could have her that she would yield and that whatever he took would leave him empty he drew away youd better go im not feeling reasonable she nodded ordered her shaky legs to walk to the door and there with her hand on the knob she felt shame for being less than honest for giving him less than hed asked im out of my depth with you branson she said quietly i feel out of control i dont know how to function that way and i need to decide what that means for me she opened the door but made herself turn so that their eyes met across the room i need to decide what to do about the fact that im in love with you she rushed out he was halfway across the room before he stopped himself no she wouldnt listen now he told himself and fought to calm his speeding pulse she would fight him every step of the way if he tried to press the advantage shed just given him hed made enough missteps without making another slowly he rubbed a hand over his heart the ache was gone that dull nasty throb the doctor had healed him he thought with a slow smile he was going to have to work very fast to complete plans for her payment he was going to order up a meal a huge meal a banquet god he was starving he needed a shower a shave a long walk then he had to get to work there was only a matter of days before christmas she loves me he said and laughed out loud you say youre out of your depth now doc he thought believe me you aint seen nothin yet chapter contents prev next daniel macgregor scowled fiercely huffed out a breath well whats wrong with the boy he wanted to know nothings wrong with him gwen barely resisted throwing up her hands shed made certain she got to hyannis early and cornered her meddling grandfather before the rest of the family could distract her thats not the point what is the point id like to know ill tell you what the point is he continued jabbing out a finger before she could speak the point is you met a nice young man of good family a young man with a fine and clever mind and of strong and steady heart if hes been romancing you what have you got to complain about if hes been romancing me gwen said evenly its because you tossed us in each others faces and under false pretenses false pretenses he rolled his bright blue eyes did he want to research his murder book or not yes but are you a doctor with some knowhow in the medical field grandpa and if youre both young healthy single people what harm is there in having you meet you dont like him you toss him back hes not a trout she said between her teeth so you do like him dont you gwennie she had to shut her eyes had to wonder why shed believed even for an instant that she would get anywhere with the macgregor my feelings for branson have nothing to do with this conversation of course they do theyre the point he beamed at her has he asked you to marry him im not going to discuss it he has triumphant daniel banged his fist on the arm of his chair i knew young branson maguire was a sharp lad a man of taste and character which is why you picked him for me exactly i he stopped hissed between his teeth shed caught him there now gwennie its just that your grandmother worries so that youre alone there in the city im not alone and that you might meet the wrong type of individual that gilbert doctor for instance his name is greg she said wearily and hes a perfectly nice man but hes no bran maguire is he tell the truth and shame the devil her lips twitched forcing her to press them into a firm line perhaps i prefer the sober serious type ha in a pigs eye kin of mine would prefer a dull dog to a purebred george would bore you to death within a year greg and youre not going to turn this around you interfered with my life with bransons life and if you think either one of us is going to thank you for it she swore when the front door slammed and voices rolled down the hall thats my rena grateful for the interruption daniel hauled his bulk out of the chair rena he bellowed it your daughters in here gwen still shaking snow off her sleek bob of redgold hair serena macgregor blade rushed into the room her eyes lit and her face as lovely as any gwen knew glowed with pleasure youre here early laughing she threw open her arms oh ive missed you gwen flew into her mothers arm and her hug was just desperate enough to have serena lifting a brow and aiming a narrowed look at her father what have you been up to she demanded of daniel just having a nice chat with my granddaughter no one he knew could cut through his bluster as quickly or as keenly as his daughter he admired her for it and was greatly relieved when justin blade walked in dad gwen turned to embrace him held tight he was tall and strikingly handsome his thick dark hair glinting with silver his green eyes sharp as gemstones those eyes met his wifes over their daughters head then as a unit both pairs shifted to daniel what we need here is hot food and drink calculating quickly daniel decided on retreat im going to see to it the rest of the family will be along any minute i dont know what your mothers up to rena he said as he strode out always fussing always worrying he never changes justin commented and laughed thank god for it then he tipped up gwens chin hello beautiful he murmured they were the exact words hed said to her when she was placed in his arms at birth im so glad to see you both wheres mac duncan mell macs flying in from vegas hell be here in a couple hours duncan and mell are driving up from atlantic city theyre probably an hour behind us why dont i help you get your bags upstairs theres time for that serena led gwen to the sofa drew her down just how angry with your grandfather are you about branson maguire gwen blew out a breath as her father sat on her other side i should have known word would travel it always does this route was julia to shelby to me to your father how impossible has he made it for you hes made it uncomfortable gwen muttered justin ran a hand over her hair if youre not interested in this maguire thats the end of it i am interested justins hand paused i see how interested justin with a laugh serena shook her head at him whats he like she asked gwen tell us about him hes a writer i suppose you knew that hes a good one justin admitted i havent seen him since he was a baby serena sighed over the passage of time his mother and i lost touch its a shame ill have to call her hes been to the vegas casino justin took out a slim cigar studied it mac knows him slightly really well its interesting how things work serena smiled at her daughter but you havent told us what hes like hes charming and gentle hes very intense about his work he likes french food and italian operas hes got a wonderful smile and gray eyes that look right inside you youre in love with him serenas eyes stung as she reached for her husbands hand shes in love with him i might be gwen sprang up too restless to sit how do i know ive never felt this way before how can i be sure he wants to marry me he insists on it as if its a given something thats bound to happen sooner or later so why not sooner and grandpa set the whole thing up deciding he would deal with all the conflicting emotions spinning inside him later justin lifted serenas hand to his lips hes done it before with excellent results so i should just fall in line of course not justin rose put his hands on gwens shoulders you have your own mind your own heart youll follow them theyre telling me different things and its all happening so fast being swept off your feet is fine in storybooks but in reality its frightening how can i marry him she demanded turning to her mother how do i know ill be good at it that ill be able to handle all those demands and responsibilities my career a husband children how do i know i can do as good a job with all of that as you have as grandma did you dont you decide if youre willing to work at it every day for the rest of your life darling youve achieved everything youve ever gone after maybe thats a problem for you now serena patted the cushion beside her you were always such a serious child not without humor and a sense of the ridiculous but always responsible and very goaloriented ive hurt him gwen murmured and im afraid if im not careful if im not cautious ill end up hurting him again by marrying him yes and failing at it then you should take the time you need but let me give you a hypothetical case medically speaking you have a cool doctors mind if you had a patient a strong healthy patient and there were two choices for her with one she could go on exactly as she had been she would be content successful even happy nothing would have to change for her the other choice involved a certain risk an adjustment in lifestyle if she took this choice took this risk she might gain a great deal not a longer life but a richer one not a healthier body but a fuller heart which prognosis would you wish for her youre very wise gwen murmured macgregors are very wise serena leaned over to kiss her i cant tell you what choice to make you have to make it for yourself and i wont tell you whether to follow your mind or your heart in the end if its right youll follow both youre right absolutely right i have to decide and i will she rose again i love you both of you im going to take a walk do some thinking before the horde descends and i wont be able to hear myself think justin waited until they were alone then walked to his wife taking her hands he drew her to her feet there are two things i need to do and what are they i have to go smuggle the cigars in my suitcase to daniel to thank him for his daughter who is the most incredible woman ive ever known and then he lowered his head to brush his lips over hers i have to take his daughter my wife and the mother of my children upstairs and make love with her serena wound her arms around his neck why doesnt his daughter your wife and the mother of your children go upstairs and wait for you justin kissed her again lingered over it why doesnt she gwen barely slept it had been nearly am before everyone stumbled off to bed she had lain there staring at the ceiling willing the right answer to come but shed only been able to see bransons face and to yearn for him just before dawn she drifted off but even that thin sleep was ragged with dreams she saw him in the hospital corridor his eyes focused on hers as he told her who he was and what he wanted now smiling that quick charming grin as he shopped with her downtown holding her when she cried over the loss of a patient kissing her breathless at her front door carrying her to a bed strewn with rose petals and that dark and desperate look in his eyes when hed told her he loved her then the dream became less memory than wish she saw herself smiling back at him holding out her hands accepting giving embracing pipes were playing as he swept her up onto a gleaming white stallion she felt not helpless but powerful her laugh mixed with his as they thundered off bagpipes singing high and bright she stirred sighing with the dream the romance the rightness of it and she was murmuring his name as she woke the pipes played still she sat up rubbing her eyes clear bagpipes she thought in confusion and the steady beat of drums with it she yawned laughed and swung her legs off the bed grandpa she thought had cooked up something special for christmas morning early christmas morning she noted with a glance at the clock it was barely eight she stumbled for her robe just as her door burst open julias hair was wildly tousled her feet bare and her eyes wide look out the window you wont believe it until you see it i hear it gwen said as voices sounded in the hall doors opened and closed feet pounded sounds like everyone else does too whats grandpa done not grandpa taking the matter into her own hands julia grabbed gwens arm and dragged her to the window its bran stunned julia stared outside there on the wide slope of lawn were ten burly men in kilts leaping in a scottish reel ten lords aleaping she managed lairds julia corrected grinning like an idiot even better there are eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming id say that wraps it up honey your true love didnt miss a trick he she stared down at branson he stood in the midst of the melee his hair flying in the wind he did all this for me hes crazy julia stated hes in love hes amazing yes yes laughing gwen pressed a hand to her mouth true love she thought her true love had no sense at all and wasnt that wonderful hes all of that he loves me he really does its not a mistake its not too fast its not a passing infatuation its perfect hes perfect then what are you doing up here when hes down there im going she slipped on a pair of boots and with her robe flapping behind her she raced for the stairs her family was already ahead of her bundling into coats or boots or just streaming out the door in their robes she saw her grandparents by the door with anna calmly buttoning daniels overcoat i dont need it you do its a cold wind i wont have you catching a chill the pipers arent going anywhere and fine pipers they are he caught sight of gwen speeding down the stairs and sent her a smug grin well thats a lad isnt it yes she caught his bearded face in her hands and kissed him long and hard but im not thanking you for at least a week with that she rushed outside into the cold and pushed her way through her family until she had a clear view be quiet she demanded i cant hear but she might have been talking to the wind for all the good it did her then it didnt matter they could talk and shout and laugh she didnt hear them she only heard the pipes and drums as branson started over the snowy lawn toward her she didnt notice that her family actually became silent she didnt notice that tears shimmered cold on her cheeks she only saw bransons face and his heart was in his eyes merry christmas gwendolyn branson i love you he told her lifting a hand to brush a tear from her lashes youre everything i want i admire your strength your honesty your compassion and your logic i need you in my life im promising you here in front of the people who matter to you most that ill never let you down thats a lad daniel boomed out with tears in his voice i told you by god thats a lad when branson smiled gwen felt her mother take her hand squeeze it in support in approval with love then serena let it go its not all the twelve days of christmas branson told her but its a start will you have me gwendolyn her heart brimmed over as she stepped forward stood between him and her family and took his hands i told you i wouldnt be pressured i wouldnt be pushed oh give the guy a break gwen ignoring the order from her younger sister gwen kept her eyes on bransons and i wont be but i cant resist being loved or loving you back so ill answer you in front of the people who matter to me most yes ill have you branson and youll have me well kiss the girl daniel demanded branson shot a look over gwens head met daniels fiercely glinting eyes i think i can handle it from here he said and he kissed the girl from the private memoirs of daniel duncan macgregor its my pleasure to say that my choice of young branson was better than even i anticipated hes a clever irishman were proud to have him as part of the family i watched his face when our gwen started down the aisle toward him in her fairy princess gown and heirloom veil there was love there for a lifetime and more anna and i our hands linked watched them take their vows life is a circle and love is what gilds it in that church with the light streaming through the stainedglass windows in rainbows my gwen and her branson began their own circle within those circles forged by all the generations before i take no credit for this for to take it causes all manner of trouble ill just enjoy it so another spring is here our gwen is beginning this new life our laura is round and healthy with the babe she carries julia now she keeps herself busy as six beavers shes a sharp one she is takes after her grandfather shes my jewel and make no mistake ive outlined my strategy there even while settling her cousins shell be a tough nut but hah theres no tougher nut than daniel duncan macgregor im planning on enlisting a little help with this arrangement had my eye on this boy for years and so has julia though shed suffer the tortures of hell before shed admit it stubborn lass god bless her the two of them are perfect for each other a pair of hotheads who snarl and snap at each other at every opportunity theyll make fine strong babies for me for anna i mean the poor woman pines for babies annas already packed the macgregor wedding veil away i didnt want to mention shed be taking it out again before a years passed i give my word on it part three julia chapter contents prev next there was no doubt in julias mind but then there rarely was the wall would have to go she walked from the tiny parlor into the tiny library that abutted it definitely and when the wall was gone she would have one generous airy room rather than two cramped ones she nodded firmly and continued her tour her eyes observing assessing all the glass would have to be replaced with thermal and the trim and molding would need to be stripped down to the original walnut whoever had painted it blue should have been hanged she said as much into the minirecorder she carried her notes were always logged in this manner and her commentaries were invariably pithy julia macgregor not only had strong feelings she strongly believed in expressing them she already had completed and labeled two tapes on the house on beacon hill the house she had decided would be her home she would make it uniquely hers every detail down to the color of the grout in the firstfloor powder room would be decided upon and supervised by her the contractor and subs would be charmed or bullied and she could do both into providing her with exactly what she wanted she had never been satisfied with anything less julia would never have considered herself spoiled she worked for what she wanted she planned she executed and she could if necessary hang drywall nail trim and grout windows but she believed in hiring experts and professionals and paying them well she had been known to take advice particularly when it agreed with her own point of view and a project once started was never left undone shed learned the value of planning of working and of finishing from her parents alan macgregor had served two terms as president with shelby campbell macgregor beside him as a first lady who did a great deal more than host parties and greet dignitaries the women in the macgregor clan were not and never had been reflections of their husbands a macgregor woman was her own woman so was julia she headed up the gently curving stairs a woman with rosepetal skin and curling flamecolored hair her eyes were chocolate brown focused sharply now to catch any minute detail or flaw she might have missed her mouth was wide and often mobile her hands narrow and rarely still her curvy body was fueled with an inner energy that never seemed to be depleted only the smitten would have called her beautiful but even her detractors and a strong woman who routinely voiced strong opinions had them acknowledged her unique appeal one of the men shed dated had called her the amazon queen and though it hadnt been meant as a compliment at the time the term suited she was sturdy selfsufficient and sexy and she was ruthless tapping a finger on the subtle point of her chin she studied the bedroom shed been using for the past month the delightful adam fireplace needed to be unblocked its having been blocked off was another black mark against the former owners in julias opinion she could imagine herself curled up in the wonderful teak sleigh bed she had in storage pillows heaped around her a pot of jasmine tea a good book and a fire crackling away in the hearth it was only late august and summer still held boston in a sweaty grip but the image played for her and would she determined be reality by thanksgiving the house itself would shine by christmas and she would christen it with a huge and glittery new years eve party ring in the new julia thought and grinned on cue the doorbell rang mr murdoch she thought and right on time she had used his company as her head contractor for nearly six years this wasnt the first property julia had purchased or the first she had rehabbed or the first she had lived in real estate was her passion and her skill for wheeling deals came naturally down through the blood her grandfather had gone from pauper to millionaire on the qualities of a shrewd mind a sharp eye and a gamblers heart of all his children and grandchildren it was julia who most closely followed in the big mans footprints she hurried downstairs anxious to begin discussing plans and wrangling about fees with the crafty scotsman daniel macgregor himself had recommended michael murdoch and his company to her years before and julia blessed him for it she felt shed found a kindred spirit in those twinkling blue eyes and capable workingmans hands so she was smiling when she opened the door and scowling a pulse beat later it wasnt michael murdoch but his son she considered cullum murdoch the only fly in the ointment of her excellent relationship with the contracting company wheres your father she demanded hes not feeling well cullum didnt waste smiles on women who irritated so his cool green eyes his full sculpted mouth remained sober im doing the runthrough hes sick the concern was instant and sincere and had her reaching for cullums hand whats wrong with him has he seen a doctor its nothing serious latesummer cold but he softened a bit her eyes were worried her affection for his father was palpable he just needs to stay in bed and take it easy for a couple days oh they stood where they were on either side of the threshold with the morning sun beating down she released his hand and calculated she didnt care to work with cullum but neither did she care to delay the project he read her and dark brows lifted over amused green eyes i can stand it if you can macgregor frowning julia studied him men who were as handsome as the devil rarely irritated her and cullum with his sharpboned sculpted face certainly qualified there was the added appeal of the lions mane of bronzetipped brown hair the quick and crooked grin not that he ever aimed it at her and the long lanky body that fit so nicely in denim but irritate her he did continually their personalities crashed and clashed like honed swords on a battlefield annoying or not she thought he was good at his work and it was only a runthrough all right murdoch lets get started then he stepped onto the wide squares of roseveined tiles in the foyer gave the staircase a sweeping glance took a considering look at the ornate plasterwork on the vaulted ceiling hows the foundation solid as a rock ill check it out there she thought gritting her teeth that was just it the man constantly questioned her judgment argued with her opinions sneered at her tastes she drew in a breath ive taken notes she said and took minicassettes from the pocket of her trim navy trousers yeah the famous macgregor tapes sarcasm edged his voice as he took them stuffed them in the back pocket of his jeans its more efficient than scribbling notes on paper and my plans and outlines cant be misconstrued yeah youre in charge its my house she snapped he shot her a bland look who said it wasnt he moved beyond her into the small front parlor and instantly thought that whoever had painted the molding should have been beaten mercilessly cozy cramped she corrected i want the right wall taken out the room beyond is just as cramped equaling two wasted spaces in my opinion it was a good move but she so clearly thought so there was no need to confirm it and there was an irresistible desire to challenge it old traditional houses like this dont like structural changes the wall goes with unhurried longlegged strides he strolled over looked it up looked it down probably screw up this nice randomwidth pine floor then youll just have to fix it she walked through the stillempty room her steps echoing hollowly i want the molding stripped down to natural wood and theres some minor plasterwork you can see for yourself the stone needs to be repainted on the fireplace but the mantel is in excellent shape and over in here she strode out and into the next room waiting for him to follow the patio door is too small i want the opening widened an atrium installed walnut beveled glass brass hardware he saw the results in his head approved them but shrugged thats going to mean cutting into the brick im aware of that murdoch its going to cost you the sneer was in her eyes well discuss your estimate after youve worked it up but to continue naturally all the walls will need to be repainted or repapered and the fireplace in here she cocked her head measuring the line and distance from the fireplace in the next room ill want this mantel replaced with one to match the other and the flue heres been blocked off it needs to be opened thermal glass for all the windows of course of course ignoring the smirk she brushed past him and continued if it had been his father she would have asked opinions discussed strategies theyd have been laughing over something by now or been on their hands and knees examining the floor molding she would do none of those things with the son her voice was as stiff as her spine cullum thought and he wished to god she didnt smell so good it was distracting having that warriorgoddess fragrance assault him whenever he got within three feet of her he did his best to keep his distance he considered her a snotty cold bossy and arrogant woman anything but his type the fact that he occasionally wondered what she would taste like was in his opinion just a reflex and nothing more they moved through the first floor room by room it was a great house he mused but then hed never known julia macgregor to buy a loser she had an eye for buildings he could respect that and he could respect the fact that whatever she bought she tended well but she never shut the hell up he decided and she treated him as if he were braindead explaining and outlining every point and change replacement tiles in the powder room yeah yeah new hardware for the pedestal sink did she think he couldnt see that the current faucet was rusted and clunky he had eyes didnt he they spent nearly an hour in the kitchen julia wanted a complete redesign there all of it built around two points the old brick hearth that she wanted in working order again and the wallspanning chestnut breakfront he was pleased to shut down a couple of her ideas as unworkable and even more pleased to replace her plans with his own youve got plenty of room he stood in the center of the kitchen on a shiny linoleum floor why do you want to waste it thats not its just plain stupid to have the stove and refrigerator that far apart you want a flow a traffic pattern aesthetics and convenience its pretty obvious you dont cook she angled her head and in your little world women whip up hot meals nightly for their weary men in my little world people who cook eat better you can keep your sink under the double windows there the counter comes around here you curve it give it a nice fluid look his gestures were brisk economic those of a man accustomed to being in charge and being obeyed dishwasher here stove there fridge there keep the pantry under the back steps get rid of the ugly door on it now if i were you youre not id run another length of counter out here a serving and conversation bar itd break up the space really use it then you take that summer porch make it part of the room get rid of the wall she winged a brow i thought old traditional houses didnt care for structural changes good one he thought but shrugged his shoulders its already too late for that if youre going to figure out how to take out one you can take out two you ditch the screens put in windows then use that part of the l for a sitting area i could run a bench under the windows oh it was coming together beautifully in her mind i saw this terrific old church pew last week even better youll never use the porch the way its set up now for anything but junk space this way youd bring those gardens inside not that they dont need work and add some great light she wanted it absolutely well ill consider it fine and youll want to get rid of the floor covering its brandnew odds are its covering up more randomwidth pine nobodys that stupid he took out a pocketknife flicked the blade those green eyes flashed with challenge bet she waffled between wanting him to be right and hating being wrong all right take up a corner but if youre wrong you take five percent off your estimate if im right you do the kitchen my way she nodded deal he walked to the corner closest to the back door and got down on his knees it took him less than two minutes youre going to be very happy just subflooring huh smug she walked over peered down oh she scrambled down to her hands and knees thrilled to see the pine boards what idiots take off some more likely its scratched scarred and stained he worked off more linoleum so they took the easy route and covered it up it was like finding buried treasure julia had to stop herself from ripping at it with her bare hands they were hiptohip now shouldertoshoulder the curling cloud of her hair brushed his cheek the scent of it drew him and without thinking he turned his head inhaled she felt the flutter the quick answer to it in the pit of her stomach she straightened so quickly she nearly bashed his nose with her head what are you doing nothing what the hell had gotten into him was all he could think was he completely insane you were sniffing me get a grip i was breathing its just something i do to get through the day the fact that her pulse was dancing a jig infuriated her her mouth was dry her skin hot well dont do it around me she snapped and got quickly to her feet lets go through the second floor and get this over with fine he closed the blade and shoved the knife back in his pocket because it was tempting to jab it into his own heart as punishment for his momentary lapse and dont worry macgregor ill make sure i hold my breath idiot she muttered under her own as she stalked from the room but she wasnt sure which one of them she was referring to daniel macgregor imagined he was puffing on a cigar tipped back in the massive leather chair in his massive office in his massive home he blew imaginary smoke rings at the ceiling while he listened to his good friend michael murdoch on the telephone so the boy bought it he did indeed michael told him i hacked a bit held my nose when i called him michael did so now making his voice stuffy and wheezy youll have to see to julia today i told him im feeling poorly he didnt care for it michael continued his voice clear as church bells on sunday but hes a good boy and takes pride in the company hes a fine boy your cullum daniel grinned at the ceiling shifted the telephone to his other ear hed known michael murdoch for fifteen years respected him as a professional liked him as a man hed grieved with him when michael lost his wife a decade before and plotted with him nearly as long so its a big job daniel continued itll take a few months more or less and keep them rubbing up against each other ill be sick for a week or two gives me a chance to catch up on my reading then ill be feeling a little off my feed for a week or two more by that time cullum will be deep into the project ill be able to convince him he should follow it through hell want it by that point in any case dont understand for a minute why the boy hasnt made a move toward the girl already theyve known each other for years two strong healthy attractive people he shook his head sadly stroking his soft white beard i tell you michael children today have to be led along by the hand or they get nothing important done theres a spark between them daniel you and i were just blowing on it a bit its time for my cullum to settle down find his happiness agreed for punctuation daniel thumped his fist on the desk and julia needs to do the same why the girls twentyfive years old whats she waiting for then he smiled settled back again theyll make beautiful babies together for us michael chapter contents prev next blissfully unaware that her life was being arranged for her julia sat in the center of her bed poring over books of samples wallpaper paint tile she had mountains of catalogs listing hinges doorknobs bathroom and kitchen hardware she scribbled down possibilities and recorded her final choices it had taken two weeks of meetings of negotiations and of snarling arguments for her and cullum to finalize the projected work the deadlines and the estimated costs shed had no choice but to accept him as head contractor on the job when she slipped into the murdoch offices and saw how tired and worn michael murdoch was shed stifled all complaints until he regained his strength hed be riding his desk she didnt want to be responsible for making him feel he had to drag himself to the site and supervise she shifted sliding her legs from left to right for comfort the morning had been spent at a settlement for a property shed sold she had yet to change out of the short summerblue skirt and jacket shed worn for the meeting absently she tapped her fingers on a swatch of floral wallpaper she had a weakness for colored stones and a trio of them winked on her hand others gleamed at her ears her wrist because shed pulled out the pins the minute she stepped into her room her hair tumbled wildly over her shoulders she hummed to herself enjoying the background noise of saws and hammers traveling up from the first floor men at work she thought terrific music cullum could only be grateful she didnt look up when he stepped into the doorway she would have seen his tongue slide out of his mouth and hit his shoes my god the woman had legs yards of them and that tiny little skirt wasnt covering up much she didnt look the least bit like a businesswoman more like a pagan goddess it almost made a man forget she had a smart mouth and a snakebite temper when she idly rubbed a hand high on her thigh he rolled his eyes to the ceiling begging for mercy he had to take two slow steady breaths to pull himself in line got a minute macgregor hmm the wild roses on dusky blue or the sleek traditional stripes roses she decided why be subtle macgregor jules he moved over snapped his fingers under her nose and had the pleasure of seeing her gaze shoot up in shock what surprise was what had her heart jolting she told herself your walls out thought you might want to see oh sure in a minute she hated to be taken unawares not given time to engage all controls ill come right down a man would be crazy to walk away from those legs when he could linger cullum decided he sat on the bed amused when her eyes narrowed getting ahead of yourself arent you i was about to say the same she said primly you wont be needing wall coverings for some time yet it pays to think ahead he leaned forward studied the stripes shed just rejected boring his gaze traveled up those legs thats about the only thing youre not lets see compliment or insult she resisted tugging at her skirt she wouldnt give him the satisfaction insult she decided get lost why are you all dressed up he fingered her lapel knowing shed slap at his hand she didnt disappoint him i had a settlement the court street property oh yeah nice place but too downtown he spread open her paintsample booklet considered the choices this is the kind of thing you want in this room deep green its rich and its restful shed been thinking along those lines going into interior decorating murdoch you work on enough houses you get ideas for what works his eyes as rich and deep and green as the paint hed chosen latched on to hers and when you put time and effort and creativity into rehabbing a house then the owners screw it up with the colors and furnishings it ticks you off damn it she agreed again this was getting dangerous hows your father hes bouncing back but a shadow of concern flickered in his eyes ive never seen him take so long to throw off a cold he said hed been to the doctor hes got a prescription and orders to take it easy for another week or two thats sensible understanding nothing better than she understood family love and concern julia laid a hand on cullums knee oh hell be fine hes as tough as they come he keeps saying hes getting old damn it hes only sixty hes just feeling sorry for himself im the same way when im sick she gave his knee a comforting squeeze dont worry he asked about you and the project she was smiling at him a rare event cullum discovered he wanted to draw it out a little longer he made noises about coming by taking it off my hands but hes just not up to it lets not bother him with it im sure we can get through one rehab together without one of us bricking the other up behind a wall in the basement we can try he skimmed a finger up her calf watched her eyes pop wide and flashed a grin keep your hands to yourself buster youve got yours on my knee he noted patting it she snatched it back fuming it serves me right for trying to be friendly get out of my bed im not in it he pointed out im on it and to tell you the truth up until now i hadnt thought about getting into it youve presented me with a whole new world of possibilities murdoch the day you get in my bed is the day theyre building snowmen in hell he didnt know what pushed him to it ego or desire perhaps a mixture of both but he leaned toward her until their faces were close their eyes locked their mouths a breath apart bet her blood was an ocean roar in her head and her pride shuddered at the fact that for even one tiny instant shed been excited tempted unlike you i dont wager on sex and unlike you i wont consider getting horizontal with someone i can barely tolerate when were vertical because hed seen that quick flare of interest in her eyes he was satisfied with a shrug he got off the bed i still like your legs macgregor theyre definitely topoftheline legs he walked out leaving her vowing to cover up every inch of them anytime she was around him and then he tried to bet me that id sleep with him two days later and julia was still fuming over it she paced her bedroom while her cousin laura cuddled her threemonthold son on her shoulder he was just trying to annoy you satisfied young daniel was fed dry and sleeping laura settled him into the portable crib julia had already set up near the window he knows how easy it is im not easily irritated julia corrected except by cullum murdoch exactly just ignore him julia youve said yourself he does wonderful work take the ends ignore the means youre right youre right julia closed her eyes ordered herself to settle the sound of work in progress was muffled by the closed bedroom door she kept it closed now at all times he doesnt even exist there she opened her eyes again and smiled gone i sent him on the plague train to limbo good one then laura bit her lip and looked down at her peacefully sleeping son are you sure you can do this ill only be a couple hours three at the very most but of course i can im looking forward to having him all to myself julia brushed her fingers over daniels soft black hair hes so beautiful laura and already growing so big i know i hate missing even a minute with him i know i have to settle the nanny business its just so hard i didnt know it would be so hard youre a terrific mommy and royces a terrific daddy daniel makes it easy hes the best baby she sighed shook herself okay okay hell be fine with his aunt jules i brought everything hell need he shouldnt be hungry but theres breast milk in the bottle if he is hell probably sleep nearly as long as im gone theres diapers and his little bear the number of the courthouse it was an effort for laura not to bite her nails two changes of clothes royces and my beeper numbers you know how he likes to be rocked when laura she had to laugh i promise you i will not sell him to gypsies while youre gone im obsessing laura managed a smile ill stop i do appreciate you taking care of him for me this morning my pleasure i dont have any appointments so daniel and i will just admire each other until you get back it took another ten minutes but julia finally managed to boot laura out the door then rubbing her hands together she walked back to the crib alone at last angel i sure hope you dont sleep the morning away two hours later she bitterly regretted those words the angel was screaming like a banshee shed tried the bottle the bear the rocking the walking the singing nothing worked his adorable little face remained red and furious as he exercised his lungs at full volume what are you doing beating him with daniel hugged to her chest she whirled when the door opened and snarled at cullum yes its one of my favorite pastimes especially when they are small defenseless babies go away come on sweetheart hush now is he wet no hes not wet do i look like an idiot with her free hand she scooped the hair out of her eyes he didnt want the bottle he doesnt want to be rocked and ive walked from here to oklahoma but it doesnt help lets see he rolled his eyes when julia held daniel away from him defensively come on jules i havent dropped a baby in at least two months here we go big guy he pried the screaming baby out of her exhausted arms whats the matter little fella julia blinked at the image the lanky man with tousled goldstreaked hair a tool belt slung at his narrow hips a faded denim work shirt with the sleeves rolled up past the elbows of welltoned arms and a baby cradled in them as naturally as air probably teething how do you know because ive got three nieces thanks to my sister and every one of them has teeth your cousin bring anything for him to chew on she brought everything else ill look while she did cullum offered daniel his knuckle the baby immediately began to gnaw if your gums were this swollen he told her youd be crying too here frazzled julia held out a blue teething ring when cullum slipped it into daniels mouth the screaming stopped now there was just whimpering and a tiny tearstreaked face thats some better isnt it cullum murmured and traced a fingertip over daniels cheek his eyes were warm deep green as he smiled down at the baby god hes cute you like babies whats not to like he swung the baby up making julias heart stop and daniel gurgle with the beginnings of a laugh youve just got to take his mind off his gums cullum told her jiggling giggles out of daniel as he held him high overhead want to go down with the guys champ you cant take him downstairs the dust the noise still grinning into daniels face cullum shook his head women always worrying about a little dust hell like it babies like motion and sound it stimulates he perched the now busily chewing baby on his hip and then well go in the kitchen for lunch a beer and a meatball sandwich she didnt mean to grin it just happened they were both watching her the bigeyed baby the cooleyed man well maybe just for a minute but he cant run the power saw bummer he planted a kiss on top of daniels head you coming or do you trust me with him surprisingly i trust you with him but im coming anyway she snagged a burp cloth he spits up a lot she explained whats a little spit between real men cullum i she hesitated didnt notice his amused surprise she never called him by his first name i really appreciate it i was about to tear out my hair nice hair he said as his gaze swept over it it would have been a shame come on he held out a hand lets go see what the kid thinks of the job so far her hand was in his before she could think about it and then it seemed rude to take it back youre making good progress do you think youll be able to start on the master bedroom next week thats the plan the noise rose as they headed for the stairs ill get the furniture out over the weekend and move into the bedroom down the hall well do it tile guys nearly finished with the powder room down here i know it wasnt a priority but he was available you liked his work before so i wanted to get him before he started another job great ill be sure to take a look at it you decide yet on the color and material for your kitchen counters yes just yesterday ive got the tape upstairs i bet you do what did you go with slateblue ceramic fourinch tiles navy grout not bad it would be stunning yo cullum one of the carpenters came out of the expanded parlor you want to take a look at this before we nail yeah be right there here let me take him their arms brushed as the baby passed between them go ahead well watch at a safe distance he gave daniel a flick on the nose dont forget the brew and meatballs pal he said and headed off well that was unexpected wasnt it she murmured shifting daniel to rest him against her shoulder whod have thought such an annoying man could be so sweet with a baby patting daniels back she moved to the doorway the wall was gone the room wide and full of light and full of men noise and tools nothing pleased her more than watching the stages of a job walking into a perfect home just wasnt enough it was so much more satisfying to see a space and calculate the changes that could be made to enhance to take action and to see step by step those changes taking place drop cloths covered the floor sawhorses held boards ready to be cut to size the mason knelt at the hearth perfecting the repointing of stone in the new opening cullum stood with two men he had his hands tucked in his back pockets as they discussed the trim for the archway that joined the rooms he laughed and the sound was all male all male julia thought with a quick thrill that was the way to describe him his hand had been hard and rough with calluses when it took hers hed smelled of sawdust and sweat the muscles in his arms were lean and hard from use and the way the denim fit over his hips was delicious oh my she hissed out a breath what was she doing noticing how his jeans fit and what did she care if there was a thin gold ring around his pupils before the dark and misty green took over she wasnt the least bit interested in him as a man he was simply a paid laborer then he turned around grinned that crooked grin at her winked at the baby her heart bumped hard once then twice against her ribs she was suddenly very grateful she hadnt taken him up on that bet chapter contents prev next julias day had started with a breakfast speech for the boston businesswomens association at one shed been guest lecturer at a political science forum at harvard that evening she would be the dinner speaker at a real estate convention she didnt mind giving speeches it was just talking after all and giving opinions shed always considered herself good at both the eight years she spent as first daughter had given her intense onthejob training in how to handle people crowds media she agreed to such events several times a year and tried to group them into one or two days her schedule was tight but by late afternoon she was combing the antique stores hunting for doorknobs she hadnt been satisfied with the available hardware her new plan was to go for variety every door in the house would have a different and unique look by the time she was finished she bagged oval brass faceted glass smooth wood glossy enamel there were hooks and knobs and wonderful shapes and textures by the time she was finished she had more than three dozen different doorclosing implements in her box and some were already labeled for location on her way home she detoured by murdoch and sons she knew how michael murdoch enjoyed talking salvage she could entertain him see for herself how he was feeling and dump the hardware all in one short visit she drove through the industrial center as at home there amid the low buildings and huge trucks as she was in beacon hills tony neighborhood she beeped her horn sent out a friendly wave when she passed people she knew she pulled into murdochs pleased to see that michaels battered chevy pickup was in the small lot she hefted her box grunting only a little under its weight she was still wearing her publicappearance suit giving the men in the area the opportunity to send out the obligatory whistles she took it all with a careless grin and a wave she knew most of the guys by name had worked with many of them the outer office was small and comfortably untidy manning the ancient metal desk was a woman who wore a trio of pencils in her hair a murdoch and sons tshirt and a slightly harassed smile julia dont you look fresh and sunny hi meg busy day rolling her eyes meg answered the shrilling phone murdoch and sons please hold she let out a little sigh as she punched the hold button business is good which means i hear phones ringing in my sleep what can we do for you ive got some things i want to show the boss julia jiggled the box is he free for you are you kidding go right on back thanks hows he doing moving a little slow yet but hell get back on track seeing you will perk him up ill buzz him tell him youre on your way great i wont tire him out julia promised and shifting the box again started toward the short hallway that led to the offices it surprised her to find michaels door closed open doors were part of the murdoch style concerned she managed to free a hand and knock concern was slipping toward worry when the door opened he was flushed and looked a little clammy hed had to move like the wind when meg buzzed him the footlong hot dog with the works that hed smuggled in and been about to enjoy was now shoved into a filecabinet drawer along with his liter of dr pepper the handheld electronic game hed borrowed from his granddaughter had gone in with it and so had a generous slab of doublefudgechocolate cake such things he knew didnt jibe with his image as a sick old man julia he didnt have to make his voice breathless and weak nerves did that for him so nice of you to come by to see me mr murdoch instantly concerned she dumped the box on his desk and took his hands he looked feverish and shaky you should be home in bed oh im fine fine he added a quick wheezing cough which he thought was inspired im taking it easy honey time was a damn stupid chest cold wouldnt have gotten me down like this i thought it was a head cold oh hell he thought its gone into my chest lets sit down she took his arm to lead him to a chair for a moment she was certain she smelled onions but she dismissed the thought michael sighed heavily tell me hows my boy doing by you she had a few complaints chief among them the fact that cullum still questioned every one of her choices and demands but she smiled the projects coming right along of course id rather have you than anyone handsome he chuckled squeezed her hand a man couldnt ask for a more perfect daughterinlaw he decided if shed been handpicked and of course she had been cullums the best at what he does well he was certainly taught by the best michael grinned waving away the compliment youre going to turn my head now what have you brought me there in the box treasures oh im so jazzed about this mr murdoch ive been hunting doorknobs his eyes lit well lets have a look for twenty minutes they played with her new toys discussed and speculated on age and history debated the choices of doors they would grace julia gleefully shifted labels added more my bedroom doors a wonderful old oak biblestyle one of the few original ones left in the place after those peasants who owned it last got done you saw how they painted the moldings michael nodded sadly a crime a sin did cullum tell you theyd slapped linoleum down over the original pine floor in the kitchen she heated up just thinking about it it was in ragged shape certainly but itll refinish itll be gorgeous she waved a hand anyway dont you think this glass knob with the vertical carving would be perfect for the bedroom door absolutely she flashed a smile i just love dealing with someone who agrees with me oh lord look at the time ive got to get home and change you going out tonight a little probing never hurt he thought do you have a new beau no new beau but i do have a dinner thing at seventhirty why dont you leave your knobs here and ill give cullum the box hell see to it for you terrific i cant wait to see how theyll look she leaned over to kiss his cheek and you take care of yourself mr murdoch i want you dancing at my housechristening party ill be there he sat back as she went out and grinned to himself a little plot was working in his head cagily he rose slowly pushed his door shut then he danced to the file cabinet and pulled out his early dinner hed eat while he talked to daniel macgregor and worked the kinks out of the latest plan damn fussy impatient irritating woman cullum muttered as he aligned the glass knob in the door oh shed been clever to go to his father with her demands because if shed come to him instead hed have given her a piece of reality what the hell was she thinking of planning a party while the house was a construction zone probably thought it would be a lark having crowds of her fancy friends wandering around on drop cloths eating canapés and commenting on halfplastered ceilings and she had to have her damn doorknobs on he didnt mind working overtime he didnt mind doing punchout jobs himself when it was time for punchout jobs but he did mind being maneuvered into a corner hed had no choice but to agree to take the box go over to julias while she was out kicking up her heels and get the knobs on not with his father asking him to indulge one of their best clients not when his father looked so tired and weak i can go over and take care of it myself cullum if youre busy sure cullum said between his teeth like id send him over here to work at nine oclock at night so he could pass out cold on the floor it was nearly eleven now and he was almost done his temper had risen steadily as he moved from door to door it didnt matter that he found her idea of unique antique knobs throughout the house inspired her methods tipped the scales she was he thought again a spoiled arrogant selfcentered female hadnt he always thought so hed been stupid to think that maybe there was something else there the way shed held that baby the way she laughed with the men or brought in boxes of doughnuts gallons of coffee to offer them she learned their names and little personal details and always found a moment or two to compliment a man on his work just politics he thought now he heard the front door open and smiled grimly so the party girl was home he thought he hoped shed had a high old time because she was about to hear just what cullum murdoch thought of her hed reached the top of the stairs before he heard voices in the foyer julias and a mans it made him sneer brought one of her pretty boys home he supposed and indulging himself moved quietly forward until he could see them tod im really tired ive had a long day you wouldnt send me off without one drink she sighed tried not to be annoyed shed dated tod on and off mostly off for six months and she was ashamed to admit that his main qualifications were that he looked terrific in black tie and could schmooze his way cheerfully through even the most boring of social affairs she supposed she owed him a drink for that alone all right she removed her wrap revealing the sleek black evening dress she wore beneath what would you like what id really like he moved smoothly slipping his arms around her waist lowering his mouth to hers before she could do more than register annoyance she didnt protest or respond shed already discovered to her mild disappointment that kissing tod did absolutely nothing to bump up her blood pressure or her pulse rate it was pleasant enough but so was a good book tod im tired so ill wake you up a little his hands stroked up her back where two thin straps crossed over flesh ive been wanting to ive been wanting you julia im sorry its just not the irritation came now and a few muffled alarm bells he tightened his grip and his mouth grew hard and demanding she lifted her arms to push him gently away then felt his hands cup her bottom and squeeze her push wasnt gentle anymore no julia still smiling he reached out to toy with her slim shoulder strap lets stop playing games here she set her teeth as his fingertip trailed down toward her breast which part of no didnt you understand he stopped smiling look youve been stringing me along for months ive been patient but now im tired of waiting her eyes narrowed and sparked oh well in that case i should just lie back and let you have a go how ridiculous of me to think that sex involves two interested people you know damn well youre interested youre not going to tell me you wore that dress tonight to impress a bunch of realtors that snapped it she turned walked to the door and opened it no im not i wore it because i liked it and the last i heard a woman is free to dress as she chooses now id advise you to leave before i do what i really want to do which is punch your caps out you really are a cold and frigid bitch he said as he walked past her she slammed the door then shut her eyes as her breath began to heave what a jerk and i thought he was such a nice guy her eyes popped open and the temper in them only sharpened with embarrassment as she saw cullum come down the stairs what the hell are you doing in my house my job when he realized his fist was still clenched the fist hed been ready to plow into tods posterboy face he loosened it shed handled herself like a champ cullum thought and he admired her style even more now that he could see how shaken she was it is a killer dress he said hoping to soothe her her spine snapped straight go to hell hey gently he touched a hand to her arm before she could stalk past him concern deepened his voice and the color of his eyes sorry wrong angle you ought to sit down jules youre shaking im angry dont blame you he was a jerk but you handled it humiliation warred with temper you got a real eyeful didnt you murdoch look im sorry to have been your audience for that little play but its your own fault oh is it transferring her rage from tod to cullum was effortless she jabbed a finger into his chest hard enough to rock him back on his heels and i suppose any woman who makes herself look attractive is just asking for it the minute she dabs on perfume shes really saying take me you wild man im not talking about the damn dress im talking about the damn doorknobs doorknobs at her wits end she dragged her hands through her hair have i lost my mind or have you youre the one who had to have the doorknobs on tonight now his eyes sparked with temper youre the one who came by the shop whining to my father about some ridiculous party youre having do you think i want to work until nearly midnight she pressed her fingers to her temples unsurprised by the headache raging there then held out her hands wait i did go by to see your father i wanted to see how he was doing id been antiquing i took the knobs by so we could play with them together and so you could wheedle him into pushing work forward to accommodate your party what party she threw up her hands now im not having a party how can i have a party when the house is in the middle of rehab i dont know what she trailed off then shut her eyes oh i get it look i need some aspirin without waiting to see if hed follow she headed back into the kitchen giving cullum a very distracting view of bare back and slim hips it was a killer dress all right he thought resentfully it was murdering him she found a bottle in the cupboard poured a glass of water and downed three pills okay there was a misunderstanding i took the knobs by and i did say something about not being able to wait to see how they looked on the doors i didnt mean i couldnt wait you know what i mean frowning a bit he nodded okay and i did mention a party im planning on christening the house with one but not until new years eve i wasnt specific i just said i wanted him well enough to dance at my party he must have mixed it up it wasnt like his father to confuse details but then cullum admitted his father hadnt been himself for a month okay i get it crossed wires thats all im sorry you were dragged out here tonight not that big a deal i got some of the knobs on you want to take a look she worked up a smile sure how about that one he jerked his thumb toward the kitchen door and had to smile when she made a little hum of pleasure oh its perfect i knew the enameled knobs were made for this door she hurried closer to admire the delicately painted bluebells against white enamel i love little details like this its what makes a home special yeah ive got to admit it works he was leaning over her shoulder to study the knob himself then she straightened and they were suddenly facetoface and eyetoeye close close enough for her to see that fascinating gold ring around his misty green irises close enough for her blood to heat and stir her heart bounced hard and high i appreciate you seeing to it her scent was clogging his brain like i said no big deal he wanted that mouth and a great deal more than that he tried to remind himself how disgusted hed been with the jerk tod but that mouth looked so soft so generous so very tempting id better get going yeah her throat was heated and dry with lust what the hell was wrong with her the pressure built up in her chest as they stood there not quite touching but she couldnt seem to order herself to breathe ill see you out i know the way fine they moved abruptly and somehow their lips met their mouths tangled heat speared upward and spread like wildfire as teeth scraped tongues touched his hard rangy body pressed her lush curves against the door her body strained forward to better mesh with his his hands streaked up her sides the heels pressing the sides of her breasts until her system screamed for full possession busily her fingers raked through his overlong goldtipped hair this is crazy she said breathlessly insane he fastened his mouth on her throat desperate for the taste of flesh she smelled he thought like hot smoldering sin cullum we cant do this i know she fisted a hand in his hair dragging his head up until her mouth could fuse with his again they plundered each of them equally greedy until all but gasping for air they broke apart this is not happening and it cant work she had to brace herself against the door or simply slide bonelessly to the floor no way can it work he wanted wildly wanted to get to the body under that silk this is just a temporary lapse right he had to take a step back but he couldnt take his eyes off her face i really want you jules oh hell she pressed a hand to her thundering heart we need to think about something else anything else why couldnt she breathe listen we dont even like each other cullum its tough caring about that at the moment but yes okay her face was flushed her eyes smoking and he realized with shock and embarrassment his knees were shaking if we do what were both thinking about doing right now well really hate ourselves and each other in the morning of course i feel obliged to point out its a while yet till morning she was grateful she could smile wed better give this a wide pass chalk it up to stress and hormones and whatever watching him she eased away from the door giving him space to get by itll probably go away we can hope cullum started to open the door god knew he needed air and space what if it doesnt julia i dont know he studied her for another moment wondered if she could possibly be as baffled and aroused as he me either he decided and got out fast chapter contents prev next julia found dozens of things to keep her occupied and out of cullums way for the next few weeks autumn had taken over new england with its exceptional style trees roared with color and as they passed their peak the air took on a snap that hinted slyly of winter she looked at properties put in bids she dropped by her cousins office visited with laura and her aunt and uncle had lunch with friends she shopped scouring the stores for christmas presents and for baby gifts her cousin gwen was three months pregnant the threefoot stuffed saint bernard was the perfect excuse to drop by the house she and gwen and laura had once shared she found gwen at home poring over cookbooks what are you doing gwen smiled helplessly running a nervous hand through her reddishgold cap of hair i really think its time i learned to cook at least a couple of standard meals dr blade oops dr maguire julia plopped down at the kitchen table why well im going to have three months maternity leave ill be home i should she gestured vaguely do home things does branson care if you can whip up a meat loaf no of course not i do its the oddest thing she ran a hand over her stillflat belly i suppose its part of the whole nesting process in any case im a surgeon im a scientist certainly i can figure out the basic formula for say meat loaf and deliver an edible product resting her elbows on the table she cupped her chin in her hands and grinned at the huge stuffed dog i like your new pet me too i was thinking my upcoming niece or nephew would take good care of him thats so sweet julia did i tell you were planning on doing an animal theme in the nursery no more than ten or fifteen times no need to ask how youre feeling she added you look great i feel great ive never been happier in my life and ive had a very happy life the hospital work isnt too much its what i want it fuels me and satisfies me you want some coffee im off caffeine but no i dont want anything how about you hows the house going coming right along my bedrooms finished and its fabulous weve got a long way to go on the rest but its moving theyre working on the kitchen now gwen angled her head studying julias face what is it whats what whats under it youve got something on your mind i can see it its nothing but she pushed away from the table to pace its silly not if its bothering you its not really bothering me its surprising me this was why shed come after all julia admitted and dropped back down into the chair you know cullum murdoch yes of course hes the son of grandpas old friend construction they did some work on this place when we first bought it right well hes the head contractor on my job now i dont get along with him personality clash i suppose then why is he working on your house long story and not the point julia brushed it away with her fingers a couple of weeks ago we were alone in the house and it was late and oh gwen bit the inside of her lip i see no you dont julia huffed out a breath it was just a sudden animal attraction and we didnt follow through on it we agreed it would be a mistake because you dont get along that and weve got this professional relationship i adore his father thats just one more thing if cullum and i ended up in bed to well sort of flush this out of our systems lets say i dont know how id face mr murdoch as i remember mr murdoch hes a sensible man who loves his son i cant imagine hed be shocked that the two of you find each other attractive finding someone attractive isnt a license to tear up the sheets with him julia blew out a breath gwen i really want to tear up the sheets with cullum is he a decent man decent well yes i suppose does he have humor intelligence kindness hes she remembered the way hed held little daniel yes its just that we butt heads hes very opinionated and stubborn oh gwen didnt bother to suppress the laugh just let it roll and of course youre so flexible and openminded compared to him i am julia said defensively then laughed at herself okay thats probably the root of the problem we both know our own minds and have no problem pushing our opinions on others he can be right occasionally its just that im right more she leaned forward hes got these incredible hands wide and rough and really strong i think about them a lot and you wish they were attached to the arms of a more amenable man she started to agree then debated with herself im not sure i would have said so a month ago now im starting to find even the abrasiveness appealing sexy i think i need to get away for a few days well that couldnt hurt but ive never known anyone more sure of their own mind and heart than you or more willing to risk going after what she wants if you end up wanting cullum id tell you to be careful to protect yourself but to trust yourself good advice julia skimmed her hair back from her face it may be a good time for me to visit my parents in washington for a few days a little distance couldnt hurt and theres some property down there i want to check on anyway be sure to give them my love and she smiled wickedly be sure to keep me uptodate on the murdoch project it was a good way to think of it julia decided as she pulled up in front of her house the murdoch project she was an expert on projects figuring the angles the profit and loss the effort and time that was exactly what she was going to do she thought she would figure the angles calculate what she could gain or lose and how much effect cullum murdoch would have on her life and she was going to do it from a nice safe distance she walked inside gave an absent wave to some of the workmen and headed upstairs to pack it would be great to surprise her parents to just drop in for a few days she really hadnt spent any time alone with them in nearly a year for the most part they got together with most or all of the family and that was more a riot than a visit tapping her foot she contemplated her wardrobe she adored the walkin closet the space and organization to her it was much more practical in this incarnation than it had been as a dressing room she selected casual clothes blazers slacks one basic dinner dress and was carrying them toward the bed to the open suitcase when cullum walked in he lifted his brow going somewhere as a matter of fact yes and i dont believe i heard you knock you forgot to close the door this time oh she laid the clothes on the bed and walked back into the closet hed never known a single female to own so many clothes and the shoes didnt she have the standard two feet but hed already told her his opinion on this a couple of times and he felt it was likely to be a waste of time to repeat it where are you going it was her turn to lift a brow out of town for how long she brushed by him to take her choice of sweaters and blouses to the bed excuse me but why would you think thats any of your business because were in the middle of a major rehab i dont want you coming back and whining that something didnt turn out the way you wanted i dont whine how could she possibly be attracted to someone so irritating she wondered and moved to her duncan phyfe bureau for lingerie where can you be reached ill call in regularly look macgregor he had to stop himself pull back a step he didnt know why the sight of her packing a few clothes sent him into a panic hed been wanting to get rid of her for weeks the kitchen cabinets are coming in next week if youre not here to approve the delivery ill be back by then without a hint of embarrassment she folded frothylooking bras and panties into a silk lingerie bag if you must know im just going to dc for a few days something wrong with your parents she softened there was no denying the quick and sincere concern in his voice no theyre fine they dont even know im coming then why cant it wait until the kitchens wrapped its the biggest part of the project if you start wanting us to tear out work you have my tapes ive made it perfectly clear what i want done and if youll recall most of the kitchen remodeling is of your design which is why i dont want to take the heat if you change your mind i do not change my mind once ive made up my mind she slapped the silk bag into the suitcase get off my back murdoch i come and go as i please he felt the snap in the air all too familiar now slowly he turned shut the door what are you doing insuring some privacy he studied her objectively he told himself she was flushed with temper why that look suited her so well why it made his blood swim he didnt know it just was she had her hand clenched at her side as if ready to do battle pretty colored rings glittered on it her hair was loose tumbling over the shoulders of a dark green jacket that molded her curves she always wore soft clothes he mused the kind that drove a man crazy wanting to get under them and there it was he admitted he still wanted to get under them is this impromptu trip a way of running from that thing that went on a couple weeks ago her head angled her voice went regally cool i dont know what thing you could be referring to the thing where we nearly ended up naked on your kitchen floor that was a lapse she snapped hating herself for wishing they had just so that the tension in her gut would be gone we agreed we did but was it we agreed she repeated stubbornly then surprised herself by backing up when he stepped forward stay away from me for the first time in weeks he felt an easy smile curve his lips why nervous i dont want you to touch me who said i was going to touch you im just asking a question one thing ive never been able to fault you for is honesty you always tell it like it is so im asking was it a lapse for you i dont know she nearly shouted it then whirled around to begin hurling clothes into the suitcase it should have been im not running away from anything i just want to have some distance to see my parents to get the hell away from you before we do something stupid okay thats honest so ill be just as honest i dont mind getting away from you for a while either seeing you every day is difficult her hands calmed carefully smoothed out a wrinkled blouse is it more difficult than i figured it would be i keep imagining what it might be like if we had another lapse because shed never been a coward or a liar she turned back to face him he had such a strong face she thought all angles and planes set off by that firm mouth and compelling eyes i suppose ive wondered the same thing her lips curved upward whats wrong with us damned if i know this time when he stepped forward she stayed where she was do you still not want me to touch you she let out an uneven breath its the middle of the day what could it hurt lets find out his hands slid up that cloudsoft jacket then under it until they moved firmly up her back to draw her against him eyes open this time jules though he hadnt meant it literally they watched each other as their mouths met she saw his eyes darken saw herself trapped in that deepening green experimentally she changed the angle of the kiss their lips touching testing now hesitating and with every second that passed her heart picked up its rhythm he ached and the taste of her had the ache centering in his gut and radiating out to his fingers he toyed with her mouth taking his time though the blood was roaring in his head gradually gradually he saw her eyes cloud her lashes flutter and he swallowed the catchy sigh that slipped from her lips i need to touch you even as he said it his hands skimmed over her breasts cupped them possessed he knew hed never felt anything more erotic than the way her nipples pressed hard against his palms through the thin silk a strangled moan a flood of need her head fell back in a limp surrender that staggered them both you have to oh cullum youve got such hands they were on her flesh now her blouse open the front hook of her bra flicked apart with her heart pounding against his palm he forgot the men working downstairs the job needing to be done the consequences of what he so desperately wanted to do now he savaged her throat her mouth right now yes no panic excitement desire all twisted inside her wait what are we doing shuddering she pulled back dragged the open blouse together we cant here like this we just cant he did his best to imagine a bucket of cold water splashed in his face an icy waterfall raining over his head anything to help him cool off the best he could do was shove his hands in his pockets before they started ripping at her clothes okay he said as calmly as possible but jules youll have to admit that was a little more than a lapse ive got to stay away from you she clutched her blouse tighter beneath it her breasts were still tingling from his hands we need to take a break then we need to decide if this is going to happen i think weve just answered that part of the question cullum said dryly all right this is going to happen so we have to figure out how to handle it well go to our respective corners so to speak for a few days you can outline what your thoughts on this are and ill do the same when i come back we can negotiate terms he finished for her in a way we certainly have to have some groundwork here so we know how well deal with after it was sensible and it annoyed the hell out of him okay macgregor you work up your proposal and ill work up mine well have a meeting on it when you get back theres no need to get testy he stared at her there she was he thought her hair rumpled her blouse undone her mouth swollen from his and she didnt think he should get testy because she was turning it into a business deal have a good trip macgregor cullum she sighed once when he stopped with his hand on the door and shot her a fiery look i have a professional and a personal relationship with your father and with you its important to me not to compromise it he could think of nothing he wanted to say to that and only nodded briefly and walked out alone she sat on the edge of the bed and waited for her system to level unless she was very much mistaken her murdoch project had taken a sharp detour and might very well already be hopelessly compromised chapter contents prev next julia loved the elegant row house in georgetown she had started life there then after an eightyear residence at another washington address had spent the last of her teenage years in the loftyceilinged and airy rooms she had no complaints about the time when shed been able to play in the rose garden or entertain her cousins in the private theater her parents against all odds had made that pennsylvania avenue mansion a home for their children shed been given the opportunity to travel all over the world and been taught a sense of responsibility for her neighbors whether they lived next door or across an ocean she could remember even now the warm rush of pride shed felt when she saw her father man the desk in the oval office or when she watched her mother rise to a thunder of applause before she gave one of a thousand speeches on human rights shed tolerated the omnipresence of the secret service something that had become particularly smothering during her teenage years shed accepted the restrictions the impossibility of just dashing off to shop with friends or share pizza and foolishness at some local restaurant her parents had done their best to provide areas of normalcy for julia and her brother but julia had always known she came from greatness and such miracles had a price she remembered the day they had moved back into the home of her early childhood how her mother had hugged them all then grinned and told them that they were all going out for pizza and a movie it had been one of the sweetest nights of julias life now she stood on the sidewalk as her cab drove off the house still drew her still comforted she knew she bought and sold houses to give herself that comfort time and time again and then to pass it on to others love needed a home to shelter it and she had been so fortunate in hers she hefted her bag and walked up the few brick steps then rolled the bag behind her down the narrow walk the fall flowers were fading she mused their autumn brightness dulling as winter blew close in a bit more than a month the house would gleam with colored lights a wreath would hang on the tall front door and a fresh pine tree laden with ornaments made by her family would shine through the graceful front window memories such as those were welcoming she knocked using the brass crest of the macgregors to thump on the door the crowned lion eyed her fiercely and made her think of her grandfather when the door opened julia beamed at the small tidy woman who stood there boxy dont you ever change miss julia elizabeth boxlieter threw her short arms around julia and squeezed boxy had served a multitude of functions for the macgregors over a fifteenyear period administrative assistant to mrs macgregor had been her title during the white house era but what she did was manage everything boxy drew back and even though pleasure sparkled in her eyes she wagged a scolding finger you didnt let anyone know you were coming didnt give us a minutes notice what if wed been away then id have let myself in and felt very sorry for myself with a laugh julia ducked down to kiss boxys cheek i wanted to surprise all of you mom and dad are home arent they as it happens boxy shut the front door your father is just back from camp david i swear they wont leave the man alone always asking him to negotiate this advise on that well someone has to keep the free world safe dont they he did more than his share the man should be able to go off fishing for a month dad doesnt fish what difference does that make hes up in his office on an overseas call and your mother is back in her workroom ill interrupt mom julia decided then well interrupt dad dont carry that suitcase up boxy she said as she started down the hall ill take it myself in a few minutes boxy huffed as if shed leave luggage cluttering up the foyer and taking the suitcase she went upstairs shelby macgregors workroom was a converted summer kitchen that offered space for her potters wheel and kiln her worktable and supplies throughout her husbands administration she had continued as a working artist as much to satisfy her need to create as to make a statement on the human right to pursue a career now the former first lady was perched on a stool at her wheel throwing a pot her hands were slicked with clay to the wrists her forearms speckled her dark red hair was bundled messily on top of her head and her smokegray eyes were dark with concentration music played in the background a somewhat violent concerto as julia watched the clay formed under her mothers clever hands changing from a shapeless mass elongating slimming becoming an elegant vessel julia leaned on the doorjamb and waited not bad shelby muttered rolling her head and working the kinks out of her neck as she stopped the wheel itll be beautiful theyre always beautiful julia shelby popped up and was halfway to her daughter before she stopped oh im a mess she said with a laugh holding out her coated hands here you kiss me julia obliged pressed her lips to her mothers cheeks in turn this is a surprise a good one i hope the best let me wash up so i can hug you have you seen your father shelby asked as she hurried to a sink to scrub the clay from her hands and arms no boxy said he was on the phone so i came back to interrupt you first well he needs a break so well doubleteam him she dried off quickly then turned around to throw her arms around julia oh ive missed you youll have to tell me everything thats new and wonderful how are your cousins little daniel hows the house going how long can you stay are you hungry answer any or all of the above questions in the order of your choice laughing julia walked arm in arm with her mother up the back stairs lets see the cousins are wonderful laura looks like a madonna with young daniel and gwens glowing like an angel i ate something remotely like food on the plane and i can only stay a couple of days the house its going very well shelby noted the hesitation decided to probe its cause shortly she turned toward her husbands office gave what passed for a knock and opened the door alan macgregor sat behind his desk his hair had gone a rich silver and the sunlight that poured through the window glinted off it as always julia thought him the handsomest man in the world and she watched as those lines of care around his dark eyes turned to lines of joy the phone still at his ear he got to his feet held out his hand ill consider it yes seriously consider it he wrapped his arm around his daughter brought her close to his side im sorry senator ill have to get back to you somethings come up here yes i will he hung up and turning gathered julia close something irresistible he murmured kissing the top of her head within an hour julia was stretched out in front of the fire in the family parlor sipping an excellent white wine and more relaxed than shed been for weeks her instincts in coming home had been right on target she decided this is wonderful she rested her head against the arm of her fathers chair all but purring when he stroked her hair is boxy going insane canceling your evening obligations only one dinner party shelby told her a really tedious one im delighted to be able to stay home she crossed her bare feet at the ankles the quick glance she sent alan was a signal picking it up alan ruffled julias hair are you used to living on your own yet i miss them she admitted laura gwen and i were a trio for so long i still see them all the time but its not the same alan finished for her no its not in some ways its better theyre so happy its a kick to see it are you happy yes she turned her head so that she could smile up at him yes i am i love where i am and what im doing how im doing it right now im having tremendous fun watching the house come together there shelby thought was her opening i cant wait to see it she smiled at her husband as the conversational relay baton was passed smoothly how far along are you my bedrooms finished it was a priority for me of course i had to butt heads with murdoch over getting the subs in to paint and paper but i am the one writing the check absolutely not mr murdoch shelby noted but murdoch that would be the son having some trouble with your head contractor a bit its cullum murdoch im working with on this his fathers not quite well michael concerned alan straightened in his chair whats wrong he caught a nasty summer cold and it took him some time to shake it hes on the mend but cullums already hipdeep in the job so she trailed off with a shrug he does excellent work its just that we clash styles i suppose he wants it done his way i want it done mine simple as that julia drained her wine a took a deep breath im thinking about becoming involved with him oh it was a quick little stab just under the heart instinctively shelby rubbed a hand over the ache but if you dont get along thats one level letting out a little sigh julia stretched out her legs on another level we appear to get along like gangbusters the physical level isnt enough shelby interjected then fought to stem her panic as alan sent her a warm amused look it appears your mother is thinking about another lovely young woman who tried to convince herself she couldnt get along with a certain young man on a particular level his dark eyes glinted when he grinned so i seduced her alan caught between laughter and concern shelby shook her head this is our little girl here and i dont think either one of us wants her seduced by a murdoch sounds more like the macgregor than the macgregor alan murmured to his daughter and watched the warriors light he loved flash in his wifes eyes id say that depended on the murdoch he continued and on julia youre a smart woman julia you know right and wrong and whats right for you what seemed right for the moment was to get some distance and to talk to both of you dont worry about me mom she laid a hand on shelbys knee it wouldnt be seduction if i get involved with murdoch itll be with eyes wide open the three of them talked for a while longer and then when julia left to unpack and change shelby turned to her husband alan this is serious hmm he rose to refill his wifes glass dont use that diplomatic hmm on me she scowled up at him over the rim of her glass im not naive enough to believe julia hasnt been involved with a man before but none of them has ever mattered enough to worry her or to have her come to us to talk about it sitting on the arm of her chair alan skimmed a finger along his wifes bangs are you worried that shes in love or in lust both she sighed her little girl she thought her baby she hadnt had enough time to prepare i just think it might be wise if we knew a little more about him my fathers known the murdochs for years alans mouth quirked as he brought his glass up to sip i imagine hes going to be very pleased with the situation it only took shelby an instant she clamped a hand over alans you dont think he arranged this somehow no alan leaned down kissed his wifes scowling mouth until it softened then added im absolutely sure he did chapter contents prev next cullum brooded into his beer while the jukebox tinkled out a song of love gone sour didnt it always he wondered nothing lasted forever if it did hed be out of business dry rot set in or age or simple monotony buildings werent all that much different from people he mused and some were highmaintenance julia macgregor was definitely highmaintenance it was a good thing hed had a couple of days to kick back cool off and come to his senses tangling with her was bound to cost a man and personally he was very careful when it came to investments of any kind the woman wanted to negotiate sex for gods sake draft out contingencies and clauses with the bed as the bargaining table well the hell with that he decided lifting the bottle to his lips he figured if a man and a woman were single healthy and wanted each other negotiations were over so she could just find somebody else to do business with probably would too he thought as his lips curled into a snarl a woman who looked like that she wouldnt have any trouble finding a business partner and what did he mean she looked like that he wondered not even hearing his own sigh she wasnt even really pretty if you thought it through point by point but somehow when the package was put together it slugged a man right between the eyes shed know that fact shed use it to her advantage well it wasnt going to work on him the impulse had passed all right and he was back on track one of the men sidled up to the bar to order a drink and slapped cullum companionably on the back hows it going boss cullums response was a grunt he didnt know why hed let the crew talk him into going for a beer after work he wasnt in the mood to socialize but then he hadnt been in the mood to go home either the fact was he didnt seem to be in any mood except foul sure hope miz macgregor comes back soon the trim carpenter pushed up the brim of the baseball cap he wore and grinned the boys miss seeing her walk through especially when shes wearing one of those little skirts im telling you that woman stands on some classy stilts unaware of the red haze beginning to cloud his bosss vision the carpenter leaned on the bar to sip his cold draft smells good enough to eat too because quite suddenly he wanted to smash the bottle over the edge of the bar and jab the jagged end toward this mans face cullum set the beer down very carefully you keep your mind on your work jamison and off the clients legs well hell cullum jamison began then cleared his throat when he caught the smoldering violence in cullums eyes sure boss just making conversation saying nothing cullum tossed some bills on the bar and rose he walked out before he could do any damage to his crew jamison blew out a breath then chuckled and called over to his friend hey jo looks like the bosss got his eye on miz mcg jo immediately moved over and sat himself down on the recently vacated seat to discuss the new information it would have infuriated cullum to know that his crew spent over an hour grinning and gossiping about him and julia it would have mortified him if he knew those grins and gossip were being spread like chain lighting among the subcontractors by noon the next day there wasnt a man or woman working on the macgregor site who wasnt wondering what was going on with the boss and the client the betting pool was inevitable cullum walked in as twenty dollars passed from one of the men to another but murdoch and sons didnt hire the slowwitted thanks for the loan mike the man pocketed the bill with an easy smile get it back to you on payday hey boss were about ready to put the chair rail up here then lets get to it the dining room would be the most formal room in the house the wainscoting the intricately carved chair rail the trio of tall slim windows and the beautiful coffered ceiling deserved the best he hoped julia wouldnt put lady furniture in it the room wanted big heavy pieces chairs with high backs a table with some age and weight to it she had the little sitting room upstairs and the back parlor for the fancy and the delicate this room wanted strength probably put pansies on the wall he muttered and after hed checked the first run of the rail moved into the kitchen work there was progressing nicely eyes focused on details cullum didnt notice the sly looks and speculative grins sent his way the linoleum had been stripped off the pine beneath protected with drop cloths refinishing it would be one of the last steps in preparation for cabinet installation the walls had been painted he had to approve the toasty yellow julia had chosen it was a warm interesting shade and would go well with the wood the wall had been torn down bringing the side porch into the room even now the windows were being installed it was going to be a good room he decided talking details with his men as he considered the space his design was coming to life such things always gave cullum a flash of satisfaction but this time it was deeper brighter he told himself that if he felt more proprietary this time it was only because he found the house so special it had nothing to do with the owner still he could picture himself coming into the completed kitchen early in the morning thered be pots of herbs under the south window good sun there and he liked having his own fresh herbs when he cooked hed make coffee at the counter he was building himself grind the beans fresh then the room would smell of rosemary coffee and the flowers on the old oak table in the sitting area hed drink the first cup standing up then take the second over to the wroughtiron table that belonged in the corner just there for family meals sunlight would be slipping into the room when julia walked in rumpled and sexy from sleep shed smile at him come over to lean over his shoulder and rub her cheek against his and steal his coffee he was so caught up in the scene that when julia walked in rumpled and sexy from travel he gaped at her what where who why she finished and laughed at him that must have been quite a side trip murdoch she tucked her hands in the pockets of her cashmere blazer and surveyed the room wow progress ill have to take off for a couple of days regularly it really hits you then this is fabulous i knew this paint would work and oh the windows are going to be wonderful give you full points on that ive just seen the side terrace doors theyre perfect just perfect he could only be grateful she was talking so much at the moment he needed more than a minute to find his balance hed decided against her hadnt he so why was he viciously fighting the urge to grab her right this second and kiss her until her bones rattled he was staring at her as if shed walked through the wall julia thought and began to feel her pulse bump and jitter shed considered the matter of their relationship carefully while she was in georgetown all the requirements and details all the demands and rules had been carefully outlined in her mind and now she couldnt think of any of them i guess ill stutter if you keep looking at me that way she thought ah take my stuff upstairs then poke around and see whats up the um the cabinets come in yet day after tomorrow fine good cant wait to see them ill just she waved a hand vaguely go now she turned hurried out then muffled a gasp when he took her arm and walked beside her ill help you take your things up we need to finalize some details on the guest suite not now she decided definitely not now when she couldnt put two rational thoughts together i dont want to interrupt your work and i have some calls to make and wont take long his brow winged up when he saw the pile of luggage at the base of the steps you were only gone three days i knew i was going to shop so i took extra bags she grabbed one to keep her hands busy im more than half done with christmas good for you cullum started to heft the other two bags shook his head at the weight and put his back into it where do you want them santa just up in my room i have to organize everything before i wrap hows your father hes a lot better i think puzzled cullum looked down as half a dozen laborers edged into the foyer to watch him walk upstairs with julia what you guys finish the house while i wasnt looking that sent them scurrying cullum shrugged off the hoots of laughter that followed him up the stairs theyve got to remember to keep windows open while they glue turns them into idiots here just dump them on the bed julia told him and that way the bed would be too crowded to be any sort of temptation to either of them im really anxious to see the the sentence ended against his mouth he had her hauled against him her hair fisted in his hand and her lips captured in a hard greedy kiss before she could take one full breath then breathing didnt seem so very important the bag shed carried fell out of her hand hitting the floor with a thud we have to talk about this she managed shut up jules okay all right with a broken moan she ran her hands up his back hooking them over his shoulders and straining to get closer something jabbed her hip something poked hard into her thigh ouch damn tool belt he muttered and eased his grip before he lacerated her sorry its all right with an unsteady hand she rubbed the slight pinch we have incredibly poor timing look i dont know how much youve thought about this but ive thought about it quite a bit we need to discuss it i want you thats my input into the discussion with a shaky laugh she sidestepped until the chest at the foot of her bed was between them i have a little more to say than that what a surprise we knock off here at fourthirty ill come back at six if you want ill bring dinner dinner sensible she decided maybe we should go out his green gaze stayed locked and heated on hers some other time jules i dont feel much like going through the mating dance of menus and waiters and small talk tonight she nodded slowly so well eat in but we will talk now he smiled a slow sensual curving of lips that sent small delicious chills up her spine wanna bet im serious murdoch so am i macgregor six oclock he repeated before he turned to the door sixthirty she said it was arbitrary she knew but she needed to have some say in the matter understanding her perfectly he shook his head fine then then he lifted a brow are you coming where the guest suite remember oh flustered she brushed at her tousled hair i thought youd just said that for the crew i say what i mean lets go look it over the roughins been inspected and approved she did her best to shift from potential lover to client it irked her that he seemed much more graceful at the segue than she okay then id like to go over the rest of the new work if you have the time he held the door open for her my times your time at least until fourthirty her eyes narrowed on his face as she walked by him why does that sound like a threat murdoch he smiled blandly i couldnt say what it is macgregor is fact at fourfortyfive she watched the last truck cullums naturally pull out less than two hours she thought but this time shed be ready this time he wouldnt get her mind hazed over with sensation before she could speak it theyd discuss the situation rationally negotiate terms that both of them could live with when the affair ended as it undoubtedly would both of them would walk away with minimum fuss and pain they were shed already decided much too much alike to mesh well and the basic lust they were experiencing was entirely too strong and hot to burn for long she didnt want to be hurt at the end of it and she didnt want to hurt him so they would set down rules follow them and enjoy each other while it lasted julia turned away from the window wondering why she suddenly felt so depressed maybe it was because shed been so close to laura and gwen and both of them had tumbled into love so fast with hardly a moment to think or plan or worry about rules but this wasnt love it was chemistry and she remembered enough of that particular science to know that volatile experiments could blow up without careful planning and execution and she wasnt going to end up getting singed still there was no reason in the world not to drive him insane in the meantime nearly two hours she mused more than enough time to complete the indulgent female ritual of preparing for a lover by the time she was finished tough guy cullum murdoch would be putty in her hands chapter contents prev next she was going to melt like butter he was going to see to it though it was tempting to use his key to irritate her cullum knocked on the door at sixthirty hed changed into a navy sweater and fresh jeans no way was she going to think hed fussed over tonight if she knew he was the least bit nervous the least bit anxious it would give her too much of an advantage he liked the fact that julia used her advantages even respected her for it but he wasnt willing to let her get a step ahead or over him he shifted the bag he carried from arm to arm and was reconsidering using his key when she opened the door she didnt look like shed fussed much either which gave her no right to set his pulse rate soaring shed left her hair down curling wildly the way he liked it best it tumbled over the shoulders of a sleek black cat suit that displayed her curves with mouthwatering accuracy shed draped some sort of silver belt fashioned out of big links loosely at her waist her feet were bare she looked like some kind of highclass bohemian with her chocolatecolored eyes thickly lashed and her generous mouth soft and naked youre prompt her unpainted lips curved slowly i like that in a man youre built he smiled with the same lazy coolness i like that in a woman arent we lucky come on in she closed the door behind him and ordered herself to ignore the jitters in her stomach so what did you bring for dinner extra crispy her eyes lit with a quick appreciative humor that had him grinning in response and a nice white bordeaux thatll enhance rather than overwhelm those famous secret herbs and spices whod have thought wed have similar taste in food lets take it upstairs she inclined her head before he could get any ideas about rushing her my rooms the only one in the house with the ambience for dining at the moment unless youd rather sit on a couple of drywallcompound buckets and eat on a sawhorse your rooms fine go ahead up ill see if i can dig up a couple of wineglasses everything we needs in here he patted the bag plastic and paper no use dirtying up dishes while your kitchens torn up excellent point and a considerate one she noted as she turned to start up the steps the works progressing smoothly just takes planning and a little luck im looking at a building downtown it should make into six very nice twobedroom apartments with a little luck and a lot of planning she paused at the door to her room to glance back at him do you think you and your father would be interested if you dont need to get started on it until after the first of the year i havent even bought it yet so itll be at least that long shed built a fire both for warmth and for atmosphere it crackled away behind an ornate brass screen the mantel was crowded with candlesticks and candleholders of varying sizes and materials she hadnt yet lit the tapers and votives she had however lit a fat column of waxy white in the center of the little table in the sitting area very nice the room smelled seductive and so did she cullum set the redandwhite bag on the table wondering if that was her plan to seduce him before he could gain the upper hand it was going to be an interesting night he took out the wine and a corkscrew watching her as he opened the bottle since were being sociable ill tell you that youre doing a hell of a job putting this house together you move fast but you dont rush you put some thought into the pieces you pick up youre making it classy but its still friendly not everyone could pull that off she tried not to gape it was a compliment designed to flatter a woman like her one that touched on mind and style and heart thanks that means a lot to me i grew up in a classy friendly home you grew up in the white house he reminded her and offered her a plastic wineglass filled with strawcolored wine true enough but i was thinking about our house in georgetown still my parents did what they could to make the white house a home must have felt like a fishbowl sometimes often it was surprisingly cozy and intimate if i live there again id work to give my family the same his brows lifted thinking of marrying some future president no im thinking of being some future president she waited for him to choke on his wine to laugh and to make a sarcastic comment instead his eyes narrowed in speculation and he nodded if you do half as well as your father youd be a good one you surprise me again why do my knuckles drag the ground ive thought they did a few times she sat and opened the bag to sniff im ready if you are this time he did laugh to eat she specified mildly and to talk about the rest i dont mind a little dinner conversation they divvied up chicken and french fries on paper plates cullum winced as she waterfalled salt onto both i know she said with a chuckle its disgusting gwen just closes her eyes when we eat together she took a big healthy bite of a drumstick and sighed with pleasure but its so good things that are bad for each other always seem to be cullum could we be very bad for each other could be lifes a gamble agreed i like to gamble but i always figure the odds and options and i always know just how much i can afford to lose and stay comfortable before i play so were attracted to each other for some possibly insane and contrary reason he picked up his wine enjoying her as much as he enjoyed the smooth dry taste agreed speaking for myself i dont take a lover just because im attracted there has to be a little more foundation mutual respect understanding affection i also prefer to go into a relationship with the agreement that if things dont work out both parties will accept and step back and the relationship has to be monogamous for the length of term if either party finds that unsatisfactory the relationship ends no harm no foul amused cullum grinned so if i decide i want a little variety or you do the contract is void exactly and no hard feelings that cuts down on the temptation to lie and cheat i wont tolerate either in any area of my life and certainly not in bed i dont lie it was annoyance that flickered in his eyes this time and i dont cheat i didnt say you did she returned evenly but people often do and the excuse for it invariably comes down to sparing someones feelings i dont need or want my feelings spared fine the first time i want to try my luck with some hot babe ill let you know deliberately he wiped his fingers on a paper napkin and the first time you decide to try yours with some slickfaced guy in a tux well ill have to hurt him the fact that her pulse took a little bump of pleasure infuriated her thats exactly the sort of attitude that doesnt work works for me i get the gist here jules you want respect i respect you your mind and your integrity i understand you well enough youre used to getting your own way and you like to run the show youre pretty good at it and i like you well enough some of the time theres your foundation now let me add some of the trim he topped off their glasses again sat back with his if you want to make deals and contracts try it on someone like that tod you booted out the other night this isnt business and neither of us is going to be able to plan our way through the stages of it we want each other maybe after tonight we wont want each other anymore and thatll be that and if one does and one doesnt thatll be damn bad luck for somebody he rose and taking her hand pulled her to her feet lets find out she wasnt finished yet not nearly but he had already wrestled the controls out of her hands his mouth was firm possessive and gave hers no choice but to open to his on a moan of the purest pleasure shed wanted to light the candles to drive him slowly mad until he agreed to everything but the need sprang free inside her primal and raw seduction on either side would have to wait her hands streaked under his sweater gripping the hard ridge of muscle up his back his strength tantalized her fascinated her she hiked the sweater up dragging it over his head tossing it carelessly aside and was desperate for more i really love your body she managed he tugged the shoulders of the snug suit down latched his mouth on her throat same goes he grabbed the hook of her belt and sent it rattling to the floor his hands roamed over the slick material tormenting them both then onto flesh a rough scrape of callus against pampered skin their mouths met again hotly wetly with a tangle of tongues and a scrape of teeth and echoing groans of need her breath caught when he swept her up for a moment she felt utterly helpless overpowered conquered panicked excitement prickled along her skin then he was laying her on the thick duvet and his eyes were on hers as he peeled away the suit the quick shudder surprised her shed prepared herself for him shed known the evening would end in just this way but she hadnt known couldnt have known that a long searing look from those intense green eyes could sever the knots of her control so quickly with a sound of greed she reared up arms and legs snaking around him mouth fusing with his she was as erotic as any temptress as dangerous as any siren the blood raced through his veins with the flavor of her spiking it like a drug he was rough couldnt help himself shed already snapped his tenuous connection with the civilized his fingers dug into her hips would leave bruises his mouth crushed down on hers until she whimpered in dazed delight then dragging her head back by her hair he savaged her throat her skin was already damp from the heat when he pushed her back when his mouth and hands possessed her breasts the air was too thick to breathe and each gulp of it made her head reel there were flames inside her heating her system beyond bearing as desperate as he to touch to taste to take she rolled with him over the bed their legs tangled as she dragged at his jeans every second was delicious torture every movement a wild thrill he felt his own muscles quivering as his slick skin slid over hers there had never been anything or anyone he craved as he craved her every inch of her every curve every tremble every moan the need for her was like edgy fingers gripping at his throat his heart his loins he drove himself into her blindly fiercely felt her clamp around him like a hot fist triumph heady and sweet streaked through him when she cried out then those long limber legs wrapped around him her hands fisted on the bedcover as the first violent orgasm ripped through her the pressure inside her tore free then built again forcing her to sob in air mindlessly she scraped her nails down his back arched against him and met the next crest headon he fought back the mists that blurred his vision he wanted to see her had to see her as their bodies plunged toward the edge her face was flushed and damp her eyes were closed her lips trembling her hair a wild tangle of fire over the rumpled bedclothes something struggled for freedom inside him something more complex and more demanding than lust he fought it back let himself ride on the towering wave of sensation but it was her name that broke from his lips as he emptied himself into her they didnt speak julia wondered if her vocal cords had been singed by the heat they generated together shed never felt like this before so sated and weak so sinuously female she was content to drop off into sleep just like this sprawled naked on the bed with cullums body pinning hers heavily to the mattress when he shifted a little she sighed and wondered if it was the only sound shed be capable of making for the next decade or so she looked smug cullum thought as he managed to lift his head to study her face as his mind cleared hed worried that hed hurt her he knew his hands were big and rough and though he doubted hed be considered a gentle lover hed never been quite so unrestrained he was afraid hed come perilously close to brutal but judging by that contentedcat expression on her face it didnt appear apologies were in order he was grateful he hated apologizing then her eyes fluttered open and met his her lips curved wider mmm she said at the very least it surprised him that he wanted to needed to trace a fingertip along her jawline her skin was soft there despite the arrogance of the shape giving in to the urge he lowered his head and brushed his lips just under her chin the gesture made her heart flutter she told herself it was a foolish reaction even a dangerous one her heart had to maintain a safe distance despite the warmth of his body she shivered cold he wanted to bundle her up to keep her warm to keep her and that wayward thought tied an uneasy knot in his stomach the shiver had had nothing to do with the cold but she latched on to the excuse a bit she couldnt stop herself from lifting a hand running it through the tousled length of his hair i guess we could use another log on the fire ill get it he leaned down intending to kiss her lightly casually and lingered over it until they were both clinging desire built again too quickly for either of them to build a defense together they reached out draped the duvet over themselves and yielded to it chapter contents prev next november julia decided was the most interesting month of the year it was so transitional with the air both smoky and bracing hints of winter blew on the wind with all the adventures and surprises that accompanied the holiday season she was almost sorry to see it end shed never spent a more fascinating or exciting month she believed she and cullum were being very discreet they kept a professional distance during working hours for the most part julia acknowledged remembering a brief and torrid encounter in the remodeled pantry and that she had to admit had been her doing there had just been something about the way he stood in that tidy homey area his tool belt slung on his hips his skin smelling of sawdust that fried her circuits enough to have her pushing him up against the door and attacking him not that hed put up much of a fight the basic truth was they had a hard time keeping their hands off each other struggling to do so for the best part of eight hours a day five days a week added quite a bit of desperation to their afterhours meetings hen bedroom and the pantry werent the only rooms theyd enjoyed she thought of how theyd ended up rolling around on the drop cloths in the halffinished library laughing like loons and fighting with buttons and zippers they didnt seem even close to getting enough of each other you certainly look content laura commented both she and gwen had set aside the first saturday afternoon in december to help julia decorate her tree though each had their own home now none of them had forgotten the years theyd lived together or the bond they had formed why shouldnt i be julia searched for the perfect spot to hang the carved wooden santa riding his sleigh over a crescent moon the house is nearly finished and its coming together exactly as i wanted with her hands on her hips now she turned to study the completed living room the space streamed with sunlight that gilded the highly polished pine floor a fire crackled in the stone hearth the wood trim was dark and glossy curved softly over doorways and windows the plasterwork was stunning gone were the two dark little rooms and in their place was a huge airy space where shed arranged favorite pieces of furniture the curvedbacked settee with brocade seats the long deep sofa perfect for midday napping two of her brothers original watercolors of boston hung on the wall over an occasional table where one of her mothers pieces a wide shallow dish in swimming pastels rested an antique dolls cradle held magazines two lofty ficus trees flanked the archway that joined the rooms every piece every detail was very personally hers its a terrific room gwen told her i knew it would be but its better than i imagined im glad cullum talked me into a wide archway instead of straight open space it adds character gwen and laura exchanged a look behind her back pointing at each other shaking their heads rolling their eyes laura finally gave an exaggerated shrug of agreement so laura chose a tiny silver bell for a branch i guess hell be finished in a couple of weeks should be according to his flowchart were coming down to punchout work is that what you two do study flowcharts in bed sometimes but blinking julia turned back what julia for heavens sake its obvious the two of you are involved gwen walked over to pour more hot chocolate out of a china pot shaped like a grinning elephant it is every time we drop by we have to go home and defuse with a laugh laura hung a gauzy angel the air around here sizzles okay were nosy she turned around but were also concerned we always talked about this sort of thing but with cullum youve been uncharacteristically mute i dont know what to say i suppose we realized a lot of the antagonism between us was just sexual tension when we started working closely together julia shrugged her shoulders it just happened her smile broke through as she looked at her two cousins its wonderful hes wonderful i had no idea wed have such fun together and not just in bed we drove out to the cape last weekend had a picnic on the beach it was freezing she laughed it was great and the man actually likes to go antiquing can you imagine he finds terrific stuff and bargains like a champ look she dashed over to the recessed shelves and snagged something off one he got this for me a couple of weeks ago the dealer practically gave it to him by the time murdoch was done with him gwens brows drew together as she studied the metal knob and mechanism attached to a square of old wood what is it its an old telegraph key julia turned it around to show it off unaware that her heart was in her eyes i love things like this i hadnt expected him to notice and he makes incredible pasta whod have thought someone like him would cook hes helping me pick out the things for the playroom im putting together for little daniel and all the other nieces and nephews that are going to come along were looking at old pinball machines hes handy with mechanics and stuff so he thought it might be fun to rebuild one and i her breath began to hitch and she had to press a hand to her heart oh god oh no her legs trembling she sank into a chair and stared at her cousins in horror what have i done fallen head over heels from the look and sound of it gwen poured another cup of chocolate and brought it to julia take your time catch your breath this wasnt the plan this wasnt the idea this wasnt the agreement she finished as her voice upped an octave in pitch let me be the first to tell you you cant plan it but i dont even like him she closed her eyes as gwen smiled at her well i didnt i thought i didnt if it helps i think youre perfect for each other it doesnt help julia took the cup in both hands and drank deeply it doesnt help at all what am i going to do hed be furious or hysterical if he knew laura sat on the arm of the chair you ask me a man who cooks you pasta buys you weird gifts and wants to rehab a pinball machine for you is as over his head as you are no hes not do you think no disgusted with herself she sprang up oh how did this happen to me ten minutes ago i was on top of the world hes going to be here in a couple hours hes going to rewire this art deco lamp we found last night hes rewiring lamps gwen said with a sigh thats so sweet its not sweet its impossible i dont want to be in love with him why laura cocked her head because its because hes i see the witness is having trouble answering the question laura said soberly let me rephrase oh shoot she added as the sounds of a fussing baby sounded through the intercom court will take a brief recess be right back julia gwen began as laura raced upstairs id like to say something go ahead youve never looked happier than you did when you were talking about cullum and all the time youve been spending together and ive been around here enough to notice the way he looks at you the way he watches you i dont think youre any more in love with him than he is with you if thats true julia took three deep and careful breaths it could work dont you think ive never known you to back off from something you wanted i know its scary sometimes what i feel for branson and now the baby she murmured touching a hand to her stomach its so huge it still scares me but i wouldnt want it any other way so i need to convince him that hes madly in love with me id say its more you have to persuade him to admit it the way you just have out loud she nearly laughed again as laura brought daniel back into the room i cant imagine murdoch saying it out loud she gnawed at her lip as she considered unless i trick it out of him same old julia laura commented she sat in the bentwood rocker unbuttoned her blouse to nurse the baby i dont mean trick exactly more like drag it out of him she was ready for him julia opened the door for cullum with a warm smile then sliding her arms around his neck presented him with a long deep kiss nice to see you too he backed her into the house kicked the door closed to keep out the cold and the thin fall of snow what mood is this youre in macgregor happy she nibbled down along his jaw affectionate what mood is this youre in murdoch appreciative you havent seen anything yet she eased back to smile up at him i cooked dinner isnt that dangerous i happen to be a very competent cook nearly she amended silently how do you feel about stuffed pork chops and mashed potatoes very friendly good she linked her arm through his and with stars in her eyes walked with him to the kitchen she had the table set with colorful dishes and candles music played low through the hidden speakers and a bottle of champagne was chilling in an antique bucket puzzled he shook his head are we celebrating something nope just a homecooked meal macgregorstyle why dont you open the bottle now dinner will be about twenty more minutes smells terrific he applied himself to the bottle and wondered what the hell she was up to if this wasnt a stage set by a woman who was after something hed be very surprised do you want me to tear out a wall ive just rebuilt change your mind about the tile in the guest room suite no i just felt like cooking must be the holidays coming up oh i should have showed you we got the tree up today i saw it through the window when i drove up looks great we can have dessert in the living room later and enjoy it wary now he poured the wine into two slim flutes you made dessert cream puffs old family recipe she took her glass from him and smiled i had a great time making them three times she thought and suppressed a sigh the first two attempts were buried in the garbage so how was your day productive ive nearly finished the wooden train set im building for my nieces id love to see it i could help you paint it im no shelby or d c macgregor but im not too bad sure he searched her face thatd be great well im going to check on the chops and toss the salad ill give you a hand no this is my production just sit down and relax when she put on an apron he decided sitting down was a fine idea what the hell had gotten into her he wondered she was bright solicitous all but subservient and she was wearing an apron this was not his julia his julia he took a deep gulp of wine as the ramifications of that exploded in his head since when had he been thinking of her as his since forever he realized since always hed wanted her for years covered up the want with sarcasm and annoyance but it had been there buried deep and growing roots now that they were lovers it was impossible to deny that he was in love with her and even if he managed to get his tongue around those words and tell her hed be out the door before the sentence was complete well damn it he thought as she continued to bustle around the kitchen and chatter he was in love with her hed see to it that she fell in love with him and shed be the one to say it first setting his glass aside he rose and moved behind her his arms slid around her waist his lips brushed the nape of her neck you smell even better than dinner her knees melted away do i and im becoming more interested in nibbling on you he reached over turned the stove and burners down to warm im becoming more interested in being nibbled on she was smiling as he turned her around but the smile faded and nerves kicked in as he stared and stared as if absorbing her what is it sometimes he said slowly as this new realization of love flooded him youre so beautiful this is one of those times hed never told her she was beautiful never cupped her face gently in his hands and kissed her with such slow such deep concentration every emotion inside her swam to the surface shimmered in her heart in her eyes cullum why are we always in such a hurry he murmured against her mouth why hadnt he savored this drawn this out to forever i dont know but she knew she didnt want him to stop kissing her just like this touching her just this way lets not be this time he picked her up and see what happens chapter contents prev next something was wrong with her cullum decided she wasnt acting like herself and hadnt been for days the woman was smiling all the time she was asking his opinion and advice on everything from lamp shades to andirons and she wasnt making a single sarcastic or dissenting remark shed baked him a cake hed known he was sunk when he actually forced himself to eat two pieces whatever she used to frost it had tasted distressingly like carpenters glue he was beginning to wonder if some alien lifeform had taken over julias body he was playing along cullum mused as he pulled up in front of the shop after closing time what else could he do how could a man argue with a woman who agreed with everything he said he missed arguing with her he saw that his fathers pickup was still parked beside the entrance with everyone else gone for the day theyd have a chance to catch up on the status of jobs under way discuss holiday schedules then cullum decided hed catch a quick shower before heading to julias for another homecooked meal he rubbed his uneasy stomach god help him as soon as he charmed her into confessing she was in love with him hed tell her they were getting married timing was everything hed have the advantage get a ring on her finger and sweep her along before she had the chance to figure out hed planned it the minute they were married hed find a tactful way of banishing her from the kitchen for the next fifty years meanwhile risking a little food poisoning wasnt such a big price to pay not when julia was the prize and she was a prize he thought as he climbed out of the truck into a frigid wind it might have taken him close to five years to figure out she was the only woman in the world for him but he knew it now nothing not even the threat of julias cajun chicken surprise was going to stop him from making her his inspiration struck when he unlocked the shop door hed call her cullum decided tell her hed made reservations for dinner a prechristmas celebration as shed be leaving shortly for hyannis to spend the holiday with her family he could get away with changing plans on her at the last minute thanks to the mood shed been in lately cheered he stepped inside hed just tell his father he had to make a couple of calls before they got down to business as he started down the short hall cullum heard his fathers laugh boom out it made him grin hed been worried about the old man for months but just lately michael murdoch seemed to have bounced back the sparkle was back in his eyes the lift back in his step he was still taking it slow with periods of rest but he was coming around he started to step into the doorway of his fathers office just to let michael know he was there then he heard what his father was saying chortling with glee and stopped dead i tell you daniel cullumll be proposing to her before the end of the year no plan ever worked better on the floor beside the desk michael continued his series of onehanded pushups while daniels voice pounded out of the speakerphone whats taking the pair of them so long daniel demanded theyve been in each others pockets for more than three months well lord knows the pair of them are slower than limping turtles but were coming down to the wire fit as six fiddles michael switched arms to do another twenty reps my sources tell me shes been cooking for him julia cooking god have mercy michael dont tell me the boys been eating it barely winded michael laughed again indeed he has been and as i had a sample of a cake she baked for him i can tell you any man who swallows more than a mouthful of what she makes in her kitchen is a man sunk to his ears in love ah what a pair they are made for each other though theyd not thank either of us for pointing it out to them well give them a hell of a wedding michael that we will daniel and itll be a great relief to me to have recovered my full health just be sure you dont recover it too soon if the two of them balk you may have to have a relapse julia will be here for christmas if she isnt wearing his ring on her finger ill give a wee bit of a nudge from this end and ill keep an eye on this end merry christmas to you michael a merry christmas to you daniel michael bounced up lightly to the balls of his feet to disconnect the grin that stretched over his face froze the healthy flush that colored his face drained his son stood in the doorway his eyes daggerbright his mouth curled into a snarl cullum he all but squeaked it and didnt have to feign weak limbs i ah didnt hear you come in how long have you been standing there more than long enough fury and humiliation tangled inside him until he couldnt separate one from the other you werent sick a day sick of course i was sick michael said desperately calculating chest cold he managed a wheeze sank down into the chair behind his desk im feeling considerably better considerably the doctor said exercise was just save it cullum snapped and walked slowly to the desk youre as strong and healthy as a team of clydesdales you lied to me he slapped his palms on the desk and leaned in i was worried half to death about you the men took up a collection to send you a fruit basket it was considerate of them i was very grateful fruit i said save it now michaels eyes narrowed and he rose to stick his face close to his sons youll mind your tone with me cullum murdoch im still your father which is all thats saving you from having me haul you up bodily and throw you through the window you and daniel macgregor cooked up this little plot to push me and julia together the two of you figured if i was in charge of the rehab and we bumped up against each other often enough wed realize we were meant for each other and fall in line michael set his jaw that sums it up well enough and it worked didnt it so whats the problem whats the he had to step back had to turn away never in his life had he considered punching his own father id like to knock your heads together youve had your eye on julia macgregor for years cullum and dont bother to deny it it was my choice and my eye cullum muttered and shes had hers right back on you all daniel and i did was give you a push in the right direction your direction do you think im going to thank you for it well and so you should placating the boy would never work michael decided temper against temper would be cleaner a blind fool on a galloping horse could see the two of you are in love with each other she makes you happy and you do the same for her and whether you know it or not being as stubborn a man as ive known in my life the pair of you have already built a home together its her house the hell it is its yours just as much your hearts in it he couldnt argue with that but neither he decided was it the point julia and i had an agreement before we started seeing each other it didnt matter to cullum that he hadnt agreed to the terms she outlined or that hed considered them ridiculous he was going to use them now the relationship isnt permanent it isnt permanent he repeated through his clenched teeth when his father snorted and if you think im going to propose to her think again youre in love with her arent you cullum opened his mouth to deny it jammed his hands into his pockets and simmered in silence there youve just told me you are even if you cant get your tongue around it yet lamebrain sighing michael sat again shes a bright and lovely woman a match for you in strength and will she has brains and humor and the foundation of a fine family then you marry her michael only smiled if i were twenty years younger boy id have snapped her up from under your nose long before this and if you dont get your feet moving someone else might just do it shes not seeing anyone else of course not michael said mildly why would she when shes in love with you defeated cullum pulled his hands free so that he could press his fingers to his eyes this is getting me nowhere you and macgregor decide to be a couple of puppet masters and jules and i are supposed to dance let me tell you something he continued dropping his hands if she found out what the two of you have done shed boot me out of her life to spite you but youre not going to tell her are you michael asked with a winning smile no im not going to tell her but from this point on the two of you stay out of it he jabbed a finger at his father completely out of it julia and i will fumble around on our own if and when we decide to get married itll be because we decided not because my father and her grandfather think its the thing to do of course itll be your decision michaels smile never wavered oh the boy was on the ropes he thought and didnt even know it its the biggest decision a man makes in his life your happiness is what matters to me more than anything in the world cullum cullum felt himself weakening look i know you meant well but meant the very best michael said and opened the middle drawer of his desk id like you to take this if you decide julias the woman you want to build your home and family with i hope youll give this to her he opened the small white satin box it was your mothers sentiment and memories swamped him as he offered cullum the box i couldnt afford a diamond when i asked her to spend her life with me its a topaz she always said it was like a little piece of sunlight and wouldnt have it replaced later on when the money was there dad im not pushing you i always meant you to have it when it was time your mother wanted it passed on shed have loved your julia cullum yeah helpless cullum took the box slipped it into his pocket she would have what had gotten into him julia dragged out her suitcase she needed to pack for the trip to hyannis and she needed something to take her mind off cullum and his odd behavior hed insisted on taking her out every night for a week dinner dancing theaters parties she knew very well he preferred quiet evenings at home but suddenly he was a social animal it was driving her crazy trying to gauge his changing moods and adjust hers to them with a little sigh she folded sweaters into her bag she didnt know how long she could keep up this agreeablewoman routine the only real benefit so far was that shed been able to unchain herself from the kitchen cooking was definitely not her forte it was just her bad luck that cullum loved her cooking obviously the man had a castiron stomach she thought she could barely force her own preparations through her lips but cullum always cleared his plate that had been a bad miscalculation on her part now he was going to expect her to cook with some regularity she hated fighting her way through a recipe almost as much as she loved cullum love she realized was making a fool of her and he was being so gentle so tender this new tone to their lovemaking weakened her limbs and turned her mind to mush it made her ache for the words every time he took her into his arms she was sure this would be the moment now he would tell her he loved her but he never did she wasnt going to say it first she thought and tossed clothes into her bag she couldnt she had already made dozens of compromises given him so much control she needed to stand firm on this one point and where the hell was he she scowled at the clock tossed in more clothes he knew she was leaving today that this was their last chance to see each other until after christmas she had to be on her way within the hour if she was going to make it to her grandparents before dark what was she doing she asked herself she was dawdling like a lovesick idiot bending her own plans to suit his one more time it was going to stop with a decisive nod she fastened her suitcase being in love did not mean being a doormat she was leaving on schedule and she was sticking to her plans and if cullum murdoch didnt like it he could lump it she carried her suitcase out to the car then began the laborious task of hauling shopping bags loaded with gifts her mood wasnt filled with holiday cheer when cullum pulled his truck in behind her car neither was his a problem on a job downtown had taken most of his morning and he would have to go back and finish it up himself tonight regardless of the fact that it was christmas eve the traffic had been insane even for boston and hed gotten a ticket for running a red though the damn thing had been yellow because he was in such a hurry to get to julias and here she was leaving he did his best to rein in his temper reminding himself that it was christmas that this was the woman he loved that he would tell her so as soon as she had the good sense to tell him im running behind he told her taking one of the bags from her to stuff it in with the others crowding her back seat so am i traffics a mess you might make better time if you wait another hour thanks for the bulletin she said sweetly but ill manage of course if youd gotten here on time id already be on my way i got hung up he struggled to keep his voice mild but couldnt bank the temper simmering in his eyes do you have any more bags yes she turned walked back into the house seething and seething he followed her these are the last three overdid it a little dont you think i enjoy giving gifts she snatched the lone box from under the tree and slapped it into his hand heres yours watching her he slipped it into his pocket so that he could take the bags whats your problem macgregor if you dont know im certainly not going to tell you she turned and sailed out of the house in front of him look i didnt drive across town in miserable traffic and get a ticket just to come here and get frosted its certainly not my fault if you drove irresponsibly and got a ticket but that explains your bad mood my bad mood you were snarling at me before i got out of the truck her chin shot out i dont have time to argue with you youve already made me late fine dandy he dragged a long slim box with a crushed bow out of his coat pocket heres your present see you later he strode back to the truck cursed then strode back gave her a hard yank into his arms and crushed his mouth violently to hers merry christmas he snarled and turned away same to you she shouted then slammed into her car she waited for him to drive off before she indulged in a storm of angry tears chapter contents prev she was done with him finished her mistake julia decided had been in deluding herself that shed fallen in love with him and that love meant she could adjust herself to his needs and wants because of that shed spent the past couple of weeks tiptoeing on eggshells and collecting recipes it was mortifying thank god shed come to her senses she was an independent woman one who made her own decisions lived her own life and outlined her own goals when she spoke with cullum again she would calmly and clearly explain that their relationship no longer suited her and that would be that shed never been more miserable in her life shed done her best to put on a cheerful face for her family if it had cracked from time to time shed had plenty of excuses handy she had a little headache shed been woolgathering she had a new deal on her mind not that she believed shed fooled anyone for a moment but shed gotten through it and now she was home again alone in her house the lights on her christmas tree were too bright too colorful and hurt her eyes still she refused to turn them off cullum murdoch was not going to spoil her holidays she had the final details of her party to keep her occupied the minute she had everything under control she would contact him certainly she would do so before the end of the year ring out the old ring in the new she told herself and looked at the phone yet again why hadnt he called her without realizing it she lifted a hand to touch the antique necklace she wore cullums christmas gift to her was a lovely lariatstyle necklace fashioned of tiny pearls and garnets and citrines it had given her a jolt to see it to remember that shed seen it before in one of the shops she patronized if she hadnt been in christmasgiftbuying mode she would have snatched it up for herself still she hadnt given it more than a brief avaricious glance but hed noticed and remembered and bought it for her it made her want to weep again pushing away the creeping depression she sat down at her rolltop desk to go over her list for the party the caterer was hired the menu approved the flowers and music had been chosen there was literally nothing left for her to do julia realized and felt her eyes well up furious with herself she pushed away from the desk she had to get out of the house go somewhere anywhere cullum argued with himself as he drove toward julias he was behaving like a whipped puppy going back for another kick he hated himself for it she could have called him when she got back to boston hed given her two days to call hadnt he she was the one whod gone out of town so she was the one who should have called he intended to point that out to her in words of one syllable then he was going to tell her there were going to be some changes made they would put things back the way they had been a month ago or she could just forget it when he pulled in front of her house and saw that her car was gone he could have chewed a fistful of sixpenny nails even the anger hed been able to work up was nothing compared to the need just to see her to talk to her to touch her typical he muttered scowling at the cheery lights of her tree through the graceful window she can make me suffer without even being here deflated he reached into his pocket took out the old brushedgold pocket watch shed given him for christmas how the hell could she know him well enough to choose such a perfect gift and not know when he was hurting what was he going to do about it he closed his eyes let his head rest against the seat he couldnt live without her hed thought he could hed worked for days to convince himself he could but coming here now seeing the house theyd worked on together empty of her he knew it wasnt possible he didnt want a life empty of julia he was whipped after all so what do you think everything looks great doesnt it julia fussed with her lipstick barely giving her grandmother the opportunity to speak im so happy you and grandpa are here early nothing to do really but im a little nervous if you can believe it its my first party in the house julia and i really want it to be perfect how do i look do i look all right anna studied her granddaughter calmly julia had chosen a scoopnecked dress in hunter green velvet the long sleeves snug the skirt short her hair was pinned up curls escaping strategically and her eyes anna thought were overbright you look lovely sweetheart why dont we sit down i cant really ive got to go check on the caterer people will be here soon and julia in her gentle unarguable way anna took julias hand sit down and tell me what hurts i dont know julias breath hitched before she could control it i dont know what to do what to feel everything is mixed up messed up im in love with cullum murdoch and i cant make it go away there now anna led her to the sitting area of the bedroom why do you want to make it go away he doesnt love me he doesnt even like me anymore i ruined it and i dont know how i tried to i stopped arguing with him even when he was wrong and i cooked and everything got weird and we argued he went away i went away i dont know he hasnt even called me since i got home have you called him no im not calling him until he calls me he was the one who was late and surly damn it she swiped her fingers under her eyes im ruining my mascara youll fix it now youre telling me you had a fight with cullum and you havent made it up yet not exactly julia sniffled were always fighting we like it feeling foolish she let out a huge sigh then i realized i was in love with him i didnt mean to be but i was so i thought if i tried to be a little less me i suppose if i was more agreeable if i cooked him a few hot meals hed fall in love with me and tell me so i could tell him back and this sounds so lame i cant believe its coming out of my mouth neither can i but being in love often scatters some of the brain cells being less you was a mistake probably i just wanted him so much wanted him to love me i thought we could start working on the rest after we got to that point but he doesnt love me i dont want him to hes arrogant and argumentative and bossy patient anna opened her evening bag and drew out a tissue to mop at julias now streaming eyes of course he is youd walk all over him otherwise and youd despise a man whod let you walk over him you want one who stands up to you who stands with you i thought i could make it all happen but you cant make feelings happen any more than you can stop them they just are then youve learned a fine lesson are you going to tell cullum yours so he can sneer at me do you really think he would maybe not but he might feel sorry for me that would be worse she shook her head and rose ill be all right really i guess i needed to get that out im sorry i blubbered darling from the day you were born ive never known you to blubber and i wont start now determined julia moved back to the mirror to repair her makeup i want this party to be special its the beginning of my new home a new year a new life where are my girls daniel asked at the top of his lungs as he came into the room bearing a tray with three brimming flutes of champagne there they are and more beautiful than theyve a right to be were drinking to them he set the tray down and then his wide smile faded when he saw julias tearstreaked face whats wrong little girl whats the matter here nothing i was feeling a little blue julia carefully dried her face men why cant they all be you grandpa whats the boy done he demanded why if hes done something to make you cry hell answer to me julia started to chuckle but then a wayward thought a wild and wayward thought circled in her head and took root what boy that murdoch boy of course female tears always terrified him daniel paced the room arms waving hes a fine boy make no mistake but i wont have him causing you a moments unhappiness whats he done and ill fix it slowly julia turned from the mirror how much have you fixed already making my little girl cry when she should be on top of the world kicking up her heels ill have a word with cullum murdoch see if i dont and when i finish he trailed off finally catching the gleam in julias eye what did you say how did you know i was crying over cullum well you said so hadnt she a little desperate daniel looked to his wife for support but met a stony stare well think no more of it he said quickly lets have that toast how could you be at the bottom of this julia wondered you werent here you didnt arrange for me to buy the house or for him to work on it no indeed grasping the straw daniel picked up a glass and handed it to her his eyes were a bright and innocent blue lets have a drink to your fine new house the boys work does him credit but mr murdoch was supposed to be contractor julia murmured youre awfully tight with michael murdoch arent you grandpa known him for years fine family strong stock julia sucked in her breath ready to rage still spry in his nineties daniel skipped back as the knocker beat against the front door guests arriving dont you worry ill greet them anna help the girl put her face back together ill take care of everything he deserted the field while he still had his head i dont know how he did it julia began but he did i agree with you anna defeated the indulgent smile that wanted to curve on her lips but theres just no stopping him it didnt matter julia told herself whatever her grandfather had tried to arrange hadnt worked she and cullum had taken care of that the house was finished and so were they music swept through the rooms along with laughter and voices family and friends were scattered through the house exactly as shed planned exactly as shed wanted them fires crackled lights sparkled youve made a beautiful home here shelby slipped an arm around julias shoulder its perfect for you yes it is im putting it on the market next week what its not a place i want to live alone her gaze swept the spacious living area the fine details the gleam of wood theres too much cullum in here honey dont do anything rash its not rash its necessary ill be all right she leaned her head against her mothers i always am i think i might come down to dc for a while i might relocate you know your father and i would love having you close by but dont worry about me im going to figure it all out before i do anything now whos the woman whos clinging to dc your brother met her in maine shes a poet she quotes elizabeth barrett browning incessantly id always been fond of browning before with a laugh julia sipped her champagne shes that irritating oh far more shelby said with feeling believe me if i thought for a minute he was serious about her id shelby trailed off and her heart lightened considerably you have another guest julia oh who she turned and saw cullum step into the room hed worn a suit and the damn tie was strangling him but it had seemed only right that he dress the part you couldnt very well come to a fancy new years eve party in flannel and denim and fancy it was silks and velvets glittering jewelry glossy finger food and wine in heavy crystal shed put it together he decided exactly as it should be hed have done the same then he saw her and his heart twisted and he knew she could have just as easily made do with pizza and beer she pinned a smile on her face and assuming the mask of hostess walked over to greet him im so glad you made it what can i get you listen to her talking to him as if he were a mild acquaintance instead of her lover got a beer sure she signaled to a waiter mr murdoch would like a beer you probably know almost everyone but id be happy to introduce you around i can take care of myself undoubtedly and how was

wearing the necklace hed given her against the creamy flesh exposed by the lowcut dress looks good on you what oh she could have cursed herself for giving in to the sentimental urge to wear his gift yes its made for this dress its lovely cullum thank you so much for thinking of it i hope you liked your watch it was weighing down his pocket even then it keeps good time thanks youre very welcome well be sure to try to buffet as well as the canapés that are circling around if youll excuse me his hand clamped hard on her wrist where the hell do you get off talking to me like this i have no idea what you mean dont take that snooty tone with me macgregor it doesnt suit you youd better let go of me murdoch the hell i will i want some answers ive been waiting for you to come up with them and since you didnt bother im here to see that i get them you want answers the heat of temper was beginning to blur her vision youve been waiting for answers okay try this one her hand shot out and tipped his glass of beer onto his suit she regretted it instantly it had been petty and foolish it had been public she knew several conversations that had been going on around her came to a dead stop she also knew by the way cullums eyes kindled that she couldnt back down now that you have your answer you can leave she intended to turn walk away with dignity to laugh off the incident later she could crawl into a hole but for now she had to maintain her poise she shrieked when cullum boosted her up and tossed her over his shoulder she cursed him without restraint as he carted her upstairs below daniel hooked an arm sentimentally around michael murdochs shoulders he sighed blinked a tear from his eyes aye theyll give us fine babies michael lets drink to it with a hoot of laughter daniel watched his granddaughter disappear up the stairs ill buy the first round cullum marched straight to julias bedroom ignoring the punches and kicks ignoring the wet jacket and the yeasty smell of spilled beer inside he kicked the door shut turned the lock then tossed her unceremoniously onto the bed she continued to spit at him as he dragged off his soiled suit coat in all the years hed known her and fought with her he hadnt known her to be quite that inventive with the language when she started to scramble off the bed he merely put a hand on her head and shoved her back stay put and be quiet you think you can order me around after that hideous and revolting scene you started it and at least it gave him an excuse to pull off his tie i dont know whats gotten into you one day youre up the next youre down one minute you cant do enough for me the next you talk like you barely know me you havent even bothered to get in touch with me in a week i havent bothered i havent is your finger broken that you cant dial a damn phone then to his horror and her humiliation she buried her face in her hands and sobbed dont do that i mean it cut it out right now at his wits end he dragged both hands through his hair okay im sorry im really sorry for what she asked still weeping for anything you want thatll make you stop crying you dont even know wanting it over she swiped at tears even as they fell you dont even know oh go away i dont want you here when im making a fool of myself ive seen you make a fool of yourself before i dont mind usually come on jules he leaned down intending to pat her head or her shoulder and found his mouth homing in on hers before he knew what he was doing he was sitting and pulling her onto his knees and holding her close god i missed you i missed you her hands were in his hair did you yeah i did he rested his brow on hers are you done mostly i guess im sorry i spilled your beer he wondered what there was about the pair of them that she could make him smile at such a moment you guess well you made me mad so it was as much your fault as mine she answered his smile with a watery one of her own but ill have your suit cleaned for you want me to take the pants off now he saw with fresh surprise her lip quiver and her eyes fill i was only joking i know its all right i dont know whats wrong with me she brushed her fingers under her eyes again and climbed off the bed to go to the mirror public scenes and tears werent part of the deal she said briskly and began once again to repair her makeup we have a mutually agreeable physical relationship and a friendship of sorts no point in spoiling it by getting sloppy he tucked his hands into his pockets watching her swipe color onto her cheeks what do you mean by sloppy overemotional i guess must be the holidays ive been a little unsettled recently tell me about it he muttered and her eyes narrowed which means look its new years eve i dont want to end the year fighting with you why not we do it so well then whyd you stop for so long the last few weeks except for the day you left for hyannis i couldnt get a rise out of you with a forklift all of a sudden youre agreeing with everything i say cooking me dinner practically bringing me my pipe and slippers and you object to that insulted she whirled around i went to a lot of trouble to be nice to you and now you throw it back in my face well you dont have to worry because i wont bother to be nice to you anymore thank god and i wont be around anyway she finished in a rush because im selling the house and moving to dc the hell you are you cant stop me i dont want to live here i dont know why i let you talk me into doing so many of the changes you suggested i dont know why i let you do things your way because it was the right way and thats the way you wanted it and ill be damned if youre selling this house you can buy it yourself if it means so much to you fine name your price but if you think for one minute youre moving out im not staying i cant youre not going they were all but nosetonose now panicked and furious their voices rose to shouts but it still took several minutes before either of them heard the other say three particular words since they said them simultaneously i love you and im not staying here and being unhappy i love you and youre not going anywhere without me she blinked cullum stepped back what did you say he demanded i didnt say anything what did you say you said you loved me she tried to swallow but her heart was stuck hard in her throat thats what i thought you said did you mean it what if i did he spun away to pace damn womans always talking so much you dont know what youre saying back when you say it what if i do love you he shot out in exasperation what are you going to do about it why he was perfect julia thought absolutely perfect for her ask you to marry me he stopped pacing to stare at her at first glance she looked remarkably cool and unruffled but he knew her knew where to look and her eyes were dark and wet what you heard me murdoch do you want to or not he walked to her again and in a moment in the silence they both began to grin ive got a ring in my pocket you do not bet she angled her head let me see it it was my mothers he took out the box flipped open the lid its not a diamond but you like colored stones better anyway oh cullum she lifted her gaze to his you really do love me i said i did if youd said it first weeks ago like i wanted you to wed have saved a lot of time you were supposed to say it first why the hell do you think i cooked dinner for you so many times jules believe me nobody who wasnt crazy in love with you could have eaten any of those meals she tried to be insulted but ended up laughing if you ask me to marry you ill never make another pot roast you already asked me but under the circumstances thats a deal but when he reached in his pocket and took out his watch she shifted impatiently what are you doing cant you do this right i am doing it right its elevenfortyfive fifteen minutes till midnight ill just fix that he turned the stem until the second hand hovered at twelve then took her hand thats cheating she beamed at him i do love you cullum youre what ive wanted without even knowing it he touched one of her stray curls we made this house together no she closed her hand over his we made this home together i couldnt live here without you i want to end the year and begin it right here with you he brought their linked fingers to his lips well make a hell of a team im counting on it marry me julia i thought youd never ask she said and kissed him from the private memoirs of daniel duncan macgregor ive a head for business a skill for the art of the deal my life has been a rich one ive worked hard and ive gambled ive won and ive lost business the making of money is a pleasure to me but family is gods reward strip every penny from my pocket and leave me my family and i will die a wealthy man when i started these memoirs i had hopes and plans schemes some might say and what the devil do i care what people say for my family well ive done what i set out to do laura is a happily married woman a beautiful mother she and royce are making a good life for themselves and for my precious young namesake daniel macgregor cameron oh theres a lad a bright sturdy lad good blood strong stock nothing pleases me more than seeing how royce dotes on the boy or how caine delights in being a grandfather and he and royce are as thick as thieves its a fine friendship theyve made out of their love for laura of course i had no doubt of it gwen and her branson are expecting a child any day now she frets a bit i know about taking time off from her duties at the hospital but anna is the first to tell her that she can have both her career and a family and do a magnificent job with both branson fusses over her wouldnt leave her side to tour for his book id have been tempted to take a strap to him if he had and did it make any difference hah it was a bestseller the minute it came out of the pipe hes a good storyteller that lad kept me up half the night reading about his murdering woman doctor and his cagey detective playing cat and mouse falling in love whod have thought shed end up killing herself at the end rather than taking the life of the one man whod touched her dark and troubled heart ah well love matters most after all now my julia and her cullum are making their life in the home they built together on beacon hill they still scrap like terriers and id worry if they didnt theres such passion between these two a perfect match and i dont mind saying so i expect to hear theres a baby on the way soon and if i dont ill want to know the reason why she made a magnificent bride tall stately elegant and there was a moment when she stepped beside cullum took his hand and their eyes met they grinned at each other wide and happy with laughter all but bubbling out a moment i could feel my heart swell with joy and with pride for having brought it about now the macgregor veil is packed away and waiting but ive no intention of letting it lie in its box for long its time my grandsons started doing their duty ive given them time to ripen a bit a man needs some years and some experience under his belt before he takes a wife and starts a family but lets face it im not going to live forever so far ive been subtle with mac him being the oldest of my boys but does he take the hint hah well well just have to give him a few heftier nudges ive done well by my first three girls but im not one to sit on my laurels for long ill see the rest of them wedded and the circle completed before my time is up thats a promise on the word of daniel macgregor
