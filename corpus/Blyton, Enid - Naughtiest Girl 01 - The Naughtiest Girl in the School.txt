and naughty and although daddy and were going to leave you here with miss scott when we went away i think it would be better for you to go to school elizabeth stared at her mother in dismay what leave her home and her pony and her dog go and be with a lot of children she would hate oh no she wouldnt go ill be good with miss scott she said youve said that before said her mother miss scott says she cant stay with you any longer elizabeth is it true that you put earwigs in her bed last night elizabeth giggled yes she said miss scott is so frightened of them its silly to be afraid of earwigs isnt it it is much sillier to put them into somebodys bed said mrs allen sternly you have been spoilt and you think you can do what you like you are an only child and we love you so much daddy and i that i think we have given you too many lovely things and allowed you too much freedom mummy if you send me to school i shall be so naughty there that theyll send me back home again said elizabeth shaking her curls back she was a pretty girt with laughing blue eyes and dark brown curls all her life she had done as she liked six governesses had come and gone but not one of them had been able to make elizabeth obedient or good mannered you can be such a nice little girl they had all said to her but all you think of is getting into mischief and being rude about it and now when she said that she would be so naughty at school that they would have to send her home her mother looked at her in despair she loved elizabeth very much and wanted her to be happybut how could she be happy if she did not learn to be as other children were you have been alone too much elizabeth she said you should have had other children to play with and to work with i dont like other children said elizabeth sulkily it was quite trueshe didnt like boys and girls at all they were shocked at her mischief and rude ways and when they said they wouldnt join in her naughtiness she laughed at them and said they were babies then they told her what they thought of her and elizabeth didnt like it so now the thought of going away to school and living with other boys and girls made elizabeth feel dreadful please dont send me she begged i really will be good at home no elizabeth said her mother daddy and i must go away for a whole year and as miss scott wont stay and we could not expect to find another governess quickly before we go it is best you should go to school you have a good brain and you should be able to do your work well and get to the top of the form then we shall be proud of you i shant work at all said elizabeth pouting i wont work a bit and theyll think im so stupid they wont keep me well elizabeth if you want to make things difficult for yourself youll have to said mother getting up we have written to miss belle and miss best who run whyteleafe school and they are willing to take you next week when the new term begins miss scott will get all your things ready please help her all you can elizabeth was very angry and upset she didnt want to go to school she hated everybody especially silly children miss scott was horrid to say she wouldnt stay suddenly elizabeth wondered if she would stay if she asked her very very nicely she ran to find her governess miss scott was busy sewing elizabeths name on to a pile of brown stockings are these new stockings asked elizabeth in surprise i dont wear stockings i wear socks you have to wear stockings at whyteleafe school said miss scott elizabeth stared at the pile and then she suddenly put her arms round miss scotts neck miss scott she said stay with me i know im sometimes naughty but i dont want you to go what you really mean is that you dont want to go to school said miss scott i suppose mothers been telling you yes she has said elizabeth miss scott i wont go to school well of course if youre such a baby as to be afraid of doing what all other children do then ive nothing more to say said miss scott beginning to sew another name on a brown stocking elizabeth stood up at once and stamped her foot afraid she shouted im not afraid was i afraid when i fell off my pony was i afraid when our car crashed into the bank was i afraid whenwhen when dont shout at me please elizabeth said miss scott i think you are afraid to go to school and mix with obedient wellmannered hardworking children who are not spoilt as you are you know quite well that you wouldnt get your own way that you would have to share everything instead of having things to yourself as you do now and that you would have to be punctual polite and obedient and you are afraid to go im not im not im not shouted elizabeth i shall go but i shall be so naughty and lazy that they wont keep me and then ill come back home and youll have to look after me again so there my dear elizabeth i shant be here said miss scott taking another stocking i am going to another family where i shall have two little boys to teach am going the day you go to school so you cant come back home because i shant be here your father and mother will be away and the house will be shut up elizabeth burst into tears she sobbed so loudly that miss scott who was really fond of the spoilt naughty girl put her arms round her and comforted her now dont be silly she said most children simply love school its great fun you play games you go for walks all together you have the most lovely lessons and you will make such a lot of friends you have no friends now and it is a dreadful thing not to have a single friend you are very lucky im not wept elizabeth nobody loves me im very unhappy the trouble is that people have loved you too much said miss scott you are pretty and merry and rich so you have been spoilt people like the way you look the way you smile and your pretty clothes so they fuss you and pet you and spoil you instead of treating you like an ordinary child but it isnt enough to have a pretty face and a merry smileyou must have a good heart too nobody had spoken to elizabeth like this before and the little girl was astonished i have got a good heart she said tossing her curls back again well you dont show it much said miss scott now run away please because ive got to count all these stockings and then mark your new vests and bodices elizabeth looked at the pile of stockings she hated them nasty brown things she wouldnt wear them shed take her socks to school and wear those if she wanted to miss scott turned to a chestofdrawers and began to take out some vests elizabeth picked up two brown stockings and pinned them toe to toe then she tiptoed to miss scott and neatly and quietly pinned them to her skirt she skipped out of the room giggling miss scott carried the vests to the table she began to count the stockings there should be six pairs onetwothreefourfive she counted five dear mewheres the sixth she looked on the floor she looked on the chair she was really vexed she counted the pile again then she went to the door and looked for elizabeth the little girl was pulling something out of a cupboard on the landing elizabeth called miss scott sharply have you got a pair of your brown stockings no miss scott said elizabeth making her eyes look round and surprised why because a pair is missing said miss scott did you take them out of this room no really miss scott said elizabeth truthfully trying not to laugh as she caught sight of the stockings swinging at miss scotts back im sure all the stockings are in the room miss scott really then perhaps your mother has a pair said miss scott ill go and ask her off marched the governess down the landing the pinned brown stockings trailing behind her like a tail elizabeth put her head into the cupboard and squealed with laughter miss scott went into her mothers room excuse me mrs allen she said but have you one of elizabeths new pairs of stockings ive only five pairs no i gave you them all said mrs allen surprised they must be together perhaps you have dropped them somewhere miss scott turned to go and mrs allen caught sight of the brown stockings following miss scott she looked at them in astonishment waft miss scott she said whats this she went to miss scott and unpinned the stockings the governess looked at mrs allen elizabeth of course she said yes elizabeth said mrs allen always in mis chief i really never knew such a child in my life it is high time she went to school dont you agree miss scott i do said miss scott heartily you will see a different and much nicer child when you come back home again mrs allen elizabeth was passing by and heard what her mother and her governess were saying she hit the door with the book she was carrying and shouted angrily you wont see me any different mother you wont you wont ill be worse you couldnt be said mrs allen in despair you really couldnt be worse chapter elizabeth goes to school for the rest of her time at home elizabeth was very naughty and also very good ill try being very very good and obedient and polite and sweet and see if mother changes her mind she thought so to the surprise of everyone she became thoughtful sweettongued goodmannered and most obedient but it had quite the wrong effect because instead of saying that she would keep her at home now her mother said something quite different well elizabeth now that i know what a really nice girl you can be im not so afraid of sending you to school as i was she said i thought you would get into such trouble and be so unhappybut now that i see how well you really can behave i am sure you will get on nicely at school i am very pleased with your behaviour and you can guess what happened after that elizabeth at once became naughtier than she had ever been before if being good makes mother feel like that ill see what being naughty does she thought so she emptied the inkbottle over the cushions in the drawingroom she tore a hole in one of the nicest curtains she put three black beetle into poor miss scotts toothbrush mug and she squeezed the seccotine into the ends of both miss scotts brown shoes so that her toes would stick there well all this makes it quite certain that elizabeth needs to go to school said miss scott angrily as she tried to get her feet out of her sticky shoes im glad to leave her naughty little girl and yet she can be so sweet and nice when she likes elizabeths things were packed and ready she had a neat brown trunk with e allen painted on it in black she had a tuckbox too with a big currant cake inside a box of chocolate a tin of toffee a jam sandwich and a tin of shortbread you will have to share these things with the others said miss scott as she packed the things neatly inside well i shant then said elizabeth very well dont said miss scott if you want to show everyone what a selfish child you are just take the chance elizabeth put on the outdoor uniform of whyteleafe school it was very neat and she looked nice in it but then elizabeth looked nice in anything the outdoor uniform was a dark blue coat with a yellow edge to the collar and cuffs a dark blue hat with a yellow ribbon round it and the school badge at the front her stockings were long and brown and her lace shoes were brown too my goodness you do look a real schoolgirl said her mother quite proudly elizabeth wouldnt smile she stood there sulky and angry i shant stay at school long she said theyll soon send me back dont be silly elizabeth said her mother she kissed the little girl goodbye and hugged her i will come and see you at halfterm she said no mother you wont said elizabeth i shall be home long before that dont make me sad elizabeth said mrs alien but elizabeth wouldnt smile or say she was sorry she got into the car that was to take her to the station and sat there very cross and straight she had said goodbye to her pony she had said goodbye to timmy her dog she had said goodbye to her canary and to each of them she had whispered the same thing ill soon be back youll seethey wont keep the naughtiest girl in the school for long miss scott took her to the station and then up to london in the train she went with elizabeth to a big station where trains whistled and chuffed and people ran about in a hurry now we must find the right platform said miss scott hurrying too we have to meet the teacher there who is in charge of the girls going by this train they came to the right platform and went through to where a big group of girls stood with a teacher they were all dressed in dark blue coats and hats with yellow hatbands like elizabeth the girls were of all ages some big some small and most of them were chattering hard two or three stood apart looking shy they were the new ones like elizabeth the teacher spoke to them now and again and they smiled gratefully at het miss scott bustled up to the teacher good morning she said is this miss thomas this is elizabeth allen im glad we are in good time good morning said miss thomas smiling she held out her hand to elizabeth well dear she said so you are going to join the happy crowd at whyteleafe school elizabeth put her hand behind her back and would not shake hands with miss thomas the teacher looked surprised the other children stared miss scott blushed red and spoke sharply to elizabeth elizabeth shake hands at once elizabeth turned her back and looked at a train puffing nearby im so sorry shes behaving so rudely said miss scott really upset she spoke in a low voice to miss thomas shes an only childvery very spoiltrich prettyand she doesnt want to come away to school just leave her alone for a bit and i expect shell be all right miss thomas nodded she was a merrylooking young woman and the girls liked her she was just going to say something when a man came hurrying up with four boys good morning miss thomas he said here is my batch sorry i cant stop ive a train to catch goodbye boys goodbye sir said the four boys how many boys have you at whyteleafe this term asked miss scott as many as girls not quite said miss thomas there are some more boys over there look in charge of mr johns miss scott liked the look of the boys all in dark blue overcoats and blue caps with yellow badge in front such a good idea she said to educate boys and girls together for a child like elizabeth who has no brothers and not even a sister it is like joining a large family of brothers and sisters and cousins to go to a school like whyteleafe oh theyll soon knock the corners off your elizabeth smiled miss thomas lookhere comes our train we have our carriages reserved for us so i must find them the boys have two carriages and the girls have three come along girls heres our train elizabeth was swept along with the others she was pushed into a carriage with a big label on it reserved for whyteleafe school goodbye elizabeth goodbye dear cried miss scott do your best goodbye said elizabeth suddenly feeling very small and lost ill soon be back she shouted gracious said a tubby little girl next to her a terms a long time you know fancy saying youll soon be back well i shall said elizabeth she was squashed in a heap by the tubby little girl and another girl on the other side who was rather bony she didnt like it elizabeth felt sure she would never never learn who all the different girls were she felt a little afraid of the big ones and she was horrified to think there were boys at her school boys nasty rough creatureswell shed show them that a girl could be rough too the little girl sat silently as the train rattled on and on the others chattered and talked and offered sweets round the carriage elizabeth shook her head when the sweets were offered to her oh come on do have one said the tubbly little girl whose sweets they were a sweet would do you goodmake you look a bit sweeter perhaps everybody laughed elizabeth went red and hated the tubby little girl ruth you do say some funny things said a big girl opposite dont tease the poor little things shes new well so is belinda next to you said ruth but she does at least say something when shes spoken to that will do ruth said miss thomas seeing how red elizabeth had gone ruth said no more but the next time she offered her sweets round she did not offer them to elizabeth it was a long journey elizabeth was tired when at last the train drew up in a country station and the girls poured out of the carriages the boys came to join them and the children talked eagerly of all they bad done in the holidays come along now quickly said mr johns pushing them out of the station gate the coach is waiting there was an enormous coach outside the station labelled whyteleafe school the children took their places elizabeth found a place as far away as possible from the tubby little girl called ruth she didnt like her one bit she didnt like belinda either she didnt like anyone they all stared at her too much the coach set off with a loud clank and rumble round the corner it went down a country lane up a steep hilland there was whyteleafe school at the top it was a beautiful building like an old country housewhich indeed it once had been its deep red walls green with creeper glowed in the april sun it had a broad flight of steps leading from the green lawns up to the school terrace good old whyteleafe said ruth pleased to see it the coach swept round to the other side of the school through a great archway and up to the front door the children jumped down and ran up the steps shouting and laughing elizabeth found her hand taken by miss thomas welcome to whyteleafe elizabeth said the teacher kindly smiling down at the sulky face i am sure you will do well here and be very happy with us all i shant said naughty elizabeth and she pulled her hand away it was certainly not a very good beginning chapter elizabeth makes a bad beginning it was halfpast one by the time the children arrived and they were all hungry for their dinner they were told to wash their hands quickly and tidy themselves and then go to the dininghall for their dinner eileen please look after the three new girls said miss thomas a big girl with a kindly face and a mass of fair curls came up to belinda elizabeth and another girl called helen she gave them a push in the direction of the cloakrooms hurry she said so they hurried and elizabeth soon found herself in a big cloakroom tiled in gleaming white with basins down one side and mirrors here and there she washed quickly feeling rather lost in such a crowd of chattering girls helen and belinda had made friends and elizabeth wished they would say something to her instead of chattering to one another but they said nothing to elizabeth thinking her rude and queer then to the dininghall went all the girls and took their places the boys clattered in too sit anywhere you like today said a tall mistress whose name elizabeth found was miss belle so the children sat down and began to eat their dinner hungrily there was hot soup first then beef carrots dumplings onions and potatoes and then rice pudding and golden syrup elizabeth was so hungry that she ate everything put before her though at home she would certainly have pushed away the rice pudding as it was the first day the children were allowed to talk as they pleased and there was such a noise as they told one another what they had done in the holidays i had a puppy for easter said one girl with a laughing face do you know my father bought a simply enormous easter egg and put the puppy inside and tied up the egg with a red ribbon goodness didnt i laugh when i undid it everybody else laughed too i had a new bicycle for my easter present said a roundfaced boy but it wasnt put into an egg what did you have for easter said eileen to elizabeth in a kindly tone she was sitting opposite and felt sorry for the silent new girl belinda and helen were sitting together telling each other about the last school they had been to only elizabeth had no one to talk to her i had a guineapig said elizabeth in a clear voice and it had a face just like miss thomas there was a shocked silence somebody giggled miss thomas looked rather surprised but she said nothing if you werent a new girl youd be jolly well sat on for that said a girl nearby glaring at elizabeth rude creature elizabeth couldnt help going red she had made up her mind to be naughty and rude and she was going to be really bad but it was rather dreadful to have somebody speaking like that to her in front of everyone she went on with her rice pudding soon the children began to talk to one another again and elizabeth was forgotten after dinner the boys went to unpack their things in their own bedrooms and the girls went to theirs whose room are the new girls in please miss thomas asked eileen miss thomas looked at her list let me see she said yeshere we areelizabeth allen belinda green helen marsdenthey are all in room six eileen and with them are ruth james joan lesley and nora osullivan ask nora to take the new girls there and show them what to do shes head of that room nora hie nora called eileen as a tall darkhaired girl with deep blue eyes went by take these kids to room six will you theyre yours youre head of that room i know said nora looking at the three new girls hallo is this the girl who was rude to miss thomas you just mind what you say whateveryournameis im not having any cheek from you i shall say exactly what i like said elizabeth boldly you cant stop me oho cant i said nora her blue irish eyes glaring at elizabeth thats all you know get along to the bedroom now and ill show you all what to do they all went up a winding oak staircase and came to a wide landing all around it were doors marked with numbers nora opened the door of number six and went in the bedroom was long high and airy there were wide windows all open to the school gardens outside the sun poured in and made the room look very pleasant indeed the room was divided into six by blue curtains which were now drawn back to the walls so that six low white beds could be seen each with a blue eiderdown beside each bed stood a wide chestofdrawers with a small mirror on top the chests were painted white with blue wooden handles and looked very pretty there were three washbasins in the room with hot and cold water taps to be shared by the six girls there was also a tall white cupboard for each girl and in these they hung their coats and dresses each bed had a blue rug beside it on the polished brown boards elizabeth couldnt help thinking that it all looked rather exciting she had only slept with miss scott beforenow she was to sleep with five other girls your trunks and tuckboxes are beside your beds said nora you must each unpack now and put your things away tidily and when i say tidily i mean tidily i shall look at your drawers once a week on the top of the chest you are allowed to have six things not more choose what you likehairbrushes or photographs or ornamentsit doesnt matter how silly thought elizabeth scornfully thinking of her own untidy dressingtable at home i shall put as many things out as i like they all began unpacking elizabeth had never packed or unpacked anything in her life and she found it rather exciting she put her things neatly away in her chestofdrawersthe piles of stockings vests bodices blouses everything she had brought with her she hung up her school coat and her dresses the others were busy unpacking too whilst they were doing this two more girls danced into the room hallo nora said one a redhaired girl with freckles all over her face im in your room this term good hallo joan said nora get on with your unpacking theres a lamb hallo ruthive got you here again have i well just see youre a bit tidier than last term ruth laughed she was the girl who had handed round her sweets in the train and she was plump and clever she ran to her trunk and began to undo it nora began to tell the new girls a little about the school they listened as they busily put away their things in their drawers whyteleafe school isnt a very large school began nora but its a jolly fine one the boys have their lessons with us and we play tennis and cricket with them and we have our own teams of girls only too last year we beat the boys at tennis well beat them this year too if only we can get some good players any of you new girls play tennis belinda did but the others didnt nora went on talking as she hung up her dresses we all have the same amount of pocketmoney to spend she said and its plenty too two shillings a week i shall have a lot more than that said belinda in surprise oh no you wont said nora all th money we have is put into a big box and we each draw two shillings a week from it unless weve been fined for something what do you meanfined asked helen who fines us miss belle and miss best oh no said nora we hoki a big meeting once a weekoftener if necessaryand we hear complaints and grumbles and if anyone has been behaving badly we fine them miss belle or miss best come to the meeting too of course but they dont decide anything much they trust us to decide for ourselves elizabeth thought this was very strange she had always thought that the teachers punished the children but at whyteleafe it seemed as if the children did it she listened in astonishment to all that nora was saying if theres any money over it is uiven to anyone who particularly wants to buy something that the meeting approves of went on nora for instance suppose you broke your tennis racket belinda and needed a new one the meeting might allow you to take the money from the box to buy oneespecially if they thought you were a very good player i see said belinda it sounds a good idea look norahere are the things out of my tuckbox what do i do with them i want to share them with everybody thanks said nora well we keep all our cakes and sweets and things in the playroom downstairs theres a big cupboard there and tins to put cakes into ill show you where elizabeth are your tuckbox things ready if so bring them along and well put them into the cupboard to share at teatime im not going to share said elizabeth remembering that she hadnt been naughty or horrid for some time i shall eat them all myself there was a horrified silence the five girls stared at elizabeth as if they couldnt believe their ears not share her cakes and sweets whatever sort of a girl was this well said nora at last her merry face suddenly very disgusted you can do what you like of course with your own things if theyre as horrid as you seem to be nobody would want to eat them chapter elizabeth gets into trouble as nora was about to lead the way down to the playroom she glanced at the chestsofdrawers to see that they were tidy on the top to her surprise she saw that elizabeth had put about a dozen things on her chest nora stopped and looked at them there were two hairbrushes a mirror a comb three photographs a bottle of scent two small vases and a clothesbrush look here said nora to the others this poor child cant count up to six shes got eleven things on her chest poor elizabeth fancy not being able to count six i can said elizabeth fiercely one two three four five six everybody squealed with laughter she can count said nora well elizabeth count your things and take five awayor cant you do takingaway there are eleven things on your chesttake away fiveand it will leave sixwhich is the number i told you to have im not going to take any away said elizabeth rudely arent you said nora in surprise well if you wonti will the angry irish girl picked up a hairbrush the three photographs and the mirror she went to a box under the window took a key from her pocket and unlocked it she put the five things inside and locked the box thats what happens when people cant count she said elizabeth stared at her in a rage give me my things back she said i want those photographs at once they are of mummy and daddy and my pony too sorry said nora putting the key into her pocket you can have them back when you apologise arid tell me that you know how to count i shant said elizabeth just as you please said nora now come on everybody and lets take the eatables down to the play room i dont want to bring mine said elizabeth i want to leave them here well if you do theyll go into that box along with the photographs said nora firmly the rule is that all eatables go downstairs elizabeth stood sulking looking at her cake her jam sandwich her chocolate toffee and shortbread then she picked up her tuckbox and followed the others she did not want them to go into that box she had seen enough of nora to know that that young lady was very determined they clattered down the oak staircase at one side of the hall was an open door leading into a very large room lined with cupboards and bookcases it was full of boys and girls some were talking some were playing games some were putting away cakes into tins they were all busy and happy and called out greetings to nora as she came into the room there was a gramophone going in one corner elizabeth stopped to listen to it for she loved music it was playing a tune that her mother played at home and suddenly the little girl felt as if she wanted her mother badly but never mind she thought to herself i shant be here long i dont expect theyll keep me more than a week if i go on being awfully naughty here are some empty tins said nora handing some down from a shelf catch helen catch elizabeth heres a big one for you belinda to take in that enormous cake soon they were all putting away their things nora took slips of paper from a pile and wrote their names on stick your name on your tin she said licking hers and sticking it to the side of her tin id like to see the classrooms said belinda ruth said she would show her round the whole school and off she went with belinda and helen elizabeth followed a little way behind curious to see what a school was like for she had never seen inside one before the dininghall she had already seena great high room with big windows tables ran down the middle of it it was only used for meals then there were the classrooms big sunny rooms all over the place with neat desks and chairs and a bigger desk for the teacher there were blackboards everywhere just like the one that miss scott had used for elizabeth this is our classroom said ruth to the new girls i expect well all be in miss rangers class shes pretty strict i can tell you nora in a higher class of course shes older shes a jolly good sort dont you think so yes agreed helen and belinda at once but elizabeth thought differently she pursed up her mouth and said nothing this is the gym said ruth and the three new girls looked in wonder at the great room with its ropes and climbingladders and bars and poles elizabeth suddenly felt excited she loved climbing and swinging and jumping she hoped she could do some gym before she left there were many other bedrooms like her own and then there was the part of the house put aside for miss belle and miss best and the other teachers youll each have to go and see the heads after tea said ruth theyre good sorts by the time the four girls had gone over the lovely grounds and had seen the cricketfields the tenniscourts and the flowerfilled gardens it was time for tea a bell rang loudly and the girls looked cheerful good tea said ruth come on wash first all of you and do your hairs yours looks awful elizabeth elizabeth did not like her dark curls being called awful she went up to her bedroom and did her hair neatly and washed her hands she was very hungry and thought with pleasure of her currant cake and jam sandwich ive got the most gorgeous chocolate cake you ever saw said belinda to the others it just melts in your mouth you must all have a piece and ive got some homemade shrimppaste thats too delicious for words said ruth you wait till you taste it chocolate cake and homemade shrimppaste seemed even more delicious to elizabeth than currant cake and jam sandwich which suddenly seemed rather ordinary she ran downstairs wondering if she would have two pieces of belindas gorgeous chocolate cake tea was laid in the diningroom the long tables were spread with white cloths and plates with big slices of brown bread and butter were set all the way down there were also some large plain cakes here and there and some big pots of plum jam the children put their tuckboxes on a bare table and placed on some empty plates there the cake or sandwich jam or paste they meant to share at tea these plates they took to their own table once again they were allowed to sit where they liked elizabeth put out her sandwich and her currant cake and took her place too grace was said and then the boys and girls began to chatter quietly suddenly nora banged on the table she was at the head of it everyone at her table stopped speaking i nearly forgot to say something said nora elizabeth allen does not wish to share her things with anyone so dont ask her for a piece of her cake wifi you she wants it all herself all right said the other children and they stared at elizabeth in surprise elizabeth went on eating her bread and butter next to her was ruth opening a large pot of shrimppaste that smelt simply delicious she passed it round the tablebut did not offer elizabeth any nobody offered her anything at all belinda counted how many there were at the tableelevenand then cut her cake into ten big pieces ten was enough because she missed elizabeth out elizabeth watched the others munching the chocolate cake which looked and smelt marvellous and longed for a piece she cut her currant cake it looked quite nice she suddenly felt that she really couldnt eat it all by her self she must offer it to the others too she didnt mind being thought naughty but being thought mean was different wifi you have a piece of my cake she asked ruth ruth stared at her in surprise how you do change your mind she said no thanks ive bad enough elizabeth offered her cake to belinda belinda shook her head no thank you she said elizabeth held out her plate to helen but helen simply made a face at her and turned away nobody would have any of elizabeths cake or of her sandwich either everyone else had either cut up half or all their cakes and had finished up their pots of jam or paste only elizabeths cake and sandwich stood almost untouched on their plates a bell rang miss thomas stood up and spoke to the girls and boys you may go out to play she said but the new children must stay behind in the play room and see the headmistresses so helen elizabeth and belinda went to the play room and also two boys named kenneth and ronald they set the gramophone going belinda did a funny dance and made them all laugh then someone poked her head in at the door and called to the children miss belle and miss best are waiting to see you go and line up outside the drawingroom door and mind you each say youre going to do your best for whyteleafe school and will work and play hard the girl disappeared the new children went to line up outside the drawingroom door it opened and miss best appeared come in she said to belinda and in belinda went the door shut well im not going to say i shall work hard and play hard said elizabeth to herself im going just to warn them that ii wont stay here and ill be so bad theyll have to send me away i wont stay at this horrid school the door opened and belinda came out smiling youre to go in next elizabeth she said and for goodness sake behave yourself chapter elizabeth is naughty elizabbth pushed open the door and went into the big drawingroom it was a lovely room with a few beautiful pictures on the walls and glowing cushions on the chairs and the couches the two mistresses were sitting on chairs near the window they looked up as elizabeth came m well elizabeth we are very glad to see you at whyteleafe school said miss belle she was young and pretty but miss best was older and except when she smiled she had rather a stern face sit down elizabeth said miss best smiling her lovely smile i hope you have made a few friends already no i havent said elizabeth she sat down on a chair miss best looked at her in surprise when she answered so shortly well i expect you will soon make plenty said the headmistress i hope you will be very happy with us elizabeth i shant be said elizabeth in a rude voice what a funny little girl said miss belle and she laughed cheer up dearyoull soon find things are very jolly here and i am sure you will do your best to work hard and make us proud of you im not going to said elizabeth going red im going to be as bad and naughty and horrid as i can possibly be so there i dont want to go to school i hate whyteleafe school ill be so bad that youll send me home next week the little girl glared at the two mistresses as she said all this expecting them to jump up in anger instead they both threw back their heads and laughed and laughed oh elizabeth what an extraordinary child you are said miss belle wiping away the tears of laughter that had come into her eyes you look such a good pretty little girl toono one would think you wanted to be so bad and naughty and horrid i dont care how you punish me said elizabeth tears coming into her own eyesbut tears of anger not of laughter you can do all you likei just shant care we never punish anyone elizabeth said miss best suddenly looking stern again didnt you know that no i didnt said elizabeth in astonishment what do you do when people are naughty then oh we leave any naughty person to the rest of the children to deal with said miss best every week the school holds a meeting you know and the children themselves decide what is to be done with boys and girls who dont behave themselves it wont bother us if you are naughtybut you may perhaps find that you make the children angry that seems funny to me said elizabeth i thought it was always the teachers that did the punishing not at whyteleafe school said miss belle well elizabeth my dear perhaps youd go now and tell the next child to come in will you maybe one day whyteleafe school will be proud of you even though you are quite sure it wont elizabeth went out without another word she couldnt help liking the two headmistresses though she didnt want to at all she wished she had been ruder to them what a funny school this was she spoke to helen outside the door youre to go in now she said the beauty and the beast are waiting for oh you naughty girl said helen with a giggle miss belle and miss bestthe beauty and the beast thats rather clever of you to think of that elizabeth elizabeth had meant it to be very rude she did not know enough of other children to know that they always loved nicknames for their masters and mistresses she was surprised that helen thought her clever and secretly she was pleased but she stuck her nose in the air and marched off she wasnt going to be pleased with anything or anybody at whyteleafe school she wandered round by herself until the supperbell went at seven oclock she felt hungry and went into the dininghall the children were once more opening their tins of cakes and a lively chatter was going on it all looked very jolly there were big mugs on the table and big jugs of steaming hot cocoa here and there there were piles of bread again butter cheese and dishes of stewed fruit the children sat down and helped themselves nobody took any notice of elizabeth at all till suddenly helen remembered what she had called miss belle and miss best with a giggle she repeated it to her neighbour and soon there was laughter all round the table the beauty and the beast went the whisper and chuckles echoed round elizabeth heard the whispers and went red nora osullivan laughed loudly its a jolly good nickname she said belle means beauty and best is very like beastand certainly miss belle is lovely and miss best isnt that was pretty smart of you elizabeth elizabeth smiled she really couldnt help it she didnt want toshe wanted to be as horrid as possible but it was really very pleasant to have everyone laughing at her joke its queer though she thought i meant to be horrid and rude and the others just think its funny i guess miss belle and miss best wouldnt think it was funny though nobody offered elizabeth any of their goodies and she did not like to offer hers for she felt sure everyone would say no the meal went on until halfpast seven and then after grace was said the children all got up and went to the playroom whens your bedtime said nora to elizabeth i expect its eight oclock youd better see the times are on the noticeboard over there my bedtime is at halfpast eight and when i come to bed i expect all the rest of you to be safe in bed i dont want to go to bed at eight oclock said elizabeth indignantly i go to bed much later than that at home well you shouldnt then said nora no wonder youre such a crosspatch my mother says that late hours make children stupid badtempered and slow elizabeth went to see the times for going to bed hers was as nora had said at eight oclock well she wouldnt go shed be naughty so she slipped out into the garden and went to where she had seen two or three big swings she got on to a swing and began to push herself to and fro it was lovely there in the evening sunshine elizabeth quite forgot that she was at school and she sang a little song to herself a boy came into the place where the swings were and stared at elizabeth what are you doing here he said i bet its your bedtime mind your own business said elizabeth at once well what about you going off to bed and minding yours said the boy im a monitor and its my job to see that people do what theyre told i dont know what a monitor is and i dont care said elizabeth rudely well let me tell you what a monitor is said the boy who was just about elizabeths size its somebody put in charge of other silly kids at whyteleafe to see they dont get too silly if you dont behave yourself i shall have to report you at the meeting then youll be punished pooh said elizabeth and she swung herself very hard indeed put out her foot and kicked the boy so vigorously that he fell right over elizabeth squealed with laughterbut not for long the boy jumped up ran to the swing and shook elizabeth off he caught hold of her dark curls and pulled them so hard that the little girl yelled with pain the boy grinned at her and said serve you right you be careful how you treat me next time or ill pull your nose as well as your hair noware you going in or not elizabeth ran away from him and went indoors she looked at the clockquarterpast eight perhaps she would have time to go to bed before that horrid nora came up at halfpast so she ran up the stairs and went to bedroom number ruth joan belinda and helen were already there half undressed their curtains were pulled around their cubicles but they were talking hard all the same elizabeth slipped into her own cubicle youre late elizabeth said ruth youll get into trouble if youre caught by a monitor i have been said elizabeth but didnt care i was on the swing and i put out my foot and kicked him over well youre very silly said ruth you will get into trouble at the meeting if you dont look out and thats not pleasant i dont care for any silly meeting said elizabeth jumping into bed she remembered that nora had put her three photographs into the locked box and she jumped out again she went to the box and tried to open itbut it was still locked nora came in at that moment and saw elizabeth there hallo kid she said do you want your things back well apologise and you can have them but elizabeth was not going to say she was sorry she made a rude face at nora and flung herself into bed well you are a sweet child arent you said nora mockingly i hope you get out at the right side of your bed tomorrow then there was a creak as nora sat on her bed to take off her stockings a clock struck halfpast eight downstairs no more talking now said nora sleep tight all of you chapter elizabeth joins her class elizabeth wondered where she was when she awoke the next morning but she soon remembered she was at that horrid school a bell rang nora sat up in her bed and spoke to the others thats the bell for getting up she said stir yourselves youve got half an hour elizabeth thought she wouldnt get up she lay there warm in her bed and looked up at the white ceiling noras voice came sharply to her elizabeth allen are you getting up or are you not not said elizabeth cheekily well im in charge of you five and its my job to get you down to breakfast in good time said nora poking her nose round the curtain get up you lazy creature are you a monitor asked elizabeth remembering the boy of the evening before i am said nora come on get up elizabeth and dont make yourself such a nuisance elizabeth still lay there nora nodded to plump ruth and the two went beside elizabeths bed together they stripped all the clothes off the lazy girl and then tipped up the mattress elizabeth gave a shriek and slid on to the floor she was very angry she rushed at norabut nora was big and strong and caught hold of the angry girls arms at once dont be silly now she said get dressed and hurry up or ill spank you with a hairbrush monitors do that sometimes you know elizabeth felt that she couldnt bear to be spanked by nora she washed very sulkily dressed cleaned her teeth and did her hair she was just going downstairs when nora who had gone into everyones cubicle to see if they were tidy called her back elizabeth come and put your chestofdrawers tidy do you want me to put the rest of your things into the locked box elizabeth went back and tidied her things it was quicker to do that than argue with nora she wondered if nora would notice that she had put socks on instead of the long brown stockings but nora didnt notice she was in too big a hurry to get down to breakfast in time and besides she didnt dream that anyone would wear socks instead of stockings at whyteleafe school but a great many of the other children noticed elizabeths bare legs at once and giggled miss thomas noticed them too and called to elizabeth youve put the wrong things on elizabeth you must change your socks for stockings afterwards but elizabeth didnt when she went up to make her bed afterwards she didnt change at all nora saw that she hadnt and spoke to her for goodness sake put stockings on elizabeth really i shouldnt have thought anyone could be quite so silly as you seem to be im not silly said elizabeth i prefer socks stockings make my legs too hot and im going to keep my socks on ruth spoke to nora nora elizabeth is really babyish she said and the babies at whyteleafe are allowed to wear socks arent they ive seen them in the kindergarten with their dear little bare legs well why not let elizabeth keep her socks to show that she is really only a baby though shes getting on for eleven you can easily explain that to miss thomas thats a good idea said nora with a laugh all right elizabethkeep your socks on and well explain to everyone that were letting you because youre really not much more than a baby the girls went out of the room laughing elizabeth put on her bedspread and stood thinking she didnt think she wanted to keep her socks on now if only the younger children wore them because they were the babies of the school she didnt want to the babies would laugh at her and so would the others elizabeth tore off her shoes grabbed her socks and pulled them off in a temper she took out her stockings and pulled them on bother bother bother now she would have to wear stockings after all she flew downstairs to the gym where she had been told to go after making her bed and tidying her cubicle all the others were there elizabeth had felt sure that they would all make remarks about her stockings being on after allbut nobody took any notice of her at all hymns were sung and prayers said miss best read part of a bible chapter in her rather stern ioice then she called the names of all the girls and boys to see that they were there elizabeth had a good look round the boys and girls were in separate rows there were a good many masters and mistresses the matron of the school who looked after the children when they were ill stood on the platform with some of the other mistresses a fat jollylooking person dressed like a nurse in apron and cap the musicmaster played the piano for the singing and again when the children marched out he made up a fine marching tune and elizabeth liked it very much for she loved music she wondered if she was supposed to learn music at whyteleafe miss scott had taught her at home but miss scott was not musical and elizabeth had not enjoyed her lessons at all out marched the children to their classrooms you are in miss rangers class said ruth poking elizabeth in the back come with me and ill show you elizabeth followed ruth she came to a big sunny classroom and into it poured six boys and nine girls all about elizabeths age bags i this desk squealed ruth i like to be by the window she put her things into the desk the other children chose their desks too but the new ones were told to wait till miss ranger came ruth sprang to hold the door open as soon as she heard miss rangers rather loud voice down the passage in came miss ranger good morning children good morning miss ranger said everyone but elizabeth all the old children can sit but the new ones must stand whilst i give them their places said miss ranger she gave elizabeth a desk at the back elizabeth was glad it would be a good place to be naughty in she meant to be bad in class that very morning the sooner that everyone knew how naughty she meant to be the sooner she would be sent home books were given out we will take a reading lesson first said miss ranger who wanted to make sure that the new children could read properly then dictationthen arithmetic elizabeth could read beautifully spell well and she liked arithmetic she couldnt help feeling that it was rather fun to do lessons with a lot of people instead of by herself when her turn came she read very nicely indeed though she had a great many difficult words in her page very good elizabeth said miss ranger next please elizabeth got all her dictation right she thought it was very easy miss ranger took a red pencil and marked very good on elizabeths page elizabeth looked at it proudlyand then she suddenly remembered that she had meant to be naughty this wont do she said to herself i cant get very goods like thistheyll never send me home id better be naughty she wondered what to do she looked at ruth by the window and wondered if she could flip her rubber at her and hit her she took her ruler fitted her rubber against the end of it bent it back and let it go whizzzzzz the rubber flew across the schoolroom and hit ruth on the left ear ooooh said ruth in surprise she looked round and saw elizabeths grinning face others began to giggle when they saw ruths angry look elizabeth grew bolder she folded up a bit of paper and flipped it at helen who sat m front but helen moved her head and the pellet of paper flew past her and landed on miss rangers desk she looked up playtime is for things like this she said not lessontime who did that elizabeth didnt answer miss ranger looked up and down the rows who did that she said again the boy next to elizabeth poked her bard with his ruler own up he whispered if you dont well all be kept in so elizabeth owned up i did it she said well elizabeth perhaps you would like to know that i dont allow behaviour like that in my class said miss ranger dont do it again i shall if i want to said elizabeth everybody looked at her in amazement miss ranger was surprised you must be very bored with these lessons to want to flip paper about she said go outside the room and stay there till you feel it would bore you less to come back than to stand outside i dont mind how long you stand there but i do mind anybody being bored in my class now children get out your paintboxes please there was a clatter as the desks were opened and paintboxes were taken out elizabeth loved painting and was very good at it she wanted to stay she sat on in her desk and didnt move elizabeth go outside please said miss ranger there was no help for it thenup elizabeth got and went outside the door you may come back when you think you can really behave yourself and not disturb my class said miss ranger it was very dull standing outside the door elizabeth wondered if she should wander away and have a swing noshe might meet the beauty and the beast ha ha she was being naughty all right but it was dull standing so long outside a door and hearing happy talking coming from inside as the children painted blue and pink lupins that miss ranger had brought in elizabeth couldnt bear it any longer she opened the door and went in i can behave myself now she said in a low voice to miss ranger miss ranger nodded without a smile take your place she said theres no time for you to do any paintingyou can do a few more sums sums again thought elizabeth angrily well ill just be bad as soon as ever i can think of something really naughty again chapter the first school meeting that evening after tea the first meeting was held the whole school attended it and miss belle miss best and mr johns came too they sat at the back and did not seem to be taking a great deal of notice of what was going on but all the same they never miss a word said ruth to belinda who was feeling just a little scared of this first important meeting the two head children of the school a gravelooking girl called rita and a merryeyed boy called william sat at a large table in the gym where the meeting was held they were the judges twelve other children six boys and six girls big and small sat round a table just in front of the two judges they were called the jury all the others sat on forms around at first elizabeth had thought she would not go to the meeting then she had felt rather curious about it and decided to go just this one time she had seen a notice on the noticeboard that said please bring all the money you have and she had brought hers in her pursethough she was quite determined not to give it up if she were asked to do so all the children stood up when the two judges and the two mistresses and master came into the roomall but elizabeth however she got up in a great hurry when she felt ruths hard fingers digging into her back to make her move she glared round at ruth and was just going to speak angrily to her when there was the sound of a hammer being rapped on a table sit please said one of the judges everyone sat elizabeth saw that there was a wooden hammer or mallet on the table in front of the judges and also a large notebook and some sheets of paper there was a large box as well like a big moneybox it all looked important and exciting the twelve children round the smaller table are the monitors whispered helen to elizabeth they are chosen by us all every month elizabeth saw that nora was at the jury table and so was the boy she had kicked the day before she didnt know any of the others except eileen the girl who had been kind to her yesterday the girl judge rose in her seat and spoke clearly to the school this is our first meeting this term she said we have very little to do today because school only opened yesterday but we must just make our rules clear to the new children and we must also take in the money we do not need to choose new monitors because we elected those at the last meeting of the easter term you see them at the jury table they will remain monitors for one month unless any meeting decides to choose others instead as you know monitors are chosen for their common sense their loyalty to the school and its ideas and their good character they must be obeyed because you yourselves have chosen them the girl judge stopped and looked down at a paper she held on which she had written notes to remind her of what she wanted to say she looked round at the listening children we have very few rules she said one rule is that we place all the money we get into this box and we draw from it two shillings a week each the rest of the money is used to buy anything that any of you especially wantbut you have to state at the weekly meeting what you need the money for and the jury will decide if you may have it one or two of the children clinked their money as if they would like to put it into the box at once the judges smiled youll be able to give your money in a minute said the girl judge now to go on with our rules the second rule is that if we have any complaint at all we must bring it to the meeting and announce it there so that everyone may hear it and decide what is to be done with it any bullying unkindness untruthfulness dis obedience may be brought before the meeting and we will decide what punishment shall be given please be sure you understand the difference between a real complaint and telling tales because telling tales is also punished if you are not sure of the difference ask your monitor before you bring your complaint to the meeting the girl judge sat down the boy judge got up and beamed round the listening company we will now take the money be said after that we will hand out the two shillings to everyone and then see if anybody wants extra this week thomas take the box round please elizabeth was quite sure she was not going to give up her money she quickly pushed her purse under her and sat on it hard thomas came round with the box money clinked into itshillings and sixpences halfcrowns and even a tenshilling note or two went into the big box the box came to elizabeth she passed it on without putting her money into it but thomas the monitor noticed it at once havent you any money at all he asked elizabeth pretended not to hear thomas said no more but went on taking the box round elizabeth was pleased i did what i wanted to them and they couldnt stop me she thought thomas took the box up to the judge it was very heavy now he put it on their table and said something to them in a low voice william the boy judge rapped on his table with the hammer everyone stopped chattering elizabeth allen did not put her money into the box he said elizabeth have you no money yes i have answered elizabeth defiantly but im going to keep it stand up when you speak to me ordered the judge elizabeth felt ruths hard fingers poking her again and she stood up ruth saw the purse on the form and quickly picked it up why do you want to keep your money to yourself asked william are you so very selfish no said elizabeth but i think its a silly idea listen said william patiently in this school we dont like to think that some of us have heaps of money to spend and others have hardly any we all get the same and if you want anything extra you can always have it if the meeting agrees well im not going to stay at this school very long said elizabeth in a rude defiant voice and shall want some money to go home by trainso im not going to give it to you there was a buzz of surprise and horror the judges and the jury stared at elizabeth as if she was something very queer indeed the two headmistresses and the master looked up with great interest wondering what the judges would say william and rita spoke together in low voices then they banged on the table with the hammer everyone was silent at once william spoke in a grave voice we think elizabeth is wrong and silly he said her parents are paying a lot of money to keep her in this fine school and even if she goes home in a short while her terms fees still have to be paid also we think she is very feeble not to try and see if she likes whyteleafe if im not sent home ill run away said elizabeth angry at being spoken of like this that cant be allowed said william at once you would worry your parents and everyone here just because you are a selfish silly girl ruth is that elizabeths money i see you waving at me bring it here elizabeth made a snatch at her money but it was too late ruth took the bag to the table and emptied six shillings two halfcrowns and five sixpences into the moneybox elizabeth blinked her eyes she wanted to cry but she wasnt going to elizabeth we cant allow you to keep your money in case you are foolish enough to use it for running away said rita in a kind but stern voice one of the jury stood up it was a tall boy called maurice i should like to say that the jury think that elizabeth allen must not have any money at all to spend this week because of her behaviour he said all the jury put up their hands to show that they agreed very well said the judge now elizabeth we shant say any more to you today because you are a new girl and must be given a chance to settle down i hope you will have a good report at next weeks meeting we shall be very pleased if you do well i shant then said elizabeth in a furious voice you just wait and see what ill do sit down said william losing his patience with the defiant little girl weve had enough of you for one meeting nora give out the money to everyone please nora gave two shillings to everybody except elizabeth the little girl sat sulking on her form hating everybody how dared they take her money she would pay ruth out for taking her purse like that when everyone had their money the judges knocked for silence again does anyone want extra money this week for anything asked william a small boy stood up i should like sixpence extra he said what for asked william ive been told i must give some money to the school club to help towards a new gramophone he said well take it out of your two shillings said william sit down sixpence extra not granted the boy sat down a girl got up may i have one and ninepence extra to pay for an electric light bulb i broke by accident in the playroom she asked whos your monitor asked rita one of the jury stood up a girl called winnie was it a proper accident winnie or just fooling about asked rita it was a proper accident said winnie elsie was trying to open a tin and the opener flew out of her hand and broke the light bulb give her one and ninepence out of the box then ordered rita winnie took the money and gave it to the girl who was very pleased any more requests asked william nobody said anything any complaints or grumbles asked rita elizabeth felt uncomfortable would nora complain about her would that boy she had kicked who was a monitor complain too goodness this meeting was lasting much too long chapter the first week at school nobody made any complaints at all elizabeth couldnt help feeling glad all the same theyll have plenty of complaints to make about me next week she thought ill just show them that i mean what i say somebody had a grumble it was a small boy called wilfred he stood up looking rather shy have a grumble he said go on then said william the judge please he said i learn music and one of the times put down for my practice is half of crickettime on tuesday could i have it changed because i do bate missing cricket certainly said william mr johns do you think that could be changed ill see to it said mr johns from the back of the room ill speak to the musicmaster and have it put right for wilfred thank you said william and wilfred together there were no more grumbles william hammered on the table the meeting is over he said the next will be held at the same time on the same day next week everyone must attend the children jumped up talking loudly and went out to their various tasks some had lessons to prepare for the next day some had pets to feed some wanted to practise cricket or tennis everyone seemed to have something to do all except elizabeth she seemed to have no one to talk to no one to walk with she knew it was her own fault but she didnt like it she wandered off by herself and came to a little room where someone was playing the piano softly and beautifully elizabeth loved music with all her heart she crept into the little musicroom and sat down to listen mr lewis the musicmaster was there playing to himself when he finished he turned round and saw elizabeth hallo he said did you like that yes i loved it said elizabeth it sounded to me like the sea it was supposed to be the sea on a summers day said mr lewis he was an old man with gentle eyes and a small grey beard it was written by a man who loved to put the sea into his music i wish i could learn to play it said elizabeth i really do wish i could am i supposed to be learning music at this school do you know whats your name asked the musicmaster taking out a small notebook and opening it mine is mr lewis mine is elizabeth allen said elizabeth yesheres your name said mr lewis you are down for music lessons with me thats fine we shall get on well together and perhaps by the end of the term you will be able to play this seapiece you like so much id like that said elizabeth but i shant be here long i hate school dear me what a pity said mr lewis most children simply love itespecially whyteleafe school well if you think you wont be here long perhaps i had better cross your name off my list it seems a waste of time to have any music lessons if you mean to go welli might as well have one or two lessons said elizabeth i suppose i couldnt have one now could i mr lewis looked at his watch yes he said ive got twenty minutes fetch your music and well see what you can do elizabeth was happy for the first time when she sat down at the piano with the musicmaster by her side she played one of her favourite pieces mr lewis jerked his foot in time to the music and nodded his head when she had finished yes elizabeth he said pleased you will be one of my best pupils i must ask you to change your mind about leaving us soonit will be a pleasure to me to teach you that seapiece elizabeth felt pleased and proud but she shook her head im afraid i shant stay she said theyve taken my money away so that i cant run away but im going to be so horrid that theyll have to send me away what a pity said mr lewis he looked at his watch again play me something else he said ive a little more time at the end of the lesson mr lewis showed elizabeth the name of the seapiece he had played there is a most beautiful gramophone record of it he said why dont you ask for some money to buy it at the next meeting everyone would love the record in the playroom and i know they havent got it id love to get it said elizabeth then i could hear it whenever wanted to but know the meeting wouldnt give me any money why theyve even not let me have the two shillings everyone else has dear dear said mr lewis smiling you must really be a very bad little girland yet you play my piano like an angel do i really said elizabeth in delightbut the musicmaster had gone leaving elizabeth to put away her music and shut the piano elizabeth soon found out that there were many pleasant things that the children of whyteleafe were allowed to do every other day they were allowed to go down to the village in twos to buy sweets toys books and anything they wanted they were also allowed to go to the cinema once a week provided that they paid for themselves they could go riding every day and this elizabeth simply adored for there were rolling hills and commons around the school on which it was perfectly lovely to gallop elizabeth rode very well indeed for she had had her own pony for years then on two evenings a week the musicmaster gave a little concert to those children who really loved music the concert was from halfpast seven to eight after supper and mr lewis gathered round him about twelve boys and girls who loved to hear the beautiful music he drew from his piano sometimes he played the violin too and elizabeth longed to learn to play it when she heard mr lewis drawing the bow across the strings of his fine violin on another evening there was a small dance beginning at halfpast seven for an hour elizabeth loved dancing too and when she saw the notice on the noticeboard she was pleased no wonder the children were happy at whyteleafe there seemed always something lovely to look forward to something exciting to do helen and belinda the other new girls soon settled down well made firm friends with one another and were very happy the two new boys also made friends once joan tried to make friends with elizabeth but the little girl made a rude face and turned away as the days went on elizabeth kept to her plan she took every chance of being naughty and rude till everyone was tired of her she spent most of the mornings outside the door of the classroom because miss ranger could not have her in the room as she disturbed the class so much one morning she caught the school cat and put it inside miss rangers desk before anyone entered the room when miss ranger opened the lid the cat jumped out and miss ranger squealed in fright everyone giggled they knew it was elizabeth of course another time elizabeth put the classroom clock ten minutes fast and miss ranger stopped the lesson too soon when miss ranger found out she was angry as you all have missed ten minutes of your arith metic lesson she said i am going to give you two extra sums to do for your preparation time this after noon the class was angry with elizabeth you wait till the next meeting said ruth therell be some fine complaints about you there i dont care said elizabeth and she didnt one afternoon after tea elizabeth wanted to go and see the village of whyteleafe she went to nora her monitor and asked her for permission to go and look at the shops in the village yes you can go said nora but get someone to go with you we are only allowed to go in twos elizabeth went to ruth will you come with me to the village she asked want to look at the shops no thanks said ruth i dont want to go with anyone like you i dont know how you might behave in the road i might be ashamed of you i know how to behave in the road said elizabeth crossly well you dont know how to behave at school said ruth and walked away elizabeth asked belinda but belinda shook her head i dont want to go she said helen wouldnt go either nor would joan elizabeth didnt like to ask any of the boys because they always laughed at her when they saw her coming heres the bold had girl they said to one another and soon poor elizabeth began to be known as the bold bad girl elizabeth went back to nora nobody will go with me she said it serves you right said nora you cant go if nobody will go with you we are not allowed to go alone well im going alone said elizabeth to herself and she slipped out of the school door down the steps round to the right and through the big archway down the hills she ran to see the village she had a lovely time looking into all the shops she looked longingly into the sweetshop and wished she had some money to buy some toffee she looked into a musicshop and wondered if they had the gramophone record of the seapiece she loved she looked into the toyshopand good gracious coming out of it was rita the head girl of whyteleafe school now what was naughty elizabeth to do chapter rita has a job for elizabeth elizabeth had no time to run away rita came out of the shop almost on top of her she smiled at the little girland then she saw that she was alone her smile faded and she looked stern surely somebody is with you she asked no said elizabeth but elizabeth you know by now that no one is allowed in the village by herself said rita you must always come with somebody why didnt you because nobody would come with me said eliza beth i did ask a whole lot of them well you had better come with me now said rita i am alone because the girls of the top class are allowed to shop by themselves so walk along with me elizabeth was just going to say that she didnt want to when she saw what lovely kind eyes rita had rita was looking at her and elizabeth thought she was the kindestlooking girl she had ever seeneven nicer than eileen so she walked along by rita in silence you know elizabeth it is strange that no one would go with you said rita doesnt anybody at all like you no said elizabeth dont you remember rita that i told you i was going to be as horrid as could be so that i could go home well everybody thinks i am very horrid so nobody wants to talk to me or walk with me and are you really horrid asked rita elizabeth looked up she was surprised that rita should talk to her kindly after having found her out in disobedience but rita did not look angry only very understanding and wise elizabeth thought for a moment was she really horrid she remembered all the governesses she had had she remembered that miss scott wouldnt stay with her perhaps she really and truly was a horrid girl i dont know she said at last i believe i am horrid really rita i make myself horrider than i truly ambut all the same i believe i cant be very nice poor little elizabeth said rita i wonder what has made you grow so horrid you look such a nice little girl and when you smile you are quite different i do feel sorry for you a lump suddenly came into elizabeths throat and tears into her eyes she blinked the tears away angrily now rita would think she was a baby dont feel sorry for rue she said i want to be horrid so that i can go home couldnt you try to be nice for a change and just give yourself a chance asked rita no said elizabeth i shant be sent home if i am nice i simply must be as bad as i can be but you will make yourself very unhappy said rita and you will make other people unhappy too shall i said elizabeth in surprise well i dont mind making myself unhappy if i can get what i want in the endbut i dont want to make other people unhappy i think i am a horrid girl but rita i wish youd believe me when i say that i really dont mean to make the others unhappy well listen elizabeth said rita walking all the time hack towards the school there is someone in your room who isnt very happy have you noticed it you might at least do what you can to make things nicer for her who is it asked elizabeth in surprise it is joan said rita she hasnt a happy home and she comes back to school very miserable each term she worries about her father and mother all the time because they dont seem to want her or to love her they never come to see her at half term oh said elizabeth remembering that joan usually did look rather sad i didnt know nobody knows except me said rita i live near joan at home so i know i am telling you this elizabeth because if you really do mean what you say about not wanting to make other people unhappy you can just try to make things better for joan she hasnt any friend any more than you havebut for a different reason she is afraid of making friends in case anyone asks her to stay with them for the holidaysand she knows her mother wouldnt bother to ask any friend back to stay with joan and joan is very proud and cant bear to take kindnesses she cant return now theres a job for you to do can you do it oh yes rita said elizabeth at once although she was spoilt she had a tender heart and when she saw that someone was in trouble she would always go to help them thank you for telling me i wont tell anyone else i know you wont said rita it is such a pity that you mean to be bad elizabeth because i can see you would be splendid if you would give yourself a chance elizabeth frowned its no good she said im going to do what i meant to doget sent home as soon as ever i can and i cant be sent home if im good well come and talk to me any time you think you would like to said rita as they walked in at the school gates and i say elizabethdont go alone into the village again will you can you promise that elizabeth was just going to say no she wouldnt promise when she thought of how kind and gentle rita had beenand she felt she must promise i promise rita she said andand thank you for being so nice you make it rather difficult for me to be as horrid as i want to be thats a good thing said rita with a laugh and the tall head girl walked away to her own room nora met elizabeth as she walked to the playroom did you go to the village she asked yes i did said elizabeth who went with you asked nora nobody answered elizabeth defiantly then i thai report you at the next meeting said nora angrily report me all you like said elizabeth in a dontcare tone shant mind youll mind all right when the time comes miss dontcare said nora elizabeth went to the playroom and put a record on the gramophone she looked through the pile of records to see if the seapece was there that she loved but it wasnt she wondered how much it would cost but what was the use of wondering that she would never have any money now to buy anything this horrid horrid school joan townsend came into the playroom people were used to her quiet ways and nobody took much notice of her they called her the mouse and often asked her where she kept her bit of cheese elizabeth looked ub and thought that joan did indeed look very sad has the afternoon post come yet asked joan yes said helen long ago nothing for you joan perhaps she hoped to hear from her mother or father thought elizabeth i hear from mummy often and miss scott has written twicebut i dont remember joan getting a single letter she was just going to say something to joan when the supperbell rang the children all trooped into the dininghall elizabeth tried to sit next to joan but she couldnt she noticed that joan hardly ate anything after supper there was a concert in the music masters room elizabeth ran up to joan and spoke to her joan come and hear mr lewis playing to night hes going to play a lovely thing to usmy mummy plays it at home and i know it very well no thanks said joan ive got a letter to write elizabeth stared after her as joan went to the playroom joan always seemed to be writing lettersbut none ever came for her elizabeth ran to tell mr lewis she was coming to his little concert and then she ran and peeped in at the playroom joan was there alonebut she was not writing letters she sat with her pen in her hand and two big tears dropped on to the writingpad on the desk below elizabeth was horrified she hated to see anyone crying she stepped into the roombut joan turned and saw her coming she wiped her tears away at once and spoke fiercely to elizabeth what are you spying on me for you horrid thing cant you leave anybody alone youre always making a nuisance of yourself joan i only wanted to yes i know what you wanted said joan just as fiercely you wanted to see me crying and then laugh at me and tell all the others im a baby you say you want to be as horrid and nasty as you canbut just you try telling the others you saw me crying oh please joan i wouldnt do that i really wouldnt said elizabeth full of dismay to think that joan should think such a thing of her joan please listen im not quite as horrid as i make myself be oh do please let me be friends with you no said joan who was almost as obstinate as elizabeth when she was unhappy go away do you suppose id let the naughtiest girl in the school be my friend i dont want any friend go away elizabeth went she felt dreadful how could she help joan if joan wouldnt believe that she was not quite as horrid as she pretended to be she thought of joans unhappy freckled face and although the musicmaster played really beautifully that evening for once elizabeth did not listen in delightfor once she was thinking of somebody else and not herself if only joan would let me help her thought elizabeth rita wouldnt have told me if she hadnt thought i could do it i wish i could have a chance of showing rita i can really do something for somebody elizabeths chance came that very night when she and the other five girls in her room were in bed and elizabeth was almost asleep she heard a sound from the end bed where joan slept joan was sobbing quietly under the clothes elizabeth was out of bed at once although she knew that the rule was that no one was to leave her own cubicle till morning but elizabeth didnt care for rules anyhowand she meant to go to joan even if joan pushed her away as fiercely as before chapter joans secret elizabeth slipped by noras bed and by belindas she came to joans at the end beside the wall she slipped in between the curtains and went to sit on joans bed joan stopped crying at once and lay quite stiff and still wondering who it was on her bed elizabeth whispered to her joan its me elizabeth whats the matter are you unhappy go away said joan in a fierce whisper i shant said elizabeth it makes me unhappy myself to hear you crying all alone are you homesick go away said joan beginning to cry softly again i tell you i shant said elizabeth listen joan im unhappy too i was so had at home that no governesses would stay with me so my mother had to send me away to school but i love my mummy and i cant bear to be sent away from home like this i want my dogand my ponyand even my canaryso i do know how you feel if you are homesick joan listened in surprise so that was why elizabeth was so horridpartly because she was unhappy too and wanted to be at home now joan tell me whats the matter with you begged elizabeth please do i wont laugh you know that i only want to help you theres nothing much the matter said joan wiping her eyes its only thati dont think my mother and father love meand i do love them so much you seethey hardly ever write to meand they never come to see me at half termand its my birthday this term and everyone knows itand i shant get a present from them or a birthday cake or anything i know i shant and it makes me feel so dreadful oh joan said elizabeth and she took the girls hand in hers and squeezed it oh joan thats awful when i think how my mummy spoilt meand gave me everything i wanted and fussed meand i was cross and impatient all the time and here are you just longing for a little tiny bit of everything i had i feel rather ashamed of myself well so you ought to be said joan sitting up you dont know how lucky you are to be loved and fussed goodness i should be really thrilled and frightfully happy if my mother wrote to me even once in a fortnightand yours has sent you cards and letters almost every day it makes me jealous dont be jealous said elizabeth beginning to cry herself i would share everything with you if i could joan i really would well you cant be quite so horrid as everyone thinks you are then said joan i think i am rather horrid but i do make myself much worse said elizabeth you see i mean to be sent back home as soon as possible that will make your mother very unhappy said joan it is a great disgrace to be expelled from school sent away never to come back you are very queer you love your mother and she loves you and you want to go back to herand yet you are willing to make her very unhappy dont understand you id do anything in the world for my mother and she doesnt love me at all i try to make her proud of me i do everything i can for her but she doesnt seem to bother about me youre as bad as you can be and i expect your mother will love you all the same it isnt fair noit doesnt seem fair said elizabeth thinking hard she was glad her mother wasnt like joans she made up her mind to be very nice to her mother when she went back home to make up for making her unhappy by her behaviour at school you see elizabeth the other girls see me waiting for letters every day and they laugh at me behind my back and think my parents must be very queer people said joan and i do hate that too last term i sent some letters to myself just so that i should have some but the others found out and teased me dreadfully its a shame said elizabeth joan dont worry so perhaps things will come right couldnt we be friends please just whilst im here i dont mean to be here for long but it would be nice to have somebody for a friend for a little while all right said joan and she took elizabeths hand thank you for coming to me tonight im so glad youre not as horrid as i thought i think youre very nice elizabeth slipped back to her own bed her heart feeling warm and glad it was good to have a friend it was lovely to be thought very nice no boy or girl had ever said that of elizabeth before i wont let the others laugh at joan thought elizabeth fiercely shes my friend now i shall look after hershes just like a timid mouse to the astonishment of everyone the two girls soon became fast friends they went down to the village together joan spent some of her two shillings on sweets which she shared with elizabeth elizabeth helped joan with her sums during preparation in the afternoon for joan was bad at arithmetic and elizabeth was quick joan asked elizabeth many questions about her father and mother she was never tired of hearing how wonderful they were and the presents they gave elizabeth and the fuss they made of her what are they like to look at asked joan i could show you their photographs but nora locked them up her box by the window said elizabeth well fancy letting them stay there when all youve got to do is to say youre sorry and that you know how to count said joan remembering what had happened goodnessi wouldnt let my mothers picture stay in that dirty old box i shant apologise to nora said elizabeth sulkily i dont like herinterfering creature shes not said joan shes a good sort sometimes i think you are an awful baby elizabeth only a baby would talk like that oh so you think im a baby do you cried eiizabeth flaring up in a rage and tossing her curls over her shoulder well ill just show you nora was coming into the bedroom at that very moment she was astonished to find elizabeth flinging herself almost on top of her shouting loudly nora im sorry about those things you put in the box i know how to count and ill show you i can put six things on my chestofdrawers good gracious dont deafen me said nora all rightyou can have them back nora unlocked the box took out all elizabeths things and gave them to her youre an awful goose you know she said halfscolding halfkindly she had been pleased to see that elizabeth had really tried to make friends with someone at last elizabeth proudly put her photographs on her chest and showed them to joan the bell went for tea and they had to go downstairs before elizabeth had finished saying all she wanted to as they passed the hail letterrack elizabeth glanced up to see if there were any letters for her goody a letter from motherand one from daddy tooand this looks like one from granny said elizabeth she took them down joan had no letters at all hallo joan still glooming over the letterrack as usual called helens voice im sure i dont know what youd do if ever you did find a letter there one day jump through the roof i should think joan went red and turned away elizabeth saw that she was hurt and she jumped round on helen i suppose you think youre funny she shouted well perhaps youd like to know that joan had four letters and a card this morning and she didnt jump through the roof shes not quite such a cuckoo as you are helen was so astonished to hear elizabeth sticking up for anyone that she couldnt say a word elizabeth made a rude face at her tucked her arm through joans and walked off with her joan turned to elizabeth what an awful story you told she said i didnt have any letters today and you know i didnt yes i know said elizabeth it was a storybut i really couldnt help it joan you looked like a timid mouse thats been clawed at by a cat and i felt like a dog that wanted to bark something horrid at the cat joan threw back her head and laughed you do say the funniest things elizabeth she said i never know what you will say or do next nobody ever did know what elizabeth would take into her head to do or say the days were slipping by now and another week had almost gone elizabeth enjoyed her work for she had a good brain and things came easily to her she enjoyed the riding lessons the gym the painting the walks the concerts and above all her music lessons she liked cricket and she was getting quite good at tennis she had to keep reminding herself that she mustnt enjoy these things she must really be naughty or she wouldnt be sent home in disgrace so every now and again she was very naughty indeed one morning she did every single thing wrong in her class she wrote badly and spelt every word wrong she got all her sums quite wrong she spilt ink over her neat geography map she whistled and hummed till she drove miss ranger quite mad miss ranger had been told to be patient with naughty elizabeth and she tried to be but even the children became angry with her although at first they giggled and laughed and thought she was funny i shall report you at the meeting tomorrow said a boy at last he was a monitor and had the right to report anyone im sick of you you disturb everyone and i shall report you too said nora that afternoon three times youve not gone to bed at the right time this week last night you even came up later than i did and look at thisyouve spilt ink over your blue bedside rug that will have to be cleaned welt im not going to clean it said elizabeth rudely ill make it a bit worse just for fun and the naughty little girl tipped up some more ink over another part of the rug nora stared at her in disgust youre too silly for words she said well youll be sorry at the meeting tomorrow pooh thats all you know said elizabeth chapter the meeting punishes elizabeth the meeting the next day was at the same time as before all the children went and once again the two judges rita and william sat at the big table and the twelve monitors the jury sat at the smaller table other teachers were there too this time besides miss belle and miss best they sometimes came to hear what was being done at the meeting although they never interfered rita hammered on the table for quiet elizabeth sat looking sulky she knew quite well that she would be scolded and punished and she kept telling herself that she didnt care but one week at whyteleafe school had made her see that it really was a splendid school and she couldnt help feeling rather ashamed of her behaviour well it cant be helped they wont send me home unless i behave badly she kept saying to herself has anyone any more money to put into the box asked william he looked at a sheet of paper jill kenton and harry wills have received money this week and have already put it in has anyone else any nobody had nora give out the two shillings to everyone please ordered william nora began to give out the money she even gave it to elizabeth who was most surprised she had quite thought that owing to her behaviour she would get no money at all she made up her mind to buy some peppermints and some toffee and share them with joan she whispered this to her friend who was sitting beside her thank you whispered back joan i shall want most of my money to buy stamps this week so i shall love to share your sweets does anyone want extra money asked william george got up and spoke we need a new cricket ball for a practice game he said we lost ours in the shrubbery you must look for it again before you get the money said william come to me tomorrow george sat down queenie got up could i have some money to buy a birthday present for somebody she asked its my old nurses birthday this week and id like to send her something half a crown will do nicely half a crown was given to queenie id like a new garden spade said john terry standing up im afraid it will cost rather a lot though mr warlow the games master got up and spoke for john i should just like to say that in my opinion john deserves a new spade he said he is the best gardener in the school and i believe the peas we had for dinner today were due to his hard work johns spade was passed at once give him the money said william how much is it john im afraid it is twelve shillings and sixpence said john ive asked at three shops and the price is the same in each twelve shillings and sixpence was handed out john sat down blushing with pleasure other things were asked for some were granted and some were refused then came the complaints and grumbles any reports or complaints asked rita knocking on the table for silence i want to report harry dunn for cheating said a monitor firmly there was a buzz at once everyone knew harry dunn a slyfaced boy in the class above elizabeths he sat on his form looking red cheating is awful said william shocked we havent had a proper case of that here for three terms dont give him any money to spend for the rest of the term called someone no thats a silly punishment for cheating said william at once it wouldnt stop him and would only make him angry there was a loud discussion about harry rita banged on the table with her hammer quiet she said i want to ask harry something harry what lesson do you cheat in arithmetic said harry sulkily why asked william well i missed five weeks last term and i got behind in my arithmetic said harry my father doesnt like me to be bad at arithmetic and i knew id be almost bottom if i didnt cheat so i thought id better cheat and copy humphreys sums thats all yeshe did miss five weeks last term said a monitor he had mumps i remember and his father does get wild if he isnt near the top in arithmetic said another monitor well it seems to me that wed better ask mr johns if hed be good enough to give harry extra help in arithmetic this term so that he can catch up what be missed said william then he wont need to cheat mr johns i can see you at the back this eveningdo you think it would help harry if you gave him extra time rather said mr johns ive already suggested it to harryand now that this has happened i think hell be glad of extra help in arithmetic wont you harry yes thank you sir said harry but william hadnt finished with harry we cant let you sit with the others in your class until we know you wont cheat again he said you had better put your desk apart from the others until you have caught up with the arithmetic youve missedand then you can go back if you will come and tell me that you wont cheat again all right william said harry he hated the idea of being set apart because he was a cheatand he made up his mind he would soon know as much as anyone elseand then hed beat them with his own brains and never cheat again cheating is only done by stupid or lazy people said william nowany more complaints then it was elizabeths turn to go red and look sulky up got nora at once i have a serious complaint to make she said it is about elizabeth allen again i am the monitor in her bedroom and i cant make her go to bed at the right time not only thatshe is awfully rude and horrid i dont think she cares how she behaves at all anything else asked rita staring in disgust at elizabeth yesshe has poured ink twice over her bedside rug and refuses to clean it said nora well we will send it to the cleaners and elizabeth can pay for it said rita it costs two shillings to get those rugs cleanedso i am afraid you will have to give up your two shillings elizabeth elizabeth really didnt like to be rude to rita so she meekly took out her two shillings and passed them back to nora who put them into the moneybox about the going late to bed said william thats easily dealt with in future elizabeths bedtime will be altered and she will go at halfpast seven instead of eight but i shall miss the concerts and the dancing said elizabeth in dismay thats your own fault said rita sternly if you are sensible we will alter your bedtime next week but only if you are sensible and now about the rudeness and horridness said william im not sure we can blame elizabeth for that you know weve usually found that rude children are caused by silly parents who spoil them and let them say and do what they like i should think elizabeths parents are to blame for her present rude behaviour they havent taught her good manners elizabeth leapt up at once her face full of anger mummy and daddy have taught me good manners she said theyve beautiful manners themselves and mummy is never rude to anyone well we shall only believe that when we see that you are following their example said william whenever you are rude this week we shall each say to ourselves poor elizabeth she cant help it she wasnt brought up properly ill show you ive got good manners shouted elizabeth ill just show you you horrid boy everyone began to laugh at the angry little girl william banged on the table with his hammer silence elizabeth wants to show us that she has good manners go on elizabeth shout a little more and call us names then we shall see exactly what your good manners are elizabeth sat down boiling so they thought her mother and father didnt know how to bring children up with good manners did they well nobody would be more polite than she would be next week they would have to say they were wrong kenneth the monitor in elizabeths class got up next please william and rita he said could you do something about elizabeths behaviour in class it is simply impossible she spoils all our lessons and we are getting very tired of it i guess miss ranger is too this is really dreadful said rita i had no idea elizabeth was so bad i am very disappointed has nobody a good word to say for her no one spoke no one said a word and then every one got a surprise for up got joan townsend the mouse she was blushing red for she hated to speak in public iii should like to speak for elizabeth she said she can be very kind she isnt really as horrid as she pretends to be joan sat down with a bump as red as fire elizabeth looked at her gratefully it was good to have a friend well its something to hear that said william but it isnt enough what are elizabeths favourite lessons music painting and riding shouted elizabeths class well elizabeth until you can behave in the lessons you dont seem to like you must miss those you do like said william after consulting with rita for a while you will miss riding music and painting this week and you will not go down to the village at all we hope there will be better reports next week so that we can give you back the things you love we simply cant let you spoil lessons for the rest of your class elizabeth could not stand the meeting for one moment more she stood up pushed a chair aside and rushed out let her go she heard rita say in a sorry sort of voice shes being awfully sillybut shes really not as bad as she makes out poor elizabeth no money to spendan early bed timeno concerts no dancing no riding painting or music the little girl sat on her bed and wept she knew it was all her own fault but it didnt make things any better oh when when would she be able to leave this horrid school chapter elizabeth has a bad time joan went to find elizabeth as soon as the meeting was over she guessed she would be in their bedroom elizabeth dried her eyes as soon as she heard joan coming she wasnt going to let anyone see her crying hallo said joan come down to the playroom its raining or we could go and have a game of tennis joan it was decent of you to speak up for me said elizabeth thanks awfully but dont do it again because you see i want everyone to think im too bad for this school so that ill be sent home oh elizabeth do get that silly idea out of your head said joan im quite sure that the school wont send you home and youll only go on getting yourself into more and more trouble do be sensible do you really think they wont send me home however badly i behave said elizabeth in dismay but surely no school would want to keep a really bad child whyteleafe school has never expelled anyone yet said joan so i dont expect theyll start on you youll just have a perfectly horrid time instead of haying a lovely one youd have much more chance of going home if you went to rita and said youd be good if only she would do her best to get you home because you were so unhappy here really said elizabeth astonished well i didnt think of that perhaps ill go to rita ill see i am really getting a bit tired of remembering to be bad there are so many nice things to do here that cant help enjoying myself sometimes i think youre a silly goose said joan come on down it will soon be seven oclock and you know youve got to go to bed directly after supper for a whole week instead of at eight oclock elizabeth frowned ive a good mind to go at eight oclock just to spite them she said oh dont be foolish said joan do you suppose the meeting cares if you go to bed at seven or eight youll only be hurting yourself not anyone else if youre silly oh said elizabeth seeing for the first time that she was spoiling things for herself far more than she was spoiling them for other people she sat and thought for a minute listen joan she said ill do as im told this week see ill obey the orders of the meeting and go to bed early and miss all the things i loveand at the end ill go to rita and tell her im so unhappy that i simply must go home and ill see what she says im sure she could tell miss belle and miss best and they could write to mummy for me well you do that said joan getting a bit tired of elizabeths curious ideas now do come onbother theres the supperbell and weve wasted all this time they had supperand then poor elizabeth had to go straight upstairs to bed nora popped in to see that she had obeyed the orders of the meeting and felt quite surprised to see elizabeth under the sheets good gracious she said you are learning to be sensible at last now just you listen to me elizabeth the meeting hates punishing anyone as much as they have punished you this weekso be good and sensible and obedient and youll find that everything will be all right at the next meeting by the way ill take up your bedside rugthe cleaner comes tomorrow and ill see that its put ready for him to take thank you nora said elizabeth in a very good voice the week that followed was not a pleasant one for elizabeth she had to see the others go out riding without her she had to sit indoors and copy out sums instead of going out sketching with the painting class worst of all she had to tell mr lewis that she couldnt have her music lessons that week mr lewis was disappointed well arent you a little silly he said patting her on the shoulder what a pity and we were going to do something rather exciting this week tooive got richard watson to learn a duet and i thought you and he could play it together duets are fun oh dear said elizabeth in dismay ive never played a duet and ive always thought it would be fun could you wait till next week do you think mr lewis i might get all my punishments taken off by that time i should hope you would said the musicmaster now elizabeth although you are going to miss your lessons with me this week there is no need for you to miss your practice take this duet and try to learn your part by yourselfand next week ill have richard alone too and well all have a go at it practice your other pieces too and dont forget your scales i wont forget promised elizabeth and she ran off richard watson was a big boy and elizabeth couldnt help feeling rather proud to think that mr lewis had chosen her to play a duet with him she knew that richard watson played the piano and the violin beautifully elizabeth turned over a new leaf that week nobody could have worked harder in class than she did she only got one sum wrong the whole of the week she didnt get a single mistake in dictation even the french mistress mademoiselle was pleased with her because she learned a french song so quickly ah but you are a clever little girl she said to elizabeth will you not help this poor little joan to learn her piece always she makes mistakes and is at the bottom of my class yes ill help joan said elizabeth eagerly i can easily teach her the song you have a good heart said mademoiselle elizabeth went red with pleasure the other children stared at her they couldnt understand this strange girl who was so bad and horrid one week and so good and helpful the next elizabeth helped joan to learn the song she and joan went off to a corner of the garden and elizabeth sang each line of the song in her clear voice and made joan sing it after her it wasnt long before joan knew it perfectly you are very decent to me elizabeth said joan gratefully i wish i was going to have a birthday cake on my birthdayid give you the biggest piece of all when is your birthday asked elizabeth its in two weeks time said joan and i do hate it so because i know i shant get a single card and my parents are certain not to remember it everyone else seems to have a big cake and presents and cards i think its a shame said elizabeth warmly i shall give you a present anyhowthat is if only the meeting will give me my two shillings i shant pour ink on my rug again anywaythat was an awful waste of two shillings i could have bought toffees with that i havent had a sweet for ages ill buy some this afternoon and share them with you said joan i want most of my money for stamps but i shall have a few pence over for sweets its a pity you cant go down to the village with me and choose the sweets it would be fun to go together it would agreed elizabeth but im not going down till im allowed to for one thing i promised rita i wouldnt go aloneand for another thing im jolly well not going to have the meeting taking away my good times any more they went indoors on the way they met three of the boys going out to practise bowling hallo bold bad girl said one of them elizabeth went red and tried to rush at them but joan held her arm firmly dont take any notice she said they only want to see you get angryand after all you do deserve the name you know the boys went off to the cricket field grinning elizabeth felt very angry she still had not got used to the goodnatured teasing that went on all around her she wished she could tease back or laugh as the other children did miss ranger was delighted with elizabeth that week the little girl really had a fine brain and was fond of a joke she could say clever things that made miss ranger and the class laugh heartily she had only to look at a page once or twice and she knew it by heart she liked her work and did everything well elizabeth you are a lucky little girl said miss ranger lessons come easily to you and you should be able to do something fine in the world when you grow up whyteleafe school and your parents will be proud of you one day whyteleafe school wont said elizabeth firmly i shant be here long enough half a term is as long as i shall stay and i may go home before that well well see said miss ranger anyway it is a pleasant change to see the other side of you this week and not the unpleasant rudeness of last week elizabeth practised hard at the piano all the week she wanted to show mr lewis that she could play that duet with richard over and over she played the pages of the music trying to get the right time and lo play softly and loudly at the proper moments one morning she got a letter from her mother enclosing some stamps now that you have to buy your own stamps i thought perhaps it would help you if i sent you some wrote her mother then you can spend all your money on the things you like elizabeth counted the stamps there were twelve penny ones and twelve hapenny ones she divided them in half and went to find joan joan here are some stamps for you now you neednt spend all your money on them said elizabeth oh thanks said joan delighted what a bit of luck your mother must be a darling to think of things like that ill go straight down and buy some toffee she didand the two girls sucked it happily after tea that day as they wandered round the school garden they came across john terry busy gardening with his new spade he showed it to the girls and they admired it elizabeth told john about the garden she had at home you sound as if you knew a lot about gardening said john not many girls do i suppose you wouldnt like to come and help me sometime would you elizabeth theres a lot to do and in the summertime not many people come and help id love to said elizabeth proudly fancy clever john terry asking her to help him ill come whenever i can you do look happy elizabeth said joan staring at her friends bright eyes i dont believe you want to leave whyteleafe at all well i do then said elizabeth quite fiercely i dont change my mind as quickly as all that youll soon see ill ask rita to get me sent back home before halfterm chapter the third meeting tim third meeting came everyone went to the gym as before and took their places some of the teachers sat at the back as usual rita and william came in last of all and the children rose and stood until their two judges sat down joan was sitting next to elizabeth she was hoping very much that elizabeth would not say anything silly and so spoil her weeks good work and behaviour elizabeth wished the meeting was over she was not used to having her behaviour discussed and dealt with and she didnt like it at all but she knew that everyone was treated the same and she saw that it was quite fair money was put into the box one girl eileen had had a whole pound sent to her by her grandmother and she put it into the box very proudly she was glad to feel that she could add so much to the spending money of the school the two shillings were given out to everyone elizabeth took hers gladlynow she would be able to buy some sweets for joan does anyone want anything extra this week asked william rattling the moneybox eileen wanted a shilling to get her watch mended and it was granted at once nobody else said anything nothing else asked rita looking round elizabeth suddenly found herself standing up i dont expect you will let me have it she said but i would very much like somethingit isnt only for myself but it would be nice for everyone else too what is it you want asked rita well theres a lovely seapiece that mr lewis plays said elizabeth eagerly he says there is a beautiful gramophone record of it and i would so much like it im sure everybody would love it too i know i could buy it with my two shillings but i owe joan townsend a lot of sweets and id like to buy her some this week william and rita looked at the twelve monitors below them at the small table what do you think about it rita asked them you might discuss it for a moment the jury discussed it for a few minutes then nora stood up we think the money might be granted to elizabeth said nora we have heard her practising like anything every morning this week before breakfast and we think she deserves a reward an extra two shillings is granted then said william give the money to elizabeth nora elizabeth was given another two shillings she was really delighted she thought the monitors were very decent to have granted her wish she forgot that she had hated them all last week the meeting passed on to complaints and reports one boy peter was reported for scribbling over one of the cloakroom walls a disgusting habit said william severely you will spend your next two playtimes cleaning off the scribble with soap and hot water and then you will buy some yellow distemper from the school stores out of your two shillings and repaint that bit of wall yourself i shall come to see it at the end of the week peter sat down very red never again in his life would he scribble on walls he was not angry at his punishment for he knew that it was justhe must remove the mess he had made and make the wall good we all see the walls said william and we certainly dont want to see your silly scribbles on them then there was a report on harry who had cheated the week before mr johns had sent in a written note to william about him william read it to the meeting i have to report that harry is rapidly catching up with the rest of his class in arithmetic wrote mr johns after another week he will be as good as the rest as he will then have no reason to cheat i propose that at the next meeting harry is told he may sit with the others again and not apart what about letting harry sit with the rest of his class this week asked one of the monitors hes had a week of sitting apart and its not very nice no said william firmly he cheated before because he didnt know as much as the othersand if we let him go back too soon hell be tempted to cheat again we dont want it to become a habit harry next week we hope to put you back in your old seat with the others yes william said harry he made up his mind to work so hard at his arithmetic that he would be top of the class before the end of the termthen the meeting and mr johns would know he had no reason to cheat at all and now for the bold bad girl elizabeth allen said william everyone laughed elizabeth laughed too it sounded funny not horrid when william called her by those names nora what report have you to give nora stood up an excellent report she said elizabeth has obeyed all the orders of last weeks meeting and as far as i know has obeyed them cheerfully and well thank you said rita nora sat down rita opened a note it was written by miss ranger here is a report to me from miss ranger said rita this is what she says it has been a pleasure to have a girl like elizabeth in my class this week she has worked well could easily be top of her class and has been very helpful to others who cannot work as quickly as she can she has been as good this week as she was bad last week rita looked up she smiled her lovely smile at elizabeth and william smiled too this is very good elizabeth said rita i too have noticed a great difference in you this week have you asked elizabeth pleased to think that rita had taken any notice of her rita did you notice that my manners were better because id like you to think that my mother and father have taught me good manners and brought me up properly i dont like people to think they havent well we take back what we said about your parents being at fault said rita but you really must see elizabeth that if a boy or girl is rude or horrid it often means that their parents are to blame for not having taught them any better i do see that said elizabeth well youll see my father and mother at halfterm and then youll know that they couldnt possibly be nicer ohso you have made up your mind to stay with us then asked rita with a sudden smile of amusement she couldnt help liking elizabeth for the little girl said such funny things and was so serious about everything oh no i havent said elizabeth at once but i see now that you wouldnt let me go home if i behave too badlyyoull only be angry with me and make me stay just to show me i cant get my own way but rita if i do try hard to be good and do everything i ought to will you please ask miss belle and miss best to let me go home they can ask my parents at halfterm to take me away my mother wouldnt want me to stay anywhere where i was unhappy william and rita looked at elizabeth in surprise very puzzled to know what to do with such a strange little girl rita spoke to william and the jury discussed things together too but nobody could decide anything at all rita hammered on to the table and everyone was quiet well elizabeth said rita we simply dont know what to say to you weve never been asked such a thing before we think wed better ask miss belle and miss best to help us please miss belle and miss best could you advise us what to do best for elizabeth the two headmistresses came up to the platform and rita got them chairs mr johns came too and sat with them it was not often that the masters and mistresses came on to the platform at the weekly meetings and it seemed to make things much more important and serious well first said miss belle i think we should all discuss this thing togetherand as it is not very pleasant to discuss a person when she is present and elizabeth may find it a little awkward to hear us i suggest that she shall be given the chance to leave the room until we have finished what do you think about it elizabeth id rather go out of the gym and wait till you say whats decided said elizabeth but please miss belle i shall be awfully naughty again if dont say anything more elizabeth my dear said miss best hurriedly she didnt want the children to feel annoyed with elizabeth she knew it was very difficult to be fair if people were feeling angry elizabeth went out of the gym she went to a musicroom nearby and began to practise her part of the duet she hoped that she would be able to have her music lessons the next week then she could play the piano with richard the meeting began to discuss elizabeth and what to do with her everyone had a say and everyone was listened to we dont want her shes a nuisance said one girl why not let her go we do want her said miss belle i think we can help her a great deal shes been spoilt said william its always difficult for spoil children to fit in anywhere they think the worlds made for them and them alone but you cant think how kind elizabeth is really said joan eagerly im her only friend and i know more about her than anyone she really has a good heart mademoiselle said she had too that is quite true came mademoiselles voice from the back of the gym this little elizabeth is a good child at heart and a clever one but she is soooo obstinate everyone laughed at mademoiselles long sooooo its so silly to think that elizabeth can be simply splendid but means to be awful if we dont give her what she wants said william fancy wanting to leave whyteleafe school ive never never known anyone want to do that before the discussion went on nobody could imagine how elizabeth could want to leave such a fine school as whyteleafe where the children were so happy and where they ruled themselves miss belle miss best and mr johns smiled at one another when they heard the excited children blaming elizabeth for wanting to leave whyteleafe i think i can see the answer to your problem said miss belle at last shall we say this to elizabeththat she may certainly leave us after the halfterm if she is really unhappy and can say so honestly to the meeting she does not need to be rude or naughty or disobedient any more but may be good hardworking and enjoy herself all she likesbecause we are quite willing to let her go if she really wants to in a few weeks time ohi see said rita her eyes shining you mean that elizabeth cant possibly come and say she is unhappy after enjoying herself at whyteleafe till halfterm so she wont want to go after allbut were offering her what she wants so she neednt be bad any more thats right said miss belle if whyteleafe school is all you say it is and am very proud to hear itthen i think we can safely say that you children and the school will be able to keep elizabeth here of her own free will we shall see elizabeth at her bestand we can all help her to be good and happy everyone stamped their feet and agreed it seemed comical to themthey were going to tell elizabeth she could leave when she wanted tobut when the time came they were sure she wouldnt want to what a good idea they all made up their minds to be as nice as possible to elizabeth so that she simply couldnt say she was unhappy when halfterm came call elizabeth in said miss best well tell her chapter a lovely week elizabeth was called back to the gym by nora she stopped playing the piano and went back to her place in the gym she wondered what the judges were going to say they looked serious but not angry rita knocked on the table quiet she ordered elizabeth we have all discussed what you want us to do and we have decided that if you come to us at the meeting after halfterm and tell us honestly that you are unhappy here and want to go home miss belle and miss best will advise your parents to take you away really said elizabeth in delight oh thank you rita i am pleased now i dont need to be horrid and rude any more i can wait till halfterm but i warn you that at the very first meeting after that i shall ask to go home i hate being at school elizabeth wondered why everyone roared with laughter when she said that she looked round in surprise even joan was laughing well elizabeth thats settled then said rita please be as nice as you know very well bow to be until halftermand then if you wish you can certainly go home if your parents will take you away i know they will if im unhappy said elizabeth thank you rita i promise to be really good now very well said william all your punishments are lifted from now on your bedtime will be as before at eight oclock you can take riding and painting and all your favourite lessons good said elizabeth beaming she felt very pleased with herself she had got what she wanted she could go home at halfterm im glad its not before then thought the little girl i do want to learn that duet with richard and i want to give joan a present for her birthday and i want to do some more ridingoh yes and buy that record too how everyone will love to hear it when i first put it on elizabeth was very happy she beamed round at everyone not listening to anything else that was said at the meeting there was very little else to discuss anyway and very soon the gym was empty and the children ran off to their various tasks or hobbies well elizabeth ive got you till halfterm anyway said joan tucking her arm into elizabeths thats something well make the most of me said elizabeth with a laugh for you wont have me afterwards i jolly well mean to go back home to my pony and my dog i mean to show my parents that i just wont be sent away to school a lovely week began for elizabeth then after supper that night there was a little dance and the boys and girls had great fun when eight oclock struck elizabeth and the others of her age went upstairs to bed leaving the older ones to go on dancing the next day she and joan went down to the village to buy sweets and the gramophone record that elizabeth wanted the musicshop didnt have it but they said they would send for it to the town over the hill and get it for elizabeth they would send it up to the school for her joan bought some chocolate and a book elizabeth bought some toffee and two packets of lettuce seeds she hadnt forgotten that she was going to help john terry with his gardening dear me what a lot of things there were to do you can have the first lettuce that grows from these seeds she promised joan well youll have to stay till the end of the term then laughed joan lettuces dont grow quite so quickly as you think elizabeth oh said elizabeth disappointed wellyoull have to cut the first lettuce then after im gone have a toffee it was fun to eat toffees and talk to a friend it was fun to feel the lettuce seeds rattling in their packets it was lovely to think of going riding that afternoon and having a music lesson after tea perhaps richard would he there and they would play their duet the riding lesson was glorious twelve boys and girls were taken out on the hills by the riding master elizabeth had been used to her pony and she rode well enjoying the jogjogjog and sniffing the fresh early summer breezes this was much better fun than cantur ing along on her old pony at home that afternoon the postman brought a parcel for elizabeth she undid itand inside she found a large chocolate cake sent to her by her granny oh i say look at this cried elizabeth we can all share it at teatime my word elizabeth youre rather different from when you first came said nora stating at the excited girl as she put her cake into her tin in the playroom you wouldnt share a thing then elizabeth blushed dont remind me of that nora she begged im ashamed of it now all i hope is that you wont all say no when i offer you some of this cake well nobody did say no elizabeth counted the number of people at her tableeleven she cut the cake into twelve pieces they were very large elizabeth offered the plate round and soon there were only two pieces left thanks elizabeth thanks elizabeth said everyone taking a piece they were delighted to have it because by now everyones tuckbox was empty and no more goodies had come yet from their homes for no one had had a birthday your granny must be jolly generous said nora this is the finest cake ive ever tasted elizabeth was proud and pleased she took the plate to miss ranger and offered her one of the two pieces that remained on it miss ranger took it and nodded thank you elizabeth she said then elizabeth helped herself to the last piece and settled down happily to eat it this was better than keeping everything to herself it was lovely to share she looked round at all the contented faces and liked to see the girls and boys eating her cake miss scott would be surprised at me thought elizabeth suddenly she wouldnt know me what a horrid girl i must have seemed to her after tea elizabeth got her music and raced off to mr lewis richard was there too a big serious boy with long clever fingers he meant to be a musician when he grew up he looked at elizabeth and didnt smile i suppose he doesnt think girls can play at all thought elizabeth she was right richard was dis gusted to find that he was expected to play a duet with a girland elizabeth too that bold bad one what would she know of music they began elizabeth had practised so hard that she knew her part wonderfully well she took the lower part the bass and richard had the more difficult part the treble where the higher notes were i shall count the first few bars said mr lewis nowone two three four one two three four one two three four he soon stopped for the two children found their own time and the duet went with a swing mr lewis let them play it all the way through and then he smiled very good he said you have a feeling for each others playing now richard wasnt i right when i said i had found someone you need not be afraid of playing with but richard was as obstinate in his way as elizabeth was in hers he looked at the little girls flushed face and did not answer elizabeth was disappointed mr lewis laughed thank you richard he said you may gobut come back in half an hours time and i will give you your lesson then i am going to give elizabeth hers now can you two manage to practise together sometimes suppose so said richard ungraciously well dont if you dont want to said elizabeth flaring up i play my part just as well as you play yours you made two mistakes and you made three said richard now this wont do said mr lewis patting richard on the back you can choose which you would rather do richardplay the duet with harry or with elizabeth i can find someone else for her you knowbut shes the best after you wellill have elizabeth said richard harry plays the piano as if his fingers were a bunch of bananas elizabeth went off into a peal of laughter it tickled her to think of a bunch of bananas playing the piano richard laughed too ill practise with elizabeth sir he said to mr lewis shes really jolly good elizabeth glowed with pride because richard was one of the bigger boys she settled down to her music lesson happily mr lewis made her play over the duet with him and pointed out places where she went wrong elizabeth used to get cross when miss scott pointed out her mistakes but with mr lewis it was different she thought he was very clever indeed and she could listen all day long to his playing ive ordered that gramophone record mr lewis she said the shop is getting it for me ill come and hear it when it arrives promised mr lewis now lets get on with tackling the seapiece on our piano elizabeth you want to learn it dont you but it wont be easy perhaps you could play it for me at the school concert at the end of the term if youre good enough oh id love to said elizabeth pleased and then she stopped and looked disappointed oh but i cant i forgot i shall be going home at halfterm really said mr lewis who knew all about it still being the bold bad girl dear dear what a pity isnt there a concert at halfterm asked elizabeth her voice trembling afraid not said mr lewis come alongget on with your scales now dont worry about not being able to play that seapiece i can easily get someone else to learn it for me let me learn it anyhow said elizabeth even if i cant play it for you at a concert i can still learn it for myself because i love it good said mr lewis all right ill play it for you now and you must listen hard so elizabeth listened and was happy she was happy all the day and she couldnt help being surprised at herself it is a nuisance thought funny elizabeth i really cant go about being happy like thiswhatever shall i say to the meeting at halfterm chapter two tricksand a quarrel the week slipped by quickly elizabeth practised her pieces and loved her musiclessons she and richard practised their duet together and had such fun that they asked mr lewis for an even harder piece im glad you chose me to play with you instead of harry said elizabeth to richard i do love the way you play richard you are as good as mr lewis no im not said richard but some day i shall be far far better elizabeth some day you will come to london to hear me play at a great big concert and some day you will hear the music i make up played all over the world it didnt seem like boasting when richard spoke like this elizabeth didnt mock at him or laugh at him she believed him and although he was sometimes very moody and badtempered she grew to like him very much i always hated boys before thought elizabeth surprised at herself i do seem to be changing id better be careful or i will be different when i leave here just as miss scott said so to show that she really did still hate boys she played a trick on harry she knew that he would have to go to the musicroom to fetch some music he had left behind elizabeth took a sponge filled it so full of water that it dripped and then climbing on a chair she balanced the wet sponge on the top of the door she arranged the sponge so that anyone who opened the door would move the sponge which would at once drop down on to the surprised persons head then elizabeth hid in a cupboard in the passage outside and waited for harry he soon came along rushing to fetch his forgotten music before the bell rang he pushed open the doorand down fell the sponge on top of his head squelch squash oooh said harry in the greatest astonishment whatever is it he soon found out he took the sponge off his neck and threw it down on the floor in a rage now ive got to go and change my coat he said who did that nobody answered of course but as harry knew quite well that people who set traps for others usually like to hide somewhere near to see what happens he guessed that the joker was in the passage cupboard he stole up to the cupboard and flung the door open inside was elizabeth trying her best not to laugh loudly her handkerchief was stuffed into her mouth and tears of laughter were trickling down her cheeks oh its you is it said harry hauling her out its the bold bad girl well ill just stuff this wet sponge down your neck see but he didnt have time to because the bell rang and he had to run ill pay you out for that he yelled but elizabeth only laughed mockingly i hate boys she shouted theyre silly ha ha i tricked you properly harry but harry soon paid elizabeth back for her trick he waited until the painting class and then when elizabeth was quite lost in her work bending over her painting he stole up behind her in his hand was a large sheet of paper he neatly pinned it to elizabeths back the little girl felt something and shook herselfbut the paper was safely on and she didnt know it she went on with her painting harry went back to his place giggling the class was nearly over and if miss chester the art mistress did not notice what he had done there was a good chance of elizabeth going about with the paper on her back everyone saw the paper and giggled on it was print ed in big letters im the bold bad girl beware i bark i bite i hate everybody joan was not in that painting class or she would have told elizabeth what harry had done all the others thought it was very funny especially as elizabeth was known as the bold bad girl the bell rang everyone cleared up their things miss chester began to prepare for the next class and did not notice elizabeths paper the children went out of the artroom and went to their own classrooms once in her classroom all the others there saw the paper they nudged one another and giggled joan was holding the door for miss ranger to come in and did not see what everyone was laughing at soon elizabeth noticed that the class was giggling at her and she grew red what are you all laughing at she demanded angrily is my hair untidy have i a smudge on my nose no elizabeth answered everyone in a chorus then miss ranger came in and the class settled down to work they worked hard until break when the school had fifteen minutes play outofdoors and could have biscuits and milk if they wished harry looked to see if the paper was still on elizabeths back it was he ran round to all his friends pointing it out all the boys kept behind elizabeth reading the paper and giggling shes the bold bad girl they whispered look at the notice every time that poor elizabeth turned round she found somebody behind her giggling she grew so furious that she called out she would slap anyone who giggled behind her again joan came out at that moment and elizabeth called to her joan whats the matter with everyone today they keep going behind my back and giggling i hate it joan knew more of the ways of children than elizabeth did she guessed at once that someone had pinned a notice to elizabeths back turn round she said elizabeth turned round and joan saw the notice im the bold bad girl beware i bark i bite i hate everybody joan couldnt help giggling herself oh elizabeth she said do look what youve been going round with all morning its too funny no wonder everyone laughed she unpinned the paper and showed it to elizabeth the little girl who was not used to being teased went red with rage she tore the paper into half and faced the laughing children who pinned that on me she asked didnt bold bad girl shouted someone everybody laughed elizabeth stamped her foot look out cried john she barks she bites shell show her teeth next i suppose the person who pinned that on me doesnt dare to own up shouted elizabeth oh yes i dare grinned harry nearby i pinned it on you my dear girlin return for the wet sponge dont call me your dear girl cried elizabeth in a rage youre a hateful boy and a cheat cheat cheat how dare you pin a notice on me like that take that the furious little girl slapped harry hard in the face the boy stepped back in surprise stop that commanded nora coming up at that minute elizabeth that sort of behaviour wont do apologise to harry hes too much of a gentleman to slap you back as you deserve i wont apologise cried elizabeth nora i want you to report harry at the next meetingand if you dont i shall come with me said nora to elizabeth she saw that elizabeth was really upset and needed to be quietened you can tell me about it in the playroom theres nobody there holding the torn bits of paper in her hand elizabeth followed nora trembling with anger nora made her sit down and tell her what had happened elizabeth pieced the bits of paper together and nora read what harry had written she stopped herself smiling but she really thought it was very funny and why did harry play this trick on you asked nora just because i played a trick on him said elizabeth i put a wet sponge on the musicroom door and it fell down on his head and why shouldnt harry play a trick on you then if you play tricks on him asked nora you know you wet his coat and he was late for his class because he had to change it if you werent quite so silly elizabeth you would see that the joke he played on you was quite as funny as the one you played on him after all you know that we call you the bold bad girl youre not to said elizabeth well we certainly shall if you go on behaving so fiercely said nora will you report harry at the meeting said elizabeth certainly not said nora we dont report jokes then i shall report him said elizabeth elizabeth that would be telling tales not reporting said nora firmly you mustnt do that dont spoil this good week of yours by being silly and you know i really should report you why asked elizabeth defiantly because i heard you call harry a cheat and you slapped him hard said nora it is very mean to call him a cheat when you know he isnt now we try to help one another at whyteleafe and it was hateful of you to remind harry and everyone else of something hes ashamed of elizabeth went red yes she said that was hateful of me i wish i hadnt and i wish i hadnt slapped harry now i knew he wouldnt slap me back oh norai really have tried to behave decently and now ive spoilt it all no you havent said nora getting up pleased that elizabeths temper had gone little things like this can always be put right harry is a goodtempered boy go and say youre sorry and he wont think any more about it i dont like saying im sorry said elizabeth nobody does said nora but its a little thing that makes a big difference go and try it and see if im not right chapter an apologyand another meeting eltzabeth went to find harry she noticed that everyone turned away as she came and she was sad they were all so friendly to me she thought and now ive been silly again and they dont like me any more i do wish i didnt lost my temper she didnt want to say she was sorry she felt sure harry would say something horrid or would laugh at her all the same elizabeth was truly sorry that she had called harry a cheat it was most unfair when the boy was doing his best to make up for his cheating and elizabeth was just a little girl although she did such funny things when she was in a rage hary was playing with about eight other boys and girls in a corner of the garden elizabeth stopped and looked at them they turned their backs on her it was horrid harry she called i dont want to speak to you said harry but harry i want to say something to you in private said elizabeth almost in tears say it in public then in front of everyone said harry it cant be anything important all right then said elizabeth going up to the group of children ive come to say im sorry for calling you a cheat when i know youre not nowand and im sorry for slapping you harry nora has explained things to me and i feel different now the children stared at her they all knew how hard it was to apologise especially in front of others and they admired the little girl harry went up to her thats decent of you he said warmly youve got an awful temper elizabeth but youre a good sort all the same everybody smiled everybody was friendly again what a difference a little apology made elizabeth could hardly believe it she suddenly felt that everything was perfectly all right and she wanted to skip for joy come and see my rabbits said harry slipping his arm through elizabeths ive got two called bubble and squeak and theyve got three babies would you like one elizabeth had always longed for a rabbit she stared at harry in delight oh yes she said let me buy one from you no ill give you one said harry who was a very generous boy and was eager to make elizabeth forget all about the quarrel ive got a little old hutch you can have for it it will be ready to leave its mother about halfterm oh said elizabeth disappointed i shant be here after that i shall be going home you know i cant have the rabbit the bell rang for school again so she couldnt see the baby rabbit she didnt want to now either because she wouldnt be able to have it what a pity she couldnt have it now and give it back to harry at halfterm she asked harry and richard to come and listen to the new gramophone record that evening it had come and was as mr lewis said very lovely the three children sat and listened to it they played it five times they were all fond of music and harry played quite well although his fingers were as richard had said rather like a bunch of bananas but he couldnt help that you know elizabeth we have a marvellous concert at the end of the term said harry putting the record on for the sixth time and letting the seapiece flood the room again its a pity you wont be here for it you could have played at it and your parents would have been jolly proud of you elizabeth had a quick picture in her mind of herself playing the lovely grand piano at the concert and her mother and father sitting proudly to listen to her for the first time she really wished she was staying on at whyteleafe school but its no good she said to herself quickly ive made up my mind and thats that i shant stay a minute longer than halfterm after supper that night mr lewis gave one of his little concerts about nine children were in the musicroom listening all musiclovers mr lewis had asked elizabeth to bring her new record for them all to hear and the little girl proudly put it on mr lewiss fine gramophone it was such fun to sit around listening when two of the children thanked elizabeth for getting two shillings to buy such a fine record elizabeth nearly burst with pride and pleasure it really is fun to share things she thought i simply loved all the others listening to my record how could i ever have thought it was horrid to share things i didnt know much joan was not such a musiclover as elizabeth was but she came to the concerts to be with elizabeth joan was much happier now that she had a friendthough as she said it was rather like being friends with a thunderstorm you never quite knew what elizabeth was going to do next elizabeth looked forward to the next school meeting she knew now that it was the most important thing of the whole school week she was beginning to see that each child was one of a big gathering and that because its behaviour brought good or ill to the school as a whole each child must learn to do its best so that the whole school might run smoothly and happily this was a difficult thing for a spoilt only child to learnbut elizabeth was not stupid and she soon saw what a fine thing it was for the children to rule themselves and help each other but she also saw that they would not be able to do this as well as they did if they had not had excellent teachers able to teach and guide the classes in the best way i see why everyone is so proud of whyteleafe school now said elizabeth to herself im beginning to feel proud of it myself elizabeth enjoyed the next meeting very much nora had said that she had nothing bad to report of her and so elizabeth had nothing to fear she sat listening to the reports complaints and grumbles and beamed with delight when she heard that harry had been second in his class in arithmetic and was now to be allowed to sit with the others again thank you said harry to william i shall never in my life cheat again william good said william everyone knew that harry meant what he said and they were as pleased about it as harry himself the boy was different to look at now toohis sly face had gone and his eyes looked straight at everyone he and everyone else had seen and known his fault and he and the whole school had conquered itthere was nothing to be ashamed of now there was a report that peter had carefully cleaned and newly distempered the wall which he had spoilt by scribbling see that you dont have to waste your two shillings on buying distemper again said william to peter i certainly wont said peter heartily fie had had to go without his weekly visit to the cinema and had missed all his sweets for a week he wasnt going to let that happen again there was a complaint about a small girl called doris the monitor who complained of her was very angry she stood up and made her report doris has two guineapigs she said and on two days last week she forgot to feed them i think they ought to be taken away from her oh no please dont begged doris almost crying i do love them really i do i cant think how i came to forget rita ive never forgotten before has she ever forgotten before asked william i dont think so answered the monitor who had reported doris then it was probably quite a mistake which will never happen again said william doris pets trust us completely for their food and water and it is a terrible thing to forget about them you must write out a card and pin it over your chestofdrawers to remind you print on it feed my guineapigs take it down after three weeks and see that you remember without being reminded if you forget again your guineapigs will be taken away and given to someone who will remember them ill never forget again said small doris who was very much ashamed that everyone should know she had forgotten her beloved guineapigs nora reported that elizabeth was behaving well and said no more another monitor complained that somebody had been picking and eating the peas out of the school garden but john terry immediately got up and said that the boy who had taken the peas had gone to him and had apologised and paid him a shilling for the peas he had eaten then well say no more about that said william when the meeting was over elizabeth went out to the garden to see harrys rabbits harry was not there and the little girl looked at the furry babies running round the big hutch as she was standing there looking she suddenly remembered something she had meant to ask for extra money at the meetingand she had forgotten and what was the extra money for it was to buy joan a nice birthday present now elizabeth would have to save her two shillings and buy it with that she was cross with herself for she had meant to ask for half a crown to buy joan a little red handbag she had seen in the drapers shop joan had said nothing to anyone but elizabeth about her coming birthday she hoped no one would notice it because she knew she would have no cake to share with her friends and no presents or cards to show she became a timid mouse once more as her birthday came near ashamed because nobody ever remembered her but a surprise was coming to joan and of course it was that bold bad girl elizabeth who planned it i chapter elizabeth has a secret during the next week a registered letter came for elizabeth from her uncle rupert she opened itand stared in delight there was a poundnote inside twenty shillings said elizabeth in surprise two hundred and forty pence ooooh how kind of uncle rupert she read her uncles letter he said that he had just heard that she had gone to school and had sent her some money to buy some nice things to eat a whole pound said elizabeth hardly believing her eyes i can buy heaps of things with that i can buy joan a lovely present she went off to her bedroom to put the money into her purse plans began to form in her mindwonderful plans oh said elizabeth sitting on her bed as she thought of the plans what fun i shall go down to the villageand order a fine birthday cake for joan she will think it comes from her mother and she will be so pleased elizabeth went on thinking and i shall order the new book that joan wants and send that through the post tooand ill put a card in with love from mother then joan wont be unhappy any more the little girl thought these were marvellous plans she didnt stop to think that joan would find out sooner or later that the cake and the book were not from her mother she just longed to give her friend a fine surprise she couldnt ask joan to come down to the village with her in case joan found out what she was doing so she asked belinda all right said belinda i want to buy some stamps so ill go after tea with you dont spend your two shillings all at once elizabeth all that day elizabeth thought about the cake and the presents for joan she thought about them so much in the french class that mademoiselle got cross with her elizabeth three times i have asked you a question and you sit there and smile and say nothing cried the french mistress who was very shorttempered elizabeth jumped she hadnt heard the questions at all what was it you asked me mamzelle she asked this girl she thinks she will make me repeat myself a hundred times cried mademoiselle wagging her hands about in the funny way she had you will listen to me properly for the rest of the lesson elizabeth or else you will come to me for an extra halfhour after tea gracious thought elizabeth remembering that she wanted to go shopping after tea id better stop dreaming and think of the french lesson so for the rest of the lesson she did her best and mademoiselle smiled graciously at her she liked elizabeth and found her very amusing though she sometimes wanted to shake her when she said well you see mamzelle you neednt bother about whether i shall be top or bottom in exams because im not staying after halfterm you are the most obstinate child i have ever seen mademoiselle would say and rap loudly on her desk half angry and half smiling after tea elizabeth went to get her money and to find belinda helen said she would come too so the three of them set off what are you going to buy elizabeth asked helen curiously its a secret said elizabeth at once i dont want you to come into the shops with me if you dont mind because i really have got some secrets today its to do with somebody else thats why i cant tell you all right said helen well we are going to have strawberry icecreams in the sweetshop you can join us there when you have finished your shopping dont be too long helen and belinda went off to the sweetshop and sat down at a little marbletopped table there to enjoy their icecreams elizabeth disappeared into the bakers shop the bakers wife came to see what she wanted please do you make birthday cakes asked elizabeth yes miss said the woman they are two shillings and sixpence five shillings or for a very big one with candles on and the name ten shillings would the tenshilling one be big enough for heaps of children asked elizabeth feeling certain that joan would like to share the cake with everyone it would be big enough for the whole school answered the woman smiling its the size people often order for whyteleafe school oh good said elizabeth well will you make a cake like that for friday put eleven candles on it all different coloursand put a happy birthday for my darling joan on it will there be enough room for all that do you think oh yes said the woman ill decorate it with sugar flowers and make it really beautiful and it shall have two layers of thick cream inside ill pay now said elizabeth oh and will you please send it to miss joan townsend whyteleafe school on friday morning early any message inside miss asked the bakers wife writing down the name and address no said elizabeth she took the poundnote out of her purse and was just giving it to the shop woman when nora came into the shop she smiled at elizabeth then she looked round the shop are you alone she asked surely you didnt come down to the village by yourself oh no nora said elizabeth i came with helen and belinda theyre waiting for me at the icecream shop the little girl paid for the cake and received ten shillings change nora stared at the money and looked puzzled elizabeth waved goodbye and went out she went to the bookshop and ordered the book she knew joan wanted it was a book all about birds and cost five shillings elizabeth asked the shopman to send it by post and to put inside a little card that she gave him on the card she had written with love from mother now joan will think her mother has sent her a fine cake and a present thought elizabeth pleased to think of joans surprise ill buy some birthday cards now she bought three nice ones in one she wrote with love from daddy in the second she wrote with love from mother and in the last she wrote with love from elizabeth and added a row of kisses she bought stamps for them and put them safely in her pocket ready to post on thursday then she went to buy the handbag she had seen in the drapers shop she had four shillings left by that time so she bought the red bag paid for a red comb and a red handkerchief to put inside and put the change into the little purse belonging to the bag there was sixpence change and elizabeth thought it would be fun to put that in too then she went to the icecream shop helen and belinda were there tired of waiting for her you have been a time elizabeth said helen whatever have you been doing you cant possibly be so long spending only two shillings and then for the first time elizabeth remembered that all money had to be put into the school moneybox and asked for and she had spent a whole pound that afternoon and hadnt even put a penny into the box she frowned goodness now what was she to do how could she have forgotten well perhaps its a good thing i did forget said elizabeth to herself if id put the money into the big moneybox and asked for a pound to spend on somebodys birthday im sure rita and william wouldnt have given me so much it is an awful lot to spend all at oncebut i did so want to give joan a fine birthday all the same elizabeth was rather worried about it she had broken a rulebut she couldnt mend the broken rule because she had spent all the money it was no use saying anything about it the thing was done and anyway joan would have the finest surprise of her life but elizabeth had a very nasty surprise on her way back to school with helen and belinda nora ran up to them and said elizabeth i want to speak to you for a minute helen you and belinda can go on by yourselves elizabeth will catch you up what is it nora asked elizabeth in surprise elizabeth where did you get that money from that i saw you spending in the bakers shop asked nora my uncle sent it to me said elizabeth her heart sinking when she knew that nora had seen the money well you knew the rule said nora why didnt you put it into the moneybox you knew you could have out what you wanted if you really needed it for something i know nora said elizabeth in a small voice but i forgot all about that till id spent the money really i did spent all the money cried nora in horror what a whole pound twenty shillings whatever did you spend it on elizabeth didnt answer nora grew angry elizabeth you must tell me whatever could you have spent a whole pound on in such a little time its a real waste of money it wasnt said elizabeth sulkily please dont ask me any more nora i cant tell you what i spent the money on its a secret youre a very naughty girl said nora you break a ruleand spend all that moneyand then wont tell me what you spent it on wellyou can tell the next meeting if you wont tell me i shant tell them said elizabeth its a secret and a secret i cant possibly tell oh dear i always seem to be getting into trouble and this time i really didnt mean to nora would not listen to any more she sent elizabeth to catch up helen and belinda poor elizabeth she simply did not know what to do she couldnt tell her secret because then she would have to own up that she was buying things for joan and pretending that they came from joans mother and the meeting would be angry with her just when she was being good and enjoying herself wellnever mindjoan will have a good birthday anyhow said elizabeth thinking of the cake and the book how surprised she will be chapter joans wonderful birthday joan you will soon be eleven elizabeth said at breakfast the next day as she chopped the top off her boiled egg gracious you are getting old joan went red and said nothing she hated anyone to talk about her birthday because she knew there would be no cards or presents or cake for her she was such a timid little mouse that she had no friends at all except elizabethand joan was always feeling astonished that the bold elizabeth should be her friend i wonder if youll have a cake went on elizabeth knowing perfectly well that joan was going to because she herself had ordered it i wonder what it will be like joan scowled at elizabeth she really felt angry with her how silly elizabeth is talking about my birthday and if im going to have a cake when she knows quite well that i dont want anything at all said about it thought joan she frowned at elizabeth and signed to her to stopbut elizabeth gaily went on talking let me seeits friday thats your birthday isnt it joan i wonder how many cards youll have joan didnt have a single one last year and she didnt have a cake either said kenneth i dont believe shes got a father and mother well i have then said joan feeling quite desperate funny they never come and see you not even at halfterm then said hilda who liked to see joan getting red you be quiet said elizabeth suddenly seeing that things were going too far what im surprised at is that your parents bother to come and see a girl like you hilda if i had a daughter like you id go to the end of the world and stay there thats enough elizabeth said nora who pounced on elizabeth very often since the little girl had refused to tell her her secret elizabeth said no more she longed to say quite a lot but she was learning to control her tongue now miss scott would indeed not have known her nothing more was said about joans birthday just then and after breakfast as the girls were making their beds joan went up to elizabeth please elizabeth she said for goodness sake dont say any more about my birthday you make things much worse if you dothink how i shall feel when everyone watches to see what cards and presents come for me by the post and i havent any you are luckyyou have two grannies and two granpas and uncles and auntsbut i havent a single uncle aunt or granny so its no wonder i dont get many treats you are unlucky joan said elizabeth in surprise really you are welli wont say any more about your birthday to the others if you dont like it but she longed to all the same for she kept hugging her delicious secretjoan would have a wonderful cake with eleven candles on and cards and presents too nora was not kind to elizabeth that week she did not say any more to elizabeth about her secret but she had quite made up her mind to report her at the next meeting she thought elizabeth was very deceitful and mean not to give up her money as everyone else did and not to tell her what she had spent it on after all we gave her a fine chance to be as decent as possible at the last meeting said nora to herself we really didand the funny thing is i felt sure that elizabeth would be worth that chance and would do her best to keep our rules and help the school as we all try to do but i was wrong i dont feel as if i like elizabeth a bit now when thursday came elizabeth posted the three birthday cards she had bought she could hardly go to sleep that night for thinking of joans pleasure in the morning it really was lovely to give a surprise to someone friday came elizabeth leapt out of bed ran to joans bed hugged her and cried many happy returns of the day joan i hope youll have a lovely birthday heres a little present for you from me joan took the parcel and undid it when she saw the red handbag inside she was delightedand she was even more thrilled when she found the comb the handkerchief and the sixpence she flung her arms round elizabeth and squeezed her so hard that elizabeth almost choked oh thank you elizabeth she cried its perfectly lovely i did so badly want a handbag i only had that little old purse oh how i shall love using it its the nicest present i have ever had there was another surprise for joan before she went down to breakfast hilda slipped into the bedroom with a laceedged handkerchief for joan she had felt rather ashamed of herself for teasing joan the day before and had taken one of her best hankies to give for a present joan was thrilledin fact she was so thrilled that a bright idea came into elizabeths head she flew down to the playroom to see if harry was there he wasntbut she could hear him practising in the musicroom harry harry cried elizabeth rushing up to him and startling him so much that his music fell to the floor will you do something for me depends what it is said harry picking up his music harry its joan townsends birthday said elizabeth you know you said youd give me one of your rabbits dont you and i said it wasnt any good because i was going at halftermwell would you please give it to joan instead because you cant think how pleased she is to have presents well said harry not quite sure about it go on harry do say yesbe a sport begged elizabeth her blue eyes shining like stars it was very difficult to refuse elizabeth anything when she looked like that harry nodded all right be said what shall i dobring the baby rabbit in at breakfasttime oooh said elizabeth with a squeak of delight yes do say shut your eyes joan and feel what ive brought you and then put it into her arms what a surprise for her well ill go and get it now said harry putting his music away but shell have to look after it herself elizabeth it will be her rabbit ill look after it for her said elizabeth feeling delighted at the thought of mothering a baby rabbit each day hurry harry elizabeth went back to the bedroom the breakfast bell rang as she was tidying her chestofdrawers she slipped her arm through joans and they went downstairs together they stopped at the letterrack there was one card for elizabeth from mrs allenand in joans place were three envelopes in which were the cards that elizabeth had bought joan took them down going red with surprise she opened them she took out the first card and read it with love from mother she turned to elizabeth her eyes shining shes remembered my birthday she said to elizabeth and her voice was very happy she was even more surprised when she found a card marked with love from daddy and she was delighted with elizabeths card fancy three cards said joan so happy that she didnt notice that the writing on the envelopes was the same for all three she went into breakfast quite delighted and on her chair was an enormous cardboard box from the baker and a small neat parcel from the bookshop joan gave a cry of astonishment more presents who from i wonder she opened the little parcel first and when she saw the book about birds and read the little card her eyes filled suddenly with tears she turned away to hide them look she whispered to elizabeth its from my mother isnt it lovely of her to remember my birthday i didnt think she would joan was so happy to have the book which she thought came from her mother that she almost forgot to undo the box in which was the enormous birthday cake undo this box quickly begged elizabeth joan cut the string she took off the lid and every one crowded round to see what was inside when they saw the beautiful cake they shouted in delight joan what a fine cake oooh you are lucky joan was too astonished to say a word she lifted the cake out of the box on its silver board and stood it on the breakfasttable she stared at it as if it was a dream cake she couldnt believe it was really true i say said nora what a cake look at the candlesand the sugar roses and look at the message on ita happy birthday for my darling joan your mother has been jolly generous joanits the biggest birthday cake ive seen joan stared at the message on the cake she could hardly believe it she felt so happy that she thought she would really have to burst it was all so unexpected and so surprising elizabeth was even happiershe looked at her friends delighted face and hugged herself for joy she was glad she had spent all uncle ruperts pound on joan this was better than having a birthday herself much much better something that miss scott had often said to her flashed into her head it is more blessed to give than to receive miss scott had said when she had tried to make elizabeth give some of her toys to the poor children at christmastime and miss scott was quite right thought elizabeth in surprise im getting more fun out of giving these things than if i was receiving them myself everybody in the school must share my birthday cake said joan in a happy important voice and she lifted her head proudly and smiled around thanks joan many happy returns of the day shouted everybody and then harry came in and cried joan shut your eyes and feel what ive got for you in amazement joan shut her eyesand the next moment the baby rabbit was in her arms she gave a scream and opened her eyes again she was so surprised that she didnt hold the rabbit tightly enoughand it leapt from her arms and scampered to the door through which the teachers were just coming to breakfast the rabbit ran all round them and the masters and mistresses stopped in astonishment is this a rabbit i see cried mademoiselle who was afraid of all small animals oh these children what will they bring to breakfast next im so sorry said harry catching the rabbit you see its joans birthday and i was giving her one ot my rabbits i see said miss best well take it out to the hutches now harry and joan can have it again after breakfast oh elizabeth im so happy whispered joan as they sat down to their eggs and bacon i cant tell you how happy i am you neednt tell me said elizabeth laughing i can see how happy you areand im glad chapter joan gets a shock joan had a wonderful birthday she laughed and chattered in a way that no one had ever seen before the little girl became quite pretty with happiness and when she cut her birthday cake and gave a piece to everyone in the school her face was a picture nobody could possibly look happier thought elizabeth eating the delicious cake goodness that baker certainly did make joans cake well its gorgeous that evening after supper elizabeth asked joan to come and help her plant the lettuce seeds she had bought but joan shook her head i cant she said id love to elizabethbut ive got something important to do what is it asked elizabeth rattling the seeds in her packets wellive got to write and thank my mother and father for their cards and the lovely cake and the book said joan i must do that tonight oh said elizabeth in dismay she turned away biting her lip and frowning good gracious she thought i didnt think of joan writing to say thank you whatever will her mother think when she gets joans letter thanking her for things she hasnt sent will she write and tell joan she doesnt know anything about themand what will poor joan do then elizabeth went out to the garden thinking hard now she had made a muddle why hadnt she thought of joan writing to her mother it was silly of her joan was going to be very unhappyand perhaps angry when she found out the truth perhaps it wasnt such a good idea after all said elizabeth to herself bother why do i do things without thinking first i wonder if joans mother will be angry with me for pretending those cards and the book and the cake were from joans parents i dont feel happy about it any more i feel dreadful she went to give john terry the seeds he was delighted good he said just what i wanted i plant a new row of lettuce every week elizabeth and then we have new lettuces growing in different sizes so that each week i have a fresh row to pull did you like the lettuces we had for tea yesterday those were out of the frames i was rather proud of them they were simply lovely john said elizabeth still busy thinking about joan she simply couldnt imagine what would happen and she felt worried she helped to plant the lettuce seeds but john scolded her because she sowed them so thickly i thought you knew something about gardening he said do you want the lettuces to come up like a forest sorry john said elizabeth i was thinking about something else you havent been naughty i hope asked john who liked elizabeth and was always pleased when she came to help him in his garden i hope you wont get ticked off at the meeting again youve bad enough of that im afraid i shall be said elizabeth sighing she was worried about that tooshe was sure nora would report her for spending a whole poundand whatever would she say about it she wasnt going to give away her secret and let everyone know that it was she and not joans parents who had sent the cake and the book things were suddenly getting very difficult joan was very happy for two daysand then she got a letter from her mother that took away all her happiness elizabeth was with joan when she found the letter at teatime in the letterrack oh mother has written very quickly to answer my letter said joan happily and she took the letter down she tore it open and stood reading it then she turned very pale and looked with wide miserable eyes at elizabeth mother saysmother saysshe didnt send me a cardshe forgot said joan in a trembling voice andand she says she didnt send me a cakeor that bookand she cant understand why im writing to thank her oh elizabeth elizabeth didnt know what to do or say she put her arm round joan and took her to the playroom no one was there for everyone had gone in to have tea joan sat down still very white and stared at elizabeth i dont understand it said poor joan oh elizabethi was so very happyand now i feel dreadful who could have sent those thingsif it wasnt my mother still elizabeth couldnt say a word how could she say she had done it her kindness now seemed like a cruel trick poor joan come in and have some tea said elizabeth at last finding her voice you look so pale joan come and have some teait will do you good but joan shook her head im not hungry i couldnt eat anything she said let me alone you go in to tea without me i want to be aloneplease elizabeth you are kind and sweet to me but i dont want anybody just now im going out for a walk ill be better when i come back joan slipped out of the playroom elizabeth stared after her unhappy and worried joan had gone out alonewithout anyone which wasnt allowed elizabeth simply didnt know what to do so she went in to tea very late and was scolded by nora youre late elizabeth snapped nora youll have to go without cake today elizabeth slipped into her place and said nothing as she ate her tea she noticed that the room was getting very dark indeed theres a good old storm blowing up said harry my goodnesslook at that rain splendid said john i badly need it for my broad beans and peas but elizabeth did not think it was splendid she was thinking of poor joan out for a walk all alone in the storm a roll of thunder sounded and lightning flashed across the window joan hadnt even got a hat on said elizabeth to herself shell be soaked if only i knew which way she had gone id go and meet her with a mackintosh oh dear everythings going wrong she could hardly eat any tea when the meal was over she ran to the playroom and then to the bedroom to see if joan was back she wasnt elizabeth looked out of the window she felt very ashamed and guilty i meant to be so kindand all ive done is to give joan a dreadful shock make her very unhappy and now shes out in this dreadful thunderstorm thought elizabeth for a whole hour elizabeth watched for joan to come back the thunder gradually rolled itself away and the lightning stopped but the heavy rain went on and on lashing down on the new leaves of the trees and making a noise like the waves breaking at sea at last joan came back elizabeth saw a small dripping figure coming in through the gardendoor she rushed to joan at once joan youre simply soaked through come and change at once water dripped off joans dress for the rain had been tremendous the little girl was soaked through to the skin she was shivering with cold oh poor joan said elizabeth dragging her friend upstairs youll catch a dreadful cold come on you must change into dry things straight away on the way up the two girls met the matron of the school who looked after them when they were ill and who bandaged their arms and legs when they hurt themselves she was a fat jolly woman and everyone liked her though she could be very strict when she liked she stopped when she saw joan good gracious she said wherever have you been to get into that state you silly child shes been out in the rain said elizabeth shes awfully cold matron shes going to put on dry things ive got some of joans things airing in my hot cupboard said matron shed better come along with me gracious child what a sight you look joan went with matron she was hurriedly stripped of her soaking clothes and matron rubbed her down well with a rough towel joan said nothing at all but stood looking so sad and miserable that matron was worried i think id better take your temperature she said you dont look right to me put this warm dressingdown round you for a minute ill get the thermometer she sent elizabeth away the little girl went off to the musicroom to practise feeling very upset she practised her scales steadily and somehow it comforted her she went to look for joan at suppertime but she was nowhere to be seen havent you heard said belinda joans ill shed got a high temperature and shes in bed in the san the san or sanatorium was where any boy or girl was put when they were ill it was a cheerful sunny room built apart from the school so joan was there ill elizabeths heart sank she felt that it was all her fault cheer up shell be all right tomorrow i expect said belinda seeing elizabeths dismayed face but joan wasnt all right she was worse the doctor came and went with a grave face it was dreadful i know what would make joan better thought elizabeth in despair if only her mother could come and see her and love her a bitjoan would be quite all right her chill would go and shed be happy again elizabeth sat and wondered what she could do then an idea came into her head she would write to joans mother she would tell her of the presents she had given to joan pretending that they were from joans mother she would tell her how much joan loved her mother and wanted her to think of her and remember herand she would beg her to come and see joan because she was ill elizabeth jumped up she ran to joans writingpaper which she kept on a shelf in the playroom in it she found the letter from joans mother and elizabeth copied the address for herself then she slipped the letter back now ill write to mrs townsend said the little girl it will be the most difficult letter ive ever written but its got to be done oh dearwhat an awful lot of trouble im going to get into chapter more trouble elizabeth sat down to write to joans mother she bit the end of her pen she began twice and tore the paper up it was very very difficult it took her a long time to write the letter but at last it was done and put in the box to be posted this is what elizabeth had written dear mrs townsend i am elizabeth allen joans friend i am very fond of joan but i have made her unhappy and now she is ill i will tell you what i did you see joan told me a lot about you and how she loved you and she said she didnt think you loved her very much because you hardly ever wrote to her and you didnt remember her birthdays it is awful not to have your birthday remembered at school because most people have cards and a cake well i had a pound from my uncle rupert and i thought of a good idea at least i thought it was a good idea but it wasnt i ordered a big birthday cake for joan with a loving message on itand i got cards and wrote in them with love from mother and with love from daddy and sent them and i got a book and pretended that was from you too well joan was awfully happy on her birthday because she thought you had remembered her you cant think how happy she was then she wrote to thank you for the things i quite forgot she would do that and of course you wrote back to tell her that you hadnt sent them joan got a dreadful shock and she went out for a walk by herself and a thunderstorm came she was soaked through and now she is very ill i am very unhappy about it because i know it is all my fault but i did really mean to make joan happy what i am writing for is to ask you if you could come and see joan and make a fuss of her because then i think she would be so glad that she would soon get better i know you will be very angry with me and i am very sorry elizabeth allen that was elizabeths letter written with many smudges because she had to stop and think what she wanted to say and each time she stopped she smudged her letter she lickedthe envelope stamped it and left it to be posted what would joans mother say if only she would come and see joan and put things right for her it would be lovelybut goodness she would be very very angry with elizabeth elizabeth missed joan very much the next day she went to ask matron if she might see joan but matron shook her head no she said the doctor says no one must see her she is really ill elizabeth went to find john he was putting sticks in for his peas to climb up every spare moment he spent in the school garden that was the nice part of whyteleafe schoolif you had a love for something you could make it your hobby and everything was done to help you john said elizabeth joan is ill do you think you could spare me some flowers for her yes said john standing up straight you can pick some of those pink tulips if you like oh but they are your best ones john said elizabeth arent you keeping them for something special well joans being ill is something special said john pick them with nice long stalks slit the stalks at the end before you put them into waterthe tulips will last a long time then elizabeth just had time to pick the tulips find a vase and run to matron with it before the school bell went matron promised to give the flowers to joan elizabeth shot back to the classroom and was only just in time dont forget its the school meeting tonight belinda said to elizabeth at the end of school that morning bother said elizabeth in dismay she had forgotten all about it i dont think ill come i know im going to get into trouble you must come said belinda shocked are you afraid to no said elizabeth fiercely im not afraid to ill be there and she was sitting angrily on a form beside harry and helen knowing perfectly well that nora was going to report her as soon as possible well if she does i shant give joans secret away thought elizabeth they can punish me all they like but if they do ill start being naughty again worse than ever of course nora reported elizabeth almost at once she stood up and spoke gravely to rita and william the two judges i have a serious report to make said nora it is about elizabeth although we gave her every chance to be good and helpful last week i am sorry to say that she has been mean and deceitful she went down to the village this week and took with her a poundnote to spend instead of putting it into the moneybox to share out she spent the whole pound and would not tell me anything about it everyone stared at elizabeth in surprise a pound said rita twenty shillingsspent in one afternoon elizabeth is this true quite true said elizabeth sulkily then its too bad cried eileen we all put our money into the box and share it out and we gave elizabeth extra money for a recordbut she puts her money into her own purse the mean thing everybody thought the same the children began to talk angrily elizabeth sat silent looking red and sulky rita hammered on the table quiet she said everyone was silent rita turned to elizabeth stand up elizabeth she said please tell me what you spent the pound onyou can at least let us judge whether or not you spent the money well i cant tell you what i spent it on said elizabeth looking pleadingly at rita dont ask me rita its a secretand not my own secret really as a matter of fact i quite forgot that i ought to put my money into the box and then ask for what i wanted i really did forget do you think we would have allowed you to spend the money on what you bought asked rita i dont know said elizabeth rather miserably all i know is that i wish i hadnt spent it on what i did i was quite wrong rita felt sorry for elizabeth well she said you used the money wrongly and you know itif you had only kept our rule we should have known whether or not to let you have the money to spend as you did dont you see what a good idea our moneybox is elizabeth yes i really do rita said elizabeth glad that rita was speaking kindly to her well now listen elizabeth said rita after talking with william for a while we will be as fair as we can be to you about this but you must trust us and tell us what you wanted the money for first if we think it was for a very good purpose we shall say no more about it but ask you to remember the rule another time thats very fair of you rita said elizabeth almost in tears but i cant tell you i know now that i did something wrong with the moneybut theres somebody else mixed up in the secret and i simply cant say any more who is the other person in the secret asked rita i cant tell you that either said poor elizabeth who had no wish to bring joan in after all it wasnt joans fault at all that this had happened have you told anybody about this secret asked rita yes one person said elizabeth its a grownup rita what did the grownup say when you told her asked william she hasnt said anything yet said elizabeth i told her the secret in a letter and she hasnt answered my letter yet i only wrote it yesterday william rita and the monitors spoke together for a little while everyone was puzzled to know what to do it was a very serious matter and somehow it had to be dealt with the beauty and the beast arent here tonight said nora looking towards the back of the room they are worried about joan townsend being ill only miss ranger and mr johns are here if the others were here we could ask them for advice againbut somehow i feel id like to settle it without asking miss ranger or mr johns i think i know what well do said william at last well leave the matter until elizabeth has had an answer to her letter good said rita she hammered on the table elizabeth she said we are going to leave the matter until you have had an answer to your letter will you please come to me and tell me when you have yes rita said elizabeth gratefully i think the person i wrote to will be very very angry with me and i wish i could tell you all about it but i cant well it seems to me as if elizabeth is being punished quite enough without us saying anything more said william well leave it for a day or two then please go to rita elizabeth and tell her what answer you have received elizabeth sat down glad that things were not worse she thought the children were very fair and just she hadnt even been punished when the two shillings were given out to everyone elizabeth put hers back into the box i wont have it this week she said ill do without it good girl said william there was a nicer feeling in the room at once everyone felt that elizabeth had tried to make up a bit for her mistake after the meeting elizabeth went to ask how joan was the matron came to the door of the san and shook her head shes not any better she said shes worrying about something the doctor saysand she even says she doesnt want to see her mother though we have asked her if she would like us to send for her oh said elizabeth and ran away in dismay now joan didnt want to see her motherand elizabeth had written to ask her to come i always seem to do the wrong thing said elizabeth to herself i wish i could go and tell rita everythingthen perhaps she could help mebut i cant do that without giving joan away she would hate to think that anyone knew her cake didnt come from her mother after all oh dear whatever is going to happen i wish mrs townsend would hurry up and write to me chapter joans mother arrives two days later joan was seriously ill and the matron and doctor were very worried indeed we must send for her mother said miss belle at once the child begs us not to send for her said matron in a puzzled voice it is very strange i hardly know whether it would be good for joan to see hershe seems so much against having her mother sent for well said miss best the mother ought to come for her own sake if not for joans she would be very angry if we did not send for her we can tell her that joan is behaving rather queerly about her it may be her illness that is making her think funny thoughts but mrs townsend arrived before she was sent for she had received elizabeths queer letter and had packed a bag and taken a train to whyteleafe the same day elizabeth saw the taxi coming up through the archway of the school wall but she did not know that mrs townsend was inside it she did not see her get out pay the man and ring the bell mrs townsend was shown into the headmistresses drawingroom at once miss belle and miss best were most astonished to see her ive come about joan said mrs townsend she was a small sadlooking woman beautifully dressed and with large eyes just like joans how is she not any better im afraid answered miss belle but how did you know she was ill she asked in surprise i had a letter from a girl called elizabeth allen said mrs townsend a very queer letter about joans birthday did she tell you anything about it no said miss belle even more surprised i know nothing about it may we see the letter mrs townsend gave the two mistresses elizabeths smudgy letter they read it in silence so that is what elizabeth wanted the money for said miss best her lovely smile showing for a moment well children are always surprisingbut elizabeth is the most astonishing child we have ever hadso naughty and yet so goodso defiant and yet so kindhearted and just i understand now why joan keeps saying that she doesnt want you to be sent for mrs townsend said miss belle she is ashamed poor child because she thought you had sent her those presentsand now she finds you didntand she is bewildered and hurt i think perhaps i ought to explain a few things to you said mrs townsend i must explain them to joan too yes please tell us anything that will help us with joan said miss best well said joans mother joan had a twin a boy called michael he was the finest loveliest boy you ever saw miss best his father and i couldnt help loving him more than we loved joan because we both wanted a boy and we didnt care much for girls he was brave and bonny and always laughingbut joan was always rather a coward and beside michael she seemed sulky and selfish dont you think that might have been because you made such a fuss of the boy and perhaps rather left joan out asked miss belle she may have been jealous and that does queer things to a child yesyou may be right said mrs townsend wellwhen they were three both children fell il and michael died and because we loved him so much we both wished thatthat that joan had been taken and michael had been left to you said miss best gently yes i understand mrs townsendbut you did a great wrong to poor joan you have never forgiven her for being the only child left does joan know she had a twin she soon forgot said mrs townsend and we didnt tell her as she grew older i dont think she knows even now that she ever had a brother well mrs townsend i think you should tell joan this said miss best firmly she loves you very much and is miserable because she cant understand why you dont seem to love her i do love her said mrs townsend but somehow it is difficult to show it to joan when i got this queer little letter telling me how somebody tried to buy joan presents pretending to be me i felt dreadful i felt i must come and see my poor little joan at once come and see her now said miss belle tell her what you have told us joan will understand and once she is sure of your love she will not mind how little you show it but it shouldnt be difficult to love a child like joanshe is so gentle and kind and what about elizabeth asked mrs townsend i must speak to her i think she must be a very kind child to try to make joan happy go and see joan first said miss best so mrs townsend was taken to the san she opened the door and matron beckoned her in seeing at once that she was joans mother shes asleep she whispered come over here and sit by the bed till she wakes mrs townsend sat beside the bed she looked at joan the little girl was thin and pale and her sleeping face was so unhappy that her mother couldnt bear it she leant over joan and kissed her gently on the cheek joan awoke and stared up her large eyes grew larger as she saw her mother she looked at her for a moment and then spoke are you really here was it you who kissed me of course said mrs townsend with tears in her eyes poo little joan i was so very sorry to hear you were ill joans mother put her arms round her little girl and hugged her joan flung her arms round her mothers neck in delight oh mother i didnt want you to come but now im so happy im sorry i didnt remember your birthday darling said mrs townsend i think weve got a few things to say to one another why didnt you want me to come becausebecauseoh because i didnt think you would be pleased that somebody pretended to be you and sent me things said joan i was afraid of seeing you now listen joan i want to tell you something said mrs townsend sitting on the bed and cuddling joan beside her and she began to tell the little girl of her lost brother you see i grieved so much for him that i almost forgot i had a little daughter to make up for him said mrs townsend in a trembling voice you have always been so quiet and timid too joan you never asked for things never pushed yourself for ward so i never knew that you minded so much you didnt say a word i couldnt said joan but im very happy now mother this is the biggest surprise of my life i understand things now i do wish you had told me before but it doesnt matter nothing matters now that ive got you close beside me and i know you really do love me and wont forget me again i will never forget you said mrs townsend i didnt think you minded at allhut now that know what you have been thinking i shall be the kind of mother you want but you must hurry up and get better mustnt you oh i feel much much better already said joan and indeed she looked quite different when matron came in she was surprised to see such a happylooking child i shall want lots of dinner today said joan because mother is going to have it with me matron and she wants to see how much i can eat as they were eating their dinner together they talked about elizabeth i guessed that it was elizabeth who sent those things when you said it wasnt you said joan it was just the sort of mad kind thing she would do you know mother shes the first real friend ive had and i think shes splendid though the first weeks she was here she was really the naughtiest rudest girl in the school the sad thing isshes made up her mind to go at halfterm so i shant have her very much longer i want to see elizabeth said mrs townsend she wrote me such a funny sad letter if it hadnt been for her letter and what she did for your birthday we shouldnt have come to understand one another as we now do joan and although she thinks she did a very wrong thing somehow or other it has come right because she really did mean to be kind matron do you think elizabeth might come and see me whilst my mother is here asked joan when matron came in to take her temperature well see what your temperature is doing said matron pleased to see the empty plates she slipped the thermometer into joans mouth she waited a minute and then took it out again good gracious just below normal she said you are getting better quickly yesi think elizabeth might come ill send for her elizabeth was practising her duet with richard when the message came one of the school maids brought it mrs townsend is in the san with joan and says she would like to see you said the maid matron says you can go for twenty minutes elizabeths heart sank so mrs townsend had come to the school she had got her letterand now she was here and wanted to see elizabeth i dont want to go to the san said elizabeth oh dearisnt there any excuse i can make but i thought joan was your friend said richard in surprise she is said elizabeth but you seeoh dear i cant possibly explain things have just gone wrong thats all the little girl put her music away looking glum cheer up said richard things arent so bad when you go and face them properly well ill face them all right said elizabeth throwing her curls back i wonder whats going to happen to me now chapter rita talks to elizabeth elizabeth went to the san matron was just coming out smiling how is joan now asked elizabeth much better said matron we shall soon have her out and about again now oh good said elizabeth can i go in yes said matron you can stay for twenty minutes till afternoon school talk quietly and dont excite joan at all elizabeth went in she shut the door quietly behind her joan was lying in a white bed under a big sunny window and mrs townsend was sitting beside her and is this elizabeth asked mrs townsend with a welcoming smile elizabeth went forward and shook hands thinking that mrs townsend didnt look very angry after all she bent over and kissed her friend im so glad youre better joan she said i do miss you do you really said joan pleased ive missed you too come here elizabeth said mrs townsend drawing elizabeth to her i want to thank you for your letter i was so surprised to get itand i know it must have been hard to write yes it was said elizabeth i was awfully afraid you would be angry with me when you got it mrs townsend i meant to make joan so happy on her birthdayand i didnt think shed find out it wasnt you who sent the things i know it was a silly thing to do now never mind said joans mother it has made things come right in the end have they come right asked elizabeth in surprise looking from joan to her mother very right said mrs townsend smiling joan will tell you all we have said one day and you will understand how they went wrong but now i want to tell you that i am very very glad joan has such a kind little friend i know she will be much happier at whyeeleafe now that she has you it is so horrid to have no friends at all oh elizabeth i do so wish you were staying on at whyteleafe sighed joan taking her friends hand couldnt you possibly possibly stay dont ask me to joan said elizabeth you know ive made up my mind to go and its feeble to change your mind once youve made it up ive said i shall go and if the meeting says i can i shall go back with my parents when they come to see me at halfterm do you think you will be able to come and see me at halfterm asked joan turning to her mother yes i will answered mrs townsend i hope by then that you will be up and about and we will go to the next town and spend the day there joan oh good said joan happily it was the first time her mother had ever come to take her out at halfterm and the little girl was delighted i shall get better quickly now so that i shall be ready for you at halfterm a bell rang in the school elizabeth got up quickly thats my bell she said i must go goodbye mrs townsend and thank you for being so nice about my letter goodbye joan im so glad youre happy ill come and see you again if matron will let me she ran off mrs townsend turned to joan shes a very nice child she said how funny that she should have been so naughty at firstand what a pity she wants to leave shes just the sort of girl that whyteleafe school would be proud of elizabeth thought of rita as she sat in class that afternoon doing her painting i told rita i would go to her as soon as i had an answer to my letter she thought welli havent exactly had an answerand yet i do know the answer because mrs townsend came herself and told me she wondered if she should go to rita after tea what should she tell her she didnt know she need not have worried herself miss belle and miss best had sent for rita that day and had told her about elizabeth and her queer letter to joans mother she spent the money her uncle gave her on buying that big birthday cake for joan and other presents and cards said miss belle that is where the money went rita but why didnt elizabeth say so asked rita puzzled because if she explained that the school would know joans unhappiness at being forgotten by her mother said miss best if elizabeth had been longer at whyteleafe school she would have gone to you rita or to one of the monitors she trusted and would have asked their advicebut she has been here such short time and is such a headstrong independent child that she takes matters into her own handsand gets into trouble all the same she has the makings of a very fine girl m her said miss belle she is fearless and brave kind and clever and although she has been the naughtiest rudest girl we have ever had that only lasted for a little while yes said rita i liked her almost from the beginning although she has been very difficult but she really is the sort of girl we want at whyteleafe im afraid now though that she will go home for we have promised that she shall if she wants to you must send for her and have a talk with her rita said miss best she was supposed to come and tell you when she had an answer to her letter to mrs townsend wasnt she wellwe know the answer nowand it is not an answer that can be explained fully to a school meeting have a talk with elizabeth and then decide what to do i think you will feel that although elizabeth did wrong the kindness that was at the bottom of it more than makes up for the upset she caused yes i think so too agreed rita who had been very interested in all that miss belle and miss best had told her she was glad to know that elizabeth had spent the pound on somebody else glad that it was only kindness that had caused such a disturbance she went out to look for elizabeth it was after tea elizabeth was running to see if matron would let her sit with joan again she bumped into rita round a corner good gracious what a hurricane you are said rita her breath bumped out of her youre just the person i want to see come to my study rita had a little room of her own a study all to herself because she was head girl she was very proud of it and had made it as nice as she could elizabeth had never been in it before and she looked round in pleasure what a dear little room she said i like the blue carpetand the blue tableclothand the pictures and flowers is this your very own room yes said rita william has one too his is just as nice as mine he is coming here in a minute have a sweet elizabeth rita took down a tin from the small cupboard and offered it to elizabeth who at once took a toffee elizabeth wondered what rita and william were going to say to her there was a knock at the door and william strolled in hallo he said smiling at elizabeth hows the bold bad girl elizabeth laughed she liked william calling her that though she had hated the name not so very long ago elizabeth william and i know now what you spent that pound on and why you did it said rita and we want to say that we quite see that you couldnt tell the meeting and we shant tell the meeting either said william sitting down in ritas cosy armchair but wont you have to asked elizabeth in surprise no said william rita and i are the judges of what can be told the meeting and what need not be explained if we think best we shall simply say that we have had a satisfactory answer and explanation and that the matter is now finished oh thank you said elizabeth it wasnt really myself i was thinking of you know it was joan we know that now said rita you tried to do a right thing in a wrong way elizabeth if you had been at whyteleafe a little longer you would have done things differentlybut you havent been here long enough no i havent said elizabeth i do see that i have learnt a lot already but i havent learnt enough i wish i was wise like you and william well why not stay and learn to be said william with a laugh you are just the sort of girl we want elizabeth you would make a fine monitor later on me a monitor cried elizabeth most astonished oh id never never be a monitor good gracious it may sound funny to you now elizabeth said william but in a term or two you would be quite responsible and sensible enough to be made one id simply love to be a monitor and sit in the jury said elizabeth whatever would mummy sayand miss scott my old governess would never never believe it she said i was so spoilt i would never do anything worth while you are spoilt said rita smiling but you would soon get over that what about staying on elizabeth and seeing what you can do im beginning to feel it would be nice said elizabeth but i cant change my mind i said i meant to go home at halfterm and im going to its only feeble people that change their minds and say first one thing and then another im not going to be like that i wonder where you got that idea from said william i mean the idea that its feeble to change your mind once its made up thats a wrong idea you know wrong said elizabeth in surprise of course said william make up your mind about things by all meansbut if something happens to show that you are wrong then it is feeble not to change your mind elizabeth only the strongest people have the pluck to change their minds and say so if they see they have been wrong in their ideas i didnt think of that said elizabeth feeling puzzled well dont puzzle your head too much about things said william getting up i must go think about what we have said elizabeth the next meeting will be your last one if you are leaving usand we shall keep our word to you and let you go if you want to you can tell your parents when they come to see you at halfterm and miss belle and miss best will explain everything to them but we shall be sorry to lose the naughtiest girl in the school elizabeth left the study her head in a whirl she did like william and rita so much but she couldnt change her mindshe would be so ashamed to climb down and say she had been wrong chapter elizabeth fights with herself the next day or two were very pleasant elizabeth was allowed to see joan whenever she liked and she took her some more flowers from john she also took her a jigsaw puzzle from helen and a book from nora joan was looking very pretty and very happy her mother had gone leaving behind her a big box of velvety peaches a tin of barley sugar and some books but best of all she had left joan a promise that never never would she let joan think she was forgotten again its all because of you elizabeth said joan offering her friend a barley sugar to suck oh elizabethdo please stay on at whyteleafe dont make me unhappy by leaving just as ive got to know you there are plenty of other people for you to make friends with said elizabeth sucking the barley sugar i dont want them said joan they would seem feeble after you elizabeth i sayhave you been looking after my rabbit for me of course said elizabeth oh joan its the dearest little thing you ever saw really it is do you know it knows me now when i go to feed it and it presses its tiny woffly nose against the wire to welcome me and yesterday it nuzzled itself into the crook of my arm and stayed there quite still time the school bell rang and i had to go harry came to see me this morning and he said he wishes you were not leaving because he wants to give us two more baby rabbits to live with my tiny one said joan he said they could be between the two of us oh said elizabeth longing for the two rabbits really if id known what a nice place whyteleafe school was id never have made up my mind to leave it she had to go then because it was time for her musiclesson she rushed to get her music richard was in the musicroom waiting for her with mr lewis the two were getting on well with their duets richard was pleased with elizabeth now for he knew that she really loved music as he did and was willing to work hard at it they played two duets very well indeed for mr lewis splendid he said elizabeth im pleased with you youve practised well since your last lesson and got that difficult part perfect now nowplay richard your seapiece that you love so much elizabeth was proud to play to richard for she thought him a wonderful player she played her best mr lewis and richard listened without a word or a movement till she had finished she ought to play that at the school concert at the end of the term said richard when the piece was ended its fine elizabeth glowed with pleasure she liked praise from richard even more than praise from the musicmaster thats what i suggested to her said mr lewis sitting down at the piano and playing some beautiful chords but she doesnt want to i do want to cried elizabeth indignantly its only that im leaving soon ohthat silly old story again said richard in disgust i thought better of you elizabeth you can stay here if you want tobut youre just too jolly obstinate for words your music may be goodbut dont think much of your common sense he stalked off without another word his music rolled under his arm elizabeth felt half angry half tearful she hated being spoken to like that by richard i expect richard is disappointed with you because i know he hoped that you and he would play the duets in the concert this term explained mr lewis hell have to play them with harry nowand though harry likes music hes not a good player elizabeth finished her musiclesson without saying very much she was thinking hard she was in a muddle she wanted to stayand she wanted to go because her pride told her to keep her word to herself and leave she went out to do some gardening when her lesson was over she and john had become very friendly indeed over the garden elizabeth did not mind working hard with john and he was pleased so many of the others like to pick the flowers and trim the hedges when they feel like it he said but hardly anybody really works hard when the tiny plants have to be bedded out or the kitchen garden has to be hoed who is there that offers to do it nobody well arent i somebody demanded elizabeth dont i come oh yesbut whats the use of you said john youre leaving soon arent you you cant take a real interest in a garden that you wont ever see again if you were going to stay i would make all my plans with youi believe mr johns would let you take partcharge of the garden with me it really would be fun yesit would said elizabeth looking round the garden are you the head of the garden john yesunder mr johns said john nobody needs to garden unless they like you knowbut if its anyones hobby as it is mine they are allowed to spend most of their spare time here ive had charge of the garden for two years now and its pretty good dont you think so oh yes i do said elizabeth looking round it its lovely i could think of lovely things for it too john dont you think a row of double pink hollyhocks would be nice looking over that wall fine said john standing up from his hoeing fine we could get the seeds now and plant them and we could set out the new little plants this autumn ready to flower next summer lets ask for money for the seeds at the next meeting shall we wellyou can if you like said elizabeth im afraid it will be my last meeting john your inst meeting said john scornfully and he dug his hoe into the hard ground as if he were digging it into a meeting what a feeble goose you are elizabeth feeble cried elizabeth angrily i like that just because im keeping my word and sticking to what i said you call me feeble well it is feeble to give up everything you like so much hereyour gardeningyour ridingyour friend and your musicjust because youre too proud to climb down and change your mind said john im disappointed in you elizabeth stamped off in a rage she hated to be called feeble it was the one thing she had always thought that she wasnt she went to the swings there was no one else there elizabeth sat on the highest swing and began to sway to and fro she thought very hard now lets get things clear in my own mind said elizabeth to herself first of alli didnt want to come here and i vowed to myself to mummy and miss scott that id get sent home as soon as possible well i got the meeting to say i could leave at halfterm and i was jolly pleased id got what i wanted elizabeth swung high and the swing creaked as it went to and fro yesid got what i wanted said elizabeth i neednt even stay a term at this horrid hateful school that was what i called it and now i find it isnt horrid or hateful i cant help being happy here the others seem to like me now that ive given up being so awful i have a friend who is longing for me to stay and will be unhappy when i go ive disappointed richard who wants to play with me at the concert ive disappointed mr lewis john is angry with me because i dont like his garden enough to staythough really i do like it awful y and harry wants to give me those lovely rabbits she swung even higher as her thoughts sped along and why am i going now ill just be really honest with myself im not going because im unhappy im very happy now im going simply because i cant bear to change my mind and say im wrong im too proud to say ill stay when ive said ill go im not strong enough to change my mind and own up im wrong elizabeth slowed down the swing and put her feet on the ground she frowned and looked at the grass she had never thought so hard in her life she spoke to herself sternly elizabeth allen youre feeble richard is right and harry is right youre feeble youre a coward you dont dare to stand up at the next meeting and say youre too happy to leave you arent strong enough to change your mind youre proud and silly elizabeth allen im ashamed of you elizabeth spoke these words to herself more sternly than anyone had ever spoken to her she stopped for a moment thinking deeply but am i really so silly am i really so feeble can i really spoil my happiness here and joans too by being so stupid and proud no i cant im stronger than i thought i can change my mind i will change my mind what did william say he said that only the strongest people could change their minds when they saw they were wrongit was the feeble ones who couldnt she began to swing again well im strong she sang as she swung i can change my mind i can say im wrong elizabeth allen youre not such a poor thing as i thought just wait till the next meetingand ill give them the biggest surprise theyve ever had the little girl laughed as she swung she felt very happy she was no longer obstinate and proud she was strong enough to change her mind i wish the next meeting would come soon she said to herself what a shock i shall give them chapter a surprise for the school the last meeting before halfterm met at the same time as usual in the gym everyone was there except joan who was in the san rapidly getting better elizabeth sat on her usual form between harry and belinda feeling rather excited what a surprise she was going to give everyone the ordinary business of the meeting went through as usual money was taken from the box but none was put in most of the children were expecting money from their parents when they saw them at halfterm and the next week the box would be very full again a few complaints were made and one or two reports doris who owned the guineapigs beamed when her monitor reported that she had not forgotten her pets once and said the monitor they look the finest guineapigs ive ever seen now good said rita see that they keep like that doris then elizabeths turn came at the end of the reports rita knocked on the table with the mallet and every one was silent i havent much to say about elizabeth allen this week said rita but i must just say thisboth william and i know now why elizabeth spent so much money and what she spent it on we are quite satisfied about it and we hope that the jury and the rest of you will accept our word when we say that we can only say that we are satisfied and not tell you any more elizabeth was wrong to do what she did but she was right not to tell us about it now the matter has come right and we have no more to say wait rita said william we have more to say this is the meeting at which we were to ask elizabeth if she wanted to leave usit is our halfterm meeting wellwe are keeping our word to you elizabeth if you want to go and you have made up your mind to do so we give you our permission miss belle and miss best will tell your parents and if they agree you may go back with them when they see you tomorrow elizabeth stood up her cheeks were flaming red and her voice was not quite the same as usual ive got something to say she said its not very easyand i dont quite know how to say it but anyway its thisim not going not going cried everyone in surprise turning to look at elizabeth but why not asked rita you said you had made up your mind to go and that you never changed your mind well william said that only feeble people never change their mind if they know they are wrong said elizabeth and i know i was wrong now i only made up my mind to be as naughty as possible because i was angry at being sent to school when i didnt want to go and i vowed id go back home as soon as possible just to show id have my own way well i like whyteleafe its a lovely school and i want to stay so ive changed my mind and though youve said i can have what i want and its very nice of you i dont want it now i want to staythat is if youll let me after all ive everyone began to talk at once harry thumped elizabeth on the back he was very pleased john nodded at her in delight now she could help him with the garden richard actually left his place and came to whisper to her youre a good sort he said you can play the game as well as you play the piano william banged with the mallet richard go back to your place richard went back grinning belinda and helen smiled at elizabeth trying to catch her eye everyone seemed as pleased as could be elizabeth said william we are very pleased with you youve made a lot of silly mistakes but you have made up for them alland we admire you for being able to change your mind admit you were wrong and say so to us all you are the sort of person we want at this school we hope you will stay for years and do your very best i will said elizabeth and she meant it she sat down looking happy and excited it was lovely that everyone was pleased she wasnt the bold bad girl any moreshe was elizabeth allen the sort of person that whyteleafe school wanted she was proud and happy the meeting ended soon after thatand elizabeth sped off to the san to find joan joan was sitting up in a chair reading halo she said what

minute and elizabeth ran to see if joan was ready she had been kept in bed to breakfast but was to get up afterwards and allowed to go in her mothers car she was tremendously excited its the first
