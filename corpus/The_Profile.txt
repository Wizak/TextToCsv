 the profile by willa sibert cather taken from mcclures magazine volume mayoctober the subject of discussion at the impressionists club was a picture circes swine by a young german painter a grotesque study showing the enchantress among a herd of bestial things variously diverging from the human type furryeared fauns shaggyhipped satyrs apes with pink palms snuffing jackals and thickjowled swine all with more or less of agonized human intelligence protesting mutely from their hideous lineaments they are all errors these freakish excesses declared an old painter of the second empire triboulet quasimodo gwynplaine have no proper place in art such art belongs to the huns and iroquois who could only be stirred by laceration and dismemberment the only effects of horror properly within the province of the artist are psychological everything else is a mere matter of the abattoir the body as nature has evolved it is sanctified by her purpose in any natural function or attitude decent and comely but lop away so much as a finger and you have wounded the creature beyond reparation once launched upon this subject there was no stopping the old lion and several of his confrйres were relieved when aaron dunlap quietly rose and left the room they felt that this was a subject which might well be distasteful to him i dunlap was a portrait painter preferably a painter of women he had the faculty of transferring personalities to his canvas rather than of putting conceptions there he was finely sensitive to the merest prettiness was tender and indulgent of it careful never to deflower a pretty woman of her little charm however commonplace nicer critics always discerned even in his most radiant portraits a certain quiet element of sympathy almost of pity in the treatment the sharp flexible profile of madame r of the franзaise the worn but subtle and allcapricious physiognomy of her great semitic rival the plump contours of a shopkeepers pretty wife dunlap treated them with equal respect and fidelity he accepted each as she was and could touch even obvious prettiness with dignity behind the delicate pleasure manifested in his treatment of a beautiful face one could divine the sadness of knowledge and one felt that the painter had yearned to arrest what was so fleeting and to hold it back from the cruelty of the years at an exhibition of dunlaps pictures the old painter of the second empire had said with a sigh that he ought to get together all his portraits of young women and call them les fianйes so abloom were they with the confidence of their beautiful secret then with that sensitiveness to style which comes from a long and passionate study of form the old painter had added reflectively and after all how sad a thing it is to be young dunlap had come from a country where women are hardly used he had grown up on a farm in the remote mountains of west virginia and his mother had died of pneumonia contracted from taking her place at the washtub too soon after the birth of a child when a boy he had been apprenticed to his grandfather a country cobbler who in his drunken rages used to beat his wife with odd strips of shoeleather the painters hands still bore the mark of that apprenticeship and the suffering of the mountain women he had seen about him in his childhood had left him almost morbidly sensitive just how or why dunlap had come to paris none of his fellowpainters had ever learned when he ran away from his grandfather he had been sent by a missionary fund to some sectarian college in his own state after which he had taught a country school for three winters and saved money enough for his passage he arrived in paris with something less than a hundred dollars wholly ignorant of the language without friends and apparently without especial qualifications for study there perhaps the real reason that he never succumbed to want was that he was never afraid of it he felt that he could never be really hungry so long as the poplars flickered along the gray quay behind the louvre never friendless while the gay busses rolled home across the bridges through the violet twilight and the barge lights winked above the water little by little his stripes were healed his agony of ignorance was alleviated the city herself taught him whatever was needful for him to know she repeated with him that fanciful romance which she has played at with youth for centuries in which her spontaneity is ever young she gave him of her best quickened in him a sense of the more slight and feminine fairness in things trained his hand and eye to the subtleties of the thousand types of subtle beauty in which she abounds made him after a delicate and chivalrous fashion the expiator of his mountain race he lived in a bright atmosphere of clear vision and happy associations delighted at having to do with what was fair and exquisitely brief life went on so during the first ten years of his residence in paris a happiness which despite its almost timorous modesty tempted fate it was after dunlaps name had become somewhat the fashion that he chanced one day in a cafй on the boulevard st michel to be of some service to an american who was having trouble about his order after assisting him dunlap had some conversation with the man a californian whose wheatlands comprised acres enough for a principality and whose enthusiasm was as fresh as a boys several days later at the luxembourg he met him again standing in a state of abject bewilderment before manets olympe dunlap again came to his rescue and took him off to lunch after which they went to the painters studio the acquaintance warmed on both sides and before they separated dunlap was engaged to paint the old gentlemans daughter agreeing that the sittings should be at the house on the boulevard de courcelles which the family had taken for the winter when dunlap called at the house he went through one of the most excruciating experiences of his life he found mrs gilbert and her daughter waiting to receive him the shock of the introduction over the strain of desultory conversation began the only thing that made conversation tolerable though it added a new element of perplexity was the girls seeming unconsciousness her utter openness and unabashedness she laughed and spoke almost with coquetry of the honor of sitting to him of having heard that he was fastidious as to his subjects dunlap felt that he wanted to rush from the house and escape the situation which confronted him the conviction kept recurring that it had just happened had come upon her since last she had passed a mirror that she would suddenly become conscious of it and be suffocated with shame he felt as if some one ought to tell her and lead her away shall we get to work she asked presently apparently curious and eager to begin how do you wish me to sit to you dunlap murmured something about usually asking his sitters to decide that for themselves suppose we try a profile then she suggested carelessly sitting down in a carved wooden chair for the first time since he had entered the room dunlap felt the pressure about his throat relax for the first time it was entirely turned from him and he could not see it at all what he did see was a girlish profile unusually firm for a thing so softly colored oval flowertinted and shadowed by soft blonde hair that wound about her head and curled and clung about her brow and neck and ears dunlap began setting up his easel recovering from his first discomfort and grateful to the girl for having solved his difficulty so gracefully but no sooner was it turned from him than he felt a strong desire to see it again perhaps it had been only a delusion after all the clear profile before him so absolutely contradicted it he went behind her chair to experiment with the windowshades and there as he drew them up and down he could look unseen he gazed long and hard to blunt his curiosity once and for all and prevent a further temptation to covert glances it had evidently been caused by a deep burn as if from a splash of molten metal it drew the left eye and the corner of the mouth made of her smile a grinning distortion like the shameful conception of some despairing medieval imagination it was as if some grotesque mask worn for disport were just slipping sidewise from her face when dunlap crossed to the right again he found the same clear profile awaiting him the same curves of twining silken hair what courage he thought what magnificent courage his heart ached at the injustice of it that her very beauty the alert girlish figure the firm smooth throat and chin even her delicate hands should through an inch or two of seared flesh seem tainted and false he felt that in a plain woman it would have been so much less horrible dunlap left the house overcast by a haunting sense of tragedy and for the rest of the day he was a prey to distressing memories all that he had tried to forget seemed no longer dim and faraway like the cruelties of vanished civilizations but present and painfully near he thought of his mother and grandmother of his little sister who had died from the bite of a copperhead snake as if they were creatures yet unreleased from suffering ii from the first virginias interest in the portrait never wavered yet as the sittings progressed it became evident to dunlap that her enthusiasm for the picture was but accessory to her interest in him by her every look and action she asserted her feeling as a woman young and handsome and independent may sometimes do as time went on he was drawn to her by what had once repelled him her courageous candor appealed to his chivalry and he came to love her not despite the scar but in a manner for its very sake he had some indefinite feeling that love might heal her that in time her hurt might disappear like the deformities imposed by enchantment to test the hardihood of lovers he gathered from her attitude as well as from that of her family that the thing had never been mentioned to her never alluded to by word or look both her father and mother had made it their first care to shield her had she ever in the streets of some foreign city heard a brutal allusion to it he shuddered to think of such a possibility was she not living for the moment when she could throw down the mask and point to it and weep to be comforted for all time he looked forward to the hour when there would be no lie of unconsciousness between them the moment must come when she would give him her confidence perhaps it would be only a whisper a gesture a guiding of his hand in the dark but however it might come it was the pledge he awaited during the last few weeks before his marriage the scar through the mere strength of his anticipation had ceased to exist for him he had already entered to the perfect creature which he felt must dwell behind it the soul of tragic serenity and twofold loveliness they went to the south for their honeymoon through the midi and along the coast into italy never by word or sign did virginia reveal any consciousness of what he felt must be said once and only once between them she was spirited adventurous impassioned she exacted much but she gavemagnificently her interests in the material world were absorbing and she demanded continual excitement and continual novelty granted these her good spirits were unfailing it was during their wedding journey that he discovered her two allabsorbing interests which were to become intensified as years went on her passion for dress and her feverish admiration of physical beauty whether in men or women or children this touched dunlap deeply as it seemed in a manner an admission of a thing she could not speak before their return to paris dunlap had for the time quite renounced his hope of completely winning her confidence he tried to believe his exclusion just he told himself that it was only a part of her splendid selfrespect he thought of how from her very childhood she had been fashioning day by day that armor of unconsciousness in which she sheathed her scar after all so deep a hurt could perhaps be bared to any one rather than the man she loved yet he felt that their life was enmeshed in falsehood that he could not live year after year with a woman who shut so deep a part of her nature from him that since he had married a woman outwardly different from others he must have that within her which other women did not possess until this was granted him he felt there would be a sacredness lacking in their relation which it peculiarly ought to have he counted upon the birth of her child to bring this about it would touch deeper than he could hope to do and with fingers that could not wound that would be a tenderness more penetrating more softening than passion without pride or caprice a feeling that would dwell most in the one part of her he had failed to reach the child certainly she could not shut out whatever hardness or defiant shame it was that held him away from her her maternity would bring enlightenment would bring that sad wisdom that admission of the necessity and destiny to suffer which is somehow so essential in a woman virginias child was a girl a sickly baby which cried miserably from the day it was born the listless wailing almost unwilling battle for life that daily went on before his eyes saddened dunlap profoundly all his painters sophistries fell away from him and more than ever his early destiny seemed closing about him there was then no escaping from the cruelty of physical things no matter how high and bright the sunshine how gray and poplarclad the ways of ones life the more willing the child seemed to relinquish its feeble hold the more tenderly he loved it and the more determinedly he fought to save it virginia on the contrary had almost from the first exhibited a marked indifference toward her daughter she showed plainly that the sight of its wan aged little face was unpleasant to her she disliked being clutched by its skeleton fingers and said its wailing made her head ache she was always taking madame de montebello and her handsome children to drive in the bois but she was never to be seen with little eleanor if her friends asked to see the child she usually put them off saying that she was asleep or in her bath when dunlap once impatiently asked her whether she never intended to permit any one to see her daughter she replied coldly certainly when she has filled out and begins to look like something little eleanor grew into a shy awkward child who slipped about the house like an unwelcome dependent she was four years old when a cousin of virginias came from california to spend a winter in paris virginia had known her only slightly at home but as she proved to be a charming girl and as she was illequipped to bear the hardships of a winter in a pension the dunlaps insisted upon her staying with them the cousins name was also eleanor she had been called so after virginias mother and from the first the two eleanors seemed drawn to each other miss vane was studying and went out to her lectures every day but whenever she was at home little eleanor was with her the child would sit quietly in her room while she wrote playing with anything her cousin happened to give her or would lie for hours on the hearth rug whispering to her woolly dog dunlap felt a weight lifted from his mind whenever eleanor was at home he knew that the child was happy he had long ceased to expect any solicitude for her from virginia that had gone with everything else it was one of so many disappointments that he took it rather as a matter of course and it seldom occurred to him that it might have been otherwise for two years he had been living like a man who knows that some reptile has housed itself and hatched its young in his cellar and who never cautiously puts his foot out of his bed without the dread of touching its coils the change in his feeling toward his wife kept him in perpetual apprehension it seemed to threaten everything he held dear even his selfrespect his life was a continual effort of selfcontrol and he found it necessary to make frequent trips to london or sketching tours into brittany to escape from the strain of the repression he put upon himself under this state of things dunlap aged perceptibly and his friends made various and usual conjectures whether virginia was conscious of the change in him he never knew her feeling for him had in its very nature been as temporary as it was violent it had abated naturally and she probably took for granted that the same readjustment had taken place in him perhaps she was too much engrossed in other things to notice it at all in dunlap the change seemed never to be finally established but forever painfully working whereas he had once seen the scar on his wifes face not at all he now saw it continually inch by inch it had crept over her whole countenance yet the scar itself seemed now a trivial thing he had known for a long time that the burn had gone deeper than the flesh virginias extravagant fondness for gaiety seemed to increase and her mania for lavish display doubtless common enough in the californian wheat empire was a discordant note in paris dunlap found himself condemned to an existence which daily did violence to his sense of propriety his wife gave fкtes the cost of which was noised abroad by the associated press and flaunted in american newspapers her vanity the pageantries of her toilet made them both ridiculous he felt she was a woman now with a husband and child she had no longer a pretext for keeping up the pitiful bravado under which she had hidden the smarting pride of her girlhood he became more and more convinced that she had been shielded from a realization of her disfigurement only to the end of a shocking perversity her costumes her very jewels blazed defiance her confidence became almost insolent and her laugh was nothing but a frantic denial of a thing so cruelly obvious the unconsciousness he had once reverenced now continually tempted his brutality and when he felt himself reduced to the point of actual vituperation he fled to normandy or languedoc to save himself he had begun indeed to feel strangely out of place in paris the ancient comfort of the city never lacking in the days when he had known cold and hunger failed him now a certain sordidness had spread itself over ways and places once singularly perfect and pure iii one evening when virginia refused to allow little eleanor to go down to the musicroom to see some pantomime performers who were to entertain their guests dunlap to conceal his displeasure stepped quickly out upon the balcony and closed the window behind him he stood for some moments in the cold clear night air god help me he groaned someday i shall tell her i shall hold her and tell her when he entered the house again it was by another window and his anger had cooled as he stepped into the hallway he met eleanor the elder going upstairs with the little girl in her arms for the life of him he could not refrain from appealing for sympathy to her kind grave eyes he was so hurt so sick that he could have put his face down beside the childs and wept give her to me little cousin she is too heavy for you he said gently as they went upstairs together he remembered with resentment his wifes perfectly candid and careless jests about his fondness for her cousin after he had put the little girl down in eleanors room as they leaned together above the childs head in the firelight he became for the first time really aware a sudden tenderness weakened him he put out his hand and took hers which was holding the childs and murmured thank you thank you little cousin she started violently and caught her hand away from him trembling all over dunlap left the room thrice more miserable than he had entered it after that evening he noticed that eleanor avoided meeting him alone virginia also noticed it but upon this point she was consistently silent one morning as dunlap was leaving his wifes dressingroom having been to consult her as to whether she intended going to the ball at the russian embassy she called him back she was carefully arranging her beautiful hair which she always dressed herself and said carelessly without looking up at him eleanor has a foolish notion of returning home in march i wish you would speak to her about it her family expect her to stay until june and her going now would be commented upon i scarcely see how i can interfere he replied coolly she doubtless has her reasons her reasons are not far to seek i should say remarked virginia carefully slipping the pins into the yellow coils of her hair she is pathetically ingenuous about it i should think you might improve upon the present state of affairs if you were to treat it well say a trifle more lightly that would put her more at ease at least what nonsense virginia he exclaimed laughing unnaturally and closing the door behind him with guarded gentleness that evening dunlap joined his wife in her dressingroom his coat on his arm and his hat in his hand the maid had gone upstairs to hunt for virginias last years fur shoes as the pair warming before the grate would not fit over her new dancing slippers virginia was standing before the mirror carefully surveying the effect of a new gown which struck her husband as more than usually conspicuous and defiant he watched her arranging a pinkandgold butterfly in her hair and held his peace but when she put on a pink chiffon collar with a flaring bow which came directly under her left cheek in spite of himself he shuddered for heavens sake virginia take that thing off he cried you ought really to be more careful about such extremes they only emphasize the scar he was frightened at the brittleness of his own voice it seemed to whistle dryly in the air like his grandfathers thong she caught her breath and wheeled suddenly about her face crimson and then gray she opened her lips twice but no sound escaped them he saw the muscles of her throat stiffen and she began to shudder convulsively like one who has been plunged into icy water he started toward her sick with pity at last perhaps but she pointed him steadily to the door her eyes as hard as shell and bright and small like the sleepless eyes of reptiles he went to bed with the sick feeling of a man who has tortured an animal yet with a certain sense of relief and finality which he had not known in years when he came down to breakfast in the morning the butler told him that madame and her maid had left for nice by the early train mademoiselle vane had gone out to her lectures madame requested that monsieur take mademoiselle to the opera in the evening where the widowed sister of madame de montebello would join them she would come home with them to remain until madames return dunlap accepted these instructions as a matter of course and announced that he would not dine at home when he entered the hall upon his return that evening he heard little eleanor sobbing and she flew to meet him with her dress burned and her hands black dunlap smelled the sickening odor of ointments the nurse followed with explanations the doctor was upstairs mademoiselle vane always used a little alcohol lamp in making her toilet tonight when she touched a match to it it exploded little eleanor was leaning against her dressingtable at the time and her dress caught fire mademoiselle vane had wrapped the rug about her and extinguished it when the nurse arrived mademoiselle vane was standing in the middle of the floor plucking at her scorched hair her face and arms badly burned she had bent over the lamp in lighting it and had received the full force of the explosion in her face the doctor was unable to discover what the explosive had been as it was entirely consumed mademoiselle always filled the little lamp herself all the servants knew about it for madame had sent the nurse to borrow it on several occasions when little eleanor had the earache the next morning dunlap received a telegram from his wife stating that she would go to st petersburg for the remainder of the winter in may he heard that she had sailed for america and a year later her attorneys wrote that she had begun action for divorce immediately after the decree was granted dunlap married eleanor vane he never met or directly heard from virginia again though when she returned to russia and took up her residence in st petersburg the fame of her toilets spread even to paris society always prone to crude antitheses knew of dunlap only that he had painted many of the most beautiful women of his time that he had been twice married and that each of his wives had been disfigured by a scar on the face a free ebook from httpmanybooksnet
