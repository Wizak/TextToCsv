bungay suffolk for sable basilisk pursuivant and hilary bray who came to the aid of the party seascape with figures it was one of those septembers when it seemed that the summer would never end the fivemile promenade of royaleleseaux backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia alyssum and lobelia was bright with nags and on the longest beach in the north of france the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tideline in big moneymaking battalions music one of those lilting accordion waltzes blared from the loudspeakers around the olympicsize piscine and from time to time echoing above the music a mans voice announced over the public address system that philippe bertrand aged seven was looking for his mother that yolande lefevre was waiting for her friends below the dock at the entrance or that a madame dufours was demanded on the telephone from the beach particularly from the neighbourhood of the three playground enclosures joie de vivre helio and azur came a twitter of childrens cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and farther out on the firm sand left by the now distant sea the shrill whistle of the physicalfitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day it was one of those beautiful naive seaside panoramas for which the brittany and picardy beaches have provided the setting and inspired their recorders boudin tissot monet ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago to james bond sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun there was something poignant ephemeral about it all it reminded him almost too vividly of childhood of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on of the precious little pile of seashells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rockpools of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves always in those days it seemed lit with sunshine and then the infuriating inevitable time to come out it was all there his own childhood spread out before him to have another look at what a long time ago they were those spadeandbucket days how far he had come since the freckles and the cadbury milkchocolate flakes and the fizzy lemonade impatiently bond lit a cigarette pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their longclosed file today he was a grownup a man with years of dirty dangerous memories a spy he was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalizeabout a pack of scrubby smelly children on a beach scattered with bottletops and lollysticks and fringed by a sea thick with sunoil and putrid with the main drains of royale he was here he had chosen to be here to spy to spy on a woman the sun was getting lower already one could smell the september chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat the cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes the announcer at the swimmingpool harried his customers allo allo fermeture en dix minutes a dixhuit heures fermeture de la piscine silhouetted in the path of the setting sun the two bombard rescueboats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter upriver in the vieux port the last of the gay giraffelike sandyachts fled down the distant waterline towards its corral among the sand dunes and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the carparks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town in a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand the tide still receding was already a mile out would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would for a while be entirely deserted until under cover of darkness the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly grittily in the dark corners between the bathinghuts and the seawall on the beaten stretch of sand below where james bond was sitting two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of jokari which they had been so provocatively playing and raced each other up the steps towards bonds shelter they flaunted their bodies at him paused and chattered to see if he would respond and when he didnt linked arms and sauntered on towards the town leaving bondwondering why it was that french girls had more prominent navels than any others was it that french surgeons sought to add even in this minute respect to the future sexappeal of girl babies and now up and down the beach the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty the music from the piscine stopped in midtune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted but not quite a hundred yards out lying face downwards on a black and white striped bathingwrap on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before the girl was still there motionless spreadeagled in direct line between james bond and the setting sun that was now turning the leftbehind pools and shallow rivulets into bloodred meandering scrawls across the middle distance bond went on watching her now in the silence and emptiness with an ounce more tension he was waiting for her to do something for something he didnt know what to happen it would be more true to say that he was watching over her he had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air he didnt know he only knew that he mustnt leave her alone particularly now that everyone else had gone james bond was mistaken not everyone else had gone behind him at the cafe de la plage on the other side of the promenade two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk they had halfempty cups of coffee in front of them and they didnt talk they sat and watched the blur on the frostedglass partition of the shelter that was james bonds head and shoulders they also watched but less intently the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl their stillness and their unseasonable clothes would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who in his turn might have been watching them but there was no such person except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of bad news and hoped they would soon be on their way when the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl she slowly got to her feet ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly purposefully towards the sun and the faraway froth of the waterline over a mile away it would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday her last bathe james bond thought otherwise he left his shelter ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace behind him across the promenade the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise one of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and walking strictly in step crossed the promenade to the sand and with a kind of urgent military precision marched rapidly side by side in bonds tracks now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty bloodstreaked sand was eerily conspicuous yet it was surely not one to be interfered with the pattern had a nasty a secret smell the white girl the bareheaded young man the two squat marching pursuers it had something of a kind of deadly grandmothers steps about it in the cafe the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun it smelt like police business or the other thing he would keep it to himself but remember it he might get his name in the papers james bond was rapidly catching up with the girl now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline he began to wonder what he would say to her how he would put it he couldnt say i had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so i came after you to stop you i was going for a walk on the beach and i thought i recognized you will you have a drink after your swim would be childish he finally decided to say oh tracy and then when she turned round i was worried about you which would at least be inoffensive and for the matter of that true the sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon a small westerly offshore breeze drawing the hot landair out to sea had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girls approach and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless laplap of the small waves the soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of la reine de la cфte opale as royaleleseaux had splendidly christened herself bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights he watched the lithe golden figure in the white onepiece bathingsuit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the waterline and her head with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders was slightly bowed in thought perhaps or tiredness bond quickened his step until he was only ten paces behind her hey tracy the girl didnt start or turn quickly round her steps faltered and stopped and then as a small wave creamed in and died at her feet she turned slowly and stood squarely facing him her eyes puffed and wet with tears looked past him then they met his she said dully what is it what do you want i was worried about you what are you doing out here whats the matter the girl looked past him again her clenched right hand went up to her mouth she said something something bond couldnt understand from behind it then a voice from very close behind bond said softly silkily dont move or you get it back of the knee bond swirled round into a crouch his gun hand inside his coat the steady silver eyes of the two automatics sneered at him bond slowly straightened himself he dropped his hand to his side and the held breath came out between his teeth in a quiet hiss the two deadpan professional faces told him even more than the two silver eyes of the guns they held no tension no excitement the thin halfsmiles were relaxed contented the eyes were not even wary they were almost bored bond had looked into such faces many times before this was routine these men were killers prokillers bond had no idea who these men were who they worked for what this was all about on the theory that worry is a dividend paid to disaster before it is due he consciously relaxed his muscles and emptied his mind of questions he stood and waited position your hands behind your neck the silky patient voice was from the south from the mediterranean it fitted with the mens faces toughskinned widely pored yellowbrown marseillais perhaps or italian the mafia the faces belonged to good secret police or tough crooks bonds mind ticked and whirred selecting cards like an ibm machine what enemies had he got in those areas might it be blofeld had the hare turned upon the hound when the odds are hopeless when all seems to be lost then is the time to be calm to make a show of authority at least of indifference bond smiled into the eyes of the man who had spoken i dont think your mother would like to know what you are doing this evening you are a catholic so i will do as you ask the mans eyes glittered touche bond clasped his hands behind his head the man stood aside so as to have a clear field of fire while his number two removed bonds walther ppk from the soft leather holster inside his trouser belt and ran expert hands down his sides down his arms to the wrists and down the inside of his thighs then number two stood back pocketed the walther and again took out his own gun bond glanced over his shoulder the girl had said nothing expressed neither surprise nor alarm now she was standing with her back to the group looking out to sea apparently relaxed unconcerned what in gods name was it all about had she been used as a bait but for whom and now what was he to be executed his body left lying to be rolled back inshore by the tide it seemed the only solution if it was a question of some kind of a deal the four of them could not just walk back across the mile of sand to the town and say polite goodbyes on the promenade steps no this was the terminal point or was it from the north through the deep indigo dusk came the fast rattling hum of an outboard and as bond watched the cream of a thick bowwave showed and then the blunt outline of one of the bombard rescuecraft the flatbottomed inflatable rubber boats with a single johnson engine in the flattened stern so they had been spotted by the coastguards perhaps and here was rescue by god hed roast these two thugs when they got to the harbour police at the vieux port but what story would he tell about the girl bond turned back to face the men at once he knew the worst they had rolled their trousers up to the knees and were waiting composedly their shoes in one hand and their guns in the other this was no rescue it was just part of the ride oh well paying no attention to the men bond bent down rolled up his trousers as they had done and in the process of fumbling with his socks and shoes palmed one of his heel knives and hah turning towards the boat that had now grounded in the shallows transferred it to his righthand trouser pocket no words were exchanged the girl climbed aboard first then bond and lastly the two men who helped the engine with a final shove on the stern the boatman who looked like any other french deepsea fisherman whirled the blunt nose of the bombard round changed gears to forward and they were off northwards through the buffeting waves while the golden hair of the girl streamed back and softly whipped james bonds cheek tracy youre going to catch cold here take my coat bond slipped his coat off she held out a hand to help him put it on her in the process her hand found his and pressed it now what the hell bond edged closer to her he felt her body respond bond glanced at the two men they sat hunched against the wind their hands in their pockets watchful but somehow uninterested behind them the necklace of lights that was royale receded swiftly until it was only a golden glow on the horizon james bonds right hand felt for the comforting knife in his pocket and ran his thumb across the razorsharp blade while he wondered how and when he might have a chance to use it the rest of his mind ran back over the previous twentyfour hours and panned them for the golddust of truth gran turismo almost exactly twentyfour hours before james bond had been nursing his car the old continental bentley the r type chassis with the big engine and a backaxle ratio that he had now been driving for three years along that fast but dull stretch of n between abbeville and montreuil that takes the english tourist back to his country via silver city airways from le touquet or by ferry from boulogne or calais he was hurrying safely at between eighty and ninety driving by the automatic pilot that is built in to all rallyclass drivers and his mind was totally occupied with drafting his letter of resignation from the secret service the letter addressed personal for m had got to the following stage sir i have the honour to request that you will accept my resignation from the service effective forthwith my reasons for this submission which i put forward with much regret are the following my duties in the service until some twelve months ago have been connected with the doubleo section and you sir have been kind enough from time to time to express your satisfaction with my performance of those duties which i for my part have enjoyed to my chagrin however on the successful completion of operation thunderball i received personal instructions from you to concentrate all my efforts without a terminal date on the pursuit of ernst stavro blofeld and on his apprehension together with any members of spectre otherwise the special executive for counterintelligence revenge and extortion if that organization had been recreated since its destruction at the climax of operation thunderball i accepted the assignment with if you will recall reluctance it seemed to me and i so expressed myself at the time that this was purely an investigatory matter which could well have been handled using straightforward police methods by other sections of the service local stations allied foreign secret services and interpol my objections were overruled and for close on twelve months i have been engaged all over the world in routine detective work which in the case of every scrap of rumour every lead has proved abortive i have found no trace of this man nor of a revived spectre if such exists my many appeals to be relieved of this wearisome and fruitless assignment even when addressed to you personally sir have been ignored or on occasion curtly dismissed and my frequent animadversions to the effect that blofeld is dead have been treated with a courtesy that i can only describe as scant the above unhappy circumstances have recently achieved their climax in my undercover mission to palermo in pursuit of a hare of quite outrageous falsity this animal took the shape of one blauenfelder a perfectly respectable german citizen engaged in viniculture specifically the grafting of moselle grapes on to the sicilian strains to enhance the sugar content of the latter which for your passing information are inclined to sourness my investigations into this individual brought me to the attention of the mafia and my departure from sicily was to say the least ignominious having regard sir to the above and specifically to the continued misuse of the qualities modest though they may be that have previously fitted me for the more arduous and to me more rewarding duties associated with the work of the doubleo section i beg leave to submit my resignation from the service i am sir your obedient servant of course reflected bond as he nursed the long bonnet of his car through a builtup sbend he would have to rewrite a lot of it some of it was a bit pompous and there were one or two cracks that would have to be ironed out or toned down but that was the gist of what he would dictate to his secretary when he got back to the office the day after tomorrow and if she burst into tears to hell with her he meant it by god he did he was fed to the teeth with chasing the ghost of blofeld and the same went for spectre the thing had been smashed even a man of blofelds genius in the impossible event that he still existed could never get a machine of that calibre running again it was then on a tenmile straight cut through a forest that it happened triple windhorns screamed their banshee discord in his ear and a low white twoseater a lancia flaminia zagato spyder with its hood down tore past him cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away the sexy boom of its twin exhausts echoing back from the border of trees and it was a girl driving a girl with a shocking pink scarf tied round her hair leaving a brief pink tail that the wind blew horizontal behind her if there was one thing that set james bond really moving in life with the exception of gunplay it was being passed at speed by a pretty girl and it was his experience that girls who drove competitively like that were always pretty and exciting the shock of the windhorns scream had automatically cut out george emptied bonds head of all other thought and brought his car back under manual control now with a tightlipped smile he stamped his foot into the floorboard held the wheel firmly at a quarter to three and went after her and he still wasnt gaining bond reached forward to the dashboard and flicked up a red switch the thin high whine of machinery on the brink of torment tore at his eardrums and the bentley gave an almost perceptible kick forward he was definitely gaining yards now he could just see her eyes in her rear mirror but the good road was running out one of those exclamation marks that the french use to denote danger flashed by on his right and now over a rise there was a church spire the clustered houses of a small village at the bottom of a steepish hill the snake sign of another sbend both cars slowed down bond watched her taillights briefly blaze saw her right hand reach down to the floor stick almost simultaneously with his own and change down then they were in the sbend on cobbles and he had to brake as he enviously watched the way her de dion axle married her rear wheels to the rough going while his own live axle hopped and skittered as he wrenched at the wheel and then it was the end of the village and with a brief wag of her tail as she came out of the s she was off like a bat out of hell up the long straight rise and he had lost fifty yards and so the race went on bond gaining a little on the straights but losing it all to the famous lancia roadholding through the villages and he had to admit to her wonderful nerveless driving and now a big michelin sign said montreuil royaleleseaux le touquetparisplage and he wondered about her destination and debated with himself whether he shouldnt forget about royale and the night he had promised himself at its famous casino and just follow where she went wherever it was and find out who this devil of a girl was the decision was taken out of his hands montreuil is a dangerous town with cobbled twisting streets and much farm traffic bond was fifty yards behind her at the outskirts but with his big car he couldnt follow her fast slalom through the hazards and by the time he was out of the town and over the staplesparis levelcrossing she had vanished the lefthand turn for royale came up was there a little dust hanging in the bend bond took the turn somehow knowing that he was going to see her again he leaned forward and flicked down the red switch the moan of the blower died away and there was silence in the car as he motored along easing his tense muscles he wondered if the supercharger had damaged the engine against the solemn warnings of rollsroyce he had had fitted by his pet expert at the headquarters motor pool an arnott supercharger controlled by a magnetic clutch rollsroyce had said the crankshaft bearings wouldnt take the extra load and when he confessed to them what he had done they regretfully but firmly withdrew their guarantees and washed their hands of their bastardized child this was the first time he had notched and the rev counter had hovered dangerously over the red area at but the temperature and oil were ok and there were no expensive noises and by god it had been fun james bond idled through the pretty approaches to royale through the young beeches and the heavyscented pines looking forward to the evening and remembering his other annual pilgrimages to this place and particularly the great battle across the baize he had had with le chiffre so many years ago he had come a long way since then dodged many bullets and much death and loved many girls but there had been a drama and a poignancy about that particular adventure that every year drew him back to royale and its casino and to the small granite cross in the little churchyard that simply said vesper lynd rip and now what was the place holding for him on this beautiful september evening a big win a painful loss a beautiful girl that beautiful girl to think first of the game this was the weekend of the clфture annuelle tonight this very saturday night the casino royale was holding its last night of the season it was always a big event and there would be pilgrims even from belgium and holland as well as the rich regulars from paris and lille in addition the syndicat dlnitiative et des bains de mer de royale traditionally threw open its doors to all its local contractors and suppliers and there was free champagne and a great groaning buffet to reward the town people for their work during the season it was a tremendous carouse that rarely finished before breakfast time the tables would be packed and there would be a very high game indeed bond had one million francs of private capital old francs of course about seven hundred pounds worth he always reckoned his private funds in old francs it made him feel so rich on the other hand he made out his official expenses in new francs because that made them look smaller but probably not to the chief accountant at headquarters one million francs for that evening he was a millionaire alight he so remain by tomorrow morning and now he was coming into the promenade des anglais and there was the bastard empire frontage of the hotel splendide and there by god on the gravel sweep alongside its steps stood the little white lancia and at this moment a bagagiste in a striped waistcoat and green apron was carrying two vuitton suitcases up the steps to the entrance so james bond slid his car into the millionpound line of cars in the car park told the same bagagiste who was now taking rich small stuff out of the lancia to bring up his bags and went in to the receptiondesk the manager impressively took over from the clerk and greeted bond with goldentoothed effusion while making a mental note to earn a good mark with the chef de police by reporting bonds arrival so that the chef could in his turn make a good mark with the deuxieme and the sdt by putting the news on the teleprinter to paris bond said by the way monsieur maurice who is the lady who has just driven up in the white lancia she is staying here yes indeed mon commandant bond received an extra two teeth in the enthusiastic smile the lady is a good friend of the house the father is a very big industrial from the south she is la comtesse teresa di vicenzo monsieur must surely have read of her in the papers madame la comtesse is a lady how shall i put it the smile became secret between men a lady shall we say who lives life to the full ah yes thank you and how has the season been the small talk continued as the manager personally took bond up in the lift and showed him into one of the handsome grey and white directoire rooms with the deep rose coverlet on the bed that bond remembered so well then with a final exchange of courtesies james bond was alone bond was faintly disappointed she sounded a bit grand for him and he didnt happen to like girls film stars for instance who were in any way public property he liked private girls girls he could discover himself and make his own perhaps he admitted there was inverted snobbery in this perhaps even less worthily it was that the famous ones were less easy to get his two battered suitcases came and he unpacked leisurely and then ordered from room service a bottle of the taittinger blanc de blancs that he had made his traditional drink at royale when the bottle in its frosted silver bucket came he drank a quarter of it rather fast and then went into the bathroom and had an icecold shower and washed his hair with pinaud elixir that prince among shampoos to get the dust of the roads out of it then he slipped on his darkblue tropical worsted trousers white seaisland cotton shirt socks and black casual shoes and went and sat by the window and looked out across the promenade to the sea and wondered where he would have dinner and what he would choose to eat james bond was not a gourmet in england he lived on grilled soles oeufs cocotte and cold roast beef with potato salad but when travelling abroad generally by himself meals were a welcome break in the day something to look forward to something to break the tension of fast driving with its risks taken or avoided the narrow squeaks the permanent background of concern for the fitness of his machine in fact at this moment after covering the long stretch from the italian frontier at ventimiglia in a comfortable three days he was fed to the teeth with the suckertraps for gourmandizing tourists the hostelleries the vieilles auberges the relais fleuris he had had the lot he had had their bonnes tables and their fines bouteilles he had had their spйcialites du chef generally a rich sauce of cream and wine and a few button mushrooms concealing poor quality meat or fish he had had the whole lipsmacking ritual of winemanship and foodmanship and incidentally he had had quite enough of the bisodol that went with it the french bellyreligion had delivered its final kick at him the night before wishing to avoid orleans he had stopped south of this uninspiring city and had chosen a mockbreton auberge on the south bank of the loire despite its profusion of windowboxes and sham beams ignoring the china cat pursuing the china bird across its gabled roof because it was right on the edge of the loire perhaps bonds favourite river in the world he had stoically accepted the hammered copper wanning pans brass cooking utensils and other antique bogosities that cluttered the walls of the entrance hall had left his bag in his room and had gone for an agreeable walk along the softly running swallowskimmed river the diningroom in which he was one of a small handful of tourists had sounded the alarm above a fireplace of electric logs and overpolished fireirons there had hung a coloured plaster escutcheon bearing the dread device icy doulce france all the plates of some hideous local ware bore the jingle irritatingly inscrutable jamais en vain toujours en via and the surly waiter stale with fin de saison had served him with the flywalk of the pate maison and a poularde la creme that was the only genuine antique in the place bond had moodily washed down this sleazy provender with a bottle of instant pouillyfuisse and was finally insulted the next morning by a bill for the meal in excess of five pounds it was to efface all these dyspeptic memories that bond now sat at his window sipped his taittinger and weighed up the pros and cons of the local eating places and wondered what dishes it would be best to gamble on he finally chose one of his favourite restaurants in france a modest establishment unpromisingly placed exactly opposite the railway station of staples rang up his old friend monsieur becaud for a table and two hours later was motoring back to the casino with turbot poche sauce mousseline and half the best roast partridge he had eaten in his life under his belt greatly encouraged and further stimulated by half a bottle of mouton rothschild and a glass of tenyearold calvados with his three cups of coifee he went cheerfully up the thronged steps of the casino with the absolute certitude that this was going to be a night to remember the gambit of shame after the long walk across the salle dentree past the vitrines of van cleef lanvin hermes and the rest there came the brief pause for identification at the long desk backed by the tiers of filing cabinets the payment for the carte dentree pour les salles de jeux the quick comptometer survey of the physiognomiste at the entrance the bow and flourish of the garishly uniformed huissier at the door and james bond was inside the belly of the handsome scented machine he paused for a moment by the caisse his nostrils flaring at the smell of the crowded electric elegant scene then he walked slowly across to the top chemin de fer table beside the entrance to the luxuriously appointed bar and caught the eye of monsieur pol the chef de jeu of the high game monsieur pol spoke to a huissier and bond was shown to number seven reserved by a counter from the huissiers pocket the huissier gave a quick brush to the baize inside the line that famous line that had been the bone of contention in the tranby croft case involving king edward vii polished an ashtray and pulled out the chair for bond bond sat down the shoe was at the other end of the table at number three cheerful and relaxed bond examined the faces of the other players while the changeur changed his notes for a hundred thousand into ten bloodred counters of ten thousand each bond stacked them in a neat pile in front of him and watched the play which he saw from the notice hanging between the greenshaded lights over the table was for a minimum of one hundred new francs or ten thousand of the old but he noted that the game was being opened by each banker for up to five hundred new francs serious money say forty pounds as a starter the players were the usual international mixture three lille textile tycoons in overpadded dinnerjackets a couple of heavy women in diamonds who might be belgian a rather agatha christiestyle little englishwoman who played quietly and successfully and might be a villa owner two middleaged americans in dark suits who appeared cheerful and slightly drunk probably down from paris and bond watchers and casual punters were twodeep round the table no girl the game was cold the shoe went slowly round the table each banker in turn going down on that dread third coup which for some reason is the sound barrier at chemin de fer which must be broken if you are to have a run each time when it came to bonds turn he debated whether to bow to the pattern and pass his bank after the second coup each time for nearly an hour of play he obstinately told himself that the pattern would break and why not with him that the cards have no memory and that it was time for them to run and each time as did the other players he went down on the third coup the shoe came to an end bond left his money on the table and wandered off among the other tables visiting the roulette the trente et quarante and the baccarat table to see if he could find the girl when she had passed him that evening in the lancia he had only caught a glimpse of fair hair and of a pure rather authoritative profile but he knew that he would recognize her at once if only by the cord of animal magnetism that had bound them together during the race but there was no sign of her bond went back to the table the croupier was marshalling the six packs into the oblong block that would soon be slipped into the waiting shoe since bond was beside him the croupier offered him the neutral plain red card to cut the pack with bond rubbed the card between his fingers and with amused deliberation slipped it as nearly halfway down the block of cards as he could estimate the croupier smiled at him and at his deliberation went through the legerdemain that would in due course bring the red stop card into the tongue of the shoe and stop the game just seven cards before the end of the shoe packed the long block of cards into the shoe slid in the metal tongue that held them prisoner and announced loud and clear messieurs les jeux sont fails numero six a la main the chef de jeu on his throne behind the croupier took up the cry the huissiers shepherded distant stragglers back to their places and the game began again james bond confidently bancoed the lille tycoon on his left won made up the cagnotte with a few small counters and doubled the stake to two thousand new francs two hundred thousand of the old he won that and the next now for the hurdle of the third coup and he was off to the races he won it with a natural nine eight hundred thousand in the bank again he won with difficulty this time his six against a five then he decided to play it safe and pile up some capital of the one million six he asked for the six hundred to be put en garage removed from the stake leaving a bank of one million again he won now he put a million en garage once more a bank of a million and now he would have a fat cushion of one million six coming to him anyway but it was getting difficult to make up his stake the table was becoming wary of this dark englishman who played so quietly wary of the halfsmile of certitude on his rather cruel mouth who was he where did he come from what did he do there was a murmur of excited speculation round the table so far a run of six would the englishman pocket his small fortune and pass the bank or would he continue to run it surely the cards must change but james bonds mind was made up the cards have no memory in defeat they also have no memory in victory he ran the bank three more times adding each time a million to his garage and then the little old english lady who had so far left the running to the others stepped in and bancoed him at the tenth turn and bond smiled across at her knowing that she was going to win and she did ignominiously with a one against bonds buche three kings making zero there was a sigh of relief round the table the spell had been broken and a whisper of envy as the heavy motherofpearl plaques piled nearly a foot high four million six hundred thousand francs worth well over three thousand pounds were shunted across to bond with the flat of the croupiers spatula bond tossed a plaque for a hundred new francs to the croupier received the traditional merci monsieur pour le personnel and the game went on james bond lit a cigarette and paid little attention as the shoe went shunting round the table away from him he had made a packet dammit a bloody packet now he must be careful sit on it but not too careful not sit on all of it this was a glorious evening it was barely past midnight he didnt want to go home yet so be it he would run his bank when it came to him but do no bancoing of the others absolutely none the cards had got hot his run had shown that there would be other runs now and he could easily burn his fingers chasing them bond was right when the shoe got to number five to one of the lille tycoons two places to the left of bond an illmannered loudmouthed player who smoked a cigar out of an amberandgold holder and who tore at the cards with heavily manicured sparulate fingers and slapped them down like a german tarot player he quickly got through the third coup and was off bond in accordance with his plan left him severely alone and now at the sixth coup the bank stood at twenty thousand new francs twenty million of the old and the table had got wary again everyone was sitting on his money the croupier and the chef de jeu made their loud calls un banco de vingt mille faites vos jeux messieurs ii reste a completed un banco de vingt mille and then there she was she had come from nowhere and was standing beside the croupier and bond had no time to take in more than golden arms a beautiful golden face with brilliant blue eyes and shocking pink lips some kind of a plain white dress a bell of golden hair down to her shoulders and then it came banco everyone looked at her and there was a moments silence and then le banco est fait from the croupier and the monster from lille was tearing the cards out of the shoe and hers were on their way over to her on the croupiers spatula she bent down and there was a moment of discreet cleavage in the white v of her neckline une carte bonds heart sank she certainly hadnt anything better than a five the monster turned his up seven and now he scrabbled out a card for her and flicked it contemptuously across a simpering queen the croupier delicately faced her other two cards with the tip of his spatula a four she had lost bond groaned inwardly and looked across to see how she had taken it what he saw was not reassuring the girl was whispering urgently to the chef de jeu he was shaking his head sweat was beading on his cheeks in the silence that had fallen round the table the silence that licks its lips at the strong smell of scandal which was now electric in the air bond heard the chef de jeu say firmly mais cest impossible je regrette madame ii faut vous arranger a la caisse and now that most awful of all whispers in a casino was running among the watchers and the players like a slithering reptile le coup du deshonneur cest le coup du dfehonneur quelle honte quelle honte oh my god thought bond shes done it she hasnt got the money and for some reason she cant get any credit at the caisse the monster from lille was making the most of the situation he knew that the casino would pay in the case of a default he sat back with lowered eyes puffing at his cigar the injured party but bond knew of the stigma the girl would carry for the rest of her life the casinos of france are a strong trade union they have to be tomorrow the telegrams would go out madame la contesse teresa di vicenzo passport number x is to be put on the black list that would be the end of her casino life in france in italy probably also in germany egypt and today england it was like being declared a bad risk at lloyds or with the city security firm of dun and bradstreet in american gambling circles she might even have been liquidated in europe for her the fate would be almost as severe in the circles in which presumably she moved she would be bad news unclean the coup du ddshonneur simply wasnt done it was social ostracism not caring about the social ostracism thinking only about the wonderful girl who had outdriven him shown him her tail between abbeville and montreuil james bond leant slightly forward he tossed two of the precious pearly plaques into the centre of the table he said with a slightly bored slightly puzzled intonation forgive me madame has forgotten that we agreed to play in partnership this evening and not looking at the girl but speaking with authority to the chef de jeu i beg your pardon my mind was elsewhere let the game continue the tension round the table relaxed or rather it changed to another target away from the girl was it true what this englishman had said but it must be one does not pay twenty million francs for a girl but previously there had been no relationship between them so far as one could see they had been at opposite sides of the table no signs of complicity had been exchanged and the girl she had shown no emotion she had looked at the man once with directness then she had quietly moved away from the table towards the bar there was certainly something odd here something one did not understand but the game was proceeding the chef de jeu had surreptitiously wiped a handkerchief across his face the croupier had raised his head which previously had seemed to be bowed under some kind of emotional guillotine and now the old pattern had reestablished itself la partie continue un banco de quarante mule james bond glanced down at the still formidable pile of counters between his curved relaxed arms it would be nice to get that twenty million francs back it might be hours before a banco of equal size offered the chance after all he was playing with the casinos money his profits represented found money and if he lost he could still go away with a small profit enough and to spare to pay for his night at royale and he had taken a dislike to the monster from lille it would be amusing to reverse the old fable first to rescue the girl then to slay the monster and it was time for the mans run of luck to end after all the cards have no memory james bond had not enough funds to take the whole banco only half of it what is known as avec la table meaning that the other players could make up the remaining half if they wanted to bond forgetting the conservative strategy he had sworn himself to only half an hour before leant slightly forward and said avec la table and pushed twenty thousand new francs over the line money followed his on to the table was this not the englishman with the green fingers and bond was pleased to note that the little old agatha christie englishwoman supported him with ten thousand that was a good omen he looked at the banker the man from lille his cigar had gone out in its holder and his lips where they gripped the holder were white he was sweating profusely he was debating whether to pass the hand and take his fat profits or have one more go the sharp piglike eyes darted round the table estimating if his four million was covered the croupier wanted to hurry the play he said firmly cest plus que fait monsieur the man from lille made up his mind he gave the shoe a fat slap wiped his hand on the baize and forced out a card then one for himself another for bond the fourth for him bond did not reach across number six for the cards he waited for them to be nudged towards him by the croupier he raised them just off the table slid them far enough apart between his hands to see the count edged them together again and laid them softly face down again on the table he had a five that dubious jade on which one can either draw or not the chances of improving your hand towards or away from a nine are equal he said non quietly and looked across at the two anonymous pink backs of the cards in front of the banker the man tore them up disgustedly tossed them out on to the table two knaves a buche zero now there were only four cards that could beat bond and only one the five that could equal him bonds heart thumped the man scrabbled at the shoe snatched out the card faced it a nine the nine of diamonds the curse of scotland the best it was a mere formality to turn over and reveal bonds miserable five but there was a groan round the tablell fallait tirer said someone but if he had bond would have drawn the nine and disimproved down to a four it all depended on what the next card its pink tongue now hiding its secret in the mouth of the shoe might have been bond didnt wait to see he smiled a thin rueful smile round the table to apologize to his fellow losers shovelled the rest of his chips into his coat pocket tipped the huissier who had been so busy emptying his ashtray over the hours of play and slipped away from the table towards the bar while the croupier triumphantly announced un banco de quatrevingt mille francs faites vos jeux messieurs un banco de quatrevingt mille nouveaux francs to hell with it thought bond half an hour before he had had a small fortune in his pocket now through a mixture of romantic quixotry and sheer folly he had lost it all well he shrugged he had asked for a night to remember that was the first half of it what would be the second the girl was sitting by herself with half a bottle of bollinger in front of her staring moodily at nothing she barely looked up when bond slipped into the chair next to hers and said well im afraid our syndicate lost again i tried to get it back i went avec i should have left that brute alone i stood on a five and he had a buche and then drew a nine she said dully you should have drawn on the five i always do she reflected but then you would have had a four what was the next card i didnt wait to see i came to look for you she gave him a sideways appraising glance why did you rescue me when i made the coup du deshonneur bond shrugged beautiful girl in distress besides we made friends between abbeville and montreuil this evening you drive like an angel he smiled but i dont think youd have passed me if id been paying attention i was doing about ninety and not bothering to keep an eye on the mirror and i was thinking of other things the gambit succeeded vivacity came into her face and voice oh yes id have beaten you anyway id have passed you in the villages besides there was an edge of bitterness in her voice i would always be able to beat you you want to stay alive oh lord thought bond one of those a girl with a wing perhaps two wings down he chose to let the remark lie the halfbottle of krug he had ordered came after the huissier had half filled the glass bond topped it to the brim he held it towards her without exaggeration my name is bond james bond please stay alive at any rate for tonight he drank the glass down at one long gulp and filled it again she looked at him gravely considering him then she also drank she said my name is tracy that is short for all the names you were told at the reception in the hotel teresa was a saint i am not a saint the manager is perhaps a romantic he told me of your inquiries so shall we go now i am not interested in conversation and you have earned your reward she rose abruptly so did bond confused no i will go alone you can come later the number is there if you wish you can make the most expensive piece of love of your life it will have cost you forty million francs i hope it will be worth it all cats are grey she was waiting in the big double bed a single sheet pulled up to her chin the fair hair was spread out like golden wings under the single reading light that was the only light in the room and the blue eyes blazed with a fervour that in other girls in other beds james bond would have interpreted but this one was in the grip of stresses he could not even guess at he locked the door behind him and came over and sat on the edge of her bed and put one hand firmly on the little hill that was her left breast now listen tracy he began meaning to ask at least one or two questions find out something about this wonderful girl who did hysterical things like gambling without the money to meet her debts driving like a potential suicide hinting that she had had enough of life but the girl reached up a swift hand that smelt of guerlains ode and put it across his lips i said no conversation take off those clothes make love to me you are handsome and strong i want to remember what it can be like do anything you like and tell me what you like and what you would like from me be rough with me treat me like the lowest whore in creation forget everything else no questions take me an hour later james bond slipped out of bed without waking her dressed by the light of the promenade lights filtering between the curtains and went back to his room he showered and got in between the cool rough french sheets of his own bed and switched off his thinking about her all he remembered before sleep took him was that she had said when it was all over that was heaven james will you please come back when you wake up i must have it once more then she had turned over on her side away from him and without answering his last endearments had gone to sleep but not before he had heard that she was crying what the hell all cats are grey in the dark true or false bond slept at eight oclock he woke her and it was the same glorious thing again but this time he thought that she held him to her more tenderly kissed him not only with passion but with affection but after when they should have been making plans about the day about where to have lunch when to bathe she was at first evasive and then when he pressed her childishly abusive get to hell away from me do you hear youve had what you wanted now get out wasnt it what you wanted too no youre a lousy goddam lover get out bond recognized the edge of hysteria at least of desperation he dressed slowly waiting for the tears to come for the sheet that now covered her totally to shake with sobs but the tears didnt come that was bad in some way this girl had come to the end of her tether of too many tethers bond felt a wave of affection for her a sweeping urge to protect her to solve her problems make her happy with his hand on the doorknob he said softly tracy let me help you youve got some troubles thats not the end of the world so have i so has everyone else the dull cliches fell into the silent sunbarred room like clinker in a grate go to hell in the instant of opening and closing the door bond debated whether to bang it shut to shake her out of her mood or to close it softly he closed it softly harshness would do no good with this girl she had had it somehow somewhere too much of it he went off down the corridor feeling for the first time in his life totally inadequate normally breakfast was an important part of bonds day but today he had barely noticed what he was eating hurried through the meal and sat gazing out of his window and across the promenade chainsmoking and wondering about the girl he knew nothing positive about her not even her nationality the mediterranean was in her name yet she was surely neither italian nor spanish her english was faultless and her clothes and the way she wore them were the products of expensive surroundings perhaps a swiss finishing school she didnt smoke seemed to drink only sparingly and there was no sign of drugtaking there had not even been sleeping pills beside the bed or in her bathroom she could only be about twentyfive yet she made love with the fervour and expertness of a girl who in the american phrase had gone the route she hadnt laughed once had hardly smiled she seemed in the grip of some deep melancholy some form of spiritual accidie that made life on her own admission no longer worth living and yet there were none of those signs that one associates with the hysteria of female neurotics the unkempt hair and sloppy makeup the atmosphere of disarray and chaos they create around them on the contrary she seemed to possess an icecold will authority over herself and an exact idea of what she wanted and where she was going and where was that in bonds book she had desperate intentions most likely suicide and last night had been the last fling he looked down at the little white car that was now not far from his in the parking lot somehow he must stick close to her watch over her at least until he was satisfied that his deadly conclusions were wrong as a first step he rang down to the concierge and ordered a driveyourself simca aronde yes it should be delivered at once and left in the parking lot he would bring his international driving licence and green insurance card down to the concierge who would kindly complete the formalities bond shaved and dressed and took the papers down and returned to his room he stayed there watching the entrance and the little white car until in the afternoon then at last she appeared in the black and white striped bathingwrap and bond ran down the corridor to the lift it was not difficult to follow her as she drove along the promenade and left her car in one of the parking lots and it was also no problem for the little anonymous cv citroen that followed bond and then had been set up the train of the watchers and the watched which was now drawing to its mysterious climax as the little bombard thrashed its way up the river royale under the stars what to make of it all had she been a witting or unwitting bait was this a kidnapping if so of one or of both was it blackmail the revenge of a husband or another lover or was it to be murder bond was still raking his mind for clues when the helmsman turned the bombard in a wide curve across the current towards a battered skeletal jetty that projected from the muddy bank into the stream he pulled up under its lee a powerful flashlight shone down on them out of the darkness a rope clattered down and the boat was hauled to the foot of muddy wooden steps one of the thugs climbed out first followed by the girl the white bottom of her bathing dress lascivious below bonds coat then bond then the second thug then the bombard backed quickly away and continued up river presumably thought bond to its legitimate mooring in the vieux port there were two more men of much the same build as the others on the jetty no words were spoken as surrounded the girl and bond were escorted up the small dust road that led away from the jetty through the sand dunes a hundred yards from the river tucked away in a gully between tall dunes there was a glimmer of light when bond got nearer he saw that it came from one of those giant corrugated aluminium transporttrucks that behind an articulated drivers cabin roar down the arterial routes of france belching diesel smoke and hissing angrily with their hydraulic brakes as they snake through the towns and villages this one was a glinting polished affair it looked new but might just be well cared for as they approached the man with the flashlight gave some signal and an oblong of yellow light promptly blazed as the caravanlike door in the rear was thrown open bond fingered his knife were the odds in any way within reason they were not before he climbed up the steps into the interior he glanced down at the numberplate the commercial licence said marseillerhone m draco appareils fiectriques so one more riddle inside it was thank god warm a passageway led between stacked rows of cartons marked with the famous names of television manufacturers dummies there were also folded chairs and the signs of a disturbed game of cards this was presumably used as the guardroom then on both sides the doors of cabins tracy was waiting at one of the doors she held out his coat to him said an expressionless thank you and closed the door after bond had caught a brief glimpse of a luxurious interior bond took his time putting on his coat the single man with the gun who was following him said impatiently allez bond wondered whether to jump him but behind the other three men stood watching bond contented himself with a mild merde a vous and went ahead to the aluminium door that presumably sealed off the third and forward compartment in this strange vehicle behind this door lay the answer it was probably one man the leader this might be the only chance bonds right hand was already grasping the hilt of his knife in his trouser pocket now he put out his left hand and in one swirl of motion leaped through kicked the door shut behind him and crouched the knife held for throwing behind him he felt the guard throw himself at the door but bond had his back to it and it held the man ten feet away behind the desk within easy range for the knife called out something an order a cheerful gay order in some language bond had never heard the pressure on the door ceased the man smiled a wide a charming smile that cracked his creased walnut of a face in two he got to his feet and slowly raised his hands i surrender and i am now a much bigger target but do not kill me i beg of you at least not until we have had a stiff whisky and soda and a talk then i will give you the choice again ok bond rose to his full height he smiled back he couldnt help it the man had such a delightful face so lit with humour and mischief and magnetism that at least in the mans present role bond could no more have killed him than he could have killed well tracy there was a calendar hanging on the wall beside the man bond wanted to let off steam against something anything he said september the sixteenth and jerked his right hand forward hi the underhand throw the knife flashed across the room missed the man by about a yard and stuck quivering halfway down the page of the calendar the man turned and looked inquisitively at the calendar he laughed out loud actually the fifteenth but quite respectable i must set you against my men one of these days and i might even bet on you it would teach them a lesson he came out from behind his desk a smallish middleaged man with a brown crinkled face he was dressed in the sort of comfortable dark blue suit bond himself wore the chest and the arms bulged with muscle bond noticed the fullness of the cut of the coat under the armpits built for guns the man held out a hand it was warm and firm and dry marcange draco is my name you have heard of it no aha but i have heard of yours it is commander james bond you have a decoration called the cmg you are a member an important member of her majestys secret service you have been taken off your usual duties and you are on temporary assignment abroad the impish face creased with delightyes james bond to cover his confusion walked across to the calendar verified that he had in fact pierced the fifteenth pulled out the knife and slipped it back in his trouser pocket he turned and said what makes you think so the man didnt answer he said come come and sit down i have much to talk to you about but first the whisky and soda yes he indicated a comfortable armchair across the desk from his own put in front of it a large silver box containing various kinds of cigarettes and went to a metal filing cabinet against the wall and opened it it contained no files it was a complete and compact bar with efficient housekeeperly movements he took out a bottle of pinchbottle haig another of i w harpers bourbon two pint glasses that looked like waterford a bucket of ice cubes a siphon of soda and a flagon of iced water one by one he placed these on the desk between his chair and bonds then while bond poured himself a stiff bourbon and water with plenty of ice he went and sat down across the desk from bond reached for the haig and said looking bond very directly in the eye i learned who you are from a good friend in the deuxieme in paris he is paid to give me such information when i want it i learned it very early this morning i am in the opposite camp to yourself not directly opposite let us say at a tangent on the field he paused he lifted his glass he said with much seriousness i am now going to establish confidence with you by the only means i am going once again to place my life in your hands he drank so did bond in the filing cabinet in its icebox the hum of the generator broke in on what bond suddenly knew was going to be an important moment of truth he didnt know what the truth was going to be he didnt think it was going to be bad but he had an instinct that somehow perhaps because he had conceived respect and affection for this man it was going to mean deep involvement for himself the generator stopped the eyes in the walnut face held his i am the head of the union corse the capu the union corse now at least some of the mystery was explained bond looked across the desk into the brown eyes that were now shrewdly watching his reactions while his mind flicked through the file that bore the innocent title the union corse more deadly and perhaps even older than the unione siciliano the mafia he knew that it controlled most organized crime throughout metropolitan france and her colonies protection rackets smuggling prostitution and the suppression of rival gangs only a few months ago a certain rossi had been shot dead in a bar in nice a year before that a jean giudicelli had been liquidated after several previous attempts had failed both these men had been known pretenders to the throne of capu the ebullient cheerful man who now sat so peacefully across the table from bond then there was this mysterious business of rommels treasure supposed to be hidden beneath the sea somewhere off bastia in a czech diver called fleigh who had been in the abwehr and had got on the track of it was warned off by the union and then vanished off the face of the earth quite recently the body of a young french diver andre mattei was found riddled with bullets by the roadside near bastia he had foolishly boasted in the local bars that he knew the whereabouts of the treasure and had come to dive for it did marcange know the secret of this treasure had he been responsible for the killing of these two divers the little village of calenzana in the balagne boasted of having produced more gangsters than any other village in corsica and of being in consequence one of the most prosperous the local mayor had held office for fiftysix years the longest reigning mayor in france marcange would surely be a son of that little community know the secrets of that famous mayor know for instance of that big american gangster who had just returned to discreet retirement in the village after a highly profitable career in the states it would be fun to drop some of these names casually in this quiet little room fun to tell marcange that bond knew of the old abandoned jetty called the port of crovani near the village of galeria and of the ancient silver mine called argentella in the hills behind whose maze of underground tunnels accommodates one of the great world junctions in the heroin traffic yes it would be fun to frighten his captor in exchange for the fright he had given bond but better keep this ammunition in reserve until more had been revealed for the time being it was interesting to note that this was marcange dracos travelling headquarters his contact in the deuxieme bureau would be an essential tipoff man bond and the girl had beensent for for some purpose that was still to be announced the borrowing of the bombard rescueboat would have been a simple matter of finance in the right quarter perhaps accompanied by a pot de vin for the coastguards to look the other way the guards were corsicans on reflection that was anyway what they looked like the whole operation was simple for an organization as powerful as the union as simple in france as it would have been for the mafia in most of italy and now for more veils to be lifted james bond sipped his drink and watched the other mans face with respect this was one of the great professionals of the world marcange spoke he spoke excellent but occasionally rather clumsy english as if he had been well taught but had little occasion to use the language he said my dear commander everything i am going to discuss with you will please remain behind your herkos odonton you know the ex pression no the wide smile lit up his face then if i may say so your education was incomplete it is from the classical greek it means literally the hedge of the teeth it was the greek equivalent of your top secret is that agreed bond shrugged if you tell me secrets that affect my profession im afraid i shall have to pass them on that i fully comprehend what i wish to discuss is a personal matter it concerns my daughter teresa good god the plot was indeed thickening bond concealed his surprise he said then i agree he smiled herkos odonton it is thank you you are a man to trust you would have to be in your profession but i see it also in your face now then he lit a caporal and sat back in his chair he gazed at a point on the aluminium wall above bonds head only occasionally looking into bonds eyes when he wished to emphasize a point i was married once only to an english girl an english governess she was a romantic she had come to corsica to look for bandits he smiled rather like some english women adventure into the desert to look for sheiks she explained to me later that she must have been possessed by a subconscious desire to be raped well this time he didnt smile she found me in the mountains and she was raped by me the police were after me at the time they have been for most of my life and the girl was a grave encumbrance but for some reason she refused to leave me there was a wildness in her a love of the unconventional and for god knows what reason she liked the months of being chased from cave to cave of getting food by robbery at night she even learned to skin and cook a moufflon those are our mountain sheep and even eat the animal which is tough as shoe leather and about as palatable and in those crazy months i came to love this girl and i smuggled her away from the island to marseilles and married her he paused and looked at bond the result my dear commander was teresa my only child so thought bond that explained the curious mixture the girl was the kind of wild lady that was so puzzling in her what a complex of bloods and temperaments corsican english no wonder he hadnt been able to define her nationality my wife died ten years ago marcange held up his hand not wanting sympathy and i had the girls education finished in switzerland i was already rich and at that time i was elected capu that is chief of the union and became infinitely richer by means my dear commander which you can guess but need not inquire into the girl was how do you say that charming expression the apple of my eye and i gave her all she wanted but she was a wild one a wild bird without a proper home or since i was always on the move without proper supervision through her school in switzerland she entered the fast international set that one reads of in the newspapers the south american millionaires the indian princelings the paris english and americans the playboys of cannes and gstaad she was always getting in and out of scrapes and scandals and when i remonstrated with her cut off her allowance she would commit some even grosser folly to spite me i suppose he paused and looked at bond and now there was a terrible misery in the happy face and yet all the while behind her bravado the mothers side of her blood was making her hate herself despise herself more and more and as i now see it the worm of selfdestruction had somehow got a hold inside her and behind the wild playgirl facade was eating away what i can only describe as her soul he looked at bond you know that this can happen my friend to men and to women they burn the heart out of themselves by living too greedily and suddenly they examine their lives and see that they are worthless they have had everything eaten all the sweets of life at one great banquet and there is nothing left she made what i now see was a desperate attempt to get back on the rails so to speak she went off without telling me and married perhaps with the idea of settling down but the man a worthless italian called vicenzo count giulio di vicenzo took as much of her money as he could lay his hands on and deserted her leaving her with a girl child i purchased a divorce and bought a small chateau for my daughter in the dordogne and installed her there and for once with the baby and a pretty garden to look after she seemed almost at peace and then my friend six months ago the baby died died of that most terrible of all childrens ailments spinal meningitis there was silence in the little metal room bond thought of the girl a few yards away down the corridor yes he had been near the truth he had seen some of this tragic story in the calm desperation of the girl she had indeed come to the end of the road marcange got slowly up from his chair and came round and poured out more whisky for himself and for bond he said forgive me i am a poor host but the telling of this story which i have always kept locked up inside me to another man has been a great relief he put a hand on bonds shoulder you understand that yes i understand that but she is a fine girl she still has nearly all her life to live have you thought of psychoanalysis of her church is she a catholic no her mother would not have it she is presbyterian but wait while i finish the story he went back to his chair and sat down heavily after the tragedy she disappeared she took her jewels and went off in that little car of hers and i heard occasional news of her selling the jewels and living furiously all over europe with her old set naturally i followed her had her watched when i could but she avoided all my attempts to meet her and talk to her then i heard from one of my agents that she had reserved a room here at the splendide for last night and i hurried down from paris he waved a hand in this because i had a presentiment of tragedy you see this was where we had spent the summers in her childhood and she had always loved it she is a wonderful swimmer and she was almost literally in love with the sea and when i got the news i suddenly had a dreadful memory the memory of a day when she had been naughty and had been locked in her room all afternoon instead of going bathing that night she had said to her mother quite calmly you made me very unhappy keeping me away from the sea one day if i get really unhappy i shall swim out into the sea down the path of the moon or the sun and go on swimming until i sink so there her mother told me the story and we laughed over it together at the childish tantrum but now i suddenly remembered again the occasion and it seemed to me that the childish fantasy might well have stayed with her locked away deep down and that now wanting to put an end to herself she had resurrected it and was going to act on it and so my dear friend i had her closely watched from the moment she arrived your gentlemanly conduct in the casino for which he looked across at bond i now deeply thank you was reported to me as of course were your later movements together he held up his hand as bond shifted with embarrassment there is nothing to be ashamed of to apologize for in what you did kst night a man is a man and who knows but i shall come to that later what you did the way you behaved in general may have been the beginning of some kind of therapy bond remembered how in the bombard she had yielded when he leaned against her it had been a tiny reaction but it had held more affection more warmth than all the physical ecstasies of the night now suddenly he had an inkling of why he might be here where the root of the mystery lay and he gave an involuntary shudder as if someone had walked over his grave marcange continued so i put in my inquiry to my friend from the deuxieme at six oclock this morning at eight oclock he went to his office and to the central files and by nine oclock he had reported to me fully about you by radio i have a highpowered station in this vehicle he smiled and that is another of my secrets that i deliver into your hands the report if i may say so was entirely to your credit both as an officer in your service and more important as a man a man that is in the terms that i understand the word so i reflected i reflected all through this morning and in the end i gave orders that you were both to be brought to me here he made a throwaway gesture with his right hand i need not tell you the details of my instructions you yourself saw them in operation you have been inconvenienced i apologize you have perhaps thought yourself in danger forgive me i only trust that my men behaved with correctness with finesse bond smiled i am very glad to have met you if the introduction had to be effected at the point of two automatics that will only make it all the more memorable the whole affair was certainly executed with neatness and expedition marcanges expression was rueful now you are being sarcastic but believe me my friend drastic measures were necessary i knew they were he reached to the top drawer of his desk took out a sheet of writingpaper and passed it over to bond and now if you read that you will agree with me that letter was handed in to the concierge of the splendide at this afternoon for posting to me in marseilles when teresa went out and you followed her you suspected something you also feared for her read it please bond took the letter he said yes i was worried about her she is a girl worth worrying about he held up the letter it contained only a few words written clearly with decision dear papa i am sorry but i have had enough it is only sad because tonight i met a man who might have changed my mind he is an englishman called james bond please find him and pay him new francs which i owe him and thank him from me this is nobodys fault but my own goodbye and forgive me tracy bond didnt look at the man who had received this letter he slid it back to him across the desk he took a deep drink of the whisky and reached for the bottle he said yes i see she likes to call herself tracy she thinks teresa sounds too grand yes commander bond there was now a terrible urgency in the mans voice urgency authority and appeal my friend you have heard the whole story and now you have seen the evidence will you help me will you help me save this girl it is my only chance that you will give her hope that you will give her a reason to live will you bond kept his eyes on the desk in front of him he dared not look up and see the expression on this mans face so he had been right right to fear that he was going to become involved in all this private trouble he cursed under his breath the idea appalled him he was no good samaritan he was no doctor for wounded birds what she needed he said fiercely to himself was the psychiatrists couch all right so she had taken a passing fancy to him and he to her now he was going to be asked he knew it to pick her up and carry her perhaps for the rest of his life haunted by the knowledge the unspoken blackmail that if he dropped her it would almost certainly be to kill her he said glumly i do not see that i can help what is it you have in mind he picked up his glass and looked into it he drank to give him courage to look across the desk into marcanges face the mans soft brown eyes glittered with tension the creased dark skin round the mouth had sunk into deeper folds he said holding bonds eyes i wish you to pay court to my daughter and marry her on the day of the marriage i will give you a personal dowry of one million pounds in gold james bond exploded angrily what you ask is utterly impossible the girl is sick what she needs is a psychiatrist not me and i do not want to marry not anyone nor do i want a million pounds i have enough money for my needs i have my profession you must understand all this suddenly he could not bear the hurt in the mans face he said softly she is a wonderful girl i will do all i can for her but only when she is well again then i would certainly like to see her again very much but if she thinks so well of me if you do then she must first get well of her own accord that is the only way any doctor would tell you so she must go to some clinic the best there is in switzerland probably and bury her past she must want to live again then only then would there be any point in our meeting again he pleaded with marcange you do understand dont you marcange i am a ruthless man i admit it and i have not got the patience to act as anyones nurse man or woman your idea of a cure might only drive her into deeper despair you must see that i cannot take the responsibility however much i am attracted by your daughter bond ended lamely which i am the man said resignedly i understand you my friend and i will not importune you with further arguments i will try and act in the way you suggest but will you please do one further favour for me it is now nine oclock will you please take her out to dinner tonight talk to her as you please but show her that she is wanted that you have affection for her her car is here and her clothes i have had them brought if only you can persuade her that you would like to see her again i think i may be able to do the rest will you do this forme bond thought god what an evening but he smiled with all the warmth he could summon but of course i would love to do that but i am booked on the first morning night from le touquet tomorrow morning will you be responsible for her from then certainly my friend of course i will do that marcange brusquely wiped a hand across his eyes forgive me but you have given me hope at the end of a long night he straightened his shoulders and suddenly leaned across the desk and put his hands decisively down i will not thank you i cannot but tell me my dear friend is there anything in this world that i can do for you now at this moment i have great resources great knowledge great power they are all yours is there nothing i can do for you bond had a flash of inspiration he smiled broadly there is a piece of information i want there is a man called blofeld ernst stavro blofeld you will have heard of him i wish to know if he is alive and where he is to be found marcanges face underwent a remarkable change now the bandit cold cruel avenging looked out through the eyes that had suddenly gone as hard as brown opals aha he said thoughtfully the blofeld yes he is certainly alive only recently he suborned three of my men bribed them away from the union he has done this to me before three of the members of the old spectre were taken from the union come let us find out what we can there was a single black telephone on the desk he picked up the receiver and at once bond heard the soft crackle of the operator responding dammi u commandu marcange put the receiver back i have asked for my local headquarters in ajaccio we will have them in five minutes but i must speak fast the police may know my frequency though i change it every week but the corsican dialect helps the telephone burred when marcange picked up the receiver bond could hear the zing and crackle he knew so well marcange spoke in a voice of rasping authority ecco u capu avette nuttizie di blofeld ernst stavro duve sta a voice crackled thinly site sigura ma no ezzatu indirizzu more crackle buon sara tutto marcange put back the receiver he spread his hands apologetically all we know is that he is in switzerland we have no exact address for him will that help surely your men there can find him if the swiss securite will help but they are difficult brutes when it comes to the privacy of a resident particularly if he is rich bonds pulse had quickened with triumph got you you bastard he said enthusiastically thats wonderful marcange the rest shouldnt be difficult we have good friends in switzerland marcange smiled happily at bonds reaction he said seriously but if things go wrong for you on this case or in any other way you will come at onqe to me yes he pulled open a drawer and handed a sheet of notepaper over to bond this is my open address telephone or cable to me but put your request or your news in terms that would be used in connexion with electrical appliances a consignment of radios is faulty you will meet my representative at such and such a place on such and such a date yes you understand these tricks and anyway he smiled slyly i believe you are connected with an international export firm universal export isnt it bond smiled how did the old devil know these things should he warn security no this man had become a friend and anyway all this was herkos odonton marcange said diffidently and now may i bring in teresa she does not know what we have been discussing let us say it is about one of the south of france jewel robberies you represent the insurance company i have been making a private deal with you you can manage that good he got up and came over to bond and put his hand on bonds shoulder and thank you thank you for everything then he went out of the door oh my god thought bond now for my side of the bargain bond of bond street it was two months later in london and james bond was driving lazily up from his chelsea flat to his headquarters it was ninethirty in the morning of yet another beautiful day of this beautiful year but in hyde park the fragrance of burning leaves meant that winter was only just round the corner bond had nothing on his mind except the frustration of waiting for station z somehow to penetrate the reserves of the swiss securite and come up with the exact address of blofeld but their friends in zurich were continuing to prove obtuse or more probably obstinate there was no trace of any man either tourist or resident called blofeld in the whole of switzerland nor was there any evidence of the existence of a reborn spectre on swiss soil yes they fully realized that blofeld was still urgently wanted by the governments of the nato alliance they had carefully filed all the circulars devoted to the apprehension of this man and for the past year he had been constantly reconfirmed on their watch lists at all frontier posts they were very sorry but unless the sis could come up with further information or evidence about this man they must assume that the sis was acting on mistaken evidence station z had asked for an examination of the secret lists at the banks a search through those anonymous numbered accounts which conceal the owners of most of the fugitive money in the world this request had been peremptorily refused blofeld was certainly a great criminal but the securite must point out that such information could only be legally obtained if the criminal in question was guilty of some crime committed on federal soil and indictable under the federal code it was true that this blofeld had held up britain and america to ransom by his illegal possession of atomic weapons but this could not be considered a crime under the laws of switzerland and particularly not having regard to article b of the banking laws so that was that the holy franc and the funds which backed it wherever they came from must remain untouchable wir bitten hoflichst um entschuldigung bond wondered if he should get in touch with marcange so far in his report he had revealed only a lead into the union corse whom he gave corporately as the source of his information but he shied away from this course of action which would surely have as one consequence the reopening with marcange of the case of tracy and that corner of his life of his heart he wanted to leave undisturbed for the time being their last evening together had passed quietly almost as if they had been old friends old lovers bond had said that universal export was sending him abroad for some time they would certainly meet when he returned to europe the girl had accepted this arrangement she herself had decided to go away for a rest she had been doing too much she had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown she would wait for him perhaps they could go skiing together around christmas time bond had been enthusiastic that night after a wonderful dinner at bonds little restaurant they had made love happily and this time without desperation without tears bond was satisfied that the cure had really begun he felt deeply protective towards her but he knew that their relationship and her equanimity rested on a knifeedge which must not be disturbed it was at this moment in his reflections that the syncraphone in his trouser pocket began to bleep bond accelerated out of the park and drew up beside the public telephone booth at marble arch the syncraphone had recently been introduced and was carried by all officers attached to headquarters it was a light plastic radio receiver about the size of a pocket watch when an officer was somewhere in london within a range of ten miles of headquarters he could be bleeped on the receiver when this happened it was his duty to go at once to the nearest telephone and contact his office he was urgently needed bond rang his exchange on the only outside number he was allowed to use said reporting and was at once put through to his secretary she was a new one loelia ponsonby had at last left to marry a dull but worthy and rich member of the baltic exchange and confined her contacts with her old job to rather yearning christmas and birthday cards to the members of the doubleo section but the new one mary goodnight an exwren with blueblack hair blue eyes and was a honey and there was a private fivepound sweep in the section as to who would get her first bond had been lying equal favourite with the exroyal marine commando who was but since tracy had dropped out of the field and now regarded himself as a rank outsider though he still rather bitchily flirted with her now he said to her good morning goodnight what can i do for you is it war or peace she giggled unprofessionally it sounds fairly peaceful as peaceful as a hurry message from upstairs can be youre to go at once to the college of arms and ask for griffon or or what just or oh and hes pursuivant as well whatever that means hes one of the heralds apparently theyve got some kind of a line on bedlam bedlam was the code name for the pursuit of blofeld bond said respectfully have they indeed then id better get cracking goodbye goodnight he heard her giggle before he put the receiver down now what the hell bond got back into his car that had mercifully not yet attracted the police or the traffic wardens and motored fast across london this was a queer one how the hell did the college of arms of which he knew very little except that they hunted up peoples family trees allotted coats of arms and organized various royal ceremonies get into the act the college of arms is in queen victoria street on the fringe of the city it is a pleasant little queen anne backwater in ancient red brick with white sashed windows and a convenient cobbled courtyard where bond parked his car there are horseshoeshaped stone stairs leading up to an impressive entrance over which that day there hung a banner showing a splendid heraldic beast half animal and half bird in gold against a pale blue background griffon thought bond made of or he went through the door into a large gloomy hall whose dark panelling was lined with the musty portraits of proudlooking gentlemen in ruffs and lace and from whose cornice hung the banners of the commonwealth the porter a kindly softspoken man in a cherrycoloured uniform with brass buttons asked bond what he could do for him bond asked for the griffon or and confirmed that he had an appointment ah yes sir said the porter mysteriously griffon or is in waiting this week that is why his banner is flying outside this way please sir bond followed the porter along a passage hung with gleaming coats of arms in carved wood up a dank cobwebby staircase and round a corner to a heavy door over which was written in gold griffon or pursuivant under a representation of the said golden griffon the porter knocked opened the door and announced bond and left him facing across an unkempt study uttered with books papers and importantlooking inscribed parchments the top of a bald round pink head fringed with grizzled curls the room smelt like the crypt of a church bond walked down the narrow lane of carpet left between the piles of litter and stood beside the single chair that faced the man behind the books on the desk he cleared his throat the man looked up and the pickwickian pincenezd face broke into an absent smile he got to his feet and made a little bow bond he said in a voice that creaked like the lid of an old chest commander james bond now then bond bond bond i think ive got you here he had kept his finger at the open page of a vast tome he now sat down and bond followed suit yes yes yes very interesting indeed very but i fear i have to disappoint you my dear sir the title is extinct actually its a baronetcy most desirable but no doubt we can establish a relationship through a collateral branch now then he put his pincenez very close to the page we have some ten different families of bonds the important one ended with sir thomas bond a most distinguished gentleman he resided in peckhain he had alas no issue the pincenez gleamed encouragingly at bond no legitimate issue that is of course in those days ahem morals were inclined to be laxer now if we could establish some connexion with peckham i have no connexion with peckham now i griffon or held up his hand he said severely where did your parents come from if i may ask that my dear fellow is the first step in the chain then we can go back from there somerset house parish records old tombstones no doubt with a good old english name like yours we will get somewhere in the end my father was a scot and my mother was swiss but the point is quite quite you are wondering about the cost of the research that my dear fellow we can leave until later but now tell me from whereabouts in scotland did your father come that is important the scottish records are of course less fully documented than those from the south in those days i am forced to admit that our cousins across the border were little more than savages griffon or bobbed his head politely he gave a fleeting and to bonds eye rather false smile very pleasant savages of course very brave and all that but alas very weak at keeping up their records more useful with the sword than with the pen if i may say so but perhaps your grandparents and their forebears came from the south my father came from the highlands from near glencoe but look here but griffon or was not to be diverted from the scent he pulled another thick book towards him his finger ran down the page of small print hum hum hum yes yes not very encouraging i fear burkes general armory gives more than ten different families bearing your name but alas nothing in scotland not that that means there is no scottish branch now perhaps you have other relatives living so often in these matters there is some distant cousin griffon or reached into the pocket of the purpleflowered silk waistcoat that buttoned almost up to his neat bow tie fished out a small silver snuffbox offered it to bond and then himself took two tremendous sniffs he exploded twice into an ornate bandana handkerchief bond took his opportunity he leaned forward and said distinctly and forcibly i didnt come here to talk about myself its about blofeld whats that griffon or looked at him in astonishment you are not interested in your line of descent he held up an admonishing finger do you realize my dear fellow that if we are successful you may be able to claim direct he hesitated or at any rate collateral descent from an ancient baronetcy founded he went back to his first volume and peered at it in the year does it not excite you that a possible ancestor of yours was responsible for the name of one of the most famous streets in the world refer of course to bond street that was the sir thomas bond baronet of peckham in the county of surrey who as you are no doubt aware was comptroller of the household of the queen mother henrietta maria the street was built in and its associations with famous british folk are of course well known the first duke of st albans son of nell gwynn lived there as did laurence sterne boswells famous dinner party took place there with johnson reynolds goldsmith and garrick being present dean swift and canning were residents at different times and it is intriguing to recall that while lord nelson lived at number lady hamilton lived at number and this my dear sir is the great thoroughfare of which you bear the name do you still wish to establish no claim to this vastly distinguished connexion no the bushy eyebrows raised in astonishment were now lowered in further admonishment this is the very warp and woof of history my dear commander bond he reached for another volume that lay open on his desk and that he had obviously prepared for bonds delectation the coat of arms for instance surely that must concern you be at least of profound interest to your family to your own children yes here we are argent on a chevron sable three bezants he held up the book so that bond could see a bezant is a golden ball as i am sure you know three balls bond commented drily that is certainly a valuable bonus the irony was lost on griffon or but im afraid i am still not interested and i have no relatives and no children now about this man griffon or broke in excitedly and this charming motto of the line the world is not enough you do not wish to have the right to it it is an excellent motto which i shall certainly adopt said bond curtly he looked pointedly at his watch now im afraid we really must get down to business i have to report back to my ministry griffon or pursuivant looked genuinely affronted and here is a name going back at least to norman le bond in a fine old english name though one perhaps originally of lowly origin the dictionary of british surnames suggests that the meaning is clearly husbandman peasant churl was there an edge of malice in the griffons watery eye he added with resignation but if you are not interested in your ancestry in the womb of your family then my dear sir in what can i be of service at last james bond let out a sigh of relief he said patiently i came here to inquire about a certain blofeld ernst stavro blofeld it seems that your organization has some information about this man griffon ors eyes were suddenly suspicious but you represented yourself as a commander james bond and now the name is blofeld how does this come about bond said icily i am from the ministry of defence somewhere in this building is information about a man called blofeld where can i find it griffon or ran a puzzled hand round his halo of curls blofeld is it well well he looked accusingly at bond forgive me but you certainly have wasted plenty of my of the colleges time commander bond it is a mystery to me why you did not mention this mans name before now let me see blofeld blofeld seem to recall that it came up at one of our chapter meetings the other day now who had the case ah yes he reached for a telephone among the nest of books and papers give me sable basilisk the hairy heel of achilles james bonds heart was still in his boots as he was conducted again through the musty corridors sable basilisk indeed what kind of a besotted old fogy would this be there came another heavy door with the name in gold and this time with a nightmare black monster with a vicious beak above it but now bond was shown into a light clean pleasantly furnished room with attractive prints on the walls and meticulous order among its books there was a faint smell of turkish tobacco a young man a few years younger than bond got up and came across the room to meet him he was rapierslim with a fine thin studious face that was saved from seriousness by wry lines at the edges of the mouth and an ironical glint in the level eyes commander bond the handshake was brief and firm id been expecting you how did you get into the claws of our dear griffon hes a bit of an enthusiast im afraid we all are here of course but hes getting on nice chap but hes a bit dedicated if you know what i mean it was indeed like a college this place reflected bond much of the atmosphere one associates with the senior common room at a university no doubt griffon or mentally put down sable basilisk as a young dilettante who was too big for his boots he said he seemed very anxious to establish a connexion between me and bond street it took some time to persuade him that im perfectly content to be an ordinary bond which by the way he rather churlishly i thought said meant a churl sable basilisk laughed he sat down behind his desk pulled a file towards him and gestured bond to a chair beside him well then lets get down to business first of all he looked bond very straight in the eye i gather i guess that is that this is an intelligence matter of some kind i did my national service with intelligence in baor so please dont worry about security secondly we have in this building probably as many secrets as a government department and nastier ones at that one of our jobs is to suggest titles to people whove been ennobled in the honours lists sometimes were asked to establish ownership to a title that has become lost or defunct snobbery and vanity positively sprawl through our files before my time a certain gentleman who had come up from nowhere made millions in some light industry or another and had been given a peerage for political and public services ie charities and the party funds suggested that he should take the title of lord bentley royal after the village in essex we explained that the word royal could not be used except by the reigning family but rather naughtily i fear we said that lord bentley common was vacant he smiled see what i mean if that got about this man would become the laughingstock of the country then sometimes we have to chase up lost fortunes soandso thinks hes the rightful duke of blank and ought to have his money his name happens to be blank and his ancestors migrated to america or australia or somewhere so avarice and greed come to join snobbery and vanity in these rooms of course he added putting the record straightthats only the submerged tenth of our job the rest is mostly official stuff for governments and embassies problems of precedence and protocol the garter ceremonies and others weve been doing it for around five hundred years so i suppose its got its place in the scheme of things of course it has said bond staunchly and certainly so far as security is concerned im sure we can be open with each other now this man blofeld truth of the matter is hes probably the biggest crook in the world remember that thunderball affair about a year ago only some of it leaked into the papers but i can tell you that this blofeld was at the bottom of it all now how did you come to hear of him every detail please everything about him is important sable basilisk turned back to the first letter on the file yes he said thoughtfully i thought this might be the same chap when i got a lot of urgent calls from the foreign office and the ministry of defence yesterday hadnt occurred to me before im afraid that this is a case where our secrets have to come second or id have done something about it earlier now then in june last the tenth we got this confidential letter from a firm of respectable zurich solicitors dated the day before ill read it out honoured sirs we have a valued client by the name of ernst stavro blofeld this gentleman styles himself monsieur le comte balthazar de bleuville in the belief that he is the rightful heir to this title which we understand to be extinct his belief is based on stories he heard from his parents in childhood to the effect that his family fled france at the time of the revolution settled in germany under the adopted name of blofeld assumed in order to evade the revolutionary authorities and safeguard their fortune which they had sequestered in augsburg and subsequently in the s migrated to poland our client is now anxious to have these facts established in order legally to obtain right to the de bleuville title supported by an acte de notoriete which would in due course receive the stamp of approval of the ministere de la justice in paris in the meantime our client proposes to continue to adopt albeit provisionally the title of comte de bleuville together with the family arms which he informs us are argent four fusils in fesse gules and the de bleuville motto which in english is for hearth and home thats a good one interjected bond sable basilisk smiled and continued we understand that you honoured sirs are the only body in the world who is capable of undertaking this research work and we have been instructed to get in touch with you under the strictest conditions of confidence which in view of the social aspects involved we think we have the right to request the financial standing of our client is impeccable and expense is no object in this matter as a preliminary honorarium and upon acceptance of this commission we propose a payment of one thousand pounds sterling to your account in such bank as you may designate awaiting the favour of an early reply we remain honoured sirs etc etc gebrьder gumpoldmoosbrugger advokaten his bahnhofstrasse zurich sable basilisk looked up james bonds eyes were glittering with excitement sable basilisk smiled we were even more interested than you seem to be you see to let you in on a secret our salaries are extremely modest so we all have private means which we supplement from fees received for special work like this these fees rarely go above fifty guineas for a piece of pretty tough research and all the leg work at somerset house and in parish records and graveyards that is usually involved in tracking a mans ancestry so this looked like a real challenge for the college and as i was in waiting the day the letter came in sort of officer of the watch the job fell into my lap bond said urgently so what happened have you kept the contact oh yes but rather tenuously im afraid of course i wrote at once accepting the commission and agreeing to the vow of secrecy which he smiled you now force me to break presumably by invoking the official secrets act that is so isnt it i am acting under force majeure you are indeed said bond emphatically sable basilisk made a careful note on the top paper in the file and continued of course the first thing i had to ask for was the mans birth certificate and after a delay i was told that it had been lost and that i was on no account to worry about it the count had in fact been born in gdynia of a polish father and a greek mother i have the names here on may th could i not pursue my researches backwards from the de bleuville end i replied temporizing but by this time i had indeed established from our library that there had been a family of de bleuvilles at least as lately as the seventeenth century at a place called blonvillesurmer calvados and that their arms and motto were as claimed by blofeld sable basilisk paused this of course he must have known for himself there would have been no purpose in inventing a family of de bleuvilles and trying to stuff them down our throats i told the lawyers of my discovery and in my summer holidays the north of france is more or less my private heraldic beat so to speak and very rich it is too in connexions with england motored down there and sniffed around but meanwhile i had as a matter of routine written to our ambassador in warsaw and asked him to contact our consul in gdynia and request him to employ a lawyer to make the simple researches with the registrar and the various churches where blofeld might have been baptized the reply early in september was but is no longer surprising the pages containing the record of blofelds birth had been neatly cut out i kept this information to myself that is to say i did not pass it on to the swiss lawyers because i had been expressly instructed to make no inquiries in poland meanwhile i had carried out similar inquiries through a lawyer in augsburg there there was indeed a record of blofelds but of a profusion of them for it is a fairly common german name and in any case nothing to link any of them with the de bleuvilles from calvados so i was stumped but no more than i have been before and i wrote a neutral report to the swiss lawyers and said that i was continuing my researches and there sable basilisk slapped the file shut until my telephone began ringing yesterday presumably because someone in the northern department of the foreign office was checking the file copies from warsaw and the name blofeld rang a bell and you appeared looking very impatient from the cave of my friend the griffon the case rests bond scratched his head thoughtfully but the balls still in play oh yes definitely can you keep it in play i take it you havent got blofelds present address sable basilisk shook his head then would there be any conceivable excuse for an envoy from you bond smiled me for example to be sent out from the college to have an interview with blofeld some tricky point that cannot be cleared up by correspondence something that needs a personal inquiry from blofeld well yes there is in a way sable basilisk looked rather dubious you see in some families there is a strong physical characteristic that goes on inevitably from generation to generation the habsburg lip is a case in point so is the tendency to haemophilia among descendants of the bourbons the hawk nose of the medici is another a certain royal family have minute vestigial tails the original maharajahs of mysore were born with six fingers on each hand i could go on indefinitely but those are the most famous cases now when i was scratching around in the crypt of the chapel at blonville having a look at the old bleuville tombs my flashlight moving over the stone faces picked out a curious fact that i tucked away in my mind but that your question has brought to the surface none of the de bleuvilles as far as i could tell and certainly not through a hundred and fifty years had lobes to their ears ah said bond running over in his mind the identicast picture of blofeld and the complete printed physiognometry of the man in records so he shouldnt by rights have lobes to his ears or at any rate it would be a strong piece of evidence for his case if he hadnt thats right well he has got lobes said bond annoyed rather pronounced lobes as a matter of fact where does that get us to begin with added to what i know anyway that makes him probably not a de bleuville but after all sable basilisk looked sly theres no reason why he should know what physical characteristic were looking for in this interview you think we could set one up dont see why not but sable basilisk was apologetic would you mind if i got clearance from garter king of arms hes my boss so to speak under the duke of norfolk that is the earl marshal and i cant remember that weve ever been mixed up in this sort of cloakanddagger stuff before actually sable basilisk waved a deprecating hand we are we have to be damned meticulous you do see that dont you naturally and im sure thered be no objection but even if blofeld agreed to see me how in hell could i play the part this stuff is all double dutch to me he smiled i dont know the difference between a gule and a bezant and ive never been able to make out what a baronet is whats my story to blofeld who am i exactly sable basilisk was getting enthusiastic he said cheerfully oh thatll be all right ill coach you in all the dope about the de bleuvilles you can easily mug up a few popular books on heraldry its not difficult to be impressive on the subject very few people know anything about it maybe but this blofeld is a pretty smart animal hell want the hell of a lot of credentials before he sees anyone but his lawyer and his banker who exactly am i you think blofelds smart because youve seen the smart side of him said sable basilisk sapiently ive seen hundreds of smart people from the city industry politics famous people ive been quite frightened to meet when they walked into this room but when it comes to snobbery to buying respectability so to speak whether its the title theyre going to choose or just a coat of arms to hang over their fireplaces in surbiton they dwindle and dwindle in front of you he made a downward motion over his desk with his hand until theyre no bigger than homunculi and the women are even worse the idea of suddenly becoming a lady in their small community is so intoxicating that the way they bare their souls is positively obscene its as if sable basilisk furrowed his high pale brow seeking for a simile these fundamentally good citizens these smiths and browns and joneses and he smiled across the desk bonds regarded the process of ennoblement as a sort of layingon of hands a way of ridding themselves of all the drabness of their lives of all their so to speak essential meagreness their basic inferiority dont worry about blofeld he has already swallowed the bait he may be a tremendous gangster and he must be from what i remember of the case he may be tough and ruthless in his corner of human behaviour but if he is trying to prove that he is the comte de bleuville you can be sure of various things he wants to change his name that is obvious he wants to become a new a respectable personality that is obvious too but above all he wants to become a count sable basilisk brought his hand flat down on his desk for emphasis that mr bond is tremendously significant he is a rich and successful man in his line of business no matter what it is he no longer admires the material things riches and power he is now as i reckon it he wants a new skin i can assure you air bond that he will receive you if we play our cards right that is as if he were consulting his doctor about sable basilisks aristocratic face took on an expression of distaste as if he were consulting his doctor after contracting vd sable basilisks eyes were now compelling he sat back in his chair and lit his first cigarette the smell of turkish tobacco drifted across to bond thats it he said with certitude this man knows he is unclean a social pariah which of course he is now he has thought up this way of buying himself a new identity if you ask me we must help the hair to grow and flourish on his heel of achilles until it is so luxuriant that he trips on it fancy cover and who the hell are you supposed to be m more or less repeated bonds question when that evening he looked up from the last page of the report that bond had spent the afternoon dictating to mary goodnight ms face was just outside the pool of yellow light cast by the greenshaded reading lamp on his desk but bond knew that the lined sailors face was reflecting in varying degrees scepticism irritation and impatience the hell told him so m rarely swore and when he did it was nearly always at stupidity m obviously regarded bonds plan as stupid and now away from the dedicated minutely focused world of the heralds bond wasnt sure that m wasnt right im to be an emissary from the college of arms sir this basilisk chap recommended that i should have some kind of a title the sort of rather highfalutin one that would impress a man with this kind of bee in his bonnet and blofelds obviously got this bee or he wouldnt have revealed his existence even to such a presumably secure and er sort of remote corner of the world as the college of arms ive put down there the arguments of this chap and they make a lot of sense to me snobberys a real achilles heel with people blofelds obviously got the bug badly i think we can get to him through it well i think its all a pack of nonsense said m testily all right then whats this ridiculous title to be and what happens next if bond had been able to blush he would have blushed he said er well sir it seems theres a chap called sir hilary bray friend of sable basilisks about my age and not unlike me to look at his family came from some place in normandy family tree as long as your arm william the conqueror and all that and a coat of arms that looks like a mixture between a jigsaw puzzle and piccadilly circus at night well sable basilisk says he can fix it with him this mans got a good war record and sounds a reliable sort of chap he lives in some remote glen in the highlands watching birds and climbing the hills with bare feet never sees a soul no reason why anyone in switzerland should have heard of him bonds voice became defensive stubborn well sir the idea is that i should be him rather fancy cover but i think it makes sense sir hilary bray eh m tried to conceal his scorn and then what do you do run around the alps waving this famous banner of his bond said patiently obstinately refusing to be browbeaten first ill get passport control to fix up a good passport then i mug up brays family tree until im wordperfect on the thing then i swot away at the rudiments of this heraldry business then if blofeld takes the bait i go out to switzerland with all the right books and suggest that i work out his de bleuville pedigree with him then what then i try and winkle him out of switzerland get him over the frontier to somewhere where we can do a kidnap job on him rather like the israelis did with eichmann but i havent worked out all the details yet sir had to get your approval and then sable basilisk has got to make up a damned attractive fly and throw it over these zurich solicitors why not try putting pressure on the zurich solicitors and winkle blofelds address out of them then we might think of doing some kind of a commando job you know the swiss sir god knows what kind of a retainer these lawyers have from blofeld but its bound to be millionaire size we might eventually get the address but theyd be bound to tip off blofeld if only to lay their hands on their fees before he vamoosed moneys the religion of switzerland i dont need a lecture on the qualities of the swiss thank you at least they keep their trains clean and cope with the beatnik problem but i daresay theres some truth in what you say oh well m wearily pushed the file over to bond take it away its a messylooking birdsnest of a plan but i suppose it had better go ahead m shook his head sceptically sir hilary bray oh well tell the chief of staff i approve but reluctantly tell him you can have the facilities keep me informed m reached for the cabinet telephone his voice was deeply disgruntled suppose ill have to tell the pm weve got a line on the chap the kind of tangle it is ill keep to myself thats all thank you sir goodnight as bond went across to the door he heard m say into the green receiver m speaking i want the prime minister personally please he might have been asking for the mortuary bond went out and softly closed the door behind him so as november blustered its way into december james bond went unwillingly back to school swotting up heraldry at his desk instead of topsecret reports picking up scraps of medieval french and english steeping himself in fusty lore and myth picking the brains of sable basilisk and occasionally learning interesting facts such as that the founders of gamages came from the de gamaches in normandy and that walt disney was remotely descended from the disignys of the same part of france but these were nuggets in a wasteland of archaisms and when one day mary goodnight in reply to some sally of his addressed him as sir hilary he nearly bit her head off meanwhile the highly delicate correspondence between sable basilisk and the gebrьder moosbrugger proceeded haltingly and at a snails pace they or rather blofeld behind them posed countless irritating but sable basilisk admitted erudite queries each one of which had to be countered with this or that degree of heraldic obfuscation then there were minute questions about this emissary sir hilary bray photographs were asked for and suitably doctored were provided his whole career since his schooldays had to be detailed and was sent down from scotland with a highly amused covering note from the real man to test the market more funds were asked for by sable basilisk and with encouraging promptitude were forthcoming in the shape of a further thousand pounds when the cheque arrived on december th sable basilisk telephoned bond delightedly weve got him he said hes hooked and sure enough the next day came a letter from zurich to say that their client agreed to a meeting with sir hilary would sir hilary please arrive at zurich central airport by swissair flight number due at zurich at hours on december st on bonds prompting sable basilisk wrote back that the date was not convenient to sir hilary owing to a prior engagement with the canadian high commissioner regarding a detail in the arms of the hudsons bay company sir hilary could however manage the nd by return came a cable agreeing and to bond confirming that the fish had not only swallowed the hook but the line and sinker as well the last few days were spent in a flurry of meetings with the chief of staff presiding at headquarters the main decisions were that bond should go to the meeting with blofeld absolutely clean he would carry no weapons no secret gear of any kind and he would not be watched or followed by the service in any way he would communicate only with sable basilisk getting across such information as he could by using heraldic double talk and sable basilisk who vaguely thought that bond was employed by the ministry of defence would be given a cutout at the ministry who would be his gobetween with the service this was all assuming that bond managed to stay close to blofeld for at least a matter of days and that was to be his basic stratagem it was essential to find out as much as possible about blofeld his activities and his associates in order to proceed with planning the next step his abduction from switzerland physical action might not be necessary bond might be able to trick the man into a visit to germany as a result of a report which sable basilisk had prepared of certain blofeld family documents at the augsburg zentral archiv which would need blofelds personal identification security precautions would include keeping station z completely in the dark about bonds mission to switzerland and a closure of the bedlam file at headquarters which would be announced in the routine orders of the day instead a new codeword for the operation known only to an essential handful of senior officers would be issued it would be corona finally the personal dangers to bond himself were discussed there was total respect for blofeld at headquarters nobody questioned his abilities or his ruthlessness if bonds true identity somehow became known to blofeld bond would of course instantly be liquidated a more dangerous and likely event would be that once blofeld had probed bonds heraldic gen to its rather shallow bottom and it had been proved that he was or was not the comte de bleuville sir hilary bray his usefulness expended might meet with an accident bond would just have to face up to these hazards and watch out particularly for the latter he and sable basilisk behind him would have to keep some tricks up their sleeves tricks that would somehow make sir hilary brays continued existence important to blofeld in conclusion the chief of staff said he considered the whole operation a lot of bezants and that bezants would have been a better codeword than corona however he wished bond the best of luck and said coldheartedly that he would instruct the technical section to proceed forthwith with the devising of a consignment of explosive snowballs for bonds protection it was on this cheery note that bond on the evening of december st returned to his office for a last runthrough of his documentation with mary goodnight he sat sideways to his desk looking out over the triste winter twilight of regents park under snow while she sat opposite him and ran through the items burkes extinct and dormant baronetage property of the college of heralds stamped not to be removed from the library the printed visitations in the college of arms stamped ditto genealogists guide by g w marshall with hatchards receipted bill to sable basilisk inserted bur hes general armory stamped property of the london library wrapped and franked december th passport in the name of sir hilary bray containing various recentlydated frontier stamps in and out of france germany and the low countries fairly well used and dogeared one large file of correspondence with augsburg and zurich on college of arms writingpaper and the writingpaper of the addressees and thats the lot youve fixed your laundry tags and so on yes said bond dully ive fixed all that and ive got two new suits with cuffs and double vents at the back and four buttons down the front also a gold watch and chain with the bray seal quite the little baronet bond turned and looked across the desk at mary goodnight what do you think of this caper mary think itll come off well it should do she said staunchly with all the trouble thats been taken but she hesitated i dont like you taking this man on without a gun she waved a hand at the pile on the floor and all these stupid books about heraldry its just not you you will take care wont you oh ill do that all right said bond reassuringly now be a good girl and get a radio taxi to the universal export entrance and put all that junk inside it would you ill be down in a minute ill be at the flat all this evening he smiled sourly packing my silk shirts with the crests on them he got up so long mary or rather goodnight goodnight and keep out of trouble till i get back she said you do that yourself she bent and picked up the books and papers from the floor and keeping her face hidden from bond went to the door and kicked it shut behind her with her heel a moment or two later she opened the door again her eyes were bright im sorry james good luck and happy christmas she closed the door softly behind her bond looked at the blank face of the office of works cream door what a dear girl mary was but now there was tracy he would be near her in switzerland it was time to make contact again he had been missing her wondering about her there had been three noncommittal but cheerful postcards from the clinique de aube at davos bond had made inquiries and had ascertained that this was run by a professor auguste kommer president of the societй psychiatrique et psychologique suisse over the telephone sir james molony the nerve specialist by appointment to the service had told bond that kommer was one of the top men in the world at his job bond had written affectionately and encouragingly to tracy and had had the letters posted from america he had said he would be home soon and would be in touch with her would he and what would he do then bond had a luxurious moment feeling sorry for himself for the miscellaneous burdens he was carrying alone he then crushed out his cigarette and banging doors behind him got the hell out of his office and down in the lift to the discreet sideentrance that said universal export the taxi was waiting it was seven oclock as the taxi got under way bond made his plan for the evening he would first do an extremely careful packing job of his single suitcase the one that had no tricks to it have two double vodkas and tonics with a dash of angostura eat a large dish of mays speciality scrambled eggs fines herbes have two more vodkas and tonics and then slightly drunk go to bed with half a grain of second encouraged by the prospect of this cosy selfanaesthesia bond brusquely kicked his problems under the carpet of his consciousness irma la not so douce the next day at london airport james bond bowler hat rolled umbrella neatly folded times and all felt faintly ridiculous he felt totally so when he was treated with the deference due to his title and shown into the vip lounge before takeoff at the ticket desk when he had been addressed as sir hilary he had looked behind him to see who the girl was talking to he really must pull himself together and damn well be sir hilary bray bond had a double brandy and ginger ale and stood aloof from the handful of other privileged passengers in the gracious lounge trying to feel like a baronet then he remembered the real sir hilary bray perhaps now gralloching a hind with his bare hands somewhere up in the glens there was nothing of the baronet about him he really must get rid of the inverted snobbery that with its opposite is ingrained in so many of the english he must stop acting a part being a stage nobleman he would just be himself and if he gave the appearance of being rather a roughhewn baronet the easygoing kind well that at least was like the real one up in scotland bond threw down the times that he had been carrying as an extra badge of top peopleship picked up the daily express and asked for another brandy and ginger ale then with its twin jets whispering far back of the firstclass cabin the swissair caravelle was airborne and bonds mind was reaching forward to the rendezvous that had been so briefly detailed by the zurich solicitors sir hilary would be met at the airport by one of the comte de bleuvilles secretaries he would be seeing the count that day or the next bond had a moment of panic how should he address the man when he met him count monsieur le comte no he would call him nothing perhaps an occasional patronizing my dear sir in context what would blofeld look like would he have changed his appearance much probably or the fox wouldnt have kept ahead of the hounds so efficiently bonds excitement mounted as he consumed a delicious lunch served by a delicious stewardess and the winterbrown chequerboard of france fled backwards distantly below now there was scattered snow and barren trees as they crossed the tiny hillocks of the vosges then permanent snow and icefloes on the rhine a short stop at basle and then the black crisscross of zurich airport and fasten your lapstraps in three languages and they were planing down a slight bump the roar of jet deflection and then they were taxying up to the apron in front of the imposing very europeanlooking buildings decked with the gay flags of the nations at the swissair desk inside the door a woman was standing beside the reception counter as soon as bond appeared in the entrance she came forward sair hilary bray yes i am fraulein irma bunt personal secretary to the count good afternoon i hope you had a happy flight she looked like a very sunburned female wardress she had a square brutal face with hard yellow eyes her smile was an oblong hole without humour or welcome and there were sunburn blisters at the left corner of her mouth which she licked from time to time with the tip of a pale tongue wisps of brownish grey hair with a tight neat bun at the back showed from under a skiing hat with a yellow talc visor that had straps which met under her chin her strong short body was dressed in unbecomingly tight vorlage trousers topped by a grey windjacket ornamented over the left breast with a large red g topped by a coronet irma la not so douce thought bond he said yes it was very pleasant you have your baggage check will you follow me please and first your passport this way bond followed her through the passport control and out into the customs hall there were a few standersby bond noticed her head nod casually a man with a briefcase under his arm hanging about moved away bond studiously examined his baggage check beyond the scrap of cardboard he noticed the man slip into one of the row of telephone booths in the main hall outside the customs area you speak german the tongue flicked out and licked the blisters no im afraid not french perhaps a little enough for my work ah yes that is important yes bonds suitcase was unloaded off the trolley on to the barrier the woman flashed some kind of a pass at the customs officer it was very quickly done but bond caught a glimpse of her photograph and the heading bundespolizei so blofeld had got the fix in the officer said deferentially bitte sehr and chalked his symbol in the colour of the day yellow on bonds suitcase a porter took it and they walked across to the entrance when they came out pn the steps an anonymous black mercedes se saloon pulled smartly out of the parking area and slid to a stop beside them next to the chauffeur sat the man who had gone to the telephone bonds suitcase was put in the boot and they moved off fast in the direction of zurich a few hundred yards down the wide road the man beside the driver who bond noticed had been surreptitiously watching in the twin drivingmirror said softly is gut and the car turned righthanded up a side road which was marked eingang verboten mit ausnahme von eigentumer und personell von privatflugzeugen bond was amused as he ticked off the little precautions it was obvious that he was still very much on probation the car came up with the hangars to the left of the main building drove slowly between them and pulled up beside a bright orange alouette helicopter adapted by sud aviation for mountain rescue work but this one had the red g with the coronet on its fuselage so he was going to be taken for a flight rather than a ride you have travelled in one of these machines before no it is very pleasant one obtains a fine view of the alps fraulein bunts eyes were blank with disinterest they climbed up the aluminium ladder mind your head please bonds suitcase was handed up by the chauffeur it was a sixseater luxurious in red leather above and in front of them under his perspex canopy the pilot lifted a thumb the ground staff pulled away the chocks and the big blades began to move as they accelerated the men on the ground drew away shielding their faces against the whirling snow there was a slight jolt and then they were climbing fast and the crackle of radio from the control tower went silent irma bunt was across the passageway from bond the extra man was in the rear hidden behind the zuricher zeitung bond leaned sideways and said loudly against the rattle of the machine where are we heading for she pretended not to hear bond repeated his question shouting it into the alps into the high alps shouted the woman she waved towards the window it is very beautiful you like the mountains isnt it i love them shouted bond just like scotland he leaned back in his seat lit a cigarette and looked out of the window yes there was the zurichersee to port their course was more or less eastsoutheast they were flying at about feet and now there was the wallensee bond apparently uninterested took the daily express out of his briefcase and turned to the sports pages he read the paper from last page to first meticulously every now and then casting a bored glance out of the window the big range to port would be the rhatikon alps that would be the railway junction of landquart below them they held their course up the valley of the pratigau would they keep on at klosters or veer to starboard starboard it was so up the davos valley in a few minutes he would be flying over tracy a casual glance yes there was davos under its thin canopy of evening mist and smoke while above her he was still in bright sunshine at least she seemed to have had plenty of snow bond remembered the tremendous run down the parsenn those had been the days and now back on the old course again and giant peaks to right and left this must be the engadine the silvretta group away to starboard to port piz languard and ahead the bernina range diving down like a vast skijump into italy that forest of lights away to starboard must be st moritz now where bond buried himself in his paper a slight veer to port more lights pontresina and now the radio began to crackle and the seat belts sign went up bond thought it time to express open interest he gazed out below the ground was mostly in darkness but ahead the giant peaks were still golden in the dying sun they were making straight for one of them for a small plateau near its summit there was a group of buildings from which golden wires swooped down into the darkness of the valley a cable car spangled in the sun was creeping down now it had been swallowed up in tie murk the helicopter was still charging the side of the peak that towered above them now it was only a hundred feet up above the slope coming in to the plateau and the buildings the pilots arms moved on his joy stick the machine pitched a little and slowed the rotor arms swung languidly and then accelerated as the machine hovered and settled there came a slight bump as the inflated rubber floats met the snow a dying whirr from the rotor and they were there where bond knew they were in the languard range somewhere above pontresina in the engadine and their altitude would be about feet he buttoned up his raincoat and prepared for the rasping dagger of the cold anon his lungs when the door was opened irma bunt gave her boxlike smile we have arrived she said unnecessarily the door with a clatter of falling ice particles was wrenched open the last rays of the sun shone into the cabin they caught the womans yellow sun visor and shone through turning her face chinese the eyes gave out a false blaze like the glass eyes of a toy animal under the light mind your head she bent low her tight squat behind inviting an enormouskick and went down the ladder james bond followed her holding his breath against the searing impact of the arctic oxygenless air there were one or two men standing around dressed like ski guides they looked at bond with curiosity but there was no greeting bond went on across the hardtrodden snow in the wake of the woman the extra man following with his suitcase he heard the engine stutter and roar and a blizzard of snow particles stung the right side of his face then the iron grasshopper rose into the air and rattled off into the dusk it was perhaps fifty yards from where the helicopter had landed to the group of buildings bond dawdled getting preliminary bearings ahead was a long low building now ablaze with lights to the right and perhaps another fifty yards away were the outlines of the typical modern cable railhead a boxlike structure with a thick flat roof canted upwards from dose to the ground as bond examined it its lights went out presumably the last car had reached the valley and the line was closed for the night to the right of this was a large boguschalet type structure with a vast veranda sparsely lit that would be for the mass tourist trade again a typical piece of highalpine architecture down to the left beneath the slope of the plateau lights shone from a fourth building that except for its flat roof was out of sight bond was now only a few yards from the building that was obviously his destination an oblong of yellow opened invitingly as the woman went in and held the door for him the light illuminated a big sign with the red g surmounted by the coronet it said gloria klub metres privat nur fur mitglieder below in smaller letters it said alpenberghaus und restaurant piz gloria and the drooping index finger of the traditional hand pointed to the right towards the building near the cablehead so piz gloria bond walked into the inviting yellow oblong the door released by the woman closed with a pneumatic hiss inside it was deliriously warm almost hot they were in a small reception room and a youngish man with a very pale crewcut and shrewd eyes got to his feet from behind a desk and made a slight bob in their direction sir hilary is in number two weiss schon said the woman curtly and only just more politely to bond follow me please she went through a facing door and down a thicklypiled redcarpeted passage the lefthand wall was only occasionally broken by windows interspersed with fine skiing and mountain photographs on the right were at first the doors of the club rooms marked bar restaurant and toiletten then came what were obviously the doors of bedrooms bond was shown into number two it was an extremely comfortable chintzy room in the american motel style with a bathroom leading off the broad picture window was now curtained but bond knew that it must offer a tremendous view over the valley to the suvretta group above st moritz bond threw his briefcase on the double bed and gratefully disposed of his bowler hat and umbrella the extra man appeared with his suitcase placed it on the luggage stand without looking at bond and withdrew closing the door behind him the woman stayed where she was this is to your satisfaction the yellow eyes were indifferent to his enthusiastic reply she had more to say that is good now perhaps i should explain some things convey to you some laws of the club isnt it bond lit a cigarette that would certainly be helpful he put a politely interested expression on his face where are we for instance in the alps in the high alps said the woman vaguely this alp piz gloria is the property of the count together with the gemeinde the local authorities he constructed the seilbahn you have seen the cables yes this is the first year it is opened it is very popular and brings in much money there are some fine ski runs the gloria abfahrt is already famous there is also a bobsleigh run that is much greater than the cresta at st moritz you have heard of that you ski perhaps or make the bobsleigh the yellow eyes were watchful bond thought he would continue to answer no to all questions instinct told him to he said apologetically im afraid not never got around to it you know too much bound up with my books perhaps he smiled ruefully selfcritically schade that is a pity but the eyes registered satisfaction these installations bring good income for the count that is important it helps to support his lifes work the institut bond raised his eyebrows a polite fraction the institut fьr physiologische forschung it is for scientific research the count is a leader in the field of allergies you understand this is like the hay fever the unableness to eat shellfish yes oh really cant say i suffer from any myself no the laboratories are in a separate building there the count also lives in this building where we are live the patients he asks that you will not disturb them with too many questions these treatments are very delicate you understand yes of course and when may i see the count im afraid i am a very busy man fraulein bunt there are matters awaiting my attention in london bond spoke impressively the new african states much work has to be done on their flags the design of their currency their stamps their medals we are very shorthanded at the college i hope the count understands that his personal problem interesting and important though it is must take second place to the problems of government bond had got through now she was all eagerness reassurance but of course my dear sair hilary the count asks to be excused tonight but he would much like to receive you at eleven oclock tomorrow morning that is suitable certainly certainly that will give me time to marshal my documents my books perhaps bond waved to the small writing desk near the window i could have an extra table to lay these things out im afraid bond smiled deprecatingly we bookworms need a lot of space of course sair hilary it will be done at once she moved to the door and pressed a bellbutton she gestured downwards now definitely embarrassed you will have noticed that there is no door handle on this side you will ring when you wish to leave the room yes it is on account of the patients it is necessary that they have quiet it is difficult to prevent them visiting each other for the sake of gossiping it is for their good you understand bedtime is at ten oclock but there is a night staff in case you should need any service and the doors are of course not locked you may reenter your room at any time yes we meet for cocktails in the bar at six it is how do you say the restpause of the day the boxlike smile made its brief appearance my girls are much looking forward to meeting you the door opened it was one of the men dressed as guides a swarthy bullnecked man with brown mediterranean eyes one of marcanges corsican defectors in rapid bad french the woman said that another table was desired this was to be furnished during dinner the man said entendu she held the door before he could close it and he went off down the passage to the right guards quarters at the end of the passage bonds mind went on clicking up the clues then that is all for the present sair hilary the post leaves at midday we have radio telephone communications if you wish to use them may i convey any message to the count please say that i look forward greatly to meeting him tomorrow until six oclock then bond suddenly wanted to be alone with his thoughts he gestured towards his suitcase i must get myself unpacked of course of course sair hilary forgive me for detaining you and on this gracious note irma bunt closed the door with its decisive click behind her bond stood still in the middle of the room he let out his breath with a quiet hiss what the hell of a kettle of fish he would have liked to kick one of the dainty bits of furniture very hard indeed but he had noticed that of the four electric light prisms in the ceiling one was a blank protruding eye ball closedcircuit television if so what would be its range not much more than a wide circle covering the centre of the room microphones probably the whole expanse of ceiling was one that was the wartime gimmick he must he simply must assume that he was under constant supervision james bond his thoughts racing proceeded to unpack take a shower and make himself presentable for my girls ten gorgeous girls it was one of those leatherpadded bars bogusmasculine and still because of its newness smelling like the inside of a new motorcar it was made to look like a tyrolean stube by a big stone fireplace with a roaring log fire and cartwheel chandeliers with redstemmed electric candles there were many wroughtiron gimmicks walllight brackets ashtrays table lamps and the bar itself was gay with small flags and miniature liqueur bottles attractive zither music tripped out from a hidden loudspeaker it was not bond decided a place to get seriously drunk in when he closed the leatherpadded brassstudded door behind him there was a moments hush then a mounting of decibels to hide the covert glances the swift summingup bond got a fleeting impression of one of the most beautiful groups of girls he had ever seen when irma bunt hideous in some kind of homemade homespun apresski in which orange and black predominated waddled out from among the galaxy and took him in charge sair hilary she grasped his hand with a dry monkey grip how delightful isnt it come please and meet my girls it was tremendously hot in the room and bond felt the sweat bead on his forehead as he was led from table to table and shook this cool this warm this languid hand names like ruby violet pearl anne elizabeth beryl sounded in his ears but all he saw was a sea of beautiful sunburned faces and a succession of splendid sweatered young bosoms it was like being at home to the tiller or the bluebell girls at last he got to the seat that had been kept for him between irma bunt and a gorgeous bosomy blonde with large blue eyes he sat down overcome the barman hovered bond pulled himself together whisky and soda please he said and heard his voice from far away he took some time lighting a cigarette while sham stage conversation broke out among the four tables in the semicircular embrasure that must during the day be the great lookout point ten girls and irma all english no surnames no other man girls in their twenties working girls probably sort of airhostess type excited at having a man among them a personable man and a baronet to boot if that was what one did to a baronet pleased with his private joke bond turned to the blonde im terribly sorry but i didnt catch your name im ruby the voice was friendly but refined it must be quite an ordeal being the only chap among all us girls i mean well it was rather a surprise but a very pleasant one its going to be difficult getting all your names right he lowered his voice conspiratorially be an angel and run through the field so to speak bonds drink came and he was glad to find it strong he took a long but discreet pull at it he had noticed that the girls were drinking colas and squashes with a sprinkling of feminine cocktails orange blossoms daiquiris ruby was one of the ones with a daiquiri it was apparently ok to drink but he would be careful to show a gentlemanly moderation ruby seemed pleased to be able to break the ice well ill start on your right thats miss bunt the sort of matron so to speak youve met her then in the violet camelot sweater well thats violet of course then at the next table the one in the green and gold pucci shirt is anne and next to her in green is pearl shes my sort of best friend here and so it went on from one glorious golden girl to the next bond heard scraps of their conversation fritz says im not getting enough vorlage my skis keep on running away from me its the same with me a giggle my situpons black and blue the count says im getting on very well wont it be awful when we have to go i wonder how pollys doing shes been out a month now i think skols the only stuff for sunburn all those oils and creams are nothing but fryingfat and so on mostly the chatter you would expect from a group of cheerful healthy girls learning to ski except for the occasional rather awed reference to the count and the covert glances at irma bunt and bond to make sure that they were behaving properly not making too much noise while ruby continued her discreet rollcall bond tried to fix the names to the faces and otherwise add to his comprehension of this lovely but bizarre group locked up on top of a very high alp indeed the girls all seemed to share a certain basic girlguidish simplicity of manners and language the sort of girls who in an english pub you would find sitting demurely with a boy friend sipping a babycham puffing rather clumsily at a cigarette and occasionally saying pardon good girls girls who if you made a pass at them would say please dont spoil it all men only want one thing or huffily please take your hand away and there were traces of many accents accents from all over britain the broad vowels of lancashire the hit of wales the burr of scotland the adenoids of refined cockney yours truly foxed concluded bond as ruby finished with and thats beryl in the pearls and twinset now do you think youve got us all straight bond looked into the round blue eyes that now held a spark of animation frankly no and i feel like one of those comic film stars who get snarled up in a girls school you know sort of st trinians she giggled oh but were not at all like st trinians those awful girls how could you ever say such a thing just a thought said bond airily now then how about another drink oh thenks awfully bond turned to fraulein bunt and you miss bunt thank you sair hilary an applejuice if you please violet the fourth at their table said demurely that she wouldnt have another coke they give me wind she explained oh violet rubys sense of the proprieties was outraged how can you say such a thing well anyway they do said violet obstinately they make me hiccup no harm in saying that is there good old manchester thought bond he got up and went to the bar wondering how he was going to plough on through this and other evenings he ordered the drinks and had a brainwave he would break the ice by hook or by crook he would become the life and soul of the party he asked for a tumbler and that its run should be dipped in water then he picked up a paper cocktail napkin and went back to the table he sat down now he said as eyes goggled at him if we were paying for our drinks ill show you how wed decide who should pay i learned this in the army he placed the tumbler in the middle of the table opened the paper napkin and spread the centre tightly over the top so that it clung to the moist edge of the glass he took his small change out of his pocket selected a fivecentime piece and dropped it gently on to the centre of the stretched tissue now then he announced remembering that the last time he had played this game had been in the dirtiest bar in singapore who else smokes we need three others with lighted cigarettes violet was the only one at their table irma clapped her hands with authority elizabeth beryl come over here and come and watch girls sair hilary is making the joke game the girls clustered round chattering happily at the diversion whats he doing whats going to happen how do you play now then said bond feeling like the games director on a cruise shipthis is for who pays for the drinks one by one you take a puff at your cigarette knock off the ash like this and touch the top of the paper with the lighted end just enough to burn a tiny hole like this the paper sparkled briefly now violet then elizabeth then beryl the point is the paper gets like a sort of cobweb with the coin just supported in the middle the person who burns the last hole and makes the coin drop has to pay for the drinks see now then violet there were squeaks of excitement what a lovely game oh beryl look out lovely heads craned over bond lovely hair brushed his cheek quickly the three girls got the trick of very delicately touching a space that would not collapse the cobweb until bond who considered himself an expert at the game decided to be chivalrous and purposely burned a vital strand with the chink of the coin falling into the glass there was a burst of excited laughter and applause so you see girls it was as if irma bunt had invented the game sair hilary pays isnt it a most delightful pastime and now she looked at her mannish wristwatch we must finish our drinks it is five minutes to supper time there were cries of oh one more game miss bunt but bond politely rose with his whisky in his hand we will play again tomorrow i hope its not going to start you all off smoking im sure it was invented by the tobacco companies there was laughter but the girls stood admiringly round bond what a sport he was and they had all expected a stuffed shirt bond felt justifiably proud of himself the ice had been broken he had got them all minutely on his side now they were all chums together from now on he would be able to get to talk to them without frightening them feeling reasonably pleased with his gambit he followed the tight pants of irma bunt into the diningroom next door it was seventhirty bond suddenly felt exhausted exhausted with the prospect of boredom exhausted with playing the most difficult role of his career exhausted with the enigma of blofeld and the piz gloria what in hell was the bastard up to he sat down on the right of irma bunt in the same placing as for drinks with ruby on his right and violet dark demure selfeffacing opposite him and glumly opened his napkin blofeld had certainly spent money on his eyrie their three tables in a remote corner by the long curved curtained window occupied only a fraction of the space in the big low luxuriously appointed mockgerman baroque room ornate with candelabra suspended from the stomachs of flying cherubs festooned with heavy gilt plasterwork solemnized by the dark portraits of anonymous noblemen blofeld must be pretty certain he was here to stay what was the investment certainly not less than a million sterling even assuming a fat mortgage from swiss banks on the cost of the cable railway to lease an alp put up a cable railway on mortgage with the engineers and the local district council participating that bond knew was one of the latest havens for fugitive funds if you were successful if you and the council could bribe or bully the local farmers to allow rightofway through their pastures cut swaths through the treeline for the cable pylons and the skiruns the rest was publicity and amenities for the public to eat their sandwiches add to that the snobappeal of a posh heavily restricted club such as bond imagined this during the daytime to be the coroneted g and the mystique of a research institute run by a count and you were off to the races skiing today bond had read was the most widely practised sport in the world it sounded unlikely but then one reckoned the others largely by spectators skiers were participants and bigger spenders on equipment than in other sports clothes boots skis bindings and now the whole apresski routine which took care of the day from four oclock when the sun went onwards were a tremendous industry if you could lay your hands on a good alp which blofeld had somehow managed to do you really had it good mortgages paid off snow was the joker but in the engadine at this height you would be all right for that in three or four years and then jam for ever one certainly had to hand it to him it was time to make the going again resignedly bond turned to fraulein bunt fraulein bunt please explain to me what is the difference between a piz and an alp and a berg the yellow eyes gleamed with academic enthusiasm ah sair hilary but that is an interesting question it had not occurred to me before now let me see she gazed into the middle distance a piz that is only a local name in this department of switzerland for a peak an alp that one would think would be smaller than a berg a hill perhaps or an upland pasture as compared with a mountain but that is not so these she waved her hand are all alps and yet they are great mountains it is the same in austria certainly in the tyrol but in germany in bavaria for instance which is my home land there it is all bergs no sair hilary the boxlike smile was switched on and off i cannot help you but why do you ask in my profession said bond prosily the exact meaning of words is vital now before we met for cocktails it amused me to look up your surname bunt in my books of reference what i found fraulein was most interesting bunt it seems is german for gay happy in england the name has almost certainly been corrupted into bounty perhaps even into bronte because the grandfather of the famous literary family by that name had in fact changed his name from the less aristocratic name of brunty now this is most interesting can you remember if your ancestors had any connexion with england there is the dukedom of bronte you see which nelson assumed it would be interesting to establish a connexion the penny dropped a duchess irma bunt hooked went off into a dreary chronicle of her forebears including proudly distant relationship with a graf von bunt bond listened politely prodding her back to the immediate past she gave the name of her father and mother bond filed them away he now had enough to find out in due course exactly who irma bunt was what a splendid trap snobbery was how right sable basilisk had been there is a snob in all of us and only through snobbery could bond have discovered who the parents of this woman were bond finally calmed down the womans momentary fever and the head waiter who had been politely hovering presented giant menus covered in violet ink there was everything from caviar down to double mokka au whisky irlandais there were also many spйcialitйs gloria poulet gloria homard gloria tournedos gloria and so on bond despite his forswearing of specialties decided to give the chicken a chance he said so and was surprised by the enthusiasm with which ruby greeted his choice oh how right you are sir hilary i adore chicken too i absolutely dote on it can i have that too please miss bunt there was such surprising fervour in her voice that bond watched irma bunts face what was that matronly gleam in her eye as she gave her approval it was more than approval for a good appetite among her charges there was enthusiasm even triumph there odd and it happened again when violet stipulated plenty of potatoes with her tournedos i simply love potatoes she explained to bond her eyes shining dont you theyre fine agreed bond when youre taking plenty of exercise that is oh theyre just darling enthused violet arent they miss bunt very good indeed my dear very good for you too and fritz i will just have the mixed salad with some cottage cheese she gave the caricature of a simper alas she spoke to bond i have to watch my figure these young things take plenty of exercise while i must stay in my office and do the paperwork isnt it at the next table bond heard the girl with the scottish burr her voice full of saliva ask that her aberdeen angus steak should be cooked very rare indeed guid and bluidy she emphasized what was this wondered bond a gathering of beautiful ogresses or was this a day off from some rigorous diet he felt completely clueless out of his depth well he would just go on digging he turned to ruby you see what i mean about surnames fraulein bunt may even have distant claim to an english title now whats yours for instance ill see what i can make of it fraulein bunt broke in sharply no surnames here sair hilary it is a rule of the house we use only first names for the girls it is part of the counts treatment it is bound up with a change a transference of identity to help the cure you understand no im afraid thats way out of my depth said bond cheerfully no doubt the count will explain some of these matters to you tomorrow he has special theories one day the world will be startled when he reveals his methods im sure said bond politely well now he searched for a subject that would leave his mind free to roam on its own tell me about your skiing how are you getting on dont do it myself im afraid perhaps i shall pick up some tips watching your classes it was an adequate ball which went bouncing on between ruby and violet and bond kept it in play while their food came and proved delicious poulet gloria was spatchcocked with a mustardandcream sauce the girls fell silent over their dishes consuming them with polite but concentrated greed there was a similar pause in the chatter at the other tables bond made conversation about the decor of the room and this gave him a chance to have a good look at the waiters there were twelve of them in sight it was not difficult to sum them up as three corsicans three germans three vaguely balkan faces turks bulgars or yugoslavs and three obvious slavs there would probably be three frenchmen in the kitchen was this the old pattern of spectre the welltried communistcell pattern of three men from each of the great gangster and secretservice organizations in europe were the three slavs exsmersh men the whole lot of them looked tough enough had that quiet smell of the pro the man at the airport was one of them bond recognized others as the reception steward and the man who had come to his room about the table he heard the girls calling them fritz joseph ivan achmed and some of them were ski guides during the day well it was a nice little setup if bond was right bond excused himself after dinner on the grounds of work he went to his room and laid out his books and papers on the desk and on the extra table that had been provided he bent over them studiously while his mind reviewed the day at ten oclock he heard the goodnights of the girls down the corridor and the click of the doors shutting he undressed turned the thermostat on the wall down from eightyfive to sixty switched off the light and lay on his back for a while staring up into the darkness then he gave an authentic sigh of exhaustion for the microphones if any and turned over on his side and went to sleep later much later he was awakened by a very soft murmuring that seemed to come from somewhere under the floor but very very far away he identified it as a minute spidery whispering that went on and on but he could not make out any words and he finally put it down to the centralheating pipes turned over and went to sleep again death for breakfast james bond awoke to a scream it was a terrible masculine scream out of hell it fractionally held its first high piercing note and then rapidly diminished as if the man had jumped off a cliff it came from the right from somewhere near the cable station perhaps even in bonds room muffled by the double windows it was terrifying enough outside it must have been shattering bond jumped up and pulled back the curtains not knowing what scene of panic of running men would meet his eyes but the only man in sight was one of the guides walking slowly stolidly up the beaten snowpath from the cable station to the club the spacious wooden veranda that stretched from the wall of the club out over the slope of the mountain was empty but tables had been laid for breakfast and the upholstered chaiseslongue for the sunbathers had already been drawn up in their meticulous colourful rows the sun was blazing down out of a crystal sky bond looked at his watch it was eight oclock work began early in this place people died early for that had undoubtedly been the deathscream he turned back into his room and rang the bell it was one of the three men bond had suspected of being russians bond became the officer and gentleman what is your name peter sir piotr bond longed to say and how are all my old friends from smersh he didnt he said what was that scream pliss the granitegrey eyes were careful a man screamed just now from over by the cable station what was it it seems there has been an accident sir you wish for breakfast he produced a large menu from under his arm and held it out clumsily what sort of an accident it seems that one of the guides has fallen how could this man have known that only minutes after the scream is he badly hurt is possible sir the eyes surely trained in investigation held bonds blandly you wish for breakfast the menu was once again nudged forward bond said with sufficient concern well i hope the poor chaps all right he took the menu and ordered let me know if you hear what happened there will no doubt be an announcement if the matter is serious thank you sir the man withdrew it was the scream that triggered bond into deciding that above all things he must keep fit he suddenly felt that despite all the mystery and its demand for solution there would come a moment when he would need all his muscle reluctantly he proceeded to a quarter of an hour of kneebends and pressups and deepbreathing chestexpansions exercises of the skiing muscles he guessed that he might have to get away from this place but quick he took a shower and shaved breakfast was brought by peter any more news about this poor guide i have heard no more sir it concerns the outdoor staff i work inside the club bond decided to play it down he must have slipped and broken an ankle poor chap thank you peter thank you sir did the granite eyes contain a sneer james bond put his breakfast on the desk and with some difficulty managed to prise open the double window he removed the small bolster that lay along the sill between the panes to keep out draughts and blew away the accumulated dust and small flycorpses the cold savourless air of high altitudes rushed into the room and bond went to the thermostat and put it up to as a counterattack while his head below the level of the sill he ate a spare continental breakfast he heard the chatter of the girls assembling outside on the terrace the voices were high with excitement and debate bond could hear every word i really dont think sarah should have told on him but he came in in the dark and started mucking her about you mean actually interfering with her so she says if id been her id have done the same and hes such a beast of a man was you mean which one was it anyway one of the yugos bertil oh i know yes he was pretty horrible he had such dreadful teeth you oughtnt to say such things of the dead how do you know hes dead what happened to him anyway he was one of the two you see spraying the start of the bobrun you see them with hoses every morning its to get it good and icy so theyll go faster fritz told me he somehow slipped lost his balance or something and that was that he just went off down the run like a sort of human bobsleigh elizabeth how can you be so heartless about it well thats what happened you asked but couldnt he save himself dont be idiotic its sheet ice a mile of it and the bobs get up to sixty miles an hour he hadnt got a prayer but didnt he fly off at one of the bends fritz said he went all the way to the bottom crashed into the tuning hut but fritz says he must have been dead in the first hundred yards or so oh heres franz franz can i have scrambled eggs and coffee and tell them to make the scrambled eggs runny like i always have them yes miss and you miss the waiter took the orders and bond heard his boots creak off across the boards the sententious girl was being sententious again well all i can say is it must have been some kind of punishment for what he tried to do to sarah you always get paid off for doing wrong dont be ridiculous god would never punish you as severely as that the conversation followed this new hare off into a maze of infantile morality and the scriptures bond lit a cigarette and sat back gazing thoughtfully at the sky no the girl was right god wouldnt mete out such a punishment but blofeld would had there been one of those blofeld meetings at which before the full body of men the crime and the verdict had been announced had this bertil been taken out and dropped on to the bobrun or had his companion been quietly dealt the card of death told to give the sinner the trip or the light push that was probably all that had been needed more likely the quality of the scream had been of sudden fully realized terror as the man fell scrabbled at the ice with his fingernails and boots and then as he gathered speed down the polished blue gully the bunding horror of the truth and what a death bond had once gone down the cresta from top to prove to himself that he dared helmeted masked against the blast of air padded with leather and foam rubber that had still been sixty seconds of naked fear even now he could remember how his limbs had shaken when he rose stiffly from the flimsy little skeleton bob at the end of the runout and that had been a bare threequarters of a mile this man or the flayed remains of him had done over a mile had he gone down head or feet first had his body started tumbling had he tried while consciousness remained to brake himself over the edge of one of the early scientifically banked bends with the unspiked toe of this boot or that no after the first few yards he would already have been going too fast for any rational thought or action god what a death a typical blofeld death a typical spectre revenge for the supreme crime of disobedience that was the way to keep discipline in the ranks so concluded bond as he cleared the tray away and got down to his books spectre walks again but down what road this time at ten minutes to eleven irma bunt came for him after an exchange of affabilities bond gathered up an armful of books and papers and followed her round the back of the club building and along a narrow welltrodden path past a sign that said privat eintritt verboten the rest of the building whose outlines bond had seen the night before came into view it was an undistinguished but powerfully built onestorey affair made of local granite blocks with a flat cement roof from which at the far end protruded a small professionallooking radio mast which bond assumed had given the pilot his landing instructions on the previous night and which would also serve as the ears and mouth of blofeld the building was on the very edge of the plateau and below the final peak of piz gloria but out of avalanche danger beneath it the mountain sloped sharply away until it disappeared over a cliff far below again was the tree line and the bernina valley leading up to pontresina the glint of a railway track and the tiny caterpillar of a long goods train of the rhдtische bahn on its way presumably over the bernina pass into italy the door to the building gave the usual pneumatic hiss and the central corridor was more or less a duplicate of the one at the club but here there were doors on both sides and no pictures it was dead quiet and there was no hint of what went on behind the doors bond put the question laboratories said irma bunt vaguely all laboratories and of course the lectureroom then the counts private quarters he lives with his work sair hilary good show they came to the end of the corridor irma bunt knocked on the facing door herein james bond was tremendously excited as he stepped over the threshold and heard the door sigh shut behind him he knew what not to expect the original blofeld last years model about twenty stone tall pale bland face with black crewcut black eyes with the whites showing all round like mussolinis ugly thin mouth long pointed hands and feet but he had no idea what alterations had been contrived on the envelope that contained the man but monsieur le comte de bleuville who now rose from the chaiselongue on the small private veranda and came in out of the sun into the penumbra of the study his hands outstretched in welcome was surely not even a distant relative of the man on the files bonds heart sank this man was tallish yes and all right his hands and naked feet were long and thin but there the resemblance ended the count had longish carefullytended almost dandified hair that was a fine silvery white his ears that should have been close to his head stuck out slightly and where they should have had heavy lobes had none the body that should have weighed twenty stone now naked save for a black woollen slip was not more than twelve stone and there were no signs of the sagging flesh that comes from middleaged weightreduction the mouth was full and friendly with a pleasant upturned but perhaps rather unwavering smile the forehead was serrated with wrinkles above a nose that while the files said it should be short and squat was aquiline and round the right nostril eaten away poor chap by what looked like the badge of tertiary syphilis the eyes well there might be something there if one could see them but they were only rather frightening darkgreen pools the count wore presumably against the truly dangerous sun at these altitudes darkgreen tinted contact lenses bond unloaded his books on to a conveniently empty table and took the warm dry hand my dear sir hilary this is indeed a pleasure blofelds voice had been said to be sombre and even this voice was light and full of animation bond said to himself furiously by god this has got to be blofeld he said im so sorry i couldnt come on the st theres a lot going on at the moment ah yes so fraulein bunt told me these new african states they must indeed present a problem now shall we settle down here he waved towards his desk or shall we go outside you see he gestured at his brown body i am a heliotrope a sunworshipper so much so that i have had to have these lenses devised for me otherwise the ultraviolet rays at this altitude he left the phrase unfinished i havent seen that kind of lens before after all i can leave the books here and fetch them if we need them for reference i have the case pretty clear in my mind and bond smiled chummily it would be nice to go back to the fop with something of a sunburn bond had equipped himself at lillywhites with clothing he thought would be both appropriate and sensible he had avoided the modern elasticized vorlage trousers and had chosen the more comfortable but oldfashioned type of skitrouser in a smooth cloth above these he wore an aged black windcheater that he used for golf over his usual white seaisland cotton shirt he had wisely reinforced this outfit with long and ugly cotton and wool pants and vests he had conspicuously brandnew skiboots with powerful anklestraps he said then id better take off my sweater he did so and followed the count out on to the veranda the count lay back again in his upholstered aluminium chaiselongue bond drew up a light chair made of similar materials he placed it also facing the sun but at an angle so that he could watch the counts face and now said the comte de bleuville what have you got to tell me that necessitated this personal visit he turned his fixed smile on bond the darkgreen glass eyes were unfathomable not of course that the visit is not most welcome most welcome now then sir hilary bond had been well trained in two responses to this obvious first question the first was for the event that the count had lobes to his ears the second if he had not he now in measured serious tones launched himself into number two my dear count the form of address seemed dictated by the silvery hair by the charm of the counts manners there are occasions in the work of the college when research and paper work are simply not enough we have as you know come to a difficult passage in our work on your case i refer of course to the hiatus between the disappearance of the de bleuville line around the time of the french revolution and the emergence of the blofeld family or families in the neighbourhood of augsburg and bond paused impressively in the latter context i may later have a proposal that i hope will find favour with you but what i am coming to is this you have already expended serious funds on our work and it would not have been fair to suggest that the researches should go forward unless there was a substantial ray of hope in the sky the possibility of such a ray existed but it was of such a nature that it definitely demanded a physical confrontation is that so and for what purpose may i inquire james bond recited sable basilisks examples of the habsburg lip the royal tail and the others he then leaned forward in his chair for emphasis and such a physical peculiarity exists in connexion with the de bleuvilles you did not know this i was not aware of it no what is it i have good news for you count bond smiled his congratulations all the de bleuville effigies or portraits that we have been able to trace have been distinctive in one vital respect in one inherited characteristic it appears that the family had no lobes to their ears the counts hands went up to his ears and felt them was he acting i see he said slowly yes i see he reflected and you had to see this for yourself my word or a photograph would not have been sufficient bond looked embarrassed i am sorry count but that was the ruling of garter king of arms i am only a junior freelance research worker for one of the pursuivants he in turn takes his orders in these matters from above i hope you will appreciate that the college has to be extremely strict in cases concerned with a most ancient and honourable title such as the one in question the dark pools aimed themselves at bond like the muzzles aa of guns now that you have seen what you came to see you regard the title as still in question this was the worst hurdle what i have seen certainly allows me to recommend that the work should continue count and i would say that our chances of success have greatly multiplied i have brought out the materials for a first sketch of the line of descent and that in a matter of days i could lay before you but alas as i have said there are still many gaps and it is most important for me to satisfy sable basilisk particularly about the stages of your familys migration from augsburg to gdynia it would be of the greatest help if i might question you closely about your parentage in the male line even details about your father and grandfather would be of the greatest assistance and then of course it would be of the utmost importance if you could spare a day to accompany me to augsburg to see if the handwriting of these blofeld families in the archives their christian names and other family details awaken any memories or connexions in your mind the rest would then remain with us at the college i could spare no more than a week on this work but i am at your disposal if you wish it the count got to his feet bond followed suit he walked casually over to the railing and admired the view would this bedraggled fly be taken bond now desperately hoped so during the interview he had come to one certain conclusion there was not a single one of the peculiarities in the counts appearance that could not have been achieved by good acting and by the most refined facial and stomach surgery applied to the original blofeld only the eyes could not have been tampered with and the eyes were obscured you think that with patient work even with the inclusion of a few question marks where the connecting links are obscure i would achieve an acte de notoriete that would satisfy the minister of justice in paris most certainly lied bond with the authority of the college in support the fixed smile widened minutely that would give me much satisfaction sir hilary i am the comte de bleuville i am certain of it in my heart in my veins there was real fervour in the voice but i am determined that my title shall be officially recognized you will be most welcome to remain as my guest and i shall be constantly at your disposal to help with your researches bond said politely but with a hint of weariness of resignation all right count and thank you i will go and make a start straight away two near misses bond was shown out of the building by a man in a white coat with the conventional white gauze of the laboratory worker over the lower half of his face bond attempted no conversation he was now well inside the fortress but he would have to continue to walk on tiptoe and be damned careful where he put his feet he returned to his room and got out one of the giant sheets of squared paper with which he had been furnished he sat down at his table and wrote firmly at the top centre of the paper guillaume de bleuville now there were five hundred years of de bleuvilles with their wives and children to be copied down from his books and notes that would fill up an impressive number of pages with impeccable fact he could certainly spread that chore over three days interspersed with more tricky work gassing with blofeld about the blofeld end of the story fortunately there were some english blofields he could throw in as makeweight and some bluefields and blumfields he could start some pretty hares running in those directions and in between these idiotic activities he would ferret and ferret away at the mystery of what in hell the new blofeld the new spectre were up to one thing was certain they had already been through his belongings before going for his interview bond had gone into the bathroom away from that seemingly watchful hole in the ceiling and had painfully pulled out half a dozen of his hairs these while he had selected the books he needed to take with him he had dispersed inconspicuously among his other papers and in his passport the hairs were all gone someone had been through all his books he got up and went to the chest of drawers ostensibly for a handkerchief yes the careful patterns in which he had laid out his things had all been minutely disturbed unemotionally he went back to his work thanking heaven he had travelled as clean as a whistle but by god hed have to keep his cover solid he didnt at all like the thought of that oneway trip down the bobrun bond got as far as and then the noise from the veranda became too distracting anyway he had done a respectable stint almost to the bottom of the giant page he would go out and do a little very discreet exploring he wanted to get his bearings or rather confirm them and this would be a perfectly reasonable activity for a newcomer he had left his door into the passage ajar he went out and along to the reception lounge where the man in the plum coat was busy entering the names of the mornings visitors in a book bonds greeting was politely answered there was a skiroom and workshop to the left of the exit bond wandered in one of the balkan types was at the workbench screwing a new binding on to a ski he looked up and went on with his work while bond gazed with seeming curiosity at the ranks of skis standing along the wall things had changed since his day the bindings were quite different and designed it seemed to keep the heel dead flat on the ski and there were new safety releases many of the skis were of metal and the skisticks were fibreglass lances that looked to bond extremely dangerous in the event of a bad fall bond wandered over to the workbench and feigned interest in what the man was doing in fact he had seen something that excited him very much an untidy pile of lengths of thin plastic strip for the boot to rest on in the binding so that on the shiny surface snow would not ball under the sole bond leaned over the workbench resting on his right elbow and commented on the precision of the mans work the man grunted and concentrated all the more closely to avoid further conversation bonds left hand slid under his leaning arm secured one of the strips and slid it up his sleeve he made a further inane comment which was not answered and strolled out of the skiroom as bond strolled along the path that led to the cable station he transferred the plastic strip from his sleeve to his trouser pocket feeling pleased with himself he had at least provided himself with one tool the traditional burglars tool for opening the yaletype locks that secured the doors away from the club house to which only a thin trickle of smartlooking people were making their way he got into the usual mountaintop crowd people swarming out of the cablehead skiers wobbling or schussing down the easy nursery slopes on the plateau little groups marshalled under individual teachers and guides from the valley the terrace of the public restaurant was already crowded with the underprivileged who hadnt got the money or the connexions to join the club he walked below it on the welltrampled snow and stood among the skiers at the top of the first plunging schuss of the gloria run a large noticeboard crowned with the g and the coronet announced gloria abfahrt then below rot freie fahrt gelb freie fahrt schwarz gesperrt meaning that the red and yellow runs were open but the black dosed presumably because of avalanche danger below this again was a painted metal map of the three runs bond had a good look at it reflecting that it might be wise to commit to memory the red which was presumably the easiest and most popular there were red yellow and black marker flags on the map and bond could see the actual flags fluttering way down the mountain until the runs studded with tiny moving figures disappeared to the left round the shoulder of the mountain and under the cable railway the red seemed to continue to zigzag under the cable and between the few high pylons until it met the tree line then there was a short stretch of woodrunning until the final easy schuss across the undulating lower meadows to the bottom cablehead beyond which lay the main railway line and then the pontresinasamaden road bond tried to get it all fixed in his mind then he watched some of the starts these varied between the arrowlike dive of the kannonen the stars who took the terrific schuss dead straight in a low crouch with their sticks jauntily tucked under their armpits the average amateur who braked perhaps three or four times on his way down and the terrified novice who with stuckout behind stemmed his way down his skis angled and edged like a snowplough with occasional straight runs diagonally across the polished slope dashing little sprints that usually ended in a mild crash as he ran off the flattened surface into the thick powder snow that edged the wide beaten piste the scene was the same as a thousand others bond had witnessed when as a teenager he learned his skiing in the old hannes schneider school at st anton in the arlberg he had got pretty good and had won his golden k but the style in those days was rudimentary compared with what he was now witnessing from the occasional expert who zoomed down and away from beside him today the metal skis seemed to run faster and truer than the old steeledged hickory there was less shoulderwork and the art of wedeln a gentle waggling of the hips was a revelation would it be as effective in deep new snow as it was on the wellbeaten piste bond was doubtful but he was envious of it it was so much more graceful than the old arlberg crouch bond wondered how he would fare on this terrific run he would certainly not dare to take the first schuss straight he would brake at least twice perhaps there and there and his legs would be trembling before he had been going for five minutes his knees and ankles and wrists would be giving out he must get on with his exercises bond excited left the scene and followed arrows that pointed to the gloria express bobrun it lay on the other side of the cable station there was a small wooden hut the starters hut with telephonewires connected to the station and beneath the cable station a little garage that housed the bobsleighs and oneman skeletonbobs a chain with a notice on itsaying abfahrten tдglich was stretched across the wide mouth of the gulch of blue ice that curved away to the left and then disappeared over the shoulder here again was a metal map showing the zigzag course of the run down into the valley in deference to the english traditions at the sport outstanding curves and hazards were marked with names such as dead mans leap whizzbang straight battling s hells delight the boneshaker and the finishing straight down paradise alley bond visualized the scene that morning heard again that heartrending scream yes that death certainly had the old blofeld touch sair hilary sair hilary startled out of his thoughts bond turned fraulein irma bunt her short arms akimbo was standing on the path to the club lunch time lunch coming bond called back and strolled up the slope towards her he noted that even in that hundred yards his breathing was shallow and his limbs were heavy this blasted height he really must get into training he came up with her she looked surly he said that he was sorry he had not noticed the time she said nothing the yellow eyes surveyed him with active dislike before she turned her back and led the way along the path bond looked back over the morning what had he done had he made a mistake well he just might have better reinsure as they came through the entrance into the reception lounge bond said casually oh by the way fraulein bunt i was in the skiroom just now she halted bond noticed that the head of the receptionist bent a fraction lower over his visitors book yes bond took the length of plastic out of his pocket i found just what i wanted he stitched a smile of innocent pleasure on his face like an idiot i forgot to bring a ruler with me and there were these things on the workbench just right so i borrowed one i hope that was all right of course ill leave it behind when i go but for these family trees you know bond sketched a series of descending straight lines in the air one has to get them on the right levels i hope you dont mind he smiled charmingly i was going to confess the nest time i saw you irma bunt veiled her eyes it is of no consequence in future anything you need you will perhaps ring for isnt it the count wishes you to have every facility now she gestured if you will perhaps go out on the terrace you will be shown to our table i will be with you in a moment bond went through the restaurant door several of the interior tables were occupied by those who had had enough sun he went across the room and out through the now open french windows the man fritz who appeared to be the maitre dhotel came towards him through the crowded tables his eyes too were cold with hostility he held up a menu please to follow me bond followed him to the table up against the railing ruby and violet were already there bond felt almost lighthearted with relief at having clean hands again by god he must pay attention take care this time he had got away with it and he still had the strip of plastic had he sounded innocent enough stupid enough he sat down and ordered a double mediumdry vodka martini on the rocks with lemon peel and edged his feet up against rubys she didnt withdraw hers she smiled violet smiled they all started talking at once it was suddenly a beautiful day fraulein bunt appeared and took her place she was gracious again i am so pleased to hear that you will be staying with us for a whole week sair hilary you enjoyed your interview with the count is he not an interesting man very interesting unfortunately our talk was too short and we discussed only my own subject i was longing to ask him about his research work i hope he didnt think me very rude irma bunts face closed perceptibly i am sure not the count does not often like to discuss his work in these specialized scientific fields you understand there is much jealousy and i am sorry to say much intellectual thieving the boxlike smile i do not of course refer to yourself my dear sair hilary but to scientists less scrupulous than the count to spies from the chemical companies that is why we keep ourselves very much to ourselves in our little eagles nest up here we have total privacy even the police in the valley are most cooperative in safeguarding us from intruders they appreciate what the count is doing the study of allergies just so the maitre dhotel was standing by her side his feet came together with a perceptible click menus were handed round and bonds drink came he took a long pull at it and ordered obufs gloria and a green salad chicken again for ruby cold cuts with stacks of potatoes for violet irma bunt ordered her usual cottage cheese and salad dont you girls eat anything but chicken and potatoes is this something to do with your allergies ruby began well yes in a way somehow ive come to simply love irma bunt broke in sharply now then ruby no discussion of treatments you remember not even with our good friend sair hilary she waved a hand towards the crowded tables around them a most interesting crowd do you not find sair hilary everybody who is anybody we have quite taken the international set away from gstaad and st moritz that is your duke of marlborough over there with such a gay party of young things and near by that is mr whitney and lady daphne straight is she not chic they are both wonderful skiers and that beautiful girl with the long fair hair at the big table that is ursula andress the film star what a wonderful tan she has and sir george dunbar he always has the most enchanting companions the boxlike smile why we only need the aga khan and perhaps your duke of kent and we would have everybody but everybody is it not sensational for the first season bond said it was the lunch came bonds eggs were delicious chopped hardboiled eggs with a cream and cheese sauce laced with english mustard gratings in a copper dish bond commented on the excellence of the cooking thank you said irma bunt we have three expert frenchmen in the kitchen men are very good at cooking is it not bond felt rather than saw a man approaching their table he came up to bond he was a militarylooking man of about bonds age and he had a puzzled expression on his face he bowed slightly to the ladies and said to bond excuse me but i saw your name in the visitors book it is hilary bray isnt it bonds heart sank this situation had always been a possibility and he had prepared a fumbling counter to it but this was the worst possible moment with that damned woman watching and listening bond said yes it is with heartiness sir hilary bray the pleasant face was even more puzzled bond got to his feet and stood with his back to his table to irma bunt thats right he took out his handkerchief and blew his nose to obscure the next question which might be fatal in the lovat scouts during the war ah said bond he looked worried lowered his voice appropriately youre thinking of my first cousin from ben trilleachan died six months ago poor chap i inherited the title oh lord the mans puzzlement cleared grief took its place sorry to hear that great pal of mine in the war funny i didnt see anything about it in the times always read the births marriages and deaths what was it bond felt the sweat running down under his arms fell off one of those bloody mountains of his broke his neck my god poor chap but he was always fooling around the tops by himself i must write to jenny at once he held out his hand well sorry to have butted in thought this was a funny place to find old hilary well so long and sorry again he moved off between the tables out of the corner of his eye bond saw him rejoin a very englishlooking table of men and obviously wives to whom he began talking animatedly bond sat down reached for his drink and drained it and went back to his eggs the womans eyes were on him he felt the sweat running down his face he took out his handkerchief and mopped at it gosh its hot out here in the sun that was some pal of my first cousins my cousin had the same name collateral branch died not long ago poor chap he frowned sadly didnt know this man from adam nicelooking fellow bond looked bravely across the table do you know any of his party fraulein bunt without looking at the party fraulein bunt said shortly no i do not know everyone who comes here the yellow eyes were still inquisitive holding his but it was a curious coincidence were you very alike you and your cousin oh absolutely said bond gushing spit image often used to get taken for each other he looked across at the english group thank god they were picking up their things and going they didnt look particularly smart or prosperous probably staying at pontresina or under the exofficers scheme at st moritz typical english skiing party with any luck they were just doing the big runs in the neighbour hood one by one bond reviewed the way the conversation had gone while coffee came and he made cheerful small talk with ruby whose foot was again clamped against his about her skiing progress that morning well he decided the woman couldnt have heard much of it with all the clatter and chatter from the surrounding tables but it had been a narrow squeak a damned narrow squeak the second of the day so much for walking on tiptoe inside the enemy lines not good enough definitely not good enough princess ruby my dear sable basilisk i arrived safely by helicopter if you please at this beautiful place called piz gloria feet up somewhere in the engadine most comfortable with an excellent male staff of several nationalities and a most efficient secretary to the count named fraulein irma bunt who tells me that she comes from munich i had a most profitable interview with the count this morning as a result of which he wishes me to stay on for a week to complete the first draft of his genealogical tree i do hope you can spare me for so long i warned the count that we had much work to do on the new commonwealth states he himself though busily engaged on what sounds like very publicspirited research work on allergies and their cause has agreed to see me daily in the hope that together we may be able to bridge the gap between the migration of the de bleuvilles from france and their subsequent transference as blofelds from augsburg to gdynia i have suggested to him that we conclude the work with a quick visit to augsburg for the purposes you and i discussed but he has not yet given me his decision please tell my cousin jenny bray that she may be hearing from a friend of her late husband who apparently served with him in the lovat scouts he came up to me at lunch today and took me for the other hilary quite a coincidence working conditions are excellent we have complete privacy here secure from the madding world of skiers and very sensibly the girls are confined to their rooms after ten at night to put them out of the temptation of roaming and gossiping they seem a very nice lot from all over the united kingdom but rather on the dumb side now for my most interesting item the count has not got lobes to his ears isnt that good news he also is of a most distinguished appearance and bearing with a fine head of silvery hair and a charming smile his slim figure also indicates noble extraction unfortunately he has to wear darkgreen contact lenses because of weak eyes and the strength of the sunshine at this height and his aquiline nose is blemished by a deformed nostril which i would have thought could easily have been put right by facial surgery he speaks impeccable english with a gay lilt to his voice and i am sure that we will get on very well now to get down to business it would be most helpful if you would get in touch with the old printers of the almanach de gotha and see if they can help us over our gaps in the lineage they may have some traces cable anything helpful with the new evidence of the earlobes i am quite confident that the connexion exists thats all for now yours ever hilary bray ps dont tell my mother or she will be worried for my safety among the eternal snows but we had a nasty accident here this morning one of the staff a yugoslav it seems slipped on the bobrun and went the whole way to the bottom terrible business hes apparently being buried in pontresina tomorrow do you think we ought to send some kind of a wreath hb bond read the letter several tunes yes that would giv the officers in charge of operation corona plenty to bite on particularly the hint that they should get the dead mans name from the registrar in pontresina and he had covered up a bit on the bray mixup when the letter as bond was sure it would be was steamed open and photostated before dispatch they might of course just destroy it to prevent this the bit of bogosity about the almanach de gotha would be a clincher this source of heraldic knowledge hadnt been mentioned before it would surely excite the interest of blofeld bond rang the bell handed out the letter for dispatch and got back to his work which consisted initially of going into the bathroom with the strip of plastic and his scissors in his pocket and snipping two inchwide strips off the end these would be enough for the purposes he and he hoped ruby would put them to then using the first joint of his thumb as a rough guide he marked off the remaining eighteen inches into inch measures to support his lie about the ruler and went back to his desk and to the next hundred years of the de bleuvilles at about five oclock the light got so bad that bond got up from his table and stretched preparatory to going over to the lightswitch near the door he took a last look out of the window before he dosed it the veranda was completely deserted and the foam rubber cushions for the recliningchairs had already been taken in from the direction of the cablehead there still came the whine of machinery that had been part of the background noises to the day yesterday the railway had closed at about five and it must be time for the last pair of gondolas to complete their twoway journey and settle in their respective stations for the night bond closed the double windows walked across to the thermostat and put it down to seventy he was just about to reach for the lightswitch when there came a very soft tapping at the door bond kept his voice low come in the door opened and quickly closed to within an inch of the lock it was ruby she put her fingers to her lips and gestured towards the bathroom bond highly intrigued followed her in and shut the door then he turned on the light she was blushing she whispered imploringly oh please forgive me sir hilary but i did so want to talk to you for a second thats fine ruby but why the bathroom oh didnt you know no i suppose you wouldnt its supposed to be a secret but of course i can tell you you wont let on will you no of course not well all the rooms have microphones in them i dont know where but sometimes we girls have got together in each others rooms just for a gossip you know and miss bunt has always known we think theyve got some sort of television too she giggled we always undress in the bathroom its just a sort of feeling as if one was being watched the whole time i suppose its something to do with the treatment yes i expect so the point is sir hilary i was tremendously excited by what you were saying at lunch today about miss bunt perhaps being a duchess i mean is that really possible oh yes said bond airily i was so disappointed at not being able to tell you my surname you see you see her eyes were wide with excitement its windsor gosh said bond thats interesting i knew youd say that you see theres always been talk in my family that were distantly connected with the royal family i can quite understand that bonds voice was thoughtful judicious id like to be able to do some work on that what were your parents names i must have them first george albeit windsor and mary potts does that mean anything well of course the alberts significant bond felt a cur you see there was the prince consort to queen victoria he was albert oh golly rubys knuckles went up to her mouth but of course all this needs a lot of working on where do you come from in england where were you born in lancashire morecambe bay where the shrimps come from but a lot of poultry too you know so thats why you love chicken so much oh no she seemed surprised by the remark thats just the point you see i was allergic to chickens i simply couldnt bear them all those feathers the stupid pecking the mess and the smell i loathed them even eating chicken brought me out in a sort of rash it was awful and of course my parents were mad at me they being poultry fanners in quite a big way and me being supposed to help clean out the batteries you know those modern massproduced chicken places and then one day i saw this advertisement in the paper in the poultry farmers gazette it said that anyone suffering from chicken allergy then followed a long latin name could apply for a course of re of re for a cure in a swiss institute doing research work on the thing all found and ten pounds a week pocketmoney rather like those people who go and act as rabbits in that place thats trying to find a cure for colds i know said bond encouragingly so i applied and my fare was paid down to london and i met miss bunt and she put me through some sort of exam she giggled heaven only knows how i passed it as i failed my gce twice but she said i was just what the institute wanted and i came out here about two months ago its not bad theyre terribly strict but the count has absolutely cured my trouble i simply love chickens now her eyes became suddenly rapt i think theyre just the most beautiful wonderful birds in the world well thats a jolly good show said bond totally mystified now about your name til get to work on it right away but how are we going to talk you all seem to be pretty carefully organized how can i see you by yourself the only place is my room or yours you mean at night the big blue eyes were wide with fright excitement maidenly appraisal yes its the only way bond took a bold step towards her and kissed her full on the mouth he put his arms round her clumsily and you know i think youre terribly attractive oh sir hilary but she didnt recoil she just stood there like a great lovely doll passive slightly calculating wanting to be a princess but how would you get out of here theyre terribly strict a guard goes up and down the passage every so often of course the eyes were calculating its true that im next door to you in number three actually if only we had some way of getting out bond took one of the inch strips of plastic out of his pocket and showed it to her i knew you were somewhere close to me instinct i suppose i learned a thing or two in the army you can get out of these sort of doors by slipping this in the door crack in front of the lock and pushing it slips the latch here take this ive got another but hide it away and promise not to tell anyone ooh you are a one but of course i promise but do you think theres any hope about the windsors i mean now she put her arms round his neck round the witchdoctors neck and the big blue orbs gazed appealingly into his you definitely mustnt rely on it said bond firmly trying to get back an ounce of his selfrespect but ill have a quick look now in my books not much time before drinks anyway well see he gave her another long and he admitted to himself extremely splendid kiss to which she responded with an animalism that slightly salved his conscience now then baby his right hand ran down her back to the curve of her behind to which he gave an encouraging and hastening pat weve got to get you out of here his bedroom was dark they listened at the door like two children playing hideandseek the building was in silence he inched open the door he gave the behind an extra pat and she was gone bond paused for a moment then he switched on the light the innocent room smiled at him bond went to his table and reached for the dictionary of british surnames windsor windsor windsor here we are now then as he bent over the small print an important reflection seared his spys mind like a shooting star all right so sexual perversions and sex itself were a main security risk so was greed for money but what about status what about that most insidious of vices snobbery six oclock came bond had a nagging headache brought on by hours of poring over smallprint reference books and aggravated by the lack of oxygen at the high altitude he needed a drink three drinks he had a quick shower and smartened himself up rang his bell for the warder and went along to the bar only a few of the girls were already there violet sat alone at the bar and bond joined her she seemed pleased to see him she was drinking a daiquiri bond ordered another and for himself a double bourbon on the rocks he took a deep pull at it and put the squat glass down by god i needed that ive been working like a slave all day while youve been waltzing about the skislopes in the sun have i indeed a slight irish brogue came out with the indignation two lectures this morning frightfully boring and i had to catch up with my reading most of this afternoon im way behind with it what sort of reading oh sort of agricultural stuff the dark eyes watched him carefully were not supposed to talk about our cures you know oh well said bond cheerfully then lets talk about something else where do you come from ireland the south near shannon bond had a shot in the dark all that potato country yes thats right i used to hate them nothing but potatoes to eat and potato crops to talk about now im longing to get back funny isnt it your familyll be pleased you can say that again and my boy friend hes on the wholesale side i said i wouldnt marry anyone who had anything to do with the damned dirty ugly things hes going to get a shock all right hows that all ive learned about how to improve the crop the latest scientific ways chemicals and so on she put her hand up to her mouth she glanced swiftly round the room at the bartender to see if anyone had heard this innocent stuff she put on a hostess smile now you tell me what youve been working on sir hilary oh just some heraldic stuff for the count like i was talking about at lunch im afraid youd find it frightfully dry stuff oh no i wouldnt i was terribly interested in what you were saying to miss bunt you see she lowered her voice and spoke into her raised glass im an oneill they used to be almost kings of ireland do you think she had seen something over his shoulder she went on smoothly and i simply cant get my shoulders round enough and when i try to i simply overbalance fraid i dont know anything about skiing said bond loudly irma bunt appeared in the mirror over the bar ah sair hilary she inspected his face but yes you are already getting a little of the sunburn isnt it come let us go and sit down i see poor miss ruby over there all by herself they followed her meekly bond was amused by the little undercurrent of rulebreaking that went on among the girls the typical resistance pattern to strict discipline and the governessy ways of this hideous matron he must be careful how he handled it useful though it was proving it wouldnt do to get these girls too much on his side but if only because the count didnt want him to know them he must somehow ferret away at their surnames and addresses ferret that was the word ruby would be his ferret bond sat down beside her the back of his hand casually brushing against her shoulder more drinks were ordered the bourbon was beginning to uncoil bonds tensions his headache instead of occupying his whole head had localized itself behind the right temple he said gaily shall we play the game again there was a chorus of approval the glass and paper napkins were brought from the bar and now more of the girls joined in bond handed round cigarettes and the girls puffed vigorously occasionally choking over the smoke even irma bunt seemed infected by the laughter and squeals of excitement as the cobweb of paper became more and more tenuous careful gently elizabeth ayee but now you have done it and there was still this little corner that was safe bond was next to her now he sat back and suggested that the girls should have a game among themselves he turned to fraulein bunt by the way if i can find the time it crossed my mind that it might be fun to go down in the cable car and pay a visit to the valley i gathered from talk among the crowds today that st moritz is the other side of the valley ive never been there id love to see it alas my dear sair hilary but that is against the rules of the house guests here and the staff too have no access to the seilbahn that is only for the tourists here we keep ourselves to ourselves we are how shall i say a little dedicated community we observe the rules almost of a monastery it is better so isnt it thus we can pursue our researches in peace oh i quite see that bonds smile was understanding friendly but i hardly count myself as a patient here really couldnt an exception be made in my case i think that would be a mistake sair hilary and surely you will need all the time you have to complete your duties for the count no it was an order i am afraid with many apologies that what you ask is out of the question she glanced at her watch and clapped her hands and now girls she called it is time for the supper come along come along it had only been a tryon to see what form the negative answer would take but as bond followed her into the diningroom it was quite an effort to restrain his right shoe from giving irma bunt a really tremendous kick in her tight bulging behind sweet dreamssweet nightmare it was eleven oclock and the place was as quiet as the grave bond with due respect for the eye in the ceiling went through the motions of going to the bathroom and then climbing into bed and switching off his light he gave it ten minutes then got quietly out of bed and pulled on his trousers and shirt working by touch he slipped the end of the inch of plastic into the door crack found the lock and pressed gently the edge of the plastic caught the curve of the lock and slid it back bond now only had to push gently and the door was open he listened his ears pricked like an animals then he carefully put his head out the empty corridor yawned at him bond slipped out of the door closed it softly took the few steps along to number three and gently turned the handle it was dark inside but there was a stirring in the bed now to avoid the click of the shutting door bond took his bit of plastic and got it against the lock holding it in the mortice then he inched the door shut at the same time gently withdrawing the plastic the lock slid noiselessly into place there came a whisper from the bed is that you yes darling bond slid out of his clothes and assuming the same geography as in his own room walked gingerly over to the bed and sat down on its edge a hand came out of the darkness and touched him ooh youve got nothing on bond caught the hand and reached along it nor have you he whispered thats how it should be gingerly he lay down on the bed and put his head beside hers on the pillow he noticed with a pang of pleasure that she had left room for him he kissed her at first softly and then with fierceness her body stirred her mouth yielded to his and when his left hand began its exploration she put her arms round him im catching cold bond followed the lie by pulling the single sheet away from under him and then covering them both with it the warmth and softness of her splendid body were now all his bond lay against her he drew the fingernails of his left hand softly down her flat stomach the velvety skin fluttered she gave a small groan and reached down for his hand and held it you do love me a little bit that awful question bond whispered i think youre the most adorable beautiful girl i wish id met you before the stale insincere words seemed to be enough she removed her restraining hand her hair smelt of newmown summer grass her mouth of pepsodent and her body of mennens baby powder a small night wind rose up outside and moaned round the building giving an extra sweetness an extra warmth even a certain friendship to what was no more than an act of physical passion there was real pleasure in what they did to each other and in the end when it was over and they lay quietly in each others arms bond knew and knew that the girl knew that they had done nothing wrong done no harm to each other after a while bond whispered into her hair ruby mmmm about your name about the windsors im afraid theres not much hope oh well i never really believed you know these old family stories anyway i havent got enough books here when i get back ill dig into it properly promise itll be a question of starting with your family and going back church and town records and so forth ill have it done properly and send it to you great slab of parchment with a lot of snazzy print heavy black italics with coloured letters to start each line although it maynt get you anywhere it might be nice to have you mean like old documents in museums thats right thatd be nice there was silence in the little room her breathing became regular bond thought how extraordinary here on top of this mountain a deaths run away from the nearest hamlet in the valley in this little room were peace silence warmth happiness many of the ingredients of love it was like making love in a balloon which nineteenthcentury rake had it been who had recorded a bet in a london club that he would make love to a woman in a balloon bond was on the edge of sleep he let himself slide down the soft easy slope here it was wonderful it would be just as easy for him to get back to his room in the early hours he softly eased his right arm from under the sleeping girl took a lazy glance at his left wrist the big luminous numerals said midnight bond had hardly turned over on his right side up against the soft flanks of the sleeping girl when from underneath the pillow under the floor deep in the bowels of the building there came the peremptory ringing of a deeptoned melodious electric bell the girl stirred she said sleepily oh damn what is it oh its only the treatment i suppose its midnight yes dont pay any attention its only for me just go to sleep bond kissed her between the shoulderblades but said nothing now the bell had stopped in its place there started up a droning whine rather like the noise of a very fast electric fan with behind it the steady unvarying tickpausetock tickpausetock of some land of metronome the combination of the two sounds was wonderfully soothing it compelled attention but only just on the fringe of consciousness like the nightnoises of childhood the slow tick of the nursery clock combined with the sound of the sea or the wind outside and now a voice the counts voice came over the distant wire or tape that bond assumed was the mechani cal source of all this the voice was pitched in a low singsong murmur caressing yet authoritative and every word was distinct you are going to sleep the voice fell on the word sleep you are tired and your limbs feel like lead again the falling cadence on the last word your arms feel as heavy as lead your breathing is quite even your breathing is as regular as a childs your eyes are closed and the eyelids are heavy as lead you are becoming tireder and tireder your whole body is becoming tired and heavy as lead you are warm and comfortable you are slipping slipping slipping down into sleep your bed is as soft and downy as a nest you are as soft and sleepy as a chicken in a nest a dear little chicken flurry and cuddly there came the sound of a sweet cooing and clucking the gentle brushing together of wings the dozy murmuring of mother hens with their chicks it went on for perhaps a full minute then the voice came back the little darlings are going to sleep they are like you comfortable and sleepy in their nests you love them dearly dearly dearly you love all chickens you would like to make pets of them all you would like them to grow up beautiful and strong you would like no harm to come to them soon you will be going back to your darling chickens soon you will be able to look after them again soon you will be able to help all the chickens of england you will be able to improve the breed of chickens all over england this will make you very very happy you will be doing so much good that it will make you very very happy but you will keep quiet about it you will say nothing of your methods they will be your own secret your very own secret people will try and find out your secret but you will say nothing because they might try and take your secret away from you and then you would not be able to make your darling chickens happy and healthy and strong thousands millions of chickens made happier because of you so you will say nothing and keep your secret you will say nothing nothing at all you will remember what i say you will remember what i say the murmuring voice was getting farther and farther away the sweet cooing and clucking of chickens softly obscured the vanishing voice then that too died away and there was only the electric whine and the tickpausetock of the metronome ruby was deeply asleep bond reached out for her wrist and felt the pulse it was plumb on beat with the metronome and now that and the whine of the machine receded softly until all was dead silence again save for the soft moan of the night wind outside bond let out a deep sigh so now he had heard it all he suddenly wanted to get back to his room and think he slipped out from under the sheet got to his clothes and put them on he manipulated the lock without trouble there was no movement no sound in the passage he slipped back into number two and eased the door shut then he went into his bathroom closed the door switched on the light and sat down on the lavatory and put his head in his hands deep hypnosis that was what he had heard the hidden persuader the repetitive singsong message injected into the brain while it was on the twilight edge of consciousness now in rubys subconscious the message would work on all by itself through the night leaving her after weeks of repetition with an inbuilt mechanism of obedience to the voice that would be as deep as compelling as hunger but what in hell was the message all about surely it was a most harmless even a praiseworthy message to instil in the simple mind of this country girl she had been cured of her allergy and she would return home fully capable of helping with the family poultry business more than that enthusiastic dedicated had the leopard changed his spots had the old lag become in the corny hackneyed tradition a dogooder bond simply couldnt believe it what about all those highpowered security arrangements what about the multiracial staff that positively stank of spectre and what about the bobrun murder accident so soon after the mans attempted rape of this sarah girl an impossible coincidence malignity must somewhere lie behind the benign clinical front of this maddeningly innocent research outfit but where how in hell could he find out bond exhausted got up and turned off the light in the bathroom and quietly got himself into bed the mind whirred on for a sterile halfhour in the overheated brain and then mercifully he went to sleep when at nine oclock he awoke and threw open his windows the sky was overcast with the heavy blank grey that meant snow over by the berghaus the schneefinken and schneevogel the snowfinches and alpine choughs that lived on the crumbs and leftovers of the picnickers were fluttering and swooping close round the building a sure stormwarning the wind had got up and was blowing in sharp threatening gusts and no whine of machinery came from the cable railway the light aluminium gondolas would have too bad a time in winds of this strength particularly over the last great swoop of cable that brought them a good quarter of a mile over the exposed shoulder beneath the plateau bond shut the windows and rang for his breakfast when it came there was a note from fraulein bunt on the tray the count will be pleased to receive you at eleven oclock ie bond ate his breakfast and got down to his third page of de bleuvilles he had quite a chunk of work to show up but this was easy stuff the prospect of successfully bamboozling his way along the blofeld part of the trail was not so encouraging he would start boldly at the gdynia end and work back get the old rascal to talk about his youth and his parents old rascal well dammit whatever he had become since operation thunderball there werent two ernst stavro blofelds in the world they met in the counts study good morning sir hilary i hope you slept well we are going to have snow the count waved towards the window it will be a good day for work no distractions bond smiled a mantoman smile i certainly find those girls pretty distracting but most charming whats the matter with them by the way they all look healthy enough the count was offhand they suffer from allergies sir hilary crippling allergies in the agricultural field they are country girls and their disabilities affect the possibility of their employment i have devised a cure for such symptoms i am glad to say that the signs are propitious we are making much progress together the telephone by his side buzzed excuse me the count picked up the receiver and listened ja machen sie die verbindung he paused bond politely studied the papers he had brought along zdies de bleuville da da kharascho he put the receiver back forgive me that was one of my research workers he has been purchasing some materials for the laboratories the cable railway is closed but they are making a special trip up for him brave man he will probably be very sick poor fellow the green contact lenses hid any sympathy he may have felt the fixed smile showed none and now my dear sir hilary let us get on with our work bond laid out his big sheets on the desk and proudly ran his finger down through the generations there was excitement and satisfaction in the counts comments and questions but this is tremendous really tremendous my dear fellow and you say there is mention of a broken spear or a broken sword in the arms now when was that granted bond rattled off a lot of stuff about the norman conquest the broken sword had probably been awarded as a result of some battle more research in london would be needed to pin the occasion down finally bond rolled up the sheets and got out his notebook and now we must start working back from the other end count bond became inquisitorial authoritative we have your birth date in gdynia may th yes correct your parents names ernst george blofeld and maria stavro michelopoulos also born in gdynia yes now your grandparents ernst stefan blofeld and elizabeth lubomirskaya hm so the ernst is something of a family christian name it would seem so my greatgrandfather he was also ernst that is most important you see count among the blofelds of augsburg there are no less than two ernsts the counts hands had been lying on the green blottingpad on his desk relaxed now impulsively they joined together and briefly writhed showing white knuckles my god youve got it bad thought bond and that is important very christian names run through families we regard them as most significant clues now can you remember any farther back you have done well we have covered three generations with the dates i shall later ask you for we have already got back to around only another fifty years to go and we shall have arrived at augsburg no it was almost a cry of pain my greatgreatgrandfather of him i know nothing the hands writhed on the blottingpaper perhaps perhaps if it is a question of money people witnesses could be found the hands parted held themselves out expansively my dear sir hilary you and i are men of the world we understand each other extracts from archives registry offices the churches these things do they have to be completely authentic got you you old fox bond said affably with a hint of conspiracy i dont quite understand what you mean count the hands were now flat on the desk again happy hands blofeld had recognized one of his kind you are a hardworking man sir hilary you live modestly in this remote region of scotland life could perhaps be made easier for you there are perhaps material benefits you desire motorcars a yacht a pension you have only to say the word name a figure the darkgreen orbs bored into bonds modestly evasive eyes holding them just a little cooperation a visit here and there in poland and germany and france of course your expenses would be heavy let us say five hundred pounds a week the technical matters the documents and so forth those i can arrange it would only require your supporting evidence yes the ministry of justice in paris for them the word of the college of arms is the word of god is that not so it was too good to be true but how to play it diffidently bond said what you are suggesting count is er not without interest of course bonds smile was sufficiently expansive sufficiently bland if the documents were convincing so to speak solid very solid then it would be quite reasonable for me to authenticate them bond put spaniel into his eyes asking to be patted to be told that everything would be all right that he would be completely protected you see what i mean the count began with force sincerity you need have absolutely no when there was the noise of an approaching hubbub down the passage the door burst open a man propelled from behind lurched into the room and fell writhing to the floor two of the guards came stiffly to attention behind him they looked first at the count and then sideways towards bond surprised to see him there the count said sharply was ist derm los bond knew the answer and momentarily he died behind the snow and the blood on the face of the man on the floor bond recognized the face of a man he knew the blond hair the nose broken boxing for the navy belonged to a friend of his in the service it was unmistakably number from station z in zurich the heat increases yes it was shaun campbell all right christ almighty what a mess station z had especially been told nothing about bonds mission campbell must have been following a lead of his own probably trailing this russian who had been buying supplies typical of the son of ballsup that oversecurity can produce the leading guard was talking in rapid faulty german with a slav accent he was found in the open ski compartment at the back of the gondola much frozen but he put up a strong resistance he had to be subdued he was no doubt following captain boris the man caught himself up i mean your guest from the valley herr graf he says he is an english tourist from zurich that he had got no money for the fare he wanted to pay a visit up here he was searched he carried five hundred swiss francs no identity papers the man shrugged he says his name is campbell at the sound of his name the man on the ground stirred he lifted his head and looked wildly round the room he had been badly battered about the face and head with a pistol or a cosh his control was shot to pieces when his eyes lit on the familiar face of bond he looked astonished then as if a lifebuoy had been thrown to him he said hoarsely thank god james tell em its me tell em im from universal export in zurich you know for gods sake james tell em im ok his head fell forward on the carpet the counts head slowly turned towards bond the opaque green eyes caught the pale light from the window and glinted whitely the tight facelifted smile was grotesquely horrible you know this man sir hilary bond shook his head sorrowfully he knew he was pronouncing the death sentence on campbell never seen him before in my life poor chap he sounds a bit daft to me concussed probably why not ship him down to a hospital in the valley he looks in a pretty bad way and universal export the voice was silky i seem to have heard that name before well i havent said bond indifferently never heard of it he reached in his pocket for his cigarettes lit one with a dead steady hand the count turned back to the guards he said softly zur befragungszelle he nodded his dismissal the two guards bent down and hauled campbell up by his armpits the hanging head raised itself gave one last terrible look of appeal a bond then the man who was bonds colleague was hustled out of the room and the door was closed softly behind his dragging feet to the interrogation cell that could mean only one thing under modern methods total confession how long would campbell hold out for how many hours had bond got left i have told them to take him to the sickroom he will be well looked after the count looked from the papers on his desk to bond i am afraid this unhappy intrusion has interfered with my train of thought sir hilary soperhaps you will forgive me for this morning of course of course and regarding your proposition that we should work a little more closely together on your interests i can assure you count that i find it most interesting bond smiled conspiratorially im sure we could come to some satisfactory arrangement yes that is good the count linked his hands behind his head and gazed for a moment at the ceiling and then reflectively back at bond he said casually i suppose you would not be connected in any way with the british secret service sir hilary bond laughed out loud the laugh was a reflex forced out of him by tension good god no didnt even know we had one didnt all that sort of thing go out with the end of the war bond chuckled to himself fatuously amused cant quite see myself running about behind a false moustache not my line of country at all cant bear moustaches the counts unwavering smile did not seem to share bonds amusement he said coldly then please forget my question sir hilary the intrusion by this man has made me oversuspicious i value my privacy up here sir hilary scientific research can only be pursued in an atmosphere of peace i couldnt agree more bond was effusive he got to his feet and gathered up his papers from the desk and now i must get on with my own research work just getting into the fourteenth century i think i shall have some interesting data to show you tomorrow count the count got politely to his feet and bond went out of the door and along the passage he loitered listening for any sound there was none but halfway down the corridor one of the doors was ajar a crack of bloodred light showed bond thought ive probably had it anyway in for a penny in for a pound he pushed the door open and stuck his head into the room it was a long low laboratory with a plasticcovered workbench extending its whole length beneath the windows which were shuttered dark red light as in a filmdeveloping chamber came from neon strips above the cornice the bench was littered with retorts and testtubes and there were line upon line of testtubes and phials containing a cloudy liquid in racks against the far wall three men in white with gauze pads over the bottoms of their faces and white surgical caps over their hair were at work absorbed bond took in the scene a scene from a theatrical hell withdrew his head and walked on down the corridor and out into what was now a driving snowstorm he pulled the top of his sweater over his head and forced his way along the path to the blessed warmth of the clubhouse then he walked quickly to his room closed the door and went into the bathroom and sat down on his usual throne of reflection and wondered what in gods name to do could he have saved campbell well he could have had a desperate shot at it oh yes i know this man perfectly respectable chap we used to work for the same export firm universal in london you look in pretty bad shape old boy what the devil happened but it was just as well he hadnt tried as cover solid cover universal was brule with the pros it had been in use too long all the secret services in the world had penetrated it by now obviously blofeld knew all about it any effort to save campbell would simply have tied bond in with him there had been no alternative except to throw him to the wolves if campbell had a chance to get his wits back before they really started on him he would know that bond was there for some purpose that his disavowal by bond was desperately important to bond to the service how long would he have the strength to cover for bond retrieve his recognition of bond at most a few hours but how many hours that was the vital question that and how long the storm would last bond couldnt possibly get away in this stuff if it stopped there might be a chance a damned slim one but better than the alternatives of which if and when campbell talked there was only one death probably a screaming death bond surveyed his weapons they were only his hands and feet his gillette razor and his wristwatch a heavy rolex oyster perpetual on an expanding metal bracelet used properly these could be turned into most effective knuckledusters bond got up took the blade out of his gillette and dropped the razor into his trouser pocket he slipped the shaft between the first and second fingers of his left hand so that the bladecarrier rested flat along his knuckles yes that was the way now was there anything any evidence he should try and take with him yes he must try and get more if not all of the girls names and if possible addresses for some reason he knew they were vital for that he would have to use ruby his head full of plans for getting the information out of her bond went out of the bathroom and sat down at his desk and got on with a fresh page of de bleuvilles at least he must continue to show willing if only to the recording eye in the ceiling it was about twelvethirty when bond heard his doorknob being softly turned ruby slipped in and her finger to her lips disappeared into his bathroom bond casually threw down his pen got up and stretched and strolled over and went in after her rubys blue eyes were wide and frightened youre in trouble she whispered urgently what have you been doing nothing said bond innocently whats up weve all been told that we mustnt talk to you unless miss bunt is there her knuckles went distractedly up to her teeth do you think they know about mi couldnt possibly said bond radiating confidence i think i know what it is this morning the count told me i was an upsetting influence here that i was what he called disruptive interfering with your treatments he asked me to keep myself more to myself honestly im sure thats all it is rather a pity really apart from you i mean youre sort of special i think all you girls are terribly sweet id like to have helped you all how do you mean helped us well this business of surnames i talked to violet last night she seemed awfully interested im sure it would have amused all the others to have theirs done everyones interested in where they came from rather like palmistry in a way bond wondered how the college of arms would have liked that one he shrugged anyway ive decided to get the hell away from here i cant bear being shepherded and ordered about like this who the hell do they think i am but ill tell you what ill do if you can give me the names of the girls as many as you know ill do a piece on each of them and post them when you all get back to england how much longer have you got by the way were not told exactly but the rumour is about another week theres another batch of girls due about then when were slow at our work or get behindhand with our reading miss bunt says she hopes the next lot wont be so stupid the old bitch but sir hilary the blue eyes filled with concern how are you going to get away you know were practically prisoners up here bond was offhand oh ill manage somehow they cant hold me here against my will but what about the names ruby dont you think it would give the girls a treat oh theyd love it of course i know all of them weve found plenty of ways of exchanging secrets but you wont be able to remember have you got anything to write down on bond tore off some strips of lavatory paper and took out a pencil fire away she laughed well you know me and violet then theres elizabeth mackinnon shes from aberdeen beryl morgan from somewhere in herefordshire pearl tampion devonshire by the way all those simply loathed every kind of cattle now they live on steaks would you believe it i must say the counts a wonderful man yes indeed then theres anne charter from canterbury and caresse ventnor from the national stud wherever that is fancy her working there and she came up in a rash all over whenever she went near ajhorse now all she does is dream of pony clubs and read every word she can get hold of about pat smythe and denise robertson the list went on until bond had got the whole ten he said what about that polly somebody who left in november polly tasker she was from east anglia dont remember where but i can find out the address when i get back to england sir hilary she put her arm round his neck lam going to see you again arent i bond held her tight and kissed her of course ruby you can always get me at the college of arms in queen victoria street just send me a postcard when you get back but for gods sake cut out the sir youre my girl friend remember oh yes i will er hilary she said fervently and you will be careful getting away i mean youre sure its all right is there anything i can do to help no darling just dont breathe a word of all this its a secret between us right of course darling she glanced at her watch oh lord i must simply fly only ten minutes to lunchtime now can you do your trick with the door there shouldnt be anyone about its their lunchtime from twelve till one bond out of any possible line of vision from the eye in the ceiling did his trick with the door and she was gone with a last whispered goodbye bond eased the door shut he let out a deep sigh and went over to the window and peered out through the snowheaped panes it was thick as hades outside and the fine powder snow on the veranda was whirling up in little ghosts as the wind tore at the building pray god it would let up by nighttime now what did he need in the way of equipment goggles and gloves were two items he might harvest over lunch bond went into the bathroom again and rubbed soap into his eyes it stung like hell but the bluegrey eyes emerged from the treatment realistically bloodshot satisfied bond rang for the warden and went thoughtfully off to the restaurant silence fell as he went through the swing doors followed by a polite brittle chatter eyes followed him discreetly as he crossed the room and the replies to his goodmornings were muted bond took his usual seat between ruby and fraulein bunt apparently oblivious to her frosty greeting he snapped his fingers for a waiter and ordered his double vodka dry martini he turned to fraulein bunt and smiled into the suspicious yellow eyes would you be very kind yes sair hilary what is it bond gestured at his still watering eyes ive got the counts trouble sort of conjunctivitis i suppose the tremendous glare up here better today of course but theres still a lot of reflection from the snow and all this paperwork could you get me a pair of snowgoggles ill only need to borrow them for a day or two just till my eyes get used to the light dont usually have this sort of trouble yes that can be done i will see that they are put in your room she summoned the head waiter and gave him the order in german the man looking at bond with overt dislike said sofort gnadiges fraulein and clicked his heels and one more thing if you will said bond politely a small flask of schnapps he turned to fraulein bunt i find i am not sleeping well up here perhaps a nightcap would help i always have one at home generally whisky but here i would prefer schnapps when in gloria do as the glorians do ha ha fraulein bunt looked at him stonily she said to the waiter curtly in ordnung the man took bonds order of pat maison followed by ceufs gloria and the cheese tray clicked his heels and went away was he one of those who had been at work in the interrogation room bond silently ground his teeth by god if it came to hitting any of these guards tonight he was going to hit them damned hard with everything hed got he felt fraulein bunts eyes inquisitively on him he untensed himself and began to make amiable conversation about the storm how long would it last what was the barometer doing violet guardedly but helpfully said the guides thought it would clear up during the afternoon the barometer was rising she looked nervously at fraulein bunt to see if she had said too much to the pariah and then not reassured went back to her two vast baked potatoes with poached eggs in them bonds drink came he swallowed it in two gulps and ordered another he felt like making any gesture that would startle and outrage he said combatively to fraulein bunt and how is that poor chap who came up in the cable car this morning he looked in terrible shape i do hope hes up and about again he makes progress oh who was that asked ruby eagerly it was an intruder fraulein bunts eyes were hard with warning it is not a subject for conversation oh but why not asked bond innocently after all you cant get much excitement up here anything out of the ordinary should be a bit of a relief she said nothing bond raised his eyebrows politely and then accepted the snub with a good grace he asked if any newspapers came up or was there a radio bulletin like on board ship did they get any news from the outside world no bond gave up the struggle and got on with his lunch rubys foot crept up against his in sympathy with the man sent to coventry bond gave it a gentle kick of warning and withdrew his the girls at the other tables began to leave bond toyed with his cheese and coffee until fraulein bunt got to her feet and said come girls bond rose and sat down again now except for the waiters clearing up he was alone in the restaurant that was what he wanted he got up and strolled to the door outside on pegs against the wall the girls outdoor coats and siding gloves hung in an orderly row the corridor was empty bond swept the largest pair of leather gauntlets he could see off the peg where they hung by their joining cord and stuffed them inside his sweater then he sauntered along to the reception room it was empty the door to the skiroom was open and the surly man was at his workbench bond went in and made onesided conversation about the weather then under cover of desultory talk about whether the metal skis were not more dangerous than the old wooden ones he wandered his hands innocently in his pockets round the numbered racks in which the skis stood against the wall they were mostly the girls skis no good the bindings would be too small for his boots but by the door in unnumbered slots stood the guides skis bonds eyes narrowed to slits as he scanned them measuring estimating yes the pair of metal heads with the red vs painted on the black curved tips was the best bet they were of the stiffer masters category designed for racing bond remembered reading somewhere that the standard model was inclined to float at speed his choice had the attenhofer flex forward release with the marker lateral release two transverse leather thongs wound round the ankle and buckled over the instep would if he fell which he was certain to do ensure against losing a ski bond made a quick guess at how much the bindings would need adjustment to fit his boots and went off down the corridor to his room downhill only now it was just a question of sitting out the hours when would they have finished with campbell quick rough torture is rarely effective against a professional apart from the likelihood of the man rapidly losing consciousness becoming so punchdrunk that he is incoherent the pro if he is a tough man spiritually can keep the game alive for hours by minor admissions by telling long rambling tales and sticking to them such tales need verification blofeld would undoubtedly have his man in zurich would be able to contact him on his radio get him to check this or that date or address but that also would require time then if it was proved that campbell had told lies they would have to begin again so far as bond and his identity were concerned it all depended on campbells reading of why bond was up at the gloria club he must guess because of bonds curt disavowal of him that it was something clandestine something important would he have the wits to cover up bond the guts against the electrical and mechanical devices they would surely use against him he could say that when he came to and saw bond in his semiconscious state he had for a moment thought bond was his brother james campbell some story like that if he had the wits if he had the guts had campbell got a death pill perhaps one of the buttons on his skijacket or trousers bond sharply put the thought away he had been on the edge of wishing that campbell had well he would be wise to assume that it was only a matter of hours and then they would come for him they wouldnt do it until after lightsout to do it before would cause too much talk among the girls no they would fetch him at night and the next day it would be put about that he had left by the first cable car down to the valley meanwhile he would be buried deep in a snow overcoat or more likely deposited in a high crevasse in the nearby piz languard glacier to come out at the bottom fifty years later out of his deep freeze with multiple contusions but no identification marks a nameless victim of les neiges eternelles yes he must plan for that bond got up from the desk where he had been automatically scribbling down lists of fifteenthcentury de bleuvilles and opened the window the snow had stopped and there was broken blue in the sky it would be perfect powder snow perhaps a foot of it on the gloria run now to make everything ready there are hundreds of secret inks but there was only one available to bond the oldest one in the world his own urine he went into the bathroom with his pen a clean nib and his passport then he sat down and proceeded to transcribe from the flimsy pieces of paper in his pocket on to a blank page of his passport the names and approximate locations by county of the girls the page showed nothing held in front of a flame the writing would come up brown he slipped the passport into his hippocket next he took the gloves from under his sweater tried them on and found them an adequate but tight fit took the top off the lavatory cistern and laid the gloves along the arm of the stopcock what else it was going to be fiendishly cold at the start but his body would soon be drenched in sweat he would just have to make do with the skiclothes he possessed the gloves the goggles that had been placed on his table and the fiat glass flask of schnapps that he would carry in one of his side pockets and not in case of a fall in his hippocket extra covering for his face bond thought of using one of his warm vests and cutting eyeholes in it but it would surely slip and perhaps blind him he had some darkred silk bandana handkerchiefs he would tie one tight over his face below the goggles and discard it if it interfered with his breathing so that was the lot there was nothing else he could do or insure against the rest was up to the fates bond relaxed his thoughts and went out and back to his desk he sat down and bent to his paperwork and tried not to listen to the hastening tick of the rolex on his wrist tried to fix in his mind the rough geography of the gloria run he had inadequately learned from the metal map it was too late now to go and have another look at it he must stay put and continue to play the toothless tiger dinner was as ghastly as lunch bond concentrated on getting plenty of whisky and food under his belt he made urbane conversation and pretended he didnt notice the chill in the air then he gave rubys foot one warm press under the table excused himself on the grounds of work and strode with dignity out of the room he had changed for dinner and he was relieved to find his skiclothes in the halftidy heap in which he had left them he went with utter normalcy about his work sharpened pencils laid out his books bent to the squared paper simon de bleuville alphonse de bleuville married mariette descourt and had issue jean francoise pierre thank god he would soon be released from all this blether bond felt the excitement ball up inside him like cats fur he found that his hands were wet he wiped them down the sides of his trousers he got up and stretched he went into the bathroom and made appropriate noises retrieved the gloves and laid them on the bathroom floor just inside the door then naked he came back into the room and got into bed and switched off the light he regularized his breathing and in ten minutes began to snore softly he gave it another ten then slid out of bed and with infinite precaution dressed himself in his ski clothes he softly retrieved his gloves from the bathroom put on the goggles so that they rested in his hair above the forehead tied the darkred handkerchief tightly across his nose schnapps into pocket passport into hippocket and finally gillette through the fingers of the left hand and the rolex transferred to his right the bracelet clasped in the palm of his hand and round the fingers so that the face of the watch lay across his middle knuckles james bond paused and ran over his equipment the skigloves their cord drawn through his sweater and down the sleeves hung from his wrists they would be a hindrance until he was outside nothing to be done about that the rest was all right he was set he bent to the door manipulated the lock with the plastic and praying that the television eye had been closed down and would not see the light shining in from the passage listened briefly and slipped out there was as usual light from the reception room to his left bond crept along inched round the door jamb yes the guard was there bent over something that looked like a time sheet the neck was offered bond dropped the gillette in his pocket and stiffened the fingers of his left hand into the old commando cutting edge he took the two steps into the room and crashed the hand down on the back of the offered neck the mans face hit the table top with a thud bounced up and half turned towards bond bonds right flashed out and the face of the rolex disintegrated against the mans jaw the body slid sluggishly off its chair on to the carpet and lay still its legs untidy as if in sleep the eyes fluttered and stared unseeing upwards bond went round the desk and bent down there was no heartbeat bond straightened himself it was the man he had seen coming back alone from the bobrun on his first morning when bertil had met with his accident so rough justice the telephone on the desk buzzed like a trapped wasp bond looked at it he picked up the receiver and spoke through the handkerchief across his mouth ja alles in ordnung ja also hor zu wir kornmen fur den englander in zehn minuten verstanden isrecht also aufpassen ja zubefehl at the other end the receiver went down the sweat was beading on bonds face thank god he had answered so they were coming for him in ten minutes there was a bunch of keys on the desk bond snatched them up and ran to the front door after three misfits he had the right one he tried the door it was now only held by its airpressure device bond leaped for the skiroom unlocked he went in and by the light from the reception room found his skis there were sticks beside them carefully he lifted everything out of its wooden slot and strode to the main door and opened it he laid the skis and sticks softly down in the snow turned back to the door locked it from the outside and threw the keys far away into the snow the threequarter moon burned down with an almost dazzling fire and the snow crystals scintillated back at it like a carpet of diamond dust now minutes would have to be wasted getting the bindings absolutely right james bond kicked one boot into the groove of the marker toehold and knelt down feeling for the steel cable that went behind his heel it was too short coolly unhurriedly he adjusted the regulating screw on the forward latch and tried again this time it was all right he pressed down on the safety latch and felt it lock his boot into the toehold next the safety thong round the top of his boot that would keep the ski prisoner if the latch sprung which it would do with a fall his fingers were beginning to freeze the tip of the thong refused to find its buckle a full minute wasted got it and now the same job on the other ski at last bond stood up slipped the gloves over his aching fingers picked up the lancelike sticks and pushed himself off along the faint ridge that showed the outlines of yesterdays well trodden path it felt all right he pulled the goggles down over his eyes and now the vast snowscape was a silvery green as if he was swimming under sunny water the skis hissed smoothly through the powder snow bond tried to get up more speed down the gentle slope by langlaufing the sliding forward stride of the first norwegian skiers but it didnt work the heels of his boots felt nailed to the skis he punted himself forward as fast as he could with his sticks god what a trail he must be leaving like a tramline as soon as they got the front door open they would be after him their fastest guide would certainly catch him easily unless he got a good start every minute every second was a bonus he passed between the black outlines of the cable head and the berghaus there was the starting point of the gloria run the metal notices beside it hatted with snow bond didnt pause he went straight for it and over the edge the first vertical drop had a spinechilling bliss to it bond got down into his old arlberg crouch his hands forward of his boots and just let himself go his skis were an ugly six inches apart the kannonen he had watched had gone down with their boots locked together as if on a single ski but this was no time for style even if he had been capable of it above all he must stay upright bonds speed was now frightening but the deep cushion of cold light powder snow gave him the confidence to try a parallel swing minimum of shoulder turn needed at this speed weight on to the left ski and he came round and held it as the righthand edges of his skis bit against the slope throwing up a shower of moonlit snow crystals danger was momentarily forgotten in the joy of speed technique and mastery of the snow bond straightened up and almost dived into his next turn this time to the left leaving a broad s on the virgin mountain behind him now he could afford to schuss the rest down to the hard lefthand turn round the shoulder he pointed his skis down and felt real rapture as like a black bullet on the giant slope he zoomed down the degree drop now for the lefthand corner there was the group of three flags black red and yellow hanging limply their colours confused by the moonlight he would have to stop there and take a recce over the next lap there was a slight upward slope short of the big turn bond took it at speed felt his skis leave the ground at the crest of it jabbed into the snow with his left stick as an extra lever and threw his skis and his right shoulder and hips round to the left he landed in a spray of snow at a dead halt he was delighted with himself a sprungchristiana is a showy and not an easy turn at speed he wished his old teacher fuchs had been there to see that one he was now on the shoulder of the mountain high overhead the silver strands of the cable railway plunged downwards in one great swoop towards the distant black line of the trees where the moonlight glinted on a spidery pylon bond remembered that there now followed a series of great zigs and zags more or less beneath the cables with the piste unobscured it would have been easy but the new snow made every descent look desirable bond jerked up his goggles to see if he could spot a flag yes there was one away down to the left he would do some s turns down the next slope and then make for it as he pulled down his goggles and gripped his sticks two things happened first there came a deep boom from high up the mountain and a speck of flame that wobbled in its flight soared into the sky above him there was a pause at the top of its parabola a sharp crack and a blazing magnesium flare on a parachute began its wandering descent wiping out the black shadows in the hollows turning everything into a hideous daylight another and another sprayed out across the sky lighting every cranny over the mountain side and at the same time the cables high above bonds head began to sing they were sending the cable car down after him bond cursed into the sodden folds of his silk handkerchief and got going the next thing would be a man after him probably a man with a gun he took the second lap more carefully than the first got across to the second flag turned at it and made back across the plunging slope for the series of linked ss under the cables how fast did these bloody gondolas go ten fifteen twenty miles an hour this was the latest type it would be the fastest hadnt he read somewhere that the one between arosa and the weisshorn did even as he got into his first s the tune of the singing cable above him momentarily changed and then went back to its usual whine that was the gondola passing the first pylon bonds knees the achilles heel of all skiers were beginning to ache he cut his ss narrower snaking down faster but now feeling the rutted tracks of the piste under his skis at every turn was that a flag away over to the left the magnesium flares were swaying lower almost directly over him yes it looked all right two more s turns and he would do a traverse schuss to it something landed with a tremendous crack amidst a fountain of snow to his right another to his left they had a grenadethrower up front in the cable car a bracket would the next one be dead on almost before the thought flashed through his mind there came a tremendous explosion just ahead of him and he was hurled forward and sideways in a catherine wheel of sticks and skis bond got gingerly to his feet gasping and spitting snow one of his bindings had opened his trembling fingers found the forward latch and banged it tight again another sharp crack but wide by twenty yards he must get away from the line of fire from the blasted railway feverishly he thought the lefthand flag i must do the traverse now he took a vague bearing across the precipitous slope and flung himself down it bloody snow it was tricky undulating ground the magnesium flares had sailed lower and there were ugly patches of black shadow any of which might have been a small ravine bond had to check at all of them and each time the sharp christie reminded him of his legs and ankles but he got across without a fall and pulled up at the flag panting he looked back the gondola had stopped they had telephone communication with the top and bottom stations but why had it stopped as if in answer blue flames fluttered gaily from the forward cabin but bond heard no bullets the gondola would be swaying on its cable but then high up above him from somewhere near the first flags on the shoulder came more rapid fire from two points and the snow kicked up daintily around him so the guides had finally got after him his fall would have cost him minutes how much lead had he got certainly less than ten minutes a bullet whanged into one of his skis and sang off down the mountain bond took a last gulp of breath and got going again still lefthanded away from the cable railway towards the next flag a distant dot on the edge of the shadow thrown by the great matterhornshaped peak of piz gloria which knifed up into the spangled sky in dreadful majesty it looked as if the run was going to take him dangerously close to the skirts of the peak something was nagging at his mind a tiny memory what was it it was something unpleasant yes by god the last flag it had been black he was on the black run the one closed because of avalanche danger god well hed had it now no time to try and get back on the red run and anyway the red had a long stretch close to the cables hed just have to chance it and what a time to chance it just after a heavy fall of new snow and with all these detonations to loosen up the stuff when there was danger of an avalanche guides forbade even speech well to hell with it bond zoomed on across the great unmarked slope got to the next flag spotted the next away down the mountain side towards the tree line too steep to schuss he would just have to do it in ss and then the bastards chose to fire off three more flares followed by a stream of miscellaneous rockets that burst prettily among the stars of course bright idea this was for the sake of watchers in the valley who might be inquisitive about the mysterious explosions high up the mountain they were having a party up there celebrating something what fun these rich folk had to be sure and then bond remembered but of course it was christmas eve god rest ye merry gentlemen let nothing ye dismay bonds skis hissed an accompaniment as he zigzagged fast down the beautiful snow slope white christmas well hed certainly got himself that but then from high up above him he heard that most dreaded of all sounds in the high alps that rending booming crack the last trump avalanche the ground shook violently under bonds skis and the swelling rumble came down to him like the noise of express trains roaring through a hundred tunnels god almighty now he really had had it what was the rule point the skis straight downhill try and race it bond pointed his skis down towards the tree line got down in his ugly crouch and shot his skis screaming into white space keep forward you bastard get your hands way in front of you the wind of his speed was building up into a great wall in front of him trying to knock him off balance behind him the giant roar of the mountain seemed to be gaining other smaller cracks sounded high up among the crags the whole bloody mountain was on the move if he beat the gigantic mass of hurtling snow to the tree line what comfort would he find there certainly no protection until he was deep in the wood the avalanche would snap perhaps the first hundred yards of firs down like matchsticks bond used his brain and veered slightly lefthanded the opening the glade cut for the black run would surely be somewhere below the last flag he had been aiming for if it wasnt he was a dead duck now the wild schuss was coming to an end the trees were rushing towards him was there a break in the bloody black line of them yes but more to the left bond veered dropping his speed gratefully but with his ears strained to gauge the range of the thunder behind and above him it couldnt be far from him the shudder in the ground had greatly increased and a lot of the stuff would also find the hole through the trees funnel itself in and pursue him even down there yes there was the flag bond hurtled into a righthand christie just as to his left he heard the first trees come crashing down with the noise of a hundred monster crackers being pulled christmas crackers bond flung himself straight down the wide white glade between the trees but he could hear that he was losing the crashing of the trees was coming closer the first froth of the white tide couldnt be far behind his heels what did one do when the avalanche hit there was only one rule get your hands to your boots and grip your ankles then if you were buried there was some hope of undoing your skis being able perhaps to burrow your way to the surface if you knew in your tomb where the surface lay if you couldnt go down like a ball you would end up immovable a buried tangle of sticks and skis at all angles thank god the opening at the end of the glade the shimmer of the last easily sloping fields before the finish was showing up the crackling roar behind him was getting louder how high would the wall of snow be fifty feet a hundred bond reached the end of the glade and hurled himself into a righthand christie it was his last hope to get below the wide belt of trees and pray that the avalanche wouldnt mow down the lot of them to stay in the path of the roaring monster at his heels would be suicide the christie came off but bonds right ski snarled a root or a sapling and he felt himself flying through space he landed with a crash and lay gasping all the wind knocked out of him now he was done for not even enough strength to get his hands to his ankles a tremendous buffet of wind hit him and a small snowstorm covered him the ground shook wildly and a deep crashing roar filled his ears and then it had passed him and given way to a slow heavy rumble bond brushed the snow out of his eyes and got unsteadily to his feet both skis loose his goggles gone only a cricket pitch away a great torrent of snow perhaps twenty feet high was majestically pouring out of the wood and down into the meadows its much higher tumbling snout tossing huge crags of broken snow around it was already a hundred yards ahead and still going fast but where bond stood it was now silent and peaceful except for the machinegunfire crackling of the trees as they went down in the wood that had finally protected him the crackling was getting nearer no time to hang about but bond took off one sodden glove and dug into his trouser pocket if ever he needed a drink it was now he tilted the little flask down his throat emptied it and threw the bottle away happy christmas he said to himself and bent to his bindings he got to his feet and rather lightheaded but with the wonderful glow of the enzian in his stomach started on the last mile of finishing schuss across the meadows to the right away from the still hurtling river of snow blast there was a fence across the bottom of the meadows he would have to take the normal outlet for the runs beside the cable station it looked all right there was no sign of the gondola but he could now hear the song of the cables had the downcoming car reversed back up to piz gloria assuming him to have been killed by the avalanche there was a large black saloon car in the forecourt to the cable station and lights on in the station but otherwise no sign of life well it was his only way to get off the run and on to the road that was his objective bond schussed easily downwards resting his limbs getting his breath back the sharp crack of a heavycalibre pistol and the phut as the bullet hit the snow beside him pulled him together he jinked sideways and glanced quickly up to the right where the shot had come from the gun blazed again a man on skis was coming fast after him one of the guides of course he would have taken the red run had the other followed bond on the black bond hoped so gave a deep sigh of anger and put on all the speed he could crouching low and jinking occasionally to spoil the mans aim the single shots kept on coming it was going to be a narrow shave who got to the end of the run first bond studied the finishing point that was now coming at him fast there was a wide break in the fence to let the skiers through a large parking place in front of the cable station and then the low embankment that protected the main line of the rhatische bahn up to pontresina and the bernina pass on the other side of the rails the railway embankment dropped into the road from pontresina to samaden the junction for st moritz perhaps two miles down the valley another shot kicked up the snow in front of him that was six that had gone with any luck the mans pistol was empty but that wouldnt help much there was no stuffing left in bond for a fight now a great blaze of light showed coming up the railway line and before it was hidden by the cable station bond identified an express and could just hear the thudding of its electrodiesels by god it would just about be passing the cable station as he wanted to get across the track could he make it take a run at the low embankment and clear it and the lines before the train got there it was his only hope bond dug in with his sticks to get on extra speed hell a man had got out of the black car and was crouching aiming at him bond jinked and jinked again as fire bloomed from the mans hand but now bond was on top of him he thrust hard with the rapier point of a skistick and felt it go through clothing the man gave a scream and went down the guide now only yards behind yelled something the great yellow eye of the diesel glared down the tracks and bond caught a sideways glimpse of a huge red snowfan below the headlight that was fountaining the new snow to right and left of the engine in two white wings now he flashed across the parking place heading straight at the mound of the embankment and as he hit dug both his sticks in to get his skis off the ground and hurled himself forward into the air there was a brief glimpse of steel rails below a tremendous thudding in his ears and a ferocious blast only yards away from the trains siren then he crashed on to the icy road tried to stop failed and fetched up in an almighty skid against the hard snow wall on the other side as he did so there came a terrible scream from behind him a loud splintering of wood and the screech of the trains brakes being applied at the same time the spray from the snowfan that had now reached bond turned pink bond wiped some of it off his face and looked at it his stomach turned god the man had tried to follow him had been too late or had missed his jump and had been caught by the murderous blades of the snowfan mincemeat bond dug a handful of snow off the bank and wiped it over his face and hair he rubbed more of it down his sweater he suddenly realized that people were pulling down the windows in the brilliantlylit train above him others had got down on the line bond pulled himself together and punted off down the black ice of the road shouts followed him the angry bawls of swiss citizens bond edged his skis a little against the camber of the road and kept going ahead of him down the black gulch of the road in his minds eye the huge red propeller whirred sucking him into its steel whirlpool bond close to delirium slithered on towards its bloody beckoning vortex bond a greyfaced lunging automaton somehow stayed upright on the two miles of treacherous langlauf down the gentle slope to samaden once a passing car its snowchains clattering forced him into the bank he leaned against the comforting soft snow for a moment the breath sobbing in his throat then he drove himself on again he had got so far done so well only a few more hundred yards to the lights of the darling straggling little paradise of people and shelter the slender campanile of the village church was floodlit and there was a great warm lake of light on the left of the twinkling group of houses the strains of a waltz came over the still frozen air the skatingrink a christmas eve skaters ball that was the place for him crowds gaiety confusion somewhere to lose himself from the double hunt that would now be on by spectre and the swiss police the cops and the robbers hand in hand bonds skis hit a pile of horses dung from some merrymakers sleigh he lurched drunkenly into the snow wall of the road and righted himself cursing feebly come on pull yourself together look respectable well you neednt look too respectable after all its christmas eve here were the first houses the noise of accordion music deliciously nostalgic came from a gasthaus with a beautiful iron sign over its door now there was a twisty uphill bit the road to st moritz bond shuffled up it placing his sticks carefully he ran a hand through his matted hair and pulled the sweatsoaked handkerchief down to his neck tucking the ends into his shirt collar the music lilted down towards him from the great pool of light over the skatingrink bond pulled himself a little more upright there were a lot of cars drawn up skis stuck in mounds of snow luges and toboggans festoons of paper streamers a big notice in three languages across the entrance grand christmas eve ball fancy dress entrance francs bring all your friends hooray bond dug in his sticks and bent down to unlatch his skis he fell over sideways if only he could just lie there go to sleep on the hard trodden snow that felt like swansdown he gave a small groan and heaved himself gingerly into a crouch the bindings were frozen solid caked like his boots with ice he got one of his sticks and hacked feebly at the metal and tried again at last the latches sprang and the thongs were off where to put the bloody things hide their brilliant red markings he lugged them down the trodden path towards the entrance gay with fairy lights shoved the skis and the sticks under a big saloon car and staggered on the man at the tickettable was as drunk as bond seemed he looked up wearily zwo franken two francs deux francs the routine incantation was slurred into one portmanteau word bond held on to the table put down the coins and got his ticket the mans eyes focused the fancy dress the travesti it is obligatoire he reached into a box by his side and threw a black and white dominomask on the table one franc he gave a lopsided smile now you are the gangster the spy yes yeah thats right bond paid and put on the mask he reluctantly let go of the table and wove through the entrance there were raised tiers of wooden benches round the big square rink thank god for a chance to sit down there was an empty seat on the aisle in the bottom row at rink level bond stumbled down the wooden steps and fell into it he righted himself said sorry and put his head in his hands the girl beside him part of a group of harlequins wild westerners and pirates drew her spangled skirt away whispered something to her neighbour bond didnt care they wouldnt throw him out on a night like this through the loudspeakers the violins sobbed into the skaters waltz above them the voice of the mc called last dance ladies and gentlemen and then all out on to the rink and join hands for the grand finale only ten minutes to go to midnight last dance ladies and gentlemen last dance there was a rattle of applause people laughed excitedly god in heaven thought bond feebly now this wont anybody leave me alone he fell asleep hours later he felt his shoulder being shaken on to the rink sir please all on to the rink for the grand finale only a minute to go a man in purple and gold uniform was standing beside him looking down impatiently go away said bond dully then some inner voice told him not to make a scene not to be conspicuous he struggled to his feet made the few steps to the rink somehow stood upright his head lowered like a wounded bull he looked to left and right saw a gap in the human chain round the rink and slid gingerly towards it a hand was held out to him and he grasped it thankfully on the other side someone else was laying to get hold of his free hand and then there came a diversion from right across the rink a girl in a short black skatingskirt topped by a shockingpink furlined parka sped like an arrow across the ice and came to a crashstop in front of bond bond felt the ice particles hit his legs he looked up it was a face he recognized those brilliant blue eyes the look of authority now subdued beneath golden sunburn and a brilliant smile of excitement who in hell the girl slipped in beside him seized his right hand in her left joined up on her right james it was a thrilling whisper oh james its me tracy whats the matter with you where have you come from tracy said bond dully tracy hold on to me im in bad shape tell you later then auld lang syne began and everyone swung linked hands in unison to the music fork left for hell bond had no idea how he managed to stay upright but at last it was over and everyone cheered and broke up into pairs and groups tracy got her arm under his bond pulled himself together he said hoarsely mix with the crowd tracy got to get away from here people after me a sudden hope came to him got your car yes darling everythingll be all right just hang on to me are people waiting for you outside could be watch out for a big black mercedes there may be shooting better stay away from me i can make it wheres the car down the road to the right but dont be silly here ive got an idea you get into this parka she ran the zip down and stripped it off itll be a tight fit here put your arm into this sleeve but youll get cold do as i tell you ive got a sweater and plenty on underneath now the other arm thats right she pulled up the zip darling james you look sweet the fur of the parka smelt of guerlains ode it took bond back to royale what a girl the thought of her of having an ally of not being on his own of being away from that bloody mountain revived bond he held her hand and followed her through the crowd that was now streaming towards the exit this was going to be a bad moment whether or not that cable car had come on down the mountain by now blofeld would have had time to get one down full of spectre men bond had been seen from the train would be known to have made for samaden by now they would have covered the railway station they would expect him to try and hide in a crowd perhaps the drunken man at the entrance had remembered him if that saloon moved off and revealed the redarrowed skis it would be a cert bond let go the girls hand and slipped the shattered rolex back over the knuckles of his right hand he had gathered enough strength mostly from the girl to have one more bash at them she looked at him what are you doing he took her hand again nothing they were getting near the exit bond peered through the slits in his mask yes by god two of the thugs were standing beside the ticket man watching the throng with deadly concentration on the far side of the road stood the black mercedes petrol vapour curling up from its exhaust no escape there was only bluff bond put his arm round tracys neck and whispered kiss me all the way past the tickettable theyre there but i think we can make it she flung an arm over his shoulder and drew him to her how did you know that thats what ive been waiting for her lips crushed down sideways on his and in a tide of laughing singing people they were through and on the street they turned still linked down the road yes there was the darling little white car and then the horn on the mercedes began sounding urgently bonds gait or perhaps his oldfashioned skitrousers had given him away to the man in the car quick darling said bond urgently the girl threw herself in under the wheel pressed the starter and the car was moving as bond scrambled in through the opposite door bond looked back through the rear window he could see the two men standing in the road they would not shoot with so many witnesses about now they ran to the mercedes thank god it was pointing up the hill towards st moritz and then tracy had done a controlled skid round the s bend in the village and they were on the main road that bond had staggered down half an hour before it would be five minutes at least before the mercedes could turn and get after them the girl was going like hell but there was traffic on the road tinkling sleighs full of furwrapped merrymakers on their way back to pontresina an occasional car its snowchains rattling she drove on her brakes and her horn the same triple windhorn that sounded the high discord bond remembered so well bond said youre an angel tracy but take it easy we dont want to end up in the ditch the girl glanced sideways at him and laughed with pleasure that sounds as if you were feeling better but i cannot see you now you can take off that silly mask and my parka in a minute the heat will come on and you will be roasted and i would like to see you as i remember you but you are pleased with me life was beginning to come back into bond it was so wonderful to be in this little car with this marvellous girl the memory of the dreadful mountain of all that he had been through was receding now there was hope again after so much dread and despair he could feel the tensions uncoiling in his stomach he said ill tell you if im pleased when we get to zurich can you make it its a hell of a way to spend christmas he wound down the window and threw the dominomask out stripped off the parka and draped it over her shoulders the big sign for the main road down into the valley came up he said left here tracy filisur and then coire she took the turning in bonds estimation dangerously fast she went into a skid that bond swore was going to be uncontrolled but even on the black ice of the road she got out of it and motored blithely on bond said for gods sake tracy how in hell did you manage that you havent even got chains on she laughed pleased at the awe in his voice dunlop rally studs on all the tyres theyre only supposed to be for rally drivers but i managed to wangle a set out of them dont worry just sit back and enjoy the drive there was something entirely new in the girls voice a lilt and happiness that had certainly not been there at royale bond turned and looked at her carefully for the first time yes she was somehow a new woman radiating health and a kind of inner glow the tumbled fair hair glittered with vitality and the halfopen beautiful lips seemed always to be on the verge of a smile satisfied you look absolutely wonderful but now for gods sake tell me how you happened to be at samaden it was a bloody miracle it saved my life all right but then you tell ive never seen a man look so dead on his feet i couldnt believe my eyes i thought you must be plastered she gave him a quick glance you still look pretty bad here she leant forward to the dashboard ill switch on the blower get you properly warmed up she paused well my bit of the storys quite simple really papa rang me up one day from marseilles to find out how i was he asked if i had seen you and seemed very annoyed when he heard i hadnt he practically ordered me to go and find you she glanced at him hes quite taken to you you know anyway he said he had found out the address of a certain man you were looking for he said he was sure that by now you would have found out that address too he said that knowing you i would find you somewhere close to this address it was the piz gloria club he told me if i found you to tell you to watch your step to look after yourself she laughed how right he was well so i left davos which had really put me on my feet again like you said it would and i came up to samaden the day before yesterday the seilbahn wasnt running yesterday so i was going to come up today to look for you it was all as simple as that now you tell they had been keeping up a good speed down the sloping winding road into the valley bond turned to look through the rear window he swore under his breath perhaps a mile behind twin lights were coming after them the girl said i know ive been watching in the mirror im afraid theyre gaining a little must be a good driver who knows the road probably got snowchains but i think i can hold them now go on what have you been up to bond gave her a garbled version there was a big gangster up the mountain living under a false name he was wanted by the police in england bond was vaguely connected with the police with the ministry of defence anyway bond continued he had been sent out to make sure this was the man they wanted he had found out that he was but the man had become suspicious of bond and bond had had to get out quickly he gave her a graphic account of the moonlit nightmare of the mountain of the avalanche of the man who had been killed by the train of how he had got to samaden dead beat and had tried to hide in the crowd on the skatingrink and then he ended lamely you turned up like a beautiful angel on skates and here we are she thought the story over for a minute then she said calmly and now my darling james just tell me how many of them you killed and tell me the truth why im just curious you promise to keep this between you and me she said enigmatically of course everythings between you and me from now on well there was the main guard at the socalled club that had to be done or id be dead myself by now then i suppose one got caught by the avalanche then at the bottom one of them shot at me and i had to spear him with my skistick selfdefence i dont know how badly hes hurt and then there was the man killed by the train hed fired six shots at me and anyway it was his own fault lets say three and a half got themselves killed one way or another how many are left what are you getting at i just want to know trust me well i think there were about fifteen up there all told so that leaves eleven and a half plus the big man and there are three in the car behind would they kill us if they caught us im afraid so i havent got any weapons im sorry tracy but im afraid you wouldnt have much chance either being a witness and a sort of accomplice of mine these people think im pretty bad news for them and you are yes from now on im the worst well ive got pretty bad news for you theyre gaining on us and ive only got a couple of gallons left in the tank well have to stop in filisur there wont be a garage open and itll mean waking someone up cant hope to do it under ten minutes and theyll have us youll have to think up something clever there was a ravine and an s turn over a bridge they were coming out of the first curve over the bridge lights blazed at them from across the ravine there was half a mile between the two cars but the range across the ravine was perhaps only three hundred yards bond wasnt surprised to see the familiar blue flames flutter from the front of the car chips of granite from the overhang splattered down on the bonnet of the car then they were into the second half of the s bend and out of sight of their pursuers now came a stretch of reconstruction work where there had been a landslide there were big warning notices achtung baustelle vorsichtig fahren the broken road hugged the mountainside on the right on the left was rickety fencing and then a precipice falling hundreds of feet down into a gorge with an icefloed river in the middle of the bad stretch a huge red wooden arrow pointed right to a narrow track across a temporary bridge bond suddenly shouted stop tracy pulled up her front wheels on the bridge bond tore open the door get on wait for me round the next corner its the only chance good girl she got going without a word bond ran back the few yards to the big red arrow it was held in the forks of two upright poles bond wrenched it off swung it round so that it pointed to the left towards the flimsy fence that closed off the yards of old road leading to the collapsed bridge bond tore at the fence pulling the stakes out flattening it glare showed round the corner behind him he leaped across the temporary road into the shadow of the mountain flattened himself against it waited holding his breath the mercedes was coming faster than it should over the bumpy track its chains clattering inside the mudguards it made straight for the black opening to which the arrow now pointed bond caught a glimpse of white strained faces and then the desperate scream of brakes as the driver saw the abyss in front of him the car seemed almost to stop but its front wheels must have been over the edge it balanced for a moment on its iron belly and then slowly slowly toppled and there was a first appalling crash as it hit the rubble beneath the old bridge then another crash and another bond ran forward past the lying arrow and looked down now the car was flying upsidedown through the air it hit again and a fountain of sparks flashed from a rock ledge then somersaulting and with its lights somehow still blazing it smashed on down into the gorge it hit a last outcrop that knocked it sideways and spinning laterally but now with its lights out and only the glint of the moon on metal it took the last great plunge into the icedup river a deep rumble echoed up from the gorge and there was the patter of rocks and stones following the wreckage and then all was peaceful moonlit silence bond let out his breath in a quiet hiss between his clenched teeth then mechanically he straightened things out again put up the remains of the fence lifted the arrow and put it back facing to the right then he wiped his sweating hands down the side of his trousers and walkedunsteadily down the road and round the next corner the little white car was there pulled in to the side with its lights out bond got in and slumped into his seat tracy said nothing but got the car going the lights of filisur appeared warm and yellow in the valley below she reached out a hand and held his tightly youve had enough for one day go to sleep ill get you to zьrich please do what i say bond said nothing he pressed her hand weakly leaned his head against the door jamb and was instantly asleep he was out for the count love for breakfast in the grey dawn zurich airport was depressing and almost deserted but blessedly there was a swissair caravelle delayed by fog at london airport waiting to take off for london bond parked tracy in the restaurant and regretfully forsaking the smell of coffee and fried eggs went and bought himself a ticket had his passport stamped by a sleepy official and went to a telephone booth and shut himself in he looked up universal export in the telephone book and read underneath as he had hoped hauptvertreter alexander muir privat wohnung and the number bond glanced through the glass window at the clock in the departure hall six oclock well muir would just have to take it he rang the number and after minutes a sleepy voice said ja hier muir bond said sorry but this is im calling from the airport this is bloody urgent so ill have to take a chance on your line being bugged got a paper and pencil the voice at the other end had grown brisker hang on yes got it go ahead first of all ive got some bad news your number two has had it almost for sure cant give you any details over this line but im off to london in about an hour swissair flight and ill signal the dope back straight away could you put that on the teleprinter right now im guessing that in the next day or so a party often girls british will be coming in here by helicopter from the engadine yellow sud aviation alouette ill be teleprinting their names back from london some time today my bet is theyll be flying to england probably on different flights and perhaps to prestwick and gatwick as well as london airport if youve any planes using those airports anyway i guess theyll be dispersed now i think it may be very important to tell london their flight numbers and eta rather a big job but ill get you authority in a few hours to use men from berne and geneva to lend a hand got it right now im pretty certain youre blown remember the old operation bedlam thats just been cancelled well its him and hes got radio and hell probably have guessed id be contacting you this morning just take a look out of the window and see if theres any sign of watchers hes certainly got his men in zurich christ what a shambles the voice at the other end was tight with tension hang on there was a pause bond could visualize muir whom he didnt know except as a number going over to the window carefully drawing aside the curtain muir came back on the wire looks damn like it theres a black porsche across the road two men in it ill get my friends in the securite to chase them away bond said be careful how you go about it my guess is that our man has got a pretty good fix in with the police anyway put all this on the telex to m personally would you ciphered of course and tell him if i get back in one piece i must see him today with and if possible with someone in the same line of business from the ministry of agriculture and fisheries sounds daft but there it is its going to upset their paper hats and christmas pudding but i cant help that can you manage all that good lad any questions sure i oughtnt to come out to the airport and get some more about my number two he was tailing one of redlands men chaps been buying some pretty odd stuff from the local rep of badische anilin number two thought it seemed damned fishy didnt tell me what the stuff was just thought hed better see where it was being delivered to i thought it must be some kind of a spiel like that no you stay away from me im hot as a pistol going to be hotter later in the day when they find a certain mercedes at the bottom of a precipice ill get off the line now sorry to have wrecked your christmas bye bond put down the receiver and went up to the restaurant tracy had been watching the door her face lit up when she saw him he sat down very close to her and took her hand a typical airport farewell couple he ordered plenty of scrambled eggs and coffee its all right tracy ive fixed everything at my end but now about you that car of yours is going to be bad news therell be people wholl have seen you drive away with the mercedes on your tail there always are even at midnight on christmas eve and the big man on top of the mountain has got his men down here too youd better finish your breakfast and get the hell on over the frontier which is the nearest schaffhausen or konstanz i suppose but she pleaded james do i have to leave you now its been so long waiting for you and i have done well havent i why do you want to punish me tears that would never have been there in the royale days sparkled in her eyes she wiped them angrily away with the back of her hand bond suddenly thought hell ill never find another girl like this one shes got everything ive ever looked for in a woman shes beautiful in bed and out shes adventurous brave resourceful shes exciting always she seems to love me shed let me go on with my life shes a lone girl not cluttered up with friends relations belongings above all she needs me itll be someone for me to look after im fed up with all these untidy casual affairs that leave me with a bad conscience i wouldnt mind having children ive got no social background into which she would or wouldnt fit were two of a pair really why not make it for always bond found his voice saying those words that he had never said in his life before never expected to say tracy i love you will you marry me she turned very pale she looked at him wonderingly her lips trembled you mean that yes i mean it with all my heart she took her hand away from his and put her face in her hands when she removed them she was smiling im sorry james its so much what ive been dreaming of it came as a shock but yes yes of course ill marry you and i wont be silly about it i wont make a scene just kiss me once and ill be going she looked seriously at him at every detail of his face then she leaned forward and they kissed she got up briskly i suppose ive got to get used to doing what you say ill drive to munich to the vier jahreszeiten its my favourite hotel in the world ill wait for you there they know me theyll take me in without any luggage everythings at samaden ill just have to send out for a toothbrush and stay in bed for two days until i can go out and get some things youll telephone me talk to me when can we get married i

english church or scottish rather thats where i come from ill call you up tonight and tomorrow ill get to you just as soon as i can ive got to finish this business first you promise you wont get hurt bond smiled i wouldnt think of it for once ill run away if someone starts any shooting all right then she looked at him carefully again its time you took off that red handkerchief i suppose you realize its bitten to ribbons give it to me ill mend it bond undid the red bandanna from round his neck it was a dark sweatsoaked rag and she was right two corners of it were in shreds he must have got them between his teeth and chewed on them when the going was bad down the mountain he couldnt remember having done so he gave it to her she took it and without looking back walked straight out of the restaurant and down the stairs towards the exit bond sat down his breakfast came and he began eating mechanically what had he done what in hell had he done but the only answer was a feeling of tremendous warmth and relief and excitement james and tracy bond commander and mrs bond how utterly utterly extraordinary the voice of the tannoy said attention please passengers on swissair flight number for london please assemble at gate number swissair flight number for london passengers to gate number please bond stubbed out his cigarette gave a quick glance round their trystingplace to fix its banality in his mind and walked to the door leaving the fragments of his old life torn up amidst the debris of an airport breakfast m en pantoufles bond slept in the plane and was visited by a terrible nightmare it was the hallway of a very grand townhouse an embassy perhaps and a wide staircase led up under a spangled chandelier to where the butler was standing at the door of the drawingroom from which came the murmur of a large crowd of guests tracy in oyster satin was on his arm she was loaded with jewels and her golden hair had been piled up grandly into one of those fancy arrangements you see in smart hairdressers advertisements on top of the pile was a diamond tiara that glittered gorgeously bond was dressed in tails and the wing collar stuck into his neck below the chin he was wearing his medals and his order as cmg on its blue and scarlet ribbon hung below his white tie tracy was chattering gaily excitedly looking forward to the grand evening bond was cursing the prospect before him and wishing he was playing a tough game of bridge for high stakes at blades they got to the top of the stairs and bond gave his name commander and mrs james bond it was the stentorian bellow of a toastmaster bond got the impression that a sudden hush fell over the elegant crowd in the gilt and white drawingroom he followed tracy through the double doors there was a gush of french from tracy as she exchanged those empty mayfair kisses that end up wide of the kissers ears with her hostess tracy drew bond forward and this is james doesnt he look sweet with that beautiful medal round his neck just like the old de reszke cigarette advertisements fasten your seat belts please and extinguish your cigarettes bond awoke sweating god almighty what had he done but no it wouldnt be like that definitely not he would still have his tough exciting life but now there would be tracy to come home to would there be room in his flat in chelsea perhaps he could rent the floor above and what about may his scottish treasure that would be tricky he must somehow persuade her to stay the caravelle hit the runway and there came the roar of jet deflection and then they were trundling over the tarmac in a light drizzle bond suddenly realized that he had no luggage that he could go straight to passport control and then out and back to his flat to change out of these ridiculous skiing clothes that stank of sweat would there be a car from the pool for him there was with miss mary goodnight sitting beside the driver my god mary this is a hell of a way to spend your christmas this is far beyond the line of duty anyway get in the back and tell me why youre not stirring the plum pudding or going to church or something she climbed in to the back seat and he followed she said you dont seem to know much about christmas you make plum puddings at least two months before and let them sort of settle and mature and church isnt till eleven she glanced at him actually i came to see how you were i gather youve been in trouble again you certainly look pretty ghastly dont you own a comb and you havent shaved you look like a pirate and she wrinkled her nose when did you last have a bath i wonder they let you out of the airport you ought to be in quarantine bond laughed winter sports are very strenuous all that snowballing and tobogganing matter of fact i was at a christmas eve fancydress party last night kept me up till all hours in those great clodhopping boots i dont believe you well sucks to you it was on a skatingrink but seriously mary tell me the score why this vip treatment m youre to check with hq first and then go down to lunch with him at quarterdeck then after lunch hes having these men you wanted brought down for a conference everything top priority so i thought id better stand by too as youre wrecking so many other peoples christmases i thought i might as well throw mine on the slagheap with the others actually if you want to know i was only having lunch with an aunt and i loathe turkey and plum pudding anyway i just didnt want to miss the fun and when the duty officer got on to me about an hour ago and told me there was a major flap i asked him to tell the car to pick me up on the way to the airport bond said seriously well youre a damned good girl as a matter of fact its going to be the hell of a rush getting down the bare bones of a report and ive got something for the lab to do will there be someone there of course there will you know m insists on a skeleton staff in every section christmas day or not but seriously james have you been in trouble you really do look awful oh somewhat youll get the photo as i dictate the car drew up outside bonds flat now be an angel and stir up may while i clean myself up and get out of these bloody clothes get her to brew me plenty of black coffee and to pour two jiggers of our best brandy into the pot you ask may for what you like she might even have some plum pudding now then its ninethirty be a good girl and call the duty officer and say ok to ms orders and that well be along by tenthirty and get him to ask the lab to stand by in half an hour bond took his passport out of his hippocket then give this to the driver and ask him to get the hell over and give it to the duty officer personally tell the do bond turned down the corner of a page to tell the lab that the ink used is er homemade all it needs is exposure to heat theyll understand got that good girl now come on and well get may going bond went up the steps and rang two shorts and a long on the bell when bond got to his desk a few minutes after tenthirty feeling back to ninetenths human he found a folder on his desk with the red star in the top right corner that meant top secret it contained his passport and a dozen copies of blownup photostats of its page the list of girls names was faint but legible there was also a note marked personal bond opened it he laughed it just said the ink showed traces of an excess of uric acid this is often due to a superabundancy of alcohol in the bloodstream you have been warned there was no signature so the christmas spirit had permeated even into the solemn crevices of one of the most secret sections in the building bond crumpled the paper and then thinking of mary goodnights susceptibilities more prudently burned it with his lighter she came in and sat down with her shorthand book bond said now this is only a first draft mary and its got to be fast so dont mind about mistakes mu understand weve got about an hour and a half if im to get down to windsor by lunchtime think you can manage it all right then here goes top secret personal to m as instructed on december nd i arrived at zurich central airport at by swissair to make first contact in connexion with operation corona bond turned sideways to his secretary and as he talked looked out across the bare trees in regents park remembering every minute of the last three days the sharp empty smell of the air and the snow the dark green pools of blofelds eyes the crunch as the edge of his left hand still bruised thudded down across the offered neck of the guard and then all the rest until tracy whom without mention of romance he left in his report on her way to the vier jahreszeiten in munich then the report was finished and the muted clack of marys typewriter came from behind the closed door he would ring tracy up that night when he got back to his flat he could already hear her laughing voice at the other end of the wire the nightmare in the plane was forgotten now there was only the happy secret lookingforward to the days to come bond lost himself in his plans how to get the days off how to get the necessary papers where to have the service in scotland then he pulled himself together picked up the photostat containing the girls names and went up to the communications centre to get on the teleprinter to station z m would have preferred to live by the sea near plymouth perhaps or bristol anywhere where he could see the stuff whenever he wanted to and could listen to it at night as it was and since he had to be within easy call of london he had chosen the next best thing to water trees and had found a small regency manorhouse on the edge of windsor forest this was on crown lands and bond had always suspected that an ounce ofgrace and favour had found its way into ms lease the head of the secret service earned ј a year with the use of an ancient rolls royce and driver thrown in ms naval pay would add perhaps another ј after taxes he would have about ј to spend his london life would probably take at least half of that only if his rent and rates came to no more than ј would he be able to keep a house in the country and a beautiful small regency house at that these thoughts ran again through bonds mind as he swung the clapper of the brass shipsbell of some former hms repulse the last of whose line a battlecruiser had been ms final seagoing appointment hammond ms chief petty officer in that ship who had followed m into retirement greeted bond as an old friend and he was shown into ms study m had one of the stock bachelors hobbies he painted in watercolour he painted only the wild orchids of england in the meticulous but uninspired fashion of the naturalists of the nineteenth century he was now at his paintingtable up against the window his broad back hunched over his drawingboard with in front of him an extremely dim little flower in a toothglass full of water when bond came in and closed the door m gave the flower one last piercingly inquisitive glance he got to his feet with obvious reluctance but he gave bond one of his rare smiles and said afternoon james happy christmas and all that take a chair m himself went behind his desk and sat down he was about to come on duty bond automatically took his traditional place across the desk from his chief m began to fill a pipe what the devils the name of that fat american detective whos always fiddling about with orchids those obscene hybrids from venezuela and so forth then he comes sweating out of his orchid house eats a gigantic meal of some foreign muck and solves the murder whats he called nero wolfe sir theyre written by a chap called rex stout i like them theyre readable condescended m but i was thinking of the orchid stuff in them how in hell can a man like those disgusting flowers why theyre damned near animals and their colours all those pinks and mauves and the blotchy yellow tongues are positively hideous now that m waved at the meagre little bloom in the toothglass thats the real thing thats an autumn ladys tresses spiranthes spiralis not that i care particularly flowers in england as late as october and should be under the ground by now but i got this forcedlate specimen from a man i know assistant to a chap called summerhayes whos the orchid king at kew my friends experimenting with cultures of a fungus which oddly enough is a parasite on a lot of orchids but at the same time gets eaten by the orchid and acts as its staple diet mycorhiza its called m gave another of his rare smiles but you neednt write it down just wanted to take a leaf out of this fellow nero wolfes book however m brushed the topic aside cant expect you to get excited about these things now then he settled back what the devil have you been up to the grey eyes regarded bond keenly looks as if you havent been getting much sleep pretty gay these winter sport places they tell me bond smiled he reached into his inside pocket and took out the pinned sheets of paper this one provided plenty of miscellaneous entertainment sir perhaps youd like to have a look at my report first fraid its only a draft there wasnt much time but i can fill in anything that isnt clear m reached across for the papers adjusted his spectacles and began reading soft rain scratched at the windows a big log fell in the grate the silence was soft and comfortable bond looked round the walls at ms treasured collection of naval prints everywhere there were mountainous seas crashing cannon bellying sails tattered battle pennants the fury of ancient engagements the memories of ancient enemies the french the dutch the spaniards even the americans all gone all friends now with one another not a sign of the enemies of today who was backing blofeld for instance in the inscrutable conspiracy in which he was now certainly engaged the russians the chinese or was it an independent job as thunderball had been and what was the conspiracy what was the job for the protection of which six or seven of blofelds men had died within less than a week would m read anything into the evidence would the experts who were coming that afternoon bond lifted his left wrist remembered that he no longer had a watch that he would certainly be allowed on expenses he would get another one as soon as the shops opened after boxing day another rolex probably they were on the heavy side but they worked and at least you could see the time in the dark with those big phosphorus numerals somewhere in the hall a clock struck the halfhour twelve hours before he must have just set up the trap that killed the three men in the mercedes selfdefence but the hell of a way to celebrate christmas m threw the papers down on his desk his pipe had gone out and he now slowly lit it again he tossed the spent match accurately over his shoulder into the fire he put his hands fiat on the desk and said and there was an unusual kindness in his voice well you were pretty lucky to get out of that one james didnt know you could ski i only just managed to stay upright sir wouldnt like to try it again no and i see you say you cant come to any conclusions about what blofeld is up to thats right sir havent got a clue well nor have i i just dont understand any part of it perhaps the professorsll help us out this afternoon but youre obviously right that its spectre all over again by the way your tip about pontresina was a good one he was a bulgar cant remember his name but interpol turned him up for us plastic explosives expert worked for kbg in turkey if its true that the u that fellow powers was piloting was brought down by delayed charges and not by rockets it may be this man was implicated he was on the list of suspects then he turned freelance went into business on his own thats probably when spectre picked him up we were doubtful about your identification of blofeld the pontresina lead helped a lot youre absolutely sure of him are you he certainly seems to have done a good job on his face and stomach better set him up on the identicast when you get back this evening well have a look at him and get the views of the medical gentry i think it must be him sir i was really getting the authentic smell of him on the last day yesterday that is it seems a long time ago already you were lucky to run into this girl who is she some old flame of yours ms mouth turned down at the corners more or less sir she came into my report on the first news we got that blofeld was in switzerland daughter of this man draco head of the union corse her mother was an english governess hm interesting breeding now then time for lunch i told hammond we werent to be disturbed m got up and pressed the bell by the fireplace fraid weve got to go through the turkey and plum pudding routine mrs hammonds been brooding over her pots and pans for weeks damned sentimental rubbish hammond appeared at the door and bond followed m through and into the small diningroom beyond the hall whose walls glittered with ms other hobby the evolution of the naval cutlass they sat down m said with mock ferocity to hammond all right chief petty officer hammond do your worst and then with real vehemence what in hell are those things doing here he pointed at the centre of the table crackers sir said hammond stolidly mrs hammond thought that seeing as you have company throw them out give em to the schoolchildren ill go so far with mrs hammond but im damned if im going to have my diningroom turned into a nursery hammond smiled he said aye aye sir gathered up the shimmering crackers and departed bond was aching for a drink he got a small glass of very old marsala and most of a bottle of very bad algerian wine m treated his two glasses as if they had been chateau lafitte good old infuriator staple drink for the fleet in the mediterranean got real guts to it i remember an old shipmate of mine mclachlan my chief gunnery officer at the time betting he could get down six bottles of the stuff damn fool measured his length on the wardroom floor after only three drink up james drink up at last the plum pudding arrived flaming traditionally mrs hammond had implanted several cheap silver gewgaws in it and m nearly broke a tooth on the miniature horseshoe bond got the bachelors button he thought of tracy it should have been the ring the man from ag and fish they had coffee in ms study and smoked the thin black cheroots of which m allowed himself two a day bond burnt his tongue on his m continued with his stories about the navy which bond could listen to all day stories of battles tornadoes bizarre happenings narrow shaves courts martial eccentric officers neatlyworded signals as when admiral somerville commanding the battleship queen elizabeth had passed the liner queen elizabeth in midatlantic and had signalled the one word snap perhaps it was all just the stuff of boys adventure books but it was all true and it was about a great navy that was no more and a great breed of officers and seamen that would never be seen again it was three oclock a cars wheels scrunched on the gravel outside dusk was already creeping into the room m got up and switched on the lights and bond arranged two more chairs up against the desk m said thatll be youll have come across him head of the scientific research section and a man called franklin from the ministry of agriculture says hes the top on his subject pest control dont know why ag and fish chose to send him in particular but the minister told me theyve got a bit of trouble on their hands wouldnt tell even me what it is and they think you may have run into something pretty big well let them have a look at your report and see what they make of it all right yes sir the door opened and the two men came in number of the secret service whose name bond remembered was leathers was a bigboned rangy man with the stoop and thick spectacles of the stage scientist he had a pleasant vague smile and no deference but only politeness towards m he was appropriately dressed in shaggy tweeds and his knitted woollen tie didnt cover his collar stud the other man was small and brisk and keenlooking with darting amused eyes as became a senior representative of a ministry who had received his orders from his minister in person and who knew nothing of secret services he had put on a neat darkblue pinstripe and a stiff white collar his black shoes gleamed efficiently so did the leather of his fat briefcase his greeting was reserved neutral he wasnt quite sure where he was or what this was all about he was going to smell his way carefully in this business be wary of what he said and how far he committed his ministry of such bond reflected is government when the appropriate greetings and apologies for disturbed christmases had been made and they were in their chairs m said mr franklin if youll forgive my saying so everything you are going to see and hear in this room is subject to the official secrets act you will no doubt be in possession of many secret matters affecting your own ministry i would be grateful if you would respect those of the ministry of defence may i ask you to discuss what you are about to hear only with your minister personally mr franklin made a little bow of acquiescence my minister has already instructed me accordingly my particular duties in the ministry have accustomed me to handling top secret matters you need have no reservations in what you tell me now then the amused eyes rested on each of the other three in turn perhaps you can tell me what this is all about i know practically nothing except that a man on top of an alp is making efforts to improve our agriculture and livestock very decent of him so why are we treating him as if he had stolen atomic secrets he did once as a matter of fact said m drily i think the best course would be for you and mr leathers to read the report of my representative here it contains code numbers and other obscure references which need not concern you the story tells itself without them m handed bonds report to most of this will be new to you also perhaps you would like to read a page at a time and then pass them on to mr franklin a long silence fell in the room bond looked at his fingernails and listened to the rain on the window panes and the soft noises of the fire m sat hunched up apparently in a doze bond lit a cigarette the rasp of his ronson caused ms eyes to open lazily and then close again passed across the last page and sat back franklin finished his reading shuffled the pages together and stacked them neatly in front of him he looked at bond and smiled youre lucky to be here bond smiled back but said nothing m turned to well took off his thick spectacles and polished them on a none too clean handkerchief i dont get the object of the exercise sir it seems perfectly aboveboard praiseworthy in fact if we didnt know what we do know about blofeld technically what he has done is this he has obtained ten or rather eleven counting the one thats left the place suitable subjects for deep hypnosis these are all simple girls from the country it is significant that the one called ruby had failed her gce twice they seem to suffer and theres no reason to believe that they dont from certain fairly common forms of allergy we dont know the origins of their allergies and these are immaterial they are probably psychosomatic the adverse reaction to birds is a very common one as is the one brought on by cattle the reactions to crops and plants are less common blofeld appears to be attempting cures of these allergies by hypnosis and not only cures but a pronounced affinity with the cause of the allergy in place of the previous repulsion in the case of ruby for instance she is told in the words of the report to love chickens to wish to improve their breed and so forth the mechanical means of the cure are in practice simple in the twilight stage on the edge of sleep the sharp ringing of the bell would waken those who were already asleep the use of the metronome exactly on the pulsebeat and the distant whirring noise are both common hypnotic aids the singsong authoritative murmur is the usual voice of the hypnotist we have no knowledge of what lectures these girls attended or what reading they did but we can assume that these were merely additional means to influence the mind in the path desired by blofeld now there is plenty of medical evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis there are wellauthenticated cases of the successful treatment by these means of such stubborn disabilities as warts certain types of asthma bedwetting stammering and even alcoholism drugtaking and homosexual tendencies although the british medical association frowns officially on the practitioners of hypnosis you would be surprised sir to know how many doctors themselves as a last resort particularly in cases of alcoholism have private treatment from qualified hypnotists but this is by the way all i can contribute to this discussion is that blofelds ideas are not new and that they can be completely efficacious m nodded thank you mr leathers now would you like to be unscientific and hazard any wild guesses that would contribute in any way to what you have told us m smiled briefly you will not be quoted i can assure you ran a worried hand through his hair well sir it may be nonsense but a train of thought came to me as i read the report this is a very expensive setup of blofelds whether his intentions are benign or malignant and i must say that i think we can accept them as being malignant who is paying for all this how did he fall upon this particular field of research and find the finance for it well sir this may sound fanciful looking for burglars under the bed so to speak but the leaders in this field ever since pavlov and his salivating dogs have been the russians if you recall sir at the time of the first human orbiting of the earth by the russians i put in a report on the physiology of the astronaut yuri gagarin i drew attention to the simple nature of this man his equable temperament when faced with his hysterical welcome in london this equability never failed him and if you will remember we kept him under discreet observation throughout his visit and on his subsequent tours abroad at the request of the atomic energy authorities that bland smiling face sir those wideapart innocent eyes the extreme psychological simplicity of the man all added up as i said in my report to the perfect subject for hypnosis and i hazarded the guess that in the extremely complicated movements required of him in his space capsule gagarin was operating throughout in a state of deep hypnosis all right sir made a throwaway gesture of his hand my conclusions were officially regarded as fanciful but since you ask i now repeat them and i throw out the suggestion that the power behind blofeld in all this may well be the russians he turned to bond was there any sign of russian inspiration or guidance at this gloria place any russians anywhere in the offing well there was this man captain boris i never saw him but he was certainly a russian otherwise nothing i can think of except the three spectre men who id guess were exsmersh but they seemed definitely staff men what the americans would call mechanics shrugged he said to m well im afraid thats all i can contribute sir but if you come to the conclusion that this is dirty business for my money this captain boris was either the paymaster or supervisor of the scheme and blofeld the independent operator it would fit in with the freelance character of the old spectre an independent gang working for whoever was willing to pay them perhaps youve got something there mr leathers said m reflectively but what the devils the object of the exercise he turned to franklin well now mr franklin what do you think of all this the man from ag and fish had lit a small highly polished pipe he kept it between his teeth and reached down for his briefcase and took out some papers from among them he extracted a black and white outline map of britain and eire and smoothed it down across the desk the map was dotted with symbols forests of them here blank spaces there he said this is a map showing the total agricultural and livestock resources of britain and eire leaving out grassland and timber now at my first sight of the report i admit i was completely confused as mr leathers said these experiments seem perfectly harmless more than that to use his word praiseworthy but franklin smiled you gentlemen are concerned with searching for the dark side of the moon i adjusted my mind accordingly the result was that i am filled with a very deep and terrible suspicion perhaps these black thoughts have entered my mind by a process of osmosis with the present companys way of looking at the world he looked deprecatingly at m but i also have one piece of evidence which may be decisive excuse me but there was one sheet of paper missing from the report the list of the girls and their addresses is that available bond took the photostat out of his inside pocket sorry i didnt want to clutter up the report too much he slipped it across the table to franklin franklin ran his eyes down it then he said and there was awe in his voice ive got it i do believe ive got it he sat back heavily in his chair as if he couldnt believe what he had seen the three men watched him tensely believing him because of what was written on his face waiting for it franklin took a red pencil out of his breast pocket and leaned over the map glancing from time to time at the list he made a series of red circles at seemingly unrelated points across britain and eke but bond noticed that they covered the areas where the forests of symbols were at their densest as he made the circles he commented aberdeen aberdeen angus devon red poll lancashire poultry kent fruit shannon potatoes until ten red circles stood out on the map finally he poised his pencil over east anglia and made a big cross he looked up said turkeys and threw his pencil down in the silence that followed m said rather testily well mr franklin what have you in mind the man from ag and fish had no intention of being pushed about by someone however grand and hushhush from another ministry he bent and dug again into his briefcase he came up with several papers he selected one a newspaper cutting he said i dont expect you gentlemen have time to read much of the agricultural news in the paper but this is from the daily telegraph of early december i wont read it all its from their agricultural correspondent good man by the name of thomas these are the headlines concern over turkeys flocks ravaged by fowl pest then it goes on supplies of turkeys to the christmas market may be hit by recent fowl pest outbreaks which have resulted in large numbers of birds being slaughtered and further down figures available show that birds have been slaughtered last year total supplies for the christmas market were estimated at between and birds so much will depend now on the extent of further fowl pest outbreaks mr franklin put the cutting down he said seriously that news was only the tip of the iceberg we managed to keep later details out of the press but i can tell you this gentlemen within the past four weeks or so we have slaughtered three million turkeys and thats only the beginning of it fowl pest is running wild in east anglia and there are also signs of it in hampshire where a lot of turkeyraising goes on what you ate at lunch today was almost certainly a foreign bird we allowed the import of two million from america to cover this position up m said sourly well so far as im concerned i dont care if i never eat another turkey again however i see youve had quite a problem on your hands but to get back to our case where do we go from turkeys franklin was not amused he said we have one clue all the birds that died first were exhibited at the national poultry show at olympia early this month olympia had been cleared and cleaned out for the next exhibition before we had reached that conclusion and we could find no trace on the premises of the virus fowl pest is a virus by the way highly infectious with a mortality of one hundred per cent now then he held up a stout white pamphlet with the insignia of the united states on it how much do you gentlemen know about biological warfare leathers said we were indirectly concerned in the fringes of the subject during the war but in the end neither side used it around the americans had a plan for destroying the whole of the japanese rice crop by the use of aerial sprays but as i recall roosevelt vetoed the idea right said franklin dead right but the subject is still very much alive and very much so in my ministry we happen to be the most highly agriculturalized country in the world we had to make ourselves so during the war to keep ourselves from starvation so in theory we would be an ideal target for an attack of this kind he slowly brought his hands down on the table for emphasis i dont think it would be too much to say gentlemen that if such an attack could be launched and it can only be countered by slaughtering the poultry and animals and burning the crops we would be a bankrupt country within a matter of months we would literally be down on our knees begging for bread never thought of that said m reflectively but it seems to make sense now this continued franklin holding up the pamphlet is the latest thinking on the subject by our friends in america it also covers chemical and radiological warfare but were not concerned with those cw bw and rw they call them its a united states senate paper number dated august th prepared by the subcommittee on disarmament of the committee on foreign relations my ministry goes along with the general findings on bw with the reservation that america is a vast country and we are a very small and tightlypacked one bw would hit us a thousand times harder than it would hit the states may i read you a few extracts m positively loathed the problems of other ministries in the end on the intelligence side they all ended up on his plate bond amused watched him summon an expression of polite interest go ahead mr franklin something called bw franklin began reading in an even expository tone of voice frequently stopping to explain a point or when he skipped irrelevant passages this section he said is headed biological warfare weapons and defense this is how it goes on biological warfare he read is often referred to as bacteriological bacterial or germ warfare but it is preferred over those terms because it includes all microorganisms insects and other pests and toxic products of plant and animal life the army lists five groups of bw agents including certain chemical compounds used to inhibit or destroy plant growth microorganisms toxins vectors of disease birds and animals pests chemical anticrop compounds biological warfare agents like chemical warfare agents vary in lethality making it possible to select an agent best suited to accomplish the objective desired whether it be temporary incapacity with little aftereffects or serious illness and many deaths there are some important differences between bw and cw other than their scientific classifications bw agents have an incubation period of days sometimes weeks which produces a lag in their action while cw weapons usually bring reactions within a few seconds to a few hours cw agents are easier to detect than bw agents and identification of the latter could often be too late to permit effective countermeasures bw agents theoretically are more dangerous weight for weight than cw agents though this advantage may be cancelled because of loss of virulence by bw agents under exposure franklin paused his finger went down the page then it goes on to talk about antipersonnel bw agents like anthrax typhus smallpox botulism and so on yes his finger stopped here we are antianimal bw agents which might be used to incapacitate or destroy domestic animals are bacteria anthrax three closely related species of brucella and glanders viruses footandmouth disease rinderpest rift valley fever vesicular stomatitis vesicular exanthema hog cholera african swine fever fowl plague newcastle disease and equine encephalomyelitis franklin looked up apologetically sorry about all this jawbreaking stuff but theres not much more of it then it goes on to anticrop bw agents which they say would be used as economic weapons as i personally think is the case with the blofeld scheme and they mention a whole list including potato blight cereal stem disease crown rust of oats curly top disease of sugar beets block rot of crucifers and potato ring rot and insects such as the colorado beetle and something called the giant african landsnail which i somehow dont think we need worry about then they talk about chemical anticrop agents but i dont think we need worry about those either as theyd have to be sprayed from an aeroplane though for what its worth theyre damned lethal now this is more to the point franklins finger halted on the page the nature of bw agents makes them very adaptable for covert or undercover operations the fact that these agents are so concentrated cannot be detected by physical senses and have a delayed casualty effect would enable an operator quietly to introduce effective amounts into building ventilation systems food and water supplies and other places where they would be spread rapidly through contact with a heavily concentrated population franklin paused and that means us you see what i mean about livestock shows and so on after the show the virus gets carried off all over the country by the exhibits he went back to his pamphlet and here it goes on a significant factor is that the possible area of effective coverage is generally greater with bw than with cw agents tests have been made which show that coverage measured in the thousands of square miles is quite feasible with biological agents franklin tapped the paper in front of him how about that gentlemen we talk about the new poison gases the nerve gases the germans invented in the war we march and countermarch about radiation and the atom bomb thousands of square miles it says here a committee of the united states senate says it how many thousands of square miles are there in the united kingdom and eire gentlemen the eyes urgent and holding humour no longer looked almost scornfully into the faces of these three top officers of the secret service til tell you there are only something over one hundred thousand square miles of this little atoll of ours including the little atoll of all ireland his eyes retained their fire and let me just give you a last quote and then perhaps the eyes regained some of their humour youll realize why im getting so steamed up on this day of goodwill to all men look here what it says under defensive measures it says defense against bw warfare is greatly complicated by the difficulties involved in detection of bw agents a situation which is almost unique as to these weapons they cannot be detected by sight smell or any other physical sense so far no means have been devised for their quick detection and identification franklin threw the pamphlet on to the desk suddenly he gave a big embracing smile he reached for his little polished pipe and began filling it all right gentlemen the prosecution rests franklin had had his day a christmas he would never forget m said thank you mr franklin am i right in thinking that you conclude that this man blofeld is mounting biological warfare against this country yes franklin was definite i am and how do you work that out it seems to me hes doing exactly the opposite or rather it would if i didnt know something about the man anyway what are your deductions franklin reached over and pointed to the red cross he had made over east anglia that was my first clue the girl polly tasker who left this gloria place over a month ago came from somewhere round here where youll see from the symbols that theres the greatest concentration of turkey farmers she suffered from an allergy against turkeys she came back inspired to improve the breed within a week of her return we have the biggest outbreak of fowl pest affecting turkeys in the history of england leathers suddenly slapped his thigh by god i think youve got it franklin go on now franklin turned to bond when this officer took a look into the laboratory up there he saw rack upon rack of testtubes containing what he describes as a cloudy liquid how would it be if those were viruses fowl pest anthrax god knows what all the report mentions that the laboratory was lit with a dim red light that would be correct virus cultures suffer from exposure to bright light and how would it be if before this polly girl left she was given an aerosol spray of the right stuff and told that this was some kind of turkey elixir a tonic to make them grow fatter and healthier remember that stuff about improving the breed in the hypnosis talk and suppose she was told to go to olympia for the show perhaps even take a job for the meeting as a cleaner or something and just casually spray this aerosol here and there among the prize birds it wouldnt be bigger than one of those shavingsoap bombs thatd be quite enough shed been told to keep it secret that it was patent stuff perhaps even that shed be given shares hi the company if the tonic proved the success this man blofeld claimed it would itd be quite easy to do shed just wander round the cages perhaps she was even given a special purse to carry the thing in lean up against the wire and psst the job would be done easy as falling off a log all right if youll go along with me so far she was probably told to do the job on one of the last two days of the show so that the effects wouldnt be seen too soon then at the end of the show all the prize birds are dispersed back to their owners all over england and thats that and he paused mark you that was that three million birds dead and still dying all over the place and a great chunk of foreign currency coughed up by the treasury to replace them leathers his face red with excitement butted in he swept his hand over the map and the other girls all from the danger spots all from the areas of greatest concentration local shows taking place all the time cattle poultry even potatoes colorado beetle for that crop i suppose swine fever for the pigs golly there was reverence in leatherss voice and its so damned simple all youd need would be to keep the viruses at the right temperature for a while theyd be instructed in that the little darlings and all the time theyd be sure they were being saints marvellous i really must hand it to the man ms face was thunderous with the fury of his indecision he turned to bond he barked what do you think im afraid it fits sir the whole way along the line we know the man it fits him too right up his street and it doesnt even matter whos paying him he can pay himself make a fortune all he has to do is go a bear of sterling or giltedged if mr franklins right and that senate papers pretty solid backing for him our currencyll literally go through the floor and the country with it m got to his feet he said all right gentlemen mr franklin will you tell your minister what youve heard itll be up to him to tell the pm and the cabinet as he thinks fit ill get on with the preventive measures first of all through sir ronald vallance of the cid we must pick up this polly woman and get the others as they come into the country theyll be gently treated its not their fault then well have to think what to do with mister blofeld he turned to bond stay behind would you goodbyes were said and m rang for hammond to see the other two out he then rang again tea please hammond he turned to bond or rather have a whisky and soda whisky please sir said bond with infinite relief rotgut commented m he walked over to the window and looked out at the darkness and rain bond drew franklins map towards him and studied it he reflected that he was learning quite a lot on this case about other peoples businesses other peoples secrets from the innards of the college of arms to the innards of ag and fish odd how this gigantic manybranched tree had grown from one tiny seed in september a girl calling banco in a casino and not having the money to pay and what about bonds letter of resignation that looked pretty silly now he was up to his ears as deeply as ever in his life before in his old profession and now a big moppingup job would have to be done and he would have to do it or at any rate lead it organize it and bond knew exactly what he was going to put to m when the tea and whisky came only he could do the cleaning up it was written in his stars hammond came in with the tray and withdrew m came back to his desk gruffly told bond to pour himself a whisky and himself took a vast cup as big as a babys chamberpot of black tea without sugar or milk and put it in front of him at length he said moodily this is a dirty business james but im afraid it makes sense better do something about it i suppose he reached for the red telephone with scrambler attachment that stood beside the black one on his desk and picked up the receiver it was a direct line to that very private switchboard in whitehall to which perhaps fifty people in all britain have access put me on to sir ronald vallance would you home number i suppose he reached out and took a deep gulp at his cup of tea and put the cup back on its saucer then that you vallance m here sorry to disturb your afternoon nap there was an audible explosion at the other end of the line m smiled reading a report on teenage prostitution im ashamed of you on christmas day too well scramble would you m pressed down the large black button on the side of the cradle right now im afraid this is top priority remember blofeld and the thunderball case well hes up to his tricks again too long to explain now youll get my side of the report in the morning and ag and fish are mixed up in it yes of all people man called franklin is your contact one of their top pestcontrol men only him and his minister so would your chaps report to him copy to me im only dealing with the foreign side your friend os got the ball yes same chap he can nil you in with any extra detail you may need on the foreign angles now the point is this even though its christmas and all that could your chaps try at once and lay their hands on a certain girl polly tasker aged about who lives in east anglia yes i know its a hell of a big area but shell probably come from a respectable lowermiddleclass family connected with turkey farming certainly find the family in the telephone book cant give you any description but shes just been spending several weeks in switzerland got back the last week in november dont be ridiculous of course you can manage it and when you find her take her into custody for importing fowl pest into the country yes thats right m spelt it out the stuff thats been killing all our turkeys m muttered thank god away from the receiver no i didnt say anything now be kind to the girl she didnt know what she was doing and tell the parents itll be all right if you need a formal charge youll have to get one out of franklin then tell franklin when youve got her and hell come down and ask her one or two simple questions when hes got the answers you can let her go right but weve got to find that girl youll see why all right when youve read the report now then next assignment there are ten girls of much the same type as this polly tasker wholl probably be flying from zurich to england and eire any day from tomorrow on each one has got to be held by the customs at the port or airport of entry has a list of their names and fairly good descriptions my people in zurich may or may not be able to give us warning of their arrival is that all right yes will bring thelist to scotland yard this evening no i cant tell you what its all about too long a story but have you ever heard of biological warfare thats right anthrax and so on well this is it yes blofeld again i know thats what im just going to talk to about well now vallance have you got all that fine m listened he smiled grimly and a happy christmas to you he put the receiver back and the scrambler button automatically clicked to off he looked across at bond he said with a hint of weariness well thats taken care of this end vallance said it was about time we had this fellow blofeld in the bag i agree and thats our job and i dont for a moment think were going to get any help from the swiss even if we were to theyd trample all over the case with their big boots for weeks before we saw any action by that time the man would be in peking or somewhere cooking up something else m looked straight at bond any ideas it had come as bond knew it would he took a deep pull at his whisky and put the glass carefully down he began talking urgently persuasively as he expounded his plan ms face sank deeper and deeper in gloom and when bond concluded with and thats the only way i can see sir all i need is two weeks leave of absence i could put in a letter of resignation if it would help m turned in his chair and gazed deep into the dying flames of the log fire bond sat quietly waiting for the verdict he hoped it would be yes but he also hoped it would be no that damned mountain he never wanted to see the bloody thing again m turned back the grey eyes were fierce all right go ahead i cant go to the pm about it hed refuse but for gods sake bring it off i dont mind being sacked but we dont want to get the government mixed up in another u fiasco right i understand sir and i can have the two weeks leave yes gauloises and garlic with the walther ppk in its leather holster warm against his stomach and his own name in his passport james bond looked out of the window at the english channel sliding away beneath the belly of the caravelle and felt more like his old his presir hilary bray self he glanced at the new rolex on his wrist the shops were still shut and he had had to blarney it out of q branch and guessed they would be on time pm at marseilles it had been the hell of a rush to get off he had worked until late in the night at hq and all that morning setting up the identicast of blofeld checking details with ronnie vallance fixing up the private the munich side of his life chattering on the teleprinter to station z even remembering to tell mary goodnight to get on to sable basilisk after the holiday and ask him to please do some kind of a job on the surnames of the ten girls and please to have the family tree of ruby windsor embellished with gold capitals at

talk will he be awake im going to ring him up now good well now you go off to sleep or youll be too tired to say yes when the time comes they had not wanted to let go of each others voices but finally the last goodnight the last kiss had been exchanged and bond called the marseilles number of appareils fjectriques draco and marcanges voice almost as excited as tracys was on the line bond dampened down the raptures about the fiancailles and said now listen marcange i want you to give me a wedding present anything my dear james anything i possess he laughed and perhaps certain things of which i could take possession what is it you would like ill tell you tomorrow evening im booked on the afternoon air france to marseilles will you have someone meet me and its business im afraid so could you have your other directors present for a little meeting we shall need all our brains it is about our sales organization in switzerland something drastic needs to be done about it aha there was full understanding in the voice yes it is indeed a bad spot on our sales map i will certainly have my colleagues available and i assure you my dear james that anything that can be done will be done and of course you will be met i shall perhaps not be there in person it is very cold out these winter evenings but i shall see that you are properly looked after goodnight my dear fellow goodnight the line bad gone dead the old fox had he thought bond might commit an indiscretion or had he got fitted to his telephone a bugmeter the delicate instrument that measures the resonance on the line and warns of listeningin the winter sun spread a last orange glow over the thick overcast feet below the softly whistling plane and switched itself off for the night bond dozed reflecting that he must somehow and pretty soon find a way of catching up on his sleep there was a stagetype marseilles taxidriver to meet bond the archetype of all mariuses with the face of a pirate and the razorsharp badinage of the lower french musichalls he was apparently known and enjoyed by everyone at the airport and bond was whisked through the formalities in a barrage of wisecracks about le milord anglais which made marius for his name turned out in fact to be marius the centre of attraction and bond merely his butt the dimwitted english tourist but once in the taxi marius made curt friendly apologies over his shoulder i ask your pardon for my bad manners his french had suddenly purified itself of all patois it also smelt like acetylene gas i was told to extract you from the airport with the least possible limelight directed upon you i know all those flics and douaniers they all know me if i had not been myself the cabdriver they know as marius if i had shown deference eyes inquisitive eyes would have been upon you mon commandant i did what i thought best you forgive me of course i do marius but you shouldnt have been so funny you nearly made me laugh that would have been fatal you understand our talk here enough of it so there was a pause then marius said alas since waterloo one can never underestimate the english bond said seriously the same date applied to the french it was a near thing this was getting too gallant bond said now tell me is the bouillabaisse chez guido always as good it is passable said marius but this is a dish that is dead gone there is no more true bouillabaisse because there is no more fish in the mediterranean for the bouillabaisse you must have the rascasse the tender flesh of the scorpion fish today they just use hunks of morue the saffron and the garlic they are always the same but you could eat pieces of a woman soaked in those and it would be good go to any of the little places down by the harbour eat the plat du jour and drink the vin du cassis that they give you it will fill your stomach as well as it fills the fishermens the toilette will be filthy what does that matter you are a man you can walk up the canebiere and do it at the noailles for nothing after lunch they were now weaving expertly through the traffic down the famous canebiere and marius needed all his breath to insult the other drivers bond could smell the sea the accordions were playing in the cafes he remembered old times in this most criminal and tough of all french towns he reflected that it was rather fun this time being on the side of the devil at the bottom of the canebiere where it crosses the rue de rome marius turned right and then left into the rue st ferreol only a long stones throw from the qua des beiges and the vieux port the lights from the harbours entrance briefly winked at them and then the taxi drew up at a hideous but very new apartment house with a broad vitrine on the ground floor which announced in furious neon appareils electriques draco the welllit interior of the store contained what you would expect television sets radios gramophones electric irons fans and so forth marius very quickly carried bonds suitcase across the pavement and through the swing doors beside the vitrine the closecarpeted hallway was more luxurious than bond had expected a man came out of the porters lodge beside the lift and wordlessly took the suitcase marius turned to bond gave him a smile and a wink and a bonecrushing hand shake said curtly a la prochaine and hurried out the porter stood beside the open door of the lift bond noticed the bulge under his right arm and out of curiosity brushed against the man as he entered the lift yes and something big too a real stopper the man gave bond a bored look as much as to say clever eh and pressed the top button the porters twin or very nearly his twin dark chunky browneyed fit was waiting at the top floor he took bonds suitcase and led the way down a corridor closecarpeted and with wall brackets in good taste he opened a door it was an extremely comfortable bedroom with a bathroom leading off bond imagined that the big picture window now curtained would have a superb view of the harbour the man put down his suitcase and said monsieur draco est immddiatement a votre disposition bond thought it time to make some show of independence he said firmly un moment je vous en prie and went into the bathroom and cleaned himself up amused to notice that the soap was that most english of soaps pears transparent and that there was a bottle of mr trumpers eucris beside the very masculine brush and comb by kent marcange was indeed making his english guest feel at home bond took his time then went out and followed the man to the end door the man opened it without knocking and closed it behind bond marcange his creased walnut face split by his great goldentoothed smile got up from his desk trotted across the broad room threw his arms round bonds neck and kissed him squarely on both cheeks bond suppressed his recoil and gave a reassuring pat to marcanges broad back marcange stood away and laughed all right i swear never to do it again it is once and for ever yes but it had to come out from the latin temperament isnt it you forgive me good then come and take a drink he waved at a loaded sideboard and sit down and tell me what i can do for you i swear not to talk about teresa until you have finished with your business but tell me the brown eyes pleaded it is all right between you you have not changed your mind bond smiled of course not marcange and everything is arranged we will be married within the week at the consulate in munich i have two weeks leave i thought we might spend the honeymoon in kitzbьhel i love that place so does she you will come to the wedding come to the wedding marcange exploded you will have a time keeping me away from kitzbuhel now then he waved at the sideboard take your drink while i compose myself i must stop being happy and be clever instead my two best men my organizers if you like are waiting i wanted to have you for a moment to myself bond poured himself a stiff jack daniels sourmash bourbon on the rocks and added some water he walked over to the desk and took the righthand of the three chairs that had been arranged in a semicircle facing the capu i wanted that too marcange because there are some things i must tell you which affect my country i have been granted leave to tell them to you but they must remain as you put it behind the herkos odonton behind the hedge of your teeth is that all right marcange lifted his right hand and crossed his heart slowly deliberately with his forefinger his face was now deadly serious almost cruelly implacable he leaned forward and rested his forearms on the desk continue bond told him the whole story not even omitting his passage with ruby he had developed much love and total respect for this man he couldnt say why it was partly animal magnetism and partly that marcange had so opened his heart to bond so completely trusted him with his own innermost secrets marcanges face remained impassive throughout only his quick animal eyes nickered continually across bonds face when bond had finished marcange sat back he reached for a blue packet of gauloises fixed one in the corner of his mouth and talked through the blue clouds of smoke that puffed continuously out through his lips as if somewhere inside him there was a small steamengine yes it is indeed a dirty business it must be finished with destroyed and the man too my dear james the voice was sombre i am a criminal a great criminal i run houses chains of prostitutes i smuggle i sell protection whenever i can i steal from the very rich i break many laws and i have often had to kill in the process perhaps one day perhaps very soon i shall reform but it is difficult to step down from being capu of the union without the protection of my men my life would not be worth much however we shall see but this blofeld he is too bad too disgusting you have come to ask the union to make war on him to destroy him you need not answer i know it is so this is something that cannot be done officially your chief is correct you would get nowhere with the swiss you wish me and my men to do the job he smiled suddenly that is the wedding present you talked of yes thats right marcange but ill do my bit ill be there too i want this man for myself marcange looked at him thoughtfully that i do not like and you know why i do not like it he said mildly you are a bloody fool james you are already lucky to be alive he shrugged but i am wasting my breath you started on a long road after this man and you want to come to the end of it is that right thats right i dont want someone else to shoot my fox ok ok we bring in the others yes they will not need to know the reason why my orders are my orders but we all need to know how we are to bring this about i have some ideas i think it can be done and swiftly done but it must also be well done cleanly done there must be no untidiness about this thing marcange picked up his telephone and spoke into it a minute later the door opened and two men came in and with hardly a glance at bond took the other two chairs marcange nodded at the one next to bond a great ox of a man with the splayed ears and broken nose of a boxer or wrestler this is cheche cheche le persuadeur and marcange smiled grimly he is very adept at persuading bond got a glimpse of two hard yellowbrown eyes that looked at him quickly reluctantly and then went back to the capu plaisir and this is toussaint otherwise known as le pouff he is our expert with le plastique we shall need plenty of plastique we shall indeed said bond with pretty quick timepencils toussaint leaned forward to show himself he was thin and greyskinned with an almost fine phoenician profile pitted with smallpox bond guessed that he was on heroin but not as a mainliner he gave bond a brief conspiratorial smile plaisir he sat back and this marcange gestured at bond is my friend my absolute friend he is simply le commandant and now to business he had been speaking in french but he now broke into rapid corsican which apart from a few italian and french roots was incomprehensible to bond at one period he drew a largescale map of switzerland out of a drawer of his desk spread it out searched with his finger and pointed to a spot in the centre of the engadine the two men craned forward examined the map carefully and then sat back cheche said something which contained the word strasbourg and marcange nodded enthusiastically he turned to bond and handed him a large sheet of paper and a pencil be a good chap and get to work on this would you a map of the gloria buildings with approximate sizes and distances from each other later we will do a complete maquette in plasticine so that there is no confusion every man will have his job to do he smiled like the commandos in the war yes bond bent to his task while the others talked the telephone rang marcange picked it up he jotted down a few words and rang off he turned to bond his eyes momentarily suspicious it is a telegram for me from london signed universal it says the birds have assembled in the town and all fly tomorrow what is this my friend bond kicked himself for his forgetfulness im sorry marcange i meant to tell you you might get a signal like that it means that the girls are in zurich and are flying to england tomorrow it is very good news it was important to have them out of the way ah good very good indeed that is fine news and you were quite right not to have the telegram addressed to you you are not supposed to be here or to know me at all it is better so he fired some more corsican at the two men they nodded their understanding after that the meeting soon broke up marcange examined bonds handiwork and passed it over to toussaint the man glanced at the sketch and folded it as if it were a valuable sharecertificate with short bows in bonds direction the two men left the room marcange sat back with a sigh of satisfaction it goes well he said the whole team will receive good danger money and they love a good rough fight and they are pleased that i am coming to lead them he laughed slyly they are less certain of you my dear james they say you will get in the way i had to tell them that you could outshoot and outfight the lot of them when i say something like that they have to believe me i have never let them down yet i hope i am right please dont try me said bond ive never taken on a corsican and i dont want to start now marcange was delighted you might win with guns but not in close combat they are pigs my men great pigs the greatest i am taking five of the best with you and me that is seven how many did you say there are on the mountain about eight and the big one ah yes the big one said marcange reflectively that is one that must not get away he got up and now my friend i have ordered dinner a good dinner to be served us up here and then we will go to bed stinking of garlic and perhaps just a little bit drunk yes from his heart bond said i cant think of anything better bloodlift the next day after lunch bond made his way by plane and train to the hotel maison rouge at strasbourg his breath bearing him dose company like some noisome captive pet he was totally exhilarated by his hours with marcange in marseilles and by the prospects before him the job that was to be done and at the end of it tracy the morning had been an endless series of conferences round the model of piz gloria and its buildings that had been put up in the night new faces came received their orders in a torrent of dialect and disappeared rough murderous faces bandits faces but all bearing one common expression devotion to their capu bond was vastly impressed by the authority and incisiveness of marcange as he dealt with each problem each contingency from the obtaining of a helicopter down to the pensions that would be paid to the families of the dead marcange hadnt liked the helicopter business he had explained to bond you see my friend there is only one source for this machine the oas the french secret army of the right wing it happens that they are under an obligation to me a heavy one and that is the way i would have it i do not like being mixed up in politics i like the country where i operate to be orderly peaceful i do not like revolutions they make chaos everywhere today i never know when an operation of my own is not going to be interfered with by some damned emergency concerning algerian terrorists the rounding up of some nest of these blasted oas and road blocks house to house searches they are the bane of my existence my men can hardly move without falling over a nest of flics or sdt spies that as im sure you know is the latest of the french secret services they are getting as bad as the russians with their constant changes of initials it is the section defense terri toire it comes under the ministry of the interior and i am finding it most troublesome and difficult to penetrate not like the good old deuxieme it makes life for the peaceloving very difficult but i naturally have my men in the oas and i happen to know that the oas has a military helicopter stolen from the french army hidden away at a chateau on the rhine not fat from strasbourg the chвteau belongs to some crazy fascist count he is one of those frenchmen who cannot live without conspiring against something so now he has put all his money and property behind this general salan his chateau is remote he poses as an inventor his farm people are not surprised that there is some kind of flying machine kept in an isolated barn with mechanics to tend it oas mechanics bien entendu and now early this morning i have spoken on my radio to the right man and i have the machine on loan for twentyfour hours with the best pilot in their secret air force he is already on his way to the place to make his preparations fuel and so on but it is unfortunate before these people were in my debt now i am in theirs he shrugged what matter i will soon have them under my thumb again half the police and customs officers in france are corsicans it is an important laissezpasser for the union corse you understand at the maison rouge a fine room had been booked tor bond he was greeted with exaggerated courtesy tinged with reserve where didnt the freemasonry of the union operate bond obedient to the traditions of the town made a simple dinner off the finest foie gras pink and succulent and half a bottle of champagne and retired gratefully to bed he spent the next morning in his room changed into his ski clothes and sent out for a pair of snowgoggles and thin leather gloves sufficient to give some protection to his hands but closefitting enough for the handling of his gun he took the magazine out of his gun pumped out the single round in the chamber and practised shooting himself in the wardrobe mirror with the gloves on until he was satisfied then he reloaded and got the fitting of the stitched pigskin holster comfortable inside the waistband of his trousers he had his bill sent up and paid it and ordered his suitcase to be forwarded on to tracy at the vier jahreszeiten then he sent for the days papers and sat in front of the window watching the traffic in the street and forgetting what he read when at exactly midday the telephone rang he went straight down and out to the grey peugeot he had been told to expect the driver was chйchй he acknowledged bonds greeting curtly and in silence they drove for an hour across the uninteresting countryside finally turning left off a secondary road into a muddy lane that meandered through thick forest in due course there was the illkept stone wall of a large property and then a vast brokendown iron gateway leading into a park on the unweeded driveway were the recent tracks of vehicles they followed these past the dilapidated facade of a onceimposing chateau on through the forest to where the trees gave way to fields on the edge of the trees was a large barn in good repair they stopped outside and chйchй sounded three shorts on his horn a small door in the wide double doors of the barn opened and marcange came out he greeted bond cheerfully come along in my friend you are just in time for some good strasbourg sausage and a passable riquewihr rather thin and bitter i would have christened it chateau pisdechat but it serves to quench the thirst inside it was almost like a film set lights blazed down on the ungainly shape of the army helicopter and from somewhere came the cough of a small generator the place seemed to be full of people bond recognized the faces of the union men the others were he assumed the local mechanics two men on ladders were busily engaged painting red crosses on white backgrounds on the blackpainted fuselage of the machine and the paint of the recognition letters flbgs presumably civilian and false still glittered wetly bond was introduced to the pilot a brighteyed fairhaired young man in overalls called georges you will be sitting beside him explained marcange he is a good navigator but he doesnt know the last stretch up the valley and he has never heard of piz gloria you had better go over the maps with him after some food the general route is baslezurich he laughed cheerfully he said in french we are going to have some interesting conversation with the swiss air defences isnt it georges georges didnt smile he said briefly i think we can fool them and went about his business bond accepted a foot of garlic sausage a hunk of bread and a bottle of the pisdechat and sat on an upturned packingcase while marcange went back to supervising the loading of the stores schmeisser submachine guns and sixinch square packets in red oilcloth in due course marcange lined up his team including bond and carried out a quick inspection of sidearms which in the case of the union men included wellused flickknives the men as well as marcange were clothed in brandnew ski clothes of grey cloth marcange handed to all of them armlets in black doth bearing the neatly stitched words bundesalpenpolizei when marcange gave bond his he commented there is no such force as the federal police of the alps but i doubt if our spectre friends will know that at least the armbands will make an important first impression marcange looked at his watch he turned and called out in french two fortyfive all ready then let us roll the farm tractor attached to the wheelbase of the helicopter started up the gates of the barn were thrown wide and the great meed insect moved slowly out on to the grassland under the pale winter sun the tractor was uncoupled and the pilot followed by bond climbed up the little aluminium ladder and then into the raised cockpit and strapped themselves in the others followed into the tenseat cabin the ladder was pulled up and the door banged and locked on the ground the mechanics lifted their thumbs and the pilot bent to his controls he pressed the starter and after a first indecisive cough the engine fired healthily and the great blades began to turn the pilot glanced back at the whirring tailrotor he waited while the needle on the rotor speedindicator crept up to then he released the wheelbrakes and pulled up slowly on the pitchlever the helicopter trembled unwilling to leave the earth but then came a slight jerk and they were up and climbing rapidly above the trees the pilot retracted his wheels above the inflated snowfloats gave the machine left rudder pushed forward the joystick and they were off almost at once they were over the rhine and basle lay ahead under a thick canopy of chimneysmoke they reached two thousand feet and the pilot held it skirting the town to the north now there came a crackle of static over bonds earphones and swiss air control in thick schwyzerdьtch asked them politely to identify themselves the pilot made no reply and the question was repeated with more urgency the pilot said in french i dont understand you there was a pause then a french voice again queried them the pilot said repeat yourself more clearly the voice did so the pilot said helicopter of the red cross flying blood plasma to italy the radio went dead bond could imagine the scene in the control room somewhere down below the arguing voices the doubtful faces another voice with more authority to it spoke in french what is your destination wait said the pilot i have it here a moment please after minutes he said swiss air control yes yes flbgs reporting my destination is ospedale santa monica at bellinzona the radio again went dead only to come to life five minutes later flbgs flbgs yes said the pilot we have no record of your identification symbol please explain your registration manual must be out of date the aircraft was commissioned only one month ago another long pause now zurich lay ahead and the silver boomerang of the zьrichersee now zurich airport came on the air they must have been listening to swiss air control flbgs flbgs yes yes what is it now you have infringed the civil airlines channel land and report to flying control i repeat land and report the pilot became indignant what do you mean land and report have you no comprehension of human suffering this is a mercy flight carrying blood plasma of a rare category it is to save the life of an illustrious italian scientist at bellinzona have you no hearts down there you tell me to land and report when a life is at stake do you wish to be responsible for murder this gallic outburst gave them peace until they had passed the zurichersee bond chuckled he gave a thumbsup sign to the pilot but then federal air control at berne came on the air and a deep resonant voice said flbgs flbgs who gave you clearance i repeat who gave you clearance for your flight you did bond smiled into his mouthpiece the big lie there was nothing like it now the alps were ahead of them those blasted alps looking beautiful and dangerous in the evening sun soon they would be in the shelter of the valleys off the radar screens but records had been hastily checked in berne and the sombre voice came over to them again the voice must have realized that the long debate would have been heard at every airport and by most pilots flying over switzerland that evening it was extremely polite but firm flbgs we have no record at federal air control of your proposed flight i regret but you are transgressing swiss airspace unless you can give further authority for your flight kindly return to zurich and report to flying control the helicopter rocked there was a flash of silver and a dassault mirage with swiss markings flashed by not a hundred yards away turned leaving a trail of black vapour from the slowburning of its fuel at this low altitude and headed straight back at them swerving off to port only at the last moment the helicopter gave another lurch the pilot spoke angrily into his mouthpiece federal air control this is flbgs for further information contact international red cross at geneva am just a pilot i am not a rond de cuir a chairborne flyer if you have lost the papers that is not my fault i repeat check with geneva and in the meantime kindly call off the whole of the swiss air force which is at present trying to make my passengers airsick the voice came back but now more faintly because of the mountains who are your passengers the pilot played his trump card representatives of the worlds press they have been listening to all this nonsense coming from the home of the famous international red cross i wish you happy reading of your newspapers at breakfasttime tomorrow gentlemen and now a little peace yes and please record in your logbooks that i am not repeat not the soviet air force invading switzerland there was silence the dassault mirage had disappeared they were climbing up the valley and were already past davos the goldtipped needles of the glittering mountains seemed to be dosing in on them from right and left ahead were the great peaks bond looked at his watch barely another ten minutes to go he turned and glanced down the hatch the faces of marcange and of the others looked up at him tense and livid under the setting sun that poured in through the windows their eyes glinting redly bond held up his thumb encouragingly he spread out his ten ringers in their thin leather gloves marcange nodded there was a shirting of the bodies in their seats bond turned back and gazed ahead looking for the soaring peak that he loathed and feared hells delight etc yes there was the bloody place now only the peak was golden the plateau and the buildings were in indigo shadow soon to be lit by the full moon bond pointed the helicopter wasnt liking the altitude at feet its rotors were finding it hard to get a grip of the thin air and the pilot was struggling to keep it at maximum revs as he turned to port in towards the face of the mountain his radio crackled sharply and a harsh voice said in german and then in french landing forbidden this is private property i repeat landing forbidden the pilot reached up to the cockpit roof and switched off the radio he had studied his landingpoint on the plateau on the mockup he got to it hovered and gently came down the helicopter bounced once on its rubber floats and settled already there was a group of men waiting for them eight men bond recognized some of them they all had their hands in their pockets or in their windjackets the engine coughed to a stop and the rotors swung round briefly in neutral and halted bond heard the bang of the door being opened behind him and the rattle of the men piling down the ladder the two groups lined up facing each other marcange said with authority this is the federal police alpine patrol there was trouble up here on christmas eve we have come to investigate fritz the head waiter said angrily the local police have already been here they have made their report all is in order please leave at once what is the federal police alpine patrol i have never heard of it the pilot nudged bond and pointed over to the left to the building that housed the count and the laboratories a man clumsy in bobsleigh helmet and padding was running down the path towards the cable station he would be out of sight of the men on the ground bond said blast and scrambled out of his seat and into the cabin he leaned out of the door and shouted the big one hes getting away as bond jumped one of the spectre men shouted der englander der spion and then as bond started running away to the right weaving and dodging all hell broke loose there came the boom of heavy automatics as the spectre team got off their first rounds and bullets tracer sashed past bond with the noise of hummingbirds wings then came the answering roar of the schmeissers and bond was left alone now he was round the corner of the club and a hundred yards down the slope the man in the crash helmet had torn open the door of the garage for the bobsleighs in the foundations of the cable station he emerged carrying a oneman skeleton bob holding it in front of him as a shield he fired a burst from a heavy automatic at bond and again the hummingbirds whirred past bond knelt and steadying his gun with two hands fired three rounds with his walther but the man was now running the few yards to the glistening icemouth of the gloria express bobrun bond got a glimpse of the profile under the moon yes it was blofeld all right even as bond ran on down the slope the man had flung himself down on his skeleton and had disappeared as if swallowed up by the glistening landscape bond got to the garage damn they were all sixmen or twomen models no there was one skeleton at the back bond hauled it out no time to see if the runners were straight the steeringarm shifting easily he ran to the start and hurled himself under the protecting chain in a mad forward dive that landed him half on and half off his skeleton he straightened himself and shifted his body well forward on the flimsy little aluminium platform and gripped the steeringarm keeping his elbows well in to his sides he was already going like hell down the darkblue gutter he tried braking with the toes of both his boots damned little difference what came first on the blasted run there was this lateral straight across the shoulder of the mountain then a big banked curve he was into it now bond kept his right shoulder down and inched right on the steeringarm even so he went perilously near the top edge of the bank before he dived down into the dark gully again what came next on that metal map why in hell hadnt he studied it more carefully he got his answer it looked tike a straight but the shadows camouflaged a sharp dip bond left the ground and flew the crash of his landing almost knocked the wind out of his body he frantically dug his toes into the ice managed to get down from perhaps fifty mph to forty well well so that was dead mans leap what in hell was the next bit of murder whizzbang straight and by god it was yards when he must have been doing around seventy he remembered that on the finishing straight of the cresta the stars got up to over eighty no doubt something like that was still to come but now flashing towards him in silver and black came an sbend battling s the toes of bonds boots slid maddeningly on the black ice under his nose he could see the parallel tracks of blofelds runners and between them the grooves of his toespikes the old fox as soon as he heard the helicopter he must have got himself fixed for his only escape route but at this speed bond must surely be catching up with him for gods sake look out here comes the s there was nothing he could do about it he swayed his body as best he could felt the searing crash of one elbow against one wall was hurled across into the opposite one and was then spewed out into the straight again god almighty but it hurt he could feel the cold wind on both elbows the cloth had gone then so had the skin bond clenched his teeth and he was only halfway down if that but then ahead flashing through a patch of moonlight was the other body blofeld bond took a chance heaved himself up on one hand and reached down for his gun the wind tried to tear him off the bob but he had the gun he opened his mouth wide and gripped the gun between his teeth flexed the icecaked leather on his right hand then he got the gun in his right hand lifted his toes off the ice and went like hell but now the man had disappeared into the shadows and a giant bank reared up ahead this would be hells delight oh well if he could make this there would be another straight and he could begin shooting bond dug his toes in got a glimpse of an icewall ahead and to the left and in a flash was climbing it straight up god in a split second he would be over the edge bond hammered in his right boot and lurched his body to the right tearing at the steeringarm reluctantly the sliver of aluminium answered and bond inches from the top of the wall found himself swooping down into blackness and then out again on to a moonlit straight only fifty yards ahead was the flying figure with chips of ice fountaining up from the braking spikes on his boots bond held his breath and got off two shots he thought they were good ones but now the mad had gone into shadow again but bond was gaining gaining his lips drew back from his teeth in an almost animal snarl you bastard youre a dead duck you cant stop or fire back im coming after you like lightning soon i shall only be ten five yards behind you then youll have had it but the shadows concealed another hazard long transverse waves in the ice the boneshaker bond crashed from one to the next felt his boots being almost torn from his feet as he tried to brake nearly lost his gun felt his stomach flatten against his spine with each shattering impact felt his rib cage almost cracking but then it was over and bond sucked in air through his clenched teeth now for a length of straight but what was that ahead on the track it was something black something the size of a big lemon that was bouncing along gaily like a childs rubber ball had blofeld now only about thirty yards ahead dropped something a bit of his equipment had he the realization came to bond in a surge of terror that almost made him vomit he ground his toes into the ice no effect he was gaming on the gaily bouncing thing flashing down on it on the grenade bond sick in the stomach lifted his toes and let himself go what setting had blofeld put on it how long had he held it with the pin out the only hope was to pray to god and race it the next thing bond knew was that the whole track had blown up in his face and that he and his skeleton bob were flying through the air he landed in soft snow with the skeleton on top of him and passed out like a light later bond was to estimate that he lay there only a matter of minutes it was a tremendous explosion from the mountain above him that brought him staggering to his feet up to his belly in snow he looked vaguely up to where it had come from it must have been the club building going up because now there was the glare of flames and a tower of smoke that rose towards the moon there came the echoing crack of another explosion and blofelds block disintegrated great chunks of it crashing down the mountain side turning themselves into giant snowballs that bounded off down towards the treeline by god theyll start another avalanche thought bond vaguely then he realized that it didnt matter this time he was away to the right almost underneath the cable railway and now the station went up and bond stared fascinated as the great wires their tension released came hissing and snaking down the mountain towards him there was nothing he could do about it but stand and watch if they cut him down they cut him down but they lashed past in the snow wrapped themselves briefly round the tall pylon above the treeline tore it away in a metallic crackling and disappeared over the edge of the shoulder bond laughed weakly with pleasure and began feeling himself for damage his torn elbows he already knew about but his forehead hurt like hell he felt it gingerly then scooped up a handful of snow and held it against the wound the blood showed black in the moonlight he ached all over but there didnt seem to be anything broken he bent dazedly to the twisted remains of the skeleton the steeringarm had gone had probably saved his head and both runners were bent there were a lot of rattles from the rivets but perhaps the damned thing would run it had bloody well got to there was no other way for bond to get down the mountain his gun gone to hell of course wearily bond heaved himself over the wall of the track and slid carefully down clutching the remains of his skeleton as soon as he got to the bottom of the gutter everything began to slip downwards but he managed to haul himself on to the bob and get shakily going in fact the bent runners were a blessing and the bob scraped slowly down leaving great furrows in the ice there were more turns more hazards but at a bare ten miles an hour they were childs play and soon bond was through the treeline and into paradise alley the finishing straight where he slowly came to a halt he left the skeleton where it stopped and scrambled over the low icewall here the snow was beaten hard by spectators feet and he stumbled slowly along nursing his aches and occasionally dabbing at his head with handfuls of snow what would he find at the bottom by the cable station if it was blofeld bond would be a dead duck but there were no lights on in the station into which the cables now trailed limply along the ground by god that had been an expensive bang but what of marcange and his merry men and the helicopter as if to answer him he heard the clatter of its engine high up in the mountains and in a moment the ungainly black shape crossed the moon and disappeared down the valley bond smiled to himself they were going to have a tough time arguing themselves across swiss air space this time but marcange had thought out an alternative route over germany that would also not be fun they would have to argue the toss with nato well if a marseillais couldnt blarney his way across two hundred miles nobody could and now up the road from samaden that bond knew so well came the iron heehaw warning of the local fireengine the blinking red light on its cabin roof was perhaps a mile away bond carefully approaching the corner of the darkened cable station prepared his story he crept up to the wall of the building and looked round nobody no trace except fresh tyremarks outside the entrance door blofeld must have telephoned his man down here before he started and used him and his car for the getaway which way had he gone bond walked out on to the road the tracks turned left blofeld would be at the bernina pass or over it by now on his way down into italy and away it might still have been possible to have him held at the frontier by alerting the firebrigade whose lights now held bond in their beam no that would be idiotic how had bond got this knowledge unless he himself had been up at piz gloria that night no he must just play the part of the stupidest tourist in the engadine the shining red vehicle pulled up in front of the cable station and the warning klaxons ran down with an iron groan men jumped to the ground some went into the station while others stood gazing up at the piz gloria where a dull red glow still showed a man in a peaked cap presumably the captain of the team came up to bond and saluted he fired off a torrent of schwyzerdьtch bond shook his head the man tried french bond again showed incomprehension another man with fragmentary english was called over what is it that is happening he asked bond shook his head dazedly i dont know i was walking down from pontresina to samaden i came on a day excursion from zurich and missed my bus i was going to take a train from samaden then i saw these explosions up the mountain he waved vaguely and i walked up there past the station to see better and the next thing i knew was a bang on the head and being dragged along the path he indicated his bleeding head and the raw elbows that protruded from his torn sleeves it must have been the broken cable it must have hit me and dragged me with it have you got a red cross outfit with you yes yes the man called over to the group and one of his colleagues wearing a red cross brassard on his arm fetched his black box from the vehicle and came over he clucked his tongue over bonds injuries and while his interrogator told bonds story to the captain bade bond follow him into the toflette in the station there by the light of a torch he washed bonds wounds applied quantities of iodine that stung like hell and then strapped wide strips of elastoplast over the damage bond looked at his face in the mirror he laughed hell of a bridegroom he was going to make the red cross man cluckclucked in sympathy produced a flask of brandy out of his box and offered it to bond bond gratefully took a long swig the interpreter came in there is nothing we can do here it will need a helicopter from the mountain rescue team we must go back to samaden and report you wish to come i certainly do said bond enthusiastically and with many politenesses and no question of why he should attempt the icy walk to samaden in the dark instead of taking a taxi he was borne comfortably to samaden and dropped off with the warmest gestures of goodwill and sympathy at the railway station by a raiding personenzug to coke and then by express to zurich bond got to the door of the flat of head of station z in the bahnhofstrasse at two in the morning he had had some sleep in the train but he was almost out on his feet and his whole body felt as if it had been beaten with wooden truncheons he leaned wearily against the bell ticketed muir until a tousled man in pyjamas came and opened the door and held it on the chain um gottes willen was ist denn los he inquired angrily the english accent came through bond said its me thats los its again im afraid good god man come in come in muir opened the door and looked quickly up and down the empty street anyone after you shouldnt think so said bond thickly coming gratefully into the warmth of the entrance hall head of z closed the door and locked it he turned and looked at bond christ old boy what in hells been happening to you you look as if youd been through a mangle here come in and have a drink he led the way into a comfortable sittingroom he gestured at the sideboard help yourself ill just tell phyllis not to worry unless youd like her to have a look at the damage shes quite a hand at that sort of thing no its all right thanks a drinkll fix me nice and warm in here i never want to see a patch of snow again as long as i live muir went out and bond heard a quick confabulation across the passage muir came back phyllis is fixing the spare room shell put some fresh dressings and stuff out in the bathroom now then he poured himself a thin whisky and soda to keep bond company and sat down opposite him tell me what you can bond said im terribly sorry but i cant tell you much the same business as the other day next chapter i promise youd do better to know nothing about it i wouldnt have come here only ive got to get a signal off to m personal triple x cipher to be deciphered by recipient only would you be a good chap and put it on the printer of course muir looked at his watch twothirty am hell of a time to wake the old man up but thats your business here come into the cockpit so to speak he walked across to the booklined wall took out a book and fiddled there was a click and a small door swung open mind your head said muir old disused lavatory just the right size gets a bit stuffy when theres a lot of traffic coming or going but that cant be helped we can afford to leave the door open he bent down to a safe on the floor worked the combination and brought out what looked like a portable typewriter he set it on the shelf next to the bulky teleprinter sat down and clacked off the prefix and routing instructions winding a small handle at the side of the machine at the end of each word ok fire away bond leaned up against the wall he had toyed with various formulas on his journey down to samaden it had to be something that would get through accurately to m and yet keep muir in the dark keep his hands clean bond said all right make it this would you redoubt properly fixed stop details lacking as eye went solo after the owner who greatly regret got away and probably italicized by now stop forwarding full report from station m then gratefully accepting ten days leave signed muir repeated the signal and then began putting it in the fivefigure groups that had come off the triple x machine on to the teleprinter bond watched the message go the end of another chapter of his duties as marcange had put it on her majestys secret service what would her majesty think of this string of crimes committed in her name god it was stuffy in the little room bond felt the cold sweat break out on his forehead he put his hand up to his face muttered something indistinctly about that bloody mountain and gracefully crumpled to the floor happiness without a shadow tracy gazed at him wideeyed when she met him outside passport control at munich airport but she waited until they were inside the little lancia before she burst into tears what have they been doing to you she said through her sobs what have they been doing to you now bond took her in his arms its all right tracy i promise you these are only cuts and bruises like a bad skifall now dont be a goose they could happen to anyone he smoothed back her hair and took out his handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes she took the handkerchief from himand laughed through her tears now youve ruined my eyeblack and i put it on so carefully for you she took out her pocket mirror and carefully wiped away the smudges she said its so silly but i knew you were up to no good as soon as you said you were going off for a few days to clean up something instead of coming to me i knew you were going to get into more trouble and now marcange has telephoned and asked me if ive seen you he was very mysterious and sounded worried and when i said i hadnt he just rang off and now theres this story in the papers about piz gloria and you were so guarded on the telephone this morning and from zurich i knew it all tied up she put back her mirror and pressed the selfstarter all right i wont ask questions and im sorry i cried she added fiercely but you are such an idiot you dont seem to think it matters to anyone the way you go on playing red indians its so so selfish bond reached out and pressed her hand on the wheel he hatedscenes but it was true what she said he hadnt thought of her only of the job it never crossed his mind that anybody really cared about him a shake of the head from his mends when he went a few careful lines in the obituary columns of the times a momentary pang in a few girls hearts but now in three days time he would no longer be alone he would be a half of two people there wouldnt only be may and mary goodnight who would tuttut over him when he came back from some job as a hospital case now if he got himself killed there would be tracy who would at any rate partially die with him the little car wove expertly through the traffic bond said im sorry tracy it was something that had to be done you know how it is i just couldnt back out of it i really wouldnt have been happy here like i am now if id shirked it you do see that dont you she reached out and touched his cheek i wouldnt love you if you werent a pirate i expect its in the blood ill get used to it dont change i dont want to draw your teeth like women do with their men i want to live with you not with somebody else but dont mind if i howl like a dog every now and then or rather like a bitch its only love she gave him a fleeting smile die welt with the story in it is behind the seat on the floor bond laughed at her mindreading damn you tracy he reached for the paper he had been aching to see what it said how much had come out there it was down the central gutter between the first lead inevitably on berlin and the second equally inevitably on the miracle of the latest german export figures all it said from our correspondent datelined st moritz was mysterious explosions on piz gloria cable railway to millionaires resort destroyed and then a few lines repeating the content of the headings and saying that the police would investigate by helicopter at first light in the morning the next headline caught bonds eye in england polio scare and then datelined the day before from london a brief reuter dispatch the nine girls held at various british airports on suspicion of having had contact with a possible polio carrier at zurich airport also an english girl are still being held in quarantine a ministry of health representative said that this was purely a routine precaution a tenth girl the origin of the scare a miss violet oneill is under observation at shannon hospital she is a native of eire bond smiled to himself when they were pushed the british could do this sort of thing supremely well how much coordination had this brief report required to begin with m then the cid mis ag and fish hm customs passport control the ministry of health and the government of eire all had contributed and with tremendous speed and efficiency and the end product put out to the world had been through the press association to reuter bond tossed the paper over his shoulder and watched the raiser yellow buildings of what had once been one of the most beautiful towns in europe now slowly being rebuilt in the same old kaiser yellow file by in their postwar drabness so the case was dosed the assignment over but still the big one had got away they got to the hotel at about three oclock there was a message for tracy to call marcange at the maison rouge at strasbourg they went up to her room and got through tracy said here he is papa and almost in one piece she handed the receiver to bond marcange said did you get him no damn it hes in italy now at least i think he is that was the way he went how did vou get on it looked fine from down below satisfactory all accounted for gone yes gone for good there was no trace of your man from zurich i lost two our friend had left a surprise in his filingcabinet that accounted for cheche another one wasnt quick enough that is all the trip back was entertaining i will give you the details tomorrow i shall travel tonight in my sleepingcar you know yes by the way what about the girl friend irma there was no sign of her just as well it would have been difficult to send her away like the others yes well thanks marcange and the news from england is also good see you tomorrow bond put down the receiver tracy had discreetly retired to the bathroom and locked the door she now called can i come out two minutes darling bond got on to station m his call was expected he arranged to visit the head of station a man he knew slightly called lieutenantcommander savage in an hours time he released tracy and they made plans for the evening then he went along to his room his suitcase had been unpacked and there was a bowl of crocuses beside his bed bond smiled picked up the bowl and placed it firmly on the windowsill then he had a quick shower complicated by having to keep his dressings dry changed out of his stinking ski clothes into the warmer of the two darkblue suits he had brought with him sat down at the writingdesk and jotted down the headings of what he would have to put on the teleprinter to m then he put on his darkblue raincoat and went down into the street and along to the odeons platz bond went up to his room on the writingdesk an impressive array of dressings and medicaments had been laid out he got on to tracy and said what the hell is this have you got a passkey or something she laughed the maid on this floor has become a friend she understands people who are in love which is more than you do what do you mean by moving those flowers theyre lovely i thought they looked prettier by the window and they will get some sun there now ill make a deal if youll come along and change my dressings ill take you down and buy you a drink just one and three for me thats the right ratio between men and women all right wilco her receiver went down it hurt like hell and bond couldnt prevent the tears of pain from squeezing out of his eyes she kissed them away she looked pale at what she had seen youre sure you oughtnt to see a doctor im just seeing one you did it beautifully what worries me is how were going to make love in the proper fashion elbows are rather important for the man then well do it in an improper fashion but not tonight or tomorrow only when were married till then i am going to pretend im a virgin she looked at him seriously i wish i was james i am in a way you know people can make love without loving drinks said bond firmly weve got all the time in the world to talk about love you are a pig she said indignantly weve got so much to talk about and all you think about is drink bond laughed he put an arm gingerly round her neck and kissed her long and passionately he broke away there thats just the beginning of my conversation well go on with the duller bits in the bar then well have a wonderful dinner in walterspiels and talk about rings and whether well sleep in twin beds or one and whether ive got enough sheets and pillows for two and other exciting things to do with being married and it was in that way that the evening passed and bonds head reeled with all the practical feminine problems she raised in high seriousness but he was surprised to find that all this nestbuilding gave him a curious pleasure a feeling that he had at last come to rest and that life would now be fuller have more meaning for having someone to share it with togetherness what a curiously valid clichй it was the next day was occupied with hilarious meals with marcange whose giant trailer had come during the night to take up most of the parking space behind the hotel and with searching the antique shops for an engagement and a wedding ring the latter was easy the traditional plain gold band but tracy couldnt make up her mind about the engagement ring and finally dispatched bond to find something he liked himself while she had her last fitting for her goingaway dress bond hired a taxi and he and the taximan who had been a luftwaffe pilot during the war and was proud of it tore round the town together until at an antique shop near the nymphenburg palace bond found what he wanted a baroque ring in white gold with two diamond hands clasped it was graceful and simple and the taximan was also in favour so the deal was done and the two men went off to celebrate at the franziskaner keller where they ate mounds of weisswurst and drank four steins of beer each and swore they wouldnt ever fight each other again then happy with his last bachelor party bond returned tipsily to the hotel avoided being embraced by the taximan and went straight up to tracys room and put the ring on her finger she burst into tears sobbing that it was the most beautiful ring in the world but when he took her in his arms she began to giggle oh james you are bad you stink like a pig of beer and sausages where have you been when bond told her she laughed at the picture he painted of his last fling and then paraded happily up and down the room making exaggeratedly gracious gestures with her hand to show off the ring and for the diamonds to catch the light then the telephone rang and it was marcange saying that he wanted to talk to bond in the bar and would tracy kindly keep out of the way for half an hour bond went down and after careful consideration decided that schnapps would go with his beer and ordered a double steinhlger marcanges face was serious now listen james we have not had a proper talk it is very wrong i am about to become your fatherinlaw and i insist many months ago i made you a serious offer you declined it but now you have accepted it what is the name of your bank bond said angrily shut up marcange if you think ill accept a million pounds from you or from anyone else youre mistaken i dont want my life to be ruined too much money is the worst curse you can lay on anyones head i have enough tracy has enough it will be fun saving up to buy something we want but cant quite afford that is the only kind of money to have not quite enough marcange said furiously you have been drinking you are drunk you dont understand what you are saying what i am giving you is only a fifth of my fortune you understand it means nothing to me tracy is used to having whatever she wants i wish it to remain so she is my only child you cannot possibly keep her on a civil servants pay you have got to accept if you give me any money i swear i will pass it on to charity you want to give your money away to a dogs home all right go ahead but james marcange was now pleading what will you accept from me then a trust fund for any children you may have yes even worse if we have children i will not have this noose hung round their heads i didnt have any money and i havent needed it ive loved winning money gambling because that is found money money that comes out of the air like a great surprise if id inherited money id have gone the way of all those playboy friends of tracys you complained about so much no marcange bond drained his steinhager decisively its no good marcange looked as if he would burst into tears bond relented he said its very kind of you marcange and i appreciate it from the heart ill tell you what if i swear to come to you if either of us ever needs help will that do there may be illnesses and things perhaps it would be nice if we had a cottage in the country somewhere we may need help if we have children now how about that is it a bargain marcange turned doubtful dogs eyes on bond you promise you would not cheat me of helping you adding to your happiness when you allow me to bond reached over and took marcanges right hand and pressed it my word on it now come on pull yourself together here comes tracy shell think weve been having a fight so we have said marcange gloomily and it is the first fight i have ever lost all the time in the world i do james bond said the words at tenthirty in the morning of a crystalclear new years day in the british consul generals drawingroom and he meant them the consul general had proved himself as british consuls so often do to be a man of efficiency and a man with a heart it was a holiday for him and as he confessed he should have been recovering from a new years eve hangover and he had shaved many days off the formal period of notice but that he explained he had occasionally and improperly risked in his career if there were exceptional circumstances such as the imminent death of either party you both look healthy enough he had said when they first visited him together but thats a nasty cut on your head commander bond and the countess is perhaps looking a little pale and i have taken the precaution of obtaining special dispensation from the foreign secretary which i may say to my surprise was immediately forthcoming so lets make it new years day and come to my home my wife is hopelessly sentimental about these occasional jobs i have to do and i know shed love to meet you both the papers were signed and head of station m who had agreed to act as bonds best man and who was secretly longing to write a sensational note to the head of his london section about all this produced a handful of confetti and threw most of it over marcange who had turned up in a cylindre and a full suit of very french tails with surprisingly two rows of medals of which the last to bonds astonishment was the flings medal for foreign resistancefighters i will tell you all about it one day my dear james he had said in answer to bonds admiring inquiry it was tremendous fun i had myself what the americans call a ball and his voice sank to a whisper and he put one finger along his brown sensitive nose i confess that i profited by the occasion to lay my hands on the secret funds of a certain section of the abwehr but herkos odonton my dear james herkos odonton medals are so often just the badges of good luck if i am a hero it is for things for which no medals are awarded and he drew lines with his fingers across his chest there is hardly room on the breast of this frac which by the way is by courtesy of the excellent galeries barbes in marseilles for all that i am due under that heading the farewells were said and bond submitted himself he swore for the last time to marcanges embraces and they went down the steps to the waiting lancia someone bond suspected the consuls wife had tied white ribbons from the corners of the windscreen to the grill of the radiator and there was a small group of bystanders passersby who had stopped as they do all over the world to see who it was what they looked like the consul general shook bond by the hand im afraid we havent managed to keep this as private as youd have liked a woman reporter came on from the munchener lllustrierte this morning wouldnt say who she was gossipwriter i suppose i had to give her the bare facts she particularly wanted to know the time of the ceremony if you can call it that so that they could send a cameraman along at least youve been spared that all still tight i suppose well so long and the best of luck tracy who had elected to go away in a darkgrey tyroler outfit with the traditional darkgreen trimmings and stagshorn buttons threw her saucy mountaineers hat with its gay chamois beard cockade into the back seat climbed in and pressed the starter the engine purred and then roared softly as she went through the gears down the empty street they both waved one hand out of a window and bond looking back saw marcanges cylindre whirling up into the air there was a small flutter of answering hands from the pavement and then they were round the corner and away when they found the autobahn exit for salzburg and kufstein bond said be an angel and pull in to the side tracy ive got two things to do she pulled in on to the grass verge the brown grass of winter showed through the thin snow bond reached for her and took her in his arms he kissed her tenderly thats the first thing and i just wanted to say that ill look after you tracy will you mind being looked after she held him away from her and looked at him she smiled her eyes were introspective thats what it means being mr and mrs doesnt it they dont say mrs and mr but you need looking after too lets just look after each other all right but id rather have my job than yours now i simply must get out and take down those ribbons i cant stand looking like a coronation dyou mind she laughed you like being anonymous i want everyone to cheer as we go by i know youre going to have this car sprayed grey or black as soon as you get a chance thats all right but nothings going to stop me wearing you like a flag from now on will you sometimes feel like wearing me like a flag on all holidays and feast days bond got out and removed the ribbons he looked up at the cloudless sky the sun felt warm on his face he said do you think wed be too cold if we took the roof down no lets we can only see half the world with it up and its a lovely drive from here to kitzbьhel we can always put it up again if we want to bond unscrewed the two butterfly nuts and folded the canvas top back behind the seats he had a look up and down the autobahn there was plenty of traffic at the big shell station on the roundabout they had just passed his eye was caught by a brightred open maserati being tanked up fast job and a typical sporty couple a man and a woman in the drivingseat white dustcoats and linen helmets buttoned under the chin big darkgreen talc goggles that obscured most of the rest of the faces usual german speedsters uniform too far away to see if they were goodlooking enough for the car but the silhouette of the woman wasnt promising bond got in beside tracy and they set off again down the beautifully landscaped road they didnt talk much tracy kept at about eighty and there was windroar that was the trouble about open cars bond glanced at his watch they would get to kufstein at about one there was a splendid gasthaus up the winding streets towards the great castle here was a tiny lane of pleasure full of the heartplucking whine of zither music and the gentle melancholy of tyrolean yodellers it was here that the german tourist traditionally stopped after his days outing into cheap austria just outside the german frontier for a last giant meal of austrian food and wine bond put his mouth up close to tracys ear and told her about it and about the other attraction at kufstein the most imaginative war memorial for the war ever devised punctually at midday every day the windows of the castle are thrown open and a voluntary is played on the great organ inside it can be heard for kilometres down the valley between the giant mountain ranges for which kufstein provides the gateway but we shall miss it its coming up for twelve now never mind said tracy ill make do with the zithers while you guzzle your beer and schnapps she turned in to the righthand fork leading to the underpass for kufstein and they were at once through rosenheim and the great white peaks were immediately ahead the traffic was much sparser now and there were kilometres where theirs was the only car on the road that arrowed away between white meadows and larch copses towards the glittering barrier where blood had been shed between warring armies for centuries bond glanced behind him miles away down the great highway was a speck of red the maserati they certainly hadnt got much competitive spirit if they couldnt catch the lancia at eighty no good having a car like that if you didnt drive it so as to lose all other traffic in your mirror perhaps he was doing them an injustice perhaps they too only wanted to motor quietly along and enjoy the day ten minutes later tracy said theres a red car coming up fast behind do you want me to lose him no said bond let him go weve got all the time in the world now he could hear the rasping whine of the eight cylinders he leaned over to the left and jerked a laconic thumb forwards waving the maserati past the whine changed to a shattering roar the windscreen of the lancia disappeared as if hit by a monster fist bond caught a glimpse of a taut snarling mouth under a syphilitic nose the flasheliminator of some automatic gun being withdrawn and then the red car was past and the lancia was going like hell off the verge across a stretch of snow and smashing a path through a young copse then bonds head crashed into the windscreen frame and he was out when he came to a man in the khaki uniform of the autobahn patrol was shaking him the young face was stark with horror was ist denn geschehen was ist denn geschehen bond turned towards tracy she was lying forward with her face buried in the ruins of the steeringwheel her pink handkerchief had come off and the bell of golden hair hung down and hid her face bond put his arm round her shoulders across which the dark patches had begun to flower he pressed her against him he looked up at the young man and smiled his reassurance its all right he said in a clear voice as if explaining something to a child its quite all right shes having a rest well be going on soon theres no hurry you see bonds head sank down against hers and he whispered into her hair you see weve got all the time in the world the young patrolman took a last scared look at the motionless couple hurried over to his motor cycle picked up the handmicrophone and began talking urgently to the rescue headquarters
