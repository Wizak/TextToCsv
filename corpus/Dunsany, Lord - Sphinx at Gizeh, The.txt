 the sphinx at gizeh by lord dunsany i saw the other day the sphinxs painted face she had painted her face in order to ogle time and he has spared no other painted face in all the world but hers delilah was younger than she and delilah is dust time hath loved nothing but this worthless painted face i do not care that she is ugly nor that she has painted her face so that she only lure his secret from time time dallies like a fool at her feet when he should be smiting cities time never wearies of her silly smile there are temples all about her that he has forgotten to spoil i saw an old man go by and time never touched him time that has carried away the seven gates of thebes she has tried to bind him with eternal ropes of sand she had hoped to oppress him with the pyramids he lies there in the sand with his foolish hair all spread about her paws if she ever finds his secret we will put out his eyes so that he shall find no more our beautiful things there are lovely gates in florence that i fear he will carry away we have tried to bind him with song and with old customs but they only held him for a little while and he has always smitten us and mocked us when he is blind he shall dance to us and make sport great clumsy time shall stumble and dance who liked to kill little children and can hurt even the daisies no longer then shall our children laugh at him who slew babylons winged bulls and smote great numbers of the gods and fairies when he is shorn of his hours and his years we will shut him up in the pyramid of cheops in the great chamber where the sarcophagus is thence we will lead him out when we give our feasts he shall ripen our corn for us and do menial work we will kiss thy painted face o sphinx if thou wilt betray to us time and yet i fear that in his ultimate anguish he may take hold blindly of the world and the moon and slowly pull down upon him the house of man
