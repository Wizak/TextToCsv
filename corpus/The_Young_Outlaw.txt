the young outlaw the young outlaw or adrift in the streets chapter i the young outlaw boy is this canal street the speaker was evidently from the country he was a tall man with prominent features and a face seamed and wrinkled by the passage of nearly seventy years he wore a rusty cloak in the style of thirty years gone by and his clothing generally was of a fashion seldom seen on broadway the boy addressed was leaning against a lamppost with both hands in his pockets his clothes were soiled and ragged a soft hat which looked as if it had served in its varied career as a football was thrust carelessly on his head he looked like a genuine representative of the street arab with no thought for tomorrow and its needs and contented if he could only make sure of a square meal today his face was dirty and marked by a mingled expression of fun and impudence but the features were not unpleasing and had he been clean and neatly dressed he would undoubtedly have been considered goodlooking he turned quickly on being addressed and started perceptibly as his glance met the inquiring look of the tall stranger he seemed at first disposed to run away but this intention was succeeded by a desire to have some fun with the old man canal streets about a mile off ill show yer the way for ten cents a mile off thats strange said the old man puzzled they told me at the astor house it was only about ten minutes walk straight up thats where you got sold govnor give me ten cents and you wont have no more trouble are you sure you know canal street yourself said the old man perplexed theyd ought to know at the hotel id ought to know too thats where my store is your store ejaculated the old man fixing his eyes upon his ragged companion who certainly looked very little like a new york merchant in course dont i keep a cigar store at no i hope you dont smoke yourself said the deacon for he was a deacon solemnly yes i do my constitushun requires it my boy you are doing a lasting injury to your health said the old man impressively oh im tough i kin stand it better give me a dime and let me show yer the way the deacon was in a hurry to get to canal street and after some hesitation for he was fond of money he drew out ten cents and handed it to his ragged companion there my boy show me the way i should think you might have done it for nothing that aint the way we do business in the city govnor well go ahead im in a hurry you neednt be for this is canal street said the boy edging off a little then youve swindled me said the deacon wrathfully give me back that ten cents not if i know it said the boy mockingly that aint the way we do business in the city im goin to buy two fivecent cigars with that money you said you kept a cigarstore yourself said the deacon with sudden recollection you mustnt believe all you hear govnor said the boy laughing saucily well now if you aint a bad boy said the old man whats the odds as long as youre happy said the young arab carelessly here was a good chance for a moral lesson and the deacon felt that it was his duty to point out to the young reprobate the error of his ways my young friend he said how can you expect to be happy when you lie and cheat such men are never happy aint they though you bet ill be happy when im smokin the two cigars im goin to buy keep the money but dont buy the cigars said the deacon religion getting the better of his love of money buy yourself some clothes you appear to need them buy cloes with ten cents repeated the boy humorously at any rate devote the money to a useful purpose and i shall not mind being cheated out of it if you keep on this way youll end in the gallus thats comin it rather strong govnor hangins played out in new york i guess im all right im afraid youre all wrong my boy youre travellin to destruction lets change the subject said the street boy youre gittin personal and i dont like personal remarks whatll you bet i cant tell your name bet ejaculated the deacon horrified yes govnor ill bet you a quarter i kin tell your name i never bet its wicked said the old man with emphasis well we wont bet then said the boy only if i tell your name right you give me ten cents if i dont get it right ill give back this dime you gave me aint that fair the deacon might have been led to suspect that there was not much difference between the boys proposal and the iniquity of a bet but his mind was rather possessed by the thought that here was a good chance to recover the money out of which he had been so adroitly cheated surely there was no wrong in recovering that as of course he would do for how could a ragged street boy tell the name of one who lived a hundred and fifty miles distant in a small country town ill do it said the deacon youll give me ten cents if i tell your name yes and youll give me back the money i give you if you cant tell thats it govnor then whats my name my boy and the deacon extended his hand in readiness to receive the forfeit of a wrong answer deacon john hopkins answered the boy confidently the effect on the old man was startling he was never more surprised in his life he stared at the boy openmouthed in bewilderment and wonder well i declare he ejaculated i never heard of such a thing aint i right govnor yes my boy youre right but how on earth did you find out give me the money and ill tell you and the boy extended his hand the deacon drew the money from his vestpocket and handed it to the young arab without remonstrance now tell me my boy how you knowd me the boy edged off a few feet then lifted his venerable hat so as to display the whole of his face id ought to know you deacon he said im sam barker by gracious if it aint sam ejaculated the old man hallo stop i say but sam was halfway across the street the deacon hesitated an instant and then dashed after him his long cloak floating in the wind and his hat unconsciously pushed back on the top of his head stop you sam he shouted but sam with his head over his shoulder already three rods in advance grinned provokingly but appeared to have no intention of stopping the deacon was not used to running nor did he make due allowance for the difficulty of navigating the crowded streets of the metropolis he dashed headlong into an applestand and suffered disastrous shipwreck the applestand was overturned the deacons hat flew off and he found himself sprawling on the sidewalk with apples rolling in all directions around him and an angry dame showering maledictions upon him and demanding compensation for damages the deacon picked himself up bruised and ashamed recovered his hat which had rolled into a mudpuddle and was forced to pay the woman a dollar before he could get away when this matter was settled he looked for sam but the boy was out of sight in fact he was just around the corner laughing as if he would split he had seen his pursuers discomfiture and regarded it as a huge practical joke i never had such fun in all my life he ejaculated with difficulty and he went off into a fresh convulsion the old feller wont forget me in a hurry chapter ii sams early life three years before the meeting described in the previous chapter sam barker became an orphan by the death of his father the father was an intemperate man and no one grieved much for his death sam felt rather relieved than otherwise he had received many a beating from his father in his fits of drunken fury and had been obliged to forage for himself for the most part getting a meal from one neighbor a basket of provision from another and so managed to eke out a precarious subsistence in the tumbledown shanty which he and his father occupied mr barker left no will for the good and sufficient reason that he had no property to dispose of so on the day after the funeral sam found himself a candidate for the poorhouse he was a stout boy of twelve strong and sturdy in spite of insufficient food and certainly had suffered nothing from luxurious living it was a country town in connecticut near the rhode island border we will call it dudley the selectmen deliberated what should be done with sam there isnt much for a lad like him to do at the poorhouse said major stebbins hed ought to be set to work why dont you take him deacon hopkins i do need a boy said the deacon but im most afeard to take sam hes a dreadful mischievous boy ive heerd hes had a bad example in his father said the major you could train him up the way hed ought to go mebbe i could said the deacon flattered by this tribute and reflecting moreover that he could get a good deal of work out of sam without being obliged to pay him wages you could train him up to be a respectable man said the major they wouldnt know what to do with him at the poorhouse so the deacon was prevailed upon to take sam to bring up youre goin to live with me samuel said the deacon calling the boy to his side am i asked sam surveying the old man attentively yes i shall try to make a man of you ill get to be a man anyway if i live long enough said sam i mean i will make a man of you in a moral sense explained the deacon this however was above sams comprehension what would you like to do when youre a man asked the deacon smoke a pipe answered sam after some reflection the deacon held up his hands in horror what a misguided youth he exclaimed can you think of nothing better than to smoke a pipe dad liked it said sam but i guess he liked rum better your father was a misguided man said the deacon he wasted his substance in riotous living youd ought to have seen him when he was tight said sam confidentially didnt he tear round then hed fling sticks of wood at my head o jolly didnt i run i used to hide under the bed when i couldnt run out of doors your fathers dead and gone i dont want to talk against him but i hope youll grow up a very different man do you think you will like to live with me i guess so said sam you live in a good house where the rain dont leak through the roof on your head youll give me lots to eat too wont you you shall have enough said the deacon cautiously but it is bad to overeat boys ought to be moderate i didnt overeat to home said sam i went one day without eatin a crumb you shall have enough to eat at my house but you must render a return whats that you must pay me for it i cant i aint got a cent you shall pay me in work he that does not work shall not eat have i got to work very hard asked sam anxiously i will not task you beyond your strength but i shall expect you to work faithfully i work myself everybody works in my house sam was occupied for a brief space in considering the great problem that connects labor and eating somehow it didnt seem quite satisfactory i wish i was a pig he burst out rather unexpectedly why demanded the deacon amazed pigs have a better time than men and boys they have all they can eat and dont have to work for it nuther im surprised at you said the deacon shocked pigs are only brute animals they have no souls would you be willing to give up your immortal soul for the sake of bein idle and doin no work i dont know anything bout my immortal soul what good does it do me inquired sam i declare the boys actilly gropin in heathen darkness said the deacon beginning to think he had undertaken a tough job whats that asked sam mystified i havent time to tell you now but i must have a long talk with you some day you aint had no sort of bringing up do you ever read the bible no but ive read the life of capn kidd he was a smart man though captain kidd the pirate asked the deacon horrified yes want he a great man he calls a pirate a great man groaned the deacon i think id like to be a pirate said sam admiringly then youd die on the gallus exclaimed the deacon with energy no i wouldnt i wouldnt let em catch me said sam confidently i never heerd a boy talk so said the deacon hes as bad as a a hottentot deacon hopkins had no very clear ideas as to the moral or physical condition of hottentots or where they lived but had a general notion that they were in a benighted state and the comparison seemed to him a good one not so to sam youre calling me names he said discontentedly you called me a hottentot i fear you are very much like those poor benighted creatures samuel said his new guardian but it isnt wholly your fault you have never had any religious or moral instruction this must be rectified i shall buy you a catechism this very day will you asked sam eagerly who it must be explained had an idea that a catechism was something good to eat yes ill stop at the store and get one they went into pendletons store a general country variety store in which the most dissimilar articles were kept for sale have you got a catechism asked the deacon entering with sam at his side weve got just one left how much is it ten cents ill take it sam looked on with interest till the clerk produced the article then his countenance underwent a change why its a book he said of course it is it is a very good book from which you will learn all about your duty and your religious obligations you neednt buy it i dont want it said sam dont want the catechism said the deacon not without anger no it aint any good my boy i know better what is good for you than you do i shall buy you the catechism id rather youd get me that book said sam pointing to a thin pamphlet copy of jack the giantkiller but deacon hopkins persisted in making the purchase proposed are there any pictures in it asked sam no then i shant like it you dont know what is for your good i hope you will be wiser in time but here we are at the house come right in and mind you wipe your feet this was sams first introduction into the hopkins household he proved a disturbing element as we shall presently see chapter iii a hard case the first meal to which sam sat down at the deacons house was supper it was only a plain supper tea bread and butter and applepie but to sam who was not used to regular meals of any kind it seemed luxurious he despatched slice after slice of bread eating twice as much as any one else at the table and after eating his share of the pie gazed hungrily at the single slice which remained on the plate and asked for that also deacon hopkins thought it was time to interfere youve had one piece aready he said i know it said sam but im hungry i dont see how you can be youve eat more than any of us it takes a good deal to fill me up said sam frankly the boyll eat us out of house and home said mrs hopkins in alarm you cant have any more youve had enough sam withdrew his plate he did not look abashed for he was never much inclined that way nor did his feelings appear to be hurt for he was not sensitive but he took the matter coolly and pushing back his chair from the table was about to leave the room where are you agoin asked his new guardian out doors stop ive got something for you to do the deacon went to the mantelpiece and took therefrom the catechism you aint had no bringin up samuel he said you dont know nothin about your moral and religious obligations its my dooty to make you learn how to walk uprightly i can walk straight now said sam i dont mean that i mean in a moral sense come here sam unwillingly drew near the deacon here i want you to study the first page of the catechism and recite it to me before you go to bed sam took the book and looked at the first page doubtfully whats the good of it he demanded in a discontented voice whats the good of the catechism exclaimed the deacon shocked itll larn you your duties itll benefit your immortal soul i dont care if it will said sam perversely what do i care about my soul it never did me no good did you ever see such a heathen martha said the deacon in despair turning to his wife youll be sorry you ever took him said mrs hopkins shaking her head set down in the corner and larn your lesson samuel said the old man sam looked undecided whether to obey or not but under the circumstances he thought it best to obey he began to read the catechism but it did not interest him his eyes were not long fixed on the printed page they moved about the room following the movements of mrs hopkins as she cleared off the table he saw her take the pie and place it in the closet his eyes glistened as he caught sight of an entire pie on the lower shelf designed doubtless for tomorrows supper i wish i had it he thought to himself wouldnt it be jolly pretty soon the deacon took his hat and cane and went out then mrs hopkins went into the next room and sam was left alone there was a fine chance to escape and sam was not slow in availing himself of it he dropped the catechism on the floor seized his hat and darted out of the room finding his way out of the house through the front door he heaved a sigh of relief as he found himself out in the open air catching sight of the deacon in a field to the right he jumped over a stone wall to the left and made for a piece of woods a short distance away it was not sams intention to run away he felt that it would be foolish to leave a house where he got such good suppers but he wanted a couple of hours of freedom he did not mean to return till it was too late to study the catechism any longer whats the use of wearin out a fellers eyes over such stuff he thought it is not necessary to follow sams movements through the evening at nine oclock he opened the front door and went in not exactly abashed but uncertain how the deacon would receive him deacon hopkins had his steelbowed spectacles on and was engaged in reading a good book he looked up sternly as sam entered samuel where have you been he asked out in the woods said sam coolly didnt i tell you to get your catechism demanded the old man sternly so i did said sam without blushing i am afraid you are telling a lie mrs hopkins said she went out of the room a minute and when she came back you were gone is that so yes i guess so said sam then how did you have time to larn your lesson it wasnt long muttered sam come here and i will see if you know anything about it the deacon took the book laid it flat on his lap and read out the first question looking inquiringly at sam for the answer sam hesitated and scratched his head i give it up said he do you think i am askin conundrums said the deacon sternly no said sam honestly why dont you know because i cant tell because you didnt study it aint you ashamed of your ignorance whats the use of knowin it is very important said the deacon impressively now i will ask you the next question sam broke down and confessed that he didnt know then you told me a lie you said you studied the lesson i didnt understand it then you should have studied longer dont you know it is wicked to lie a feller cant tell the truth all the time said sam as if he were stating a wellknown fact certainly he can said the deacon i always do do you inquired sam regarding the old man with curiosity of course it is every ones duty to tell the truth you ought to die rather than tell a lie i have read of a man who was threatened with death he might have got off if he had told a lie but he wouldnt did he get killed asked sam with interest yes then he must have been a great fool said sam contemptuously you wouldnt catch me makin such a fool of myself he was a noble man said the deacon indignantly he laid down his life for the truth what good did it do said sam i am afraid samuel you are in a very benighted condition you appear to have no conceptions of duty i guess i havent said sam i dunno what they are it is all the more necessary that you should study your catechism i shall expect you to get the same lesson tomorrow evenin its too late to study now so it is said sam with alacrity i will show you where you are to sleep you must get up airly to go to work i will come and wake you up sam was not overjoyed at this announcement it did not strike him that he should enjoy going to work early in the morning however he felt instinctively that it would do no good to argue the matter at present and he followed the deacon upstairs in silence he was ushered into a small room partitioned off from the attic youll sleep there said the deacon pointing to a cotbed in the corner ill call you at five oclock tomorrow mornin sam undressed himself and got into bed this is jolly thought he a good deal better than at home if it warnt for that plaguey catechism id like livin here fustrate i wish i had another piece of that pie in ten minutes sam was fast asleep but the deacon was not so fortunate he lay awake a long time wondering in perplexity what he should do to reform the young outlaw of whom he had taken charge hes a curus boy thought the good man seems to have no more notion of religion than a choctaw or a hottentot an yet hes been livin in a christian community all his life im afeared he takes after his father chapter iv sam frightens the household sam usually slept the whole night through but tonight was an exception it might have been because he was in a strange bed and in a strange house at any rate he woke in time to hear the clock on the church of which his guardian was deacon strike two where am i was his first thought he remembered almost immediately and the thought made him broad awake he ought not to have been hungry at that hour and in fact he was not but the thought of the pie forced itself upon his mind and he felt a longing for the slice that was left over from supper quick upon this thought came another why couldnt he creep downstairs softly and get it the deacon and his wife were fast asleep who would find him out a boy better brought up than sam might have reflected that it was wrong but as the deacon said sam had no conceptions of duty or more properly his conscience was not very active he got out of bed slipped on his stockings and crept softly downstairs feeling his way it was very dark for the entries were unlighted but finally he reached the kitchen without creating any alarm now for the closet it was not locked and sam opened the door without difficulty i wish i had a match sos to see where the pie is he thought he felt around but the pie must have been placed elsewhere for he could not find it it had really been placed on the highest shelf which sam had not as yet explored but there are dangers in feeling around in the dark our hero managed to dislodge a pile of plates which fell with a crash upon his feet there was a loud crash of broken crockery and the noise was increased by the howls of sam who danced up and down with pain the noise reached the chamber where the deacon and his wife were calmly reposing mrs hopkins was a light sleeper and was awakened at once she was startled and terrified and sitting up in bed shook her husband violently by the shoulder deacon deacon hopkins she exclaimed whats the matter asked the deacon drowsily matter enough theres robbers downstairs now the deacon was broad awake robbers he exclaimed pooh nonsense youre dreamin wife just then there was another racket sam in trying to effect his escape tumbled over a chair and there was a yell of pain am i dreaming now deacon demanded his wife triumphantly youre right wife said the deacon turning pale and trembling its an awful situation what shall we do do go downstairs and confront the villains returned his wife energetically they might shoot me said her husband panicstricken theyre theyre said to be very desperate fellows are you a man and wont defend your property exclaimed his wife taunting him do you want me to go down perhaps youd better said the deacon accepting the suggestion with alacrity what shrieked mrs hopkins you are willing they should shoot me they wouldnt shoot a woman said the deacon but his wife was not appeased just then the unlucky sam trod on the tail of the cat who was quietly asleep on the hearth with the instinct of selfdefence she scratched his leg which was undefended by the customary clothing and our hero who did not feel at all heroic in the dark not knowing what had got hold of him roared with pain and fright this is terrible gasped the deacon martha is the door locked no then ill get up and lock it o lord what will become of us sam was now ascending the stairs and though he tried to walk softly the stairs creaked beneath his weight theyre comin upstairs exclaimed mrs hopkins lock the door quick deacon or we shall be murdered in our bed the deacon reached the door in less time than he would have accomplished the same feat in the daytime and hurriedly locked it its locked martha he said but they may break it down or fire through the door lets hide under the bed suggested the heroic deacon dont speak so loud theyll hear i wish it was mornin the deacon stood at the door listening and made a discovery theyre goin up into the garret he announced thats strange what do they want up there i wonder they cant think weve got anything valuable up there deacon burst out mrs hopkins with a sudden idea i believe weve been fooled fooled what do you mean i believe it isnt robbers not robbers why you told me it was said her husband bewildered i believe its that boy what sam yes what would he want downstairs i dont know but its him ill be bound light the lamp deacon and go up and see but it might be robbers objected the deacon in alarm they might get hold of me and kill me i didnt think you were such a coward mr hopkins said his wife contemptuously when she indulged in severe sarcasm she was accustomed to omit her husbands title i aint a coward but i dont want to risk my life its a clear flyin in the face of providence youd ought to see that it is martha said the deacon reproachfully i dont see it i see that you are frightened thats what i see light the lamp and ill go up myself well martha its better for you to go they wont touch a woman he lighted the lamp and his wife departed on her errand it might have been an unconscious action on the part of the deacon but he locked the door after his wife mrs hopkins proceeded to the door of sams bedchamber and as the door was unfastened she entered of course he was still awake but he pretended to be asleep sam said mrs hopkins there was a counterfeited snore sam say sam took no notice the lady took him by the shoulder and shook him with no gentle hand so that our hero was compelled to rouse himself whats up he asked rubbing his eyes in apparent surprise i am said mrs hopkins shortly and you have been i protested sam innocently why i was sound asleep when you came in i dont know whats been goin on is it time to get up what have you been doing downstairs demanded mrs hopkins sternly who says ive been downstairs asked sam im sure you have i heard you it must have been somebody else there is no one else to go down neither the deacon nor myself has been down likely its thieves but mrs hopkins felt convinced from sams manner that he was the offender and she determined to make him confess it get up she said and go down with me im sleepy objected sam so am i but i mean to find out all about this matter sam jumped out of bed and unwillingly accompanied mrs hopkins downstairs the latter stopped at her own chamberdoor and tried to open it whos there asked the deacon tremulously i am said his wife emphatically so you locked the door on your wife did you because you thought there was danger it does you great credit upon my word what have you found out asked her husband evading the reproach was it sam that made all the noise how could i said sam when i was fast asleep im goin to take him down with me to see what mischiefs done said mrs hopkins do you want to go too the deacon after a little hesitation followed his more courageous spouse at a safe distance however and the three entered the kitchen which had been the scene of sams noisy exploits it showed traces of his presence in an overturned chair moreover the closetdoor was wide open and broken pieces of crockery were scattered over the floor a light dawned upon mrs hopkins she had solved the mystery chapter v sam combines business with pleasure you came down after that pie she said turning upon sam what pie asked sam looking guilty however dont ask me you know well enough you couldnt find it in the dark and thats the way you came to make such a noise ten of my nice plates broken too what do you say to that deacon hopkins samuel said the deacon did you do this wicked thing a moments reflection convinced sam that it would be idle to deny it longer the proofs of his guilt were too strong he might have plead in his defence emotional insanity but he was not familiar with the course of justice in new york he was however fertile in expedients and thought of the next best thing mebbe i walked in my sleep he admitted did you ever walk in your sleep asked the deacon hastily lots of times said sam it is rather strange you should go to the closet in your sleep said mrs hopkins suspiciously i suppose if youd found it youd have eaten it in your sleep likely i should said sam i was dreamin of the pie you know how to make pie mrs hopkins i never tasted so good before mrs hopkins was not a soft woman but she was proud of her cooking and accessible to flattery on that subject sam could not have defended himself better that may be she said about your walking in your sleep but once is enough hereafter ill lock your door on the outside i cant be waked up every night nor i cant have my plates broken spose the house should catch fire suggested sam who didnt fancy being locked up in his room if it does ill come and let you out the house is safer when youre safe in bed my wife is right samuel said the deacon recovering his dignity now that his fears were removed you must be locked in after tonight sam did not reply on the whole he felt glad to get off so well after alarming the house so seriously do you mean to stay downstairs all night deacon hopkins demanded his wife with uncalledfor asperity if so i shall leave you to yourself im ready to go up when you are said her husband i thought you mightnt feel like stayin down here alone much protection youd be in time of danger mr hopkins you that locked the door on your wife because you was afraid i wasnt thinkin stammered the deacon probably not said his wife in an incredulous tone now go up its high time we were all in bed again sam was not called at as early an hour as the deacon intended the worthy man in consequence of his slumbers being interrupted overslept himself and it was seven oclock when he called sam get up samuel he said its dreadful late and you must be spry or you wont catch up with the work work however was not prominent in sams mind as his answer showed is breakfast ready he asked rubbing his eyes its most ready get right up for its time to go to work i spose well have breakfast first said sam if its ready under these circumstances sam did not hurry he did not care to work before breakfast nor for that matter afterwards if he could help it so he made a leisurely though not an elaborate toilet and did not come down till mrs hopkins called sharply up the attic stairs come down you sam all right maam im comin said sam who judged rightly that breakfast was ready we shant often let you sleep so late said mrs hopkins who sat behind the waiter we were broken of our rest through your cutting up last night and so we overslept ourselves its pretty early said sam wed ought to have been at work in the field an hour ago said the deacon at the table sam found work that suited him better youve got a good appetite said mrs hopkins as sam took the seventh slice of bread i most generally have said sam with his mouth full thats encouraging im sure said mrs hopkins drily there was no pie on the table as sam noticed to his regret however he was pretty full when he rose from the table now samuel you may come along with me said the deacon putting on his hat sam followed him out to the barn where in one corner were kept the hoes rakes and other farming implements in use heres a hoe for you said the deacon what are we going to do asked sam the potatoes need hoeing did you ever hoe potatoes no youll larn it aint hard the field was some little distance from the house a twoacre lot wholly devoted to potatoes i guess well begin at the further corner said the deacon come along when they had reached the part of the field specified the deacon stopped now said he just see how i do it and he carefully hoed around one of the hills there you see its easy i guess i can do it are you goin to stay here no ive got to go to the village to the blacksmiths ill be back in about two hours jest hoe right along that row and then come back again on the next do you understand yes said sam i want you to work as spry as you can sos to make up for lost time what time do you have dinner asked our hero you aint hungry so quick be you no but i shall be bimeby i thought id like to know when to quit work and go to dinner ill be back before that you neednt worry about that the deacon turned and directed his steps homeward as long as he was in sight sam worked with tolerable speed but when the tall and stooping figure had disappeared from view he rested and looked around him itll be a sight of work to hoe all them potatoes he said to himself i wonder if the old man expects me to do the whole itll be a tough job sam leisurely hoed another hill its gettin hot he said why dont they have trees to give shade then it would be more comfortable he hoed another hill taking a little longer time i guess there must be a million hills he reflected looking around him thoughtfully itll take me from now till next winter to hoe em all at the rate sam was working his calculation of the time it would take him was not far out probably he finished another hill just then a cat out on a morning walk chanced to pass through the field a few rods away now sam could never see a cat without wanting to chase it a fact which would have led the cat had she been aware of it to give him a wide berth but unluckily sam saw her scat he exclaimed and grasping his hoe he ran after puss the cat took alarm and climbing the wall which separated the potatofield from the next sped over it in terror sam followed with whoops and yells which served to accelerate her speed occasionally he picked up a stone and threw at her and once he threw the hoe in the excitement of his chase but four legs proved more than a match for two and finally he was obliged to give it up but not till he had run more than quarter of a mile he sat down to rest on a rock and soon another boy came up with a fishingpole over his shoulder what are you doing sam he asked ive been chasin a cat said sam didnt catch her did you no hang it whered you get that hoe im to work for deacon hopkins hes took me where are you goin afishing i wish i could go so do i id like company where are you goin to fish in a brook close by down at the bottom of this field ill go and look on a minute or two i guess there isnt any hurry about them potatoes the minute or two lengthened to an hour and a half when sam roused himself from his idle mood and shouldering his hoe started for the field where he had been set to work it was full time the deacon was there before him surveying with angry look the halfdozen hills which were all that his young assistant had thus far hoed now therell be a fuss thought sam and he was not far out in that calculation chapter vi sams sudden sickness where have you been you young scamp demanded the deacon wrathfully i just went away a minute or two said sam abashed a minute or two ejaculated the deacon it may have been more said sam you see i aint got no watch to tell time by how comes it that you have only got through six hills all the morning said the deacon sternly well you see a cat came along sam began to explain what if she did interrupted the deacon she didnt stop your work did she why i thought id chase her out of the field what for i thought she might scratch up some of the potatoes said sam a brilliant excuse dawning upon him how long did it take you to chase her out of the field where she wasnt doing any harm i was afraid shed come back so i chased her a good ways did you catch her no but i drove her away i guess she wont come round here again said sam in the tone of one who had performed a virtuous action did you come right back i sat down to rest you see i was pretty tired with running so fast if you didnt run any faster than you have worked a snail would catch you in half a minute said the old man with justifiable sarcasm samuel your excuse is good for nothing i must punish you sam stood on his guard prepared to run if the deacon should make hostile demonstrations but his guardian was not a man of violence and did not propose to inflict blows he had another punishment in view suited to sams particular case ill go right to work said sam seeing that no violence was intended and hoping to escape the punishment threatened whatever it might be youd better said the deacon our hero i am afraid he has not manifested any heroic qualities as yet went to work with remarkable energy to the imminent danger of the potatotops which he came near uprooting in several instances is this fast enough he asked itll do ill take the next row and well work along together take care i dont want the potatoes dug up they kept it up for an hour or more sam working more steadily probably than he had ever done before in his life he began to think it was no joke as he walked from hill to hill keeping up with the deacons steady progress there aint much fun about this he thought i dont like workin on a farm its awful tiresome whats the use of hoein potatoes he asked after a while wont they grow just as well without it no said the deacon i dont see why not they need to have the earth loosened around them and heaped up where its fallen away its a lot of trouble said sam we must all work said the deacon sententiously i wish potatoes growed on trees like apples said sam they wouldnt be no trouble then you mustnt question the almightys doins samuel said the deacon seriously whatever he does is right i was only wonderin that was all said sam human wisdom is prone to err said the old man indulging in a scrap of proverbial philosophy what does that mean thought sam carelessly hitting the deacons foot with his descending hoe unfortunately the deacon had corns on that foot and the blow cost him a sharp twinge you careless blockhead he shrieked raising the injured foot from the ground while a spasm of anguish contracted his features did you take my foot for a potatohill did i hurt you asked sam innocently you hurt me like thunder gasped the deacon using in his excitement words which in calmer moments he would have avoided i didnt think it was your foot said sam i hope youll be more careful next time you most killed me i will said sam i wonder if it isnt time for dinner he began to think presently but under the circumstances thought it best not to refer to the matter but at last the welcome sound of the dinnerbell was heard as it was vigorously rung at the back door by mrs hopkins thats for dinner samuel said the deacon we will go to the house all right said sam with alacrity throwing down the hoe in the furrow pick up that hoe and carry it with you said the deacon then we wont work here any more today said sam brightening up yes we will but its no way to leave the hoe in the fields some cat might come along and steal it he added with unwonted sarcasm sam laughed as he thought of the idea of a cat stealing a hoe and the deacon smiled at his own joke dinner was on the table it was the fashion there to put all on at once and sam to his great satisfaction saw on one side a pie like that which had tempted him the night before the deacon saw his look and it suggested a fitting punishment but the time was not yet sam did ample justice to the first course of meat and potatoes when that was despatched mrs hopkins began to cut the pie the deacon cleared his throat samuel is to have no pie martha he said his wife thought it was for his misdeeds of the night before and so did sam i couldnt help walkin in my sleep he said with a blank look of disappointment it aint that said the deacon what is it then asked his wife samuel ran away from his work this mornin and was gone nigh on to two hours said her husband you are quite right deacon hopkins said his wife emphatically he dont deserve any dinner at all cant i have some pie asked sam who could not bear to lose so tempting a portion of the repast no samuel what i say i mean he that will not work shall not eat i worked hard enough afterwards muttered sam after i came back yes i know that you worked well part of the time so i gave you part of your dinner next time let the cats alone can i have some more meat then asked sam yees said the deacon hesitating you need strength to work this afternoon i spose i get that catechism this afternoon instead of goin to work suggested sam that will do after supper samuel all things in their place the afternoon is for work the evening for readin and study and improvin the mind sam reflected that the deacon was a very obstinate man and decided that his arrangements were very foolish what was the use of living if youd got to work all the time a good many people older than sam are of the same opinion and it is not wholly without reason but then it should be borne in mind that sam was opposed to all work he believed in enjoying himself and the work might take care of itself but how could it be avoided as sam was reflecting a way opened itself he placed his hand on his stomach and began to roll his eyes groaning meanwhile whats the matter asked mrs hopkins i feel sick said sam screwing up his face into strange contortions its very sudden said mrs hopkins suspiciously so tis said sam im afraid im going to be very sick can i lay down what do you think it is martha asked the deacon looking disturbed i know what it is said his wife calmly ive treated such attacks before yes you may lay down in your room and ill bring you some tea as soon as i can make it all right said sam elated at the success of his little trick it was very much pleasanter to lie down than to hoe potatoes on a hot day how easy i took in the old woman he thought it was not long before he changed his mind as we shall see in the next chapter chapter vii sam meets his match sam went upstairs with alacrity and lay down on the bed not that he was particularly tired but because he found it more agreeable to lie down than to work in the field i wish i had something to read he thought some nice dime novel like the demon of the danube that was splendid i like it a good deal better than dickens its more excitin but there was no library in sams room and it was very doubtful whether there were any dime novels in the house the deacon belonged to the old school of moralists and looked with suspicion upon all works of fiction with a very few exceptions such as pilgrims progress and robinson crusoe which however he supposed to be true stories soon sam heard the step of mrs hopkins on the stairs he immediately began to twist his features in such a way as to express pain mrs hopkins entered the room with a cup of hot liquid in her hand how do you feel she asked i feel bad said sam are you in pain yes ive got a good deal of pain whereabouts sam placed his hand on his stomach and looked sad yes i know exactly what is the matter with you said the deacons wife then you know a good deal thought sam for i dont know of anything at all myself this was what he thought but he said do you oh yes ive had a good deal of experience i know what is good for you sam looked curiously at the cup what is it he asked its hot tea its very healin sam supposed it to be ordinary tea and he had no objection to take it but when he put it to his lips there was something about the odor that did not please him it doesnt smell good he said looking up in the face of mrs hopkins medicine generally doesnt she said quietly i thought it was tea said sam so it is it is wormwoodtea i dont think i shall like it hesitated sam no matter if you dont it will do you good said mrs hopkins sam tasted it and his face assumed an expression of disgust i cant drink it he said you must said mrs hopkins firmly i guess ill get well without said our hero feeling that he was in a scrape no you wont youre quite unwell i can see it by your face can you said sam beginning to be alarmed about his health you must take this tea said the lady firmly id rather not thats neither here nor there the deacon needs you well so you can go to work and this will cure you as quick as anything suppose it doesnt said sam then i shall bring you up some castoroil in two hours castoroil this was even worse than wormwoodtea and sams heart sank within him the old womans too much for me he thought with a sigh come take the tea said mrs hopkins i cant wait here all day thus adjured sam made a virtue of necessity and shutting his eyes gulped down the wormwood he shuddered slightly when it was all done and his face was a study well done said mrs hopkins its sure to do you good i think id have got well without said sam im afraid it wont agree with me if it dont said mrs hopkins cheerfully ill try some castoroil i guess i wont need it said sam hastily it was awful said sam to himself as his nurse left him alone id rather hoe potatoes than take it again i never see such a terrible old woman she would make me do it when i wasnt no more sick than she is mrs hopkins smiled to herself as she went downstairs served him right she said to herself ill larn him to be sick guess he wont try it again very soon two hours later mrs hopkins presented herself at sams door he had been looking out of the window but he bundled into bed as soon as he heard her appearances must be kept up how do you feel now sam asked mrs hopkins a good deal better said sam surveying in alarm a cup of some awful decoction in her hand do you feel ready to go to work again almost said sam hesitating the wormwoodtea did you good it seems but youre not quite well yet ill soon be well said sam hastily i mean you shall be said his visitor ive brought you some more medicine is it tea no castoroil i dont need it said sam getting up quickly im well if you are not well enough to go to work you must take some oil yes i am said sam ill go right out into the field i dont want you to go unless you are quite recovered im sure the oil will bring you round im all right now said sam hastily very well if you think so you can go to work rather ruefully sam made his way to the potatofield with his hoe on his shoulder tea and castoroil are worse than work he thought the old womans got the best of me after all i wonder whether she knew i was makin believe on this point sam could not make up his mind she certainly seemed in earnest and never expressed a doubt about his being really sick but all the same she made sickness very disagreeable to him and he felt that in future he should not pretend sickness when she was at home it made him almost sick to think of the bitter tea he had already drunk and the oil would have been even worse the deacon looked up as he caught sight of sam have you got well he asked innocently for he had not been as clearsighted as his wife in regard to the character of sams malady yes said sam im a good deal better but i dont feel quite so strong as i did mebbe it would be well for you to fast a little said the deacon in all sincerity for fasting was one of his specifics in case of sickness no i dont think it would said sam quickly ill feel better by suppertime i hope you will said the deacon i wish i had a piece of pie or somethin to take the awful taste out of my mouth thought sam i can taste that wormwood jist as plain i wonder why such things are allowed to grow for the rest of the afternoon sam worked unusually well he was under the the deacons eye and unable to get away though he tried at least once after they had been at work for about an hour sam said suddenly dont you feel thirsty deacon hopkins what makes you ask said the deacon because id jist as lieves go to the house and get some water said sam with a very obliging air youre very considerate samuel but i dont think its healthy to drink between meals supposin youre thirsty suggested sam disappointed its only fancy you dont need drink railly you only think you do said the deacon and he made some further remarks on the subject to which sam listened discontentedly he began to think his situation a very hard one its work work all the time he said to himself whats the good of workin yourself to death when im a man ill work only when i want to sam did not consider that there might be some difficulty in earning a living unless he were willing to work for it the present discomfort was all he thought of at last much to sams joy the deacon gave the signal to return to the house if you hadnt been sick wed have got through more he said but tomorrow we must make up for lost time i hope itll rain tomorrow thought sam we cant work in the rain at supper the wormwood seemed to give him additional appetite im afraid youll make yourself sick again samuel said the deacon there aint no danger said sam looking alarmed at the suggestion i feel all right now the wormwood did you good said mrs hopkins drily i wonder if she means anything thought sam chapter viii sams temptation a month passed a month which it is safe to say was neither satisfactory to sam nor his employer the deacon discovered that the boy needed constant watching when he was left to himself he was sure to shirk his work and indulge his natural love of living at ease his appetite showed no signs of decrease and the deacon was led to remark that samuel had the stiddyest appetite of any boy he ever knew he never seemed to know when he had eaten enough as for mrs hopkins sam failed to produce a favorable impression upon her he was by no means her ideal of a boy though it must be added that this ideal was so high that few living boys could expect to attain it he must have an old head on young shoulders and in fact be an angel in all respects except the wings on these mrs hopkins probably would not insist being only a boy and considerably lazier and more mischievous than the average there was not much prospect of sams satisfying her requirements youd better send him to the poorhouse deacon she said more than once hes the most shifless boy i ever see and its awful the amount he eats i guess ill try him a leetle longer said the deacon he aint had no sort of bringin up you know so at the end of four weeks sam still continued a member of the deacons household as for sam things were not wholly satisfactory to him in spite of all his adroit evasions of duty he found himself obliged to work more than he found agreeable he didnt see the fun of trudging after the deacon up and down the fields in the warm summer days even his meals did not yield unmingled satisfaction as he had learned from experience that mrs hopkins did not approve of giving him a second slice of pie and in other cases interfered to check the complete gratification of his appetite alleging that it wasnt good for boys to eat too much sam took a different view of the matter and felt that if he was willing to take the consequences he ought to be allowed to eat as much as he pleased he was not troubled with the catechism any more the deacon found him so stolid and unteachable that he was forced to give up in despair and sam became master of his own time in the evening he usually strayed into the village where he found company at the village store here it was that he met a youth who was destined to exercise an important influence upon his career this was ben barker who had for a few months filled a position in a small retail store in new york city coming home he found himself a great man country boys have generally a great curiosity about life in the great cities and are eager to interview any one who can give them authentic details concerning it for this reason ben found himself much sought after by the village boys and gave dazzling descriptions of life in the metropolis about which he professed to be fully informed among his interested listeners was sam whose travels had been limited by a very narrow circle but who like the majority of boys was possessed by a strong desire to see the world i suppose there as many as a thousand houses in new york he said to ben a thousand repeated ben in derision theres a million honest yes they reach for miles and miles theres about twenty thousand streets it must be awfully big id like to go there oh you said ben contemptuously it wouldnt do for you to go there why not you couldnt get along nohow id like to know why not said sam rather nettled at this depreciation oh youre a country greenhorn youd get taken in right and left i dont believe i would said sam i aint as green as you think youd better stay with the deacon and hoe potatoes said ben disparagingly it takes a smart fellow to succeed in new york is that the reason you had to come home retorted sam im going back pretty soon said ben i shant stay long in such a onehorse place as this is it far to new york asked sam thoughtfully over a hundred miles does it cost much to go there three dollars by the cars that isnt so very much no but youve got to pay your expenses when you get there i could work what could you do you might perhaps black boots in the city hall park what pay do boys get for doing that asked sam seriously sometimes five cents sometimes ten id like it better than farmin it might do for you said ben turning up his nose what were you doing when you were in new york ben i was chief salesman in a dry goods store said ben with an air of importance was it a good place of course it was or i wouldnt have stayed there what made you leave it i had so much care and responsibility that the doctor told me i must have rest when the boss was away i run the store all alone there was no one to contradict bens confident assertions and though some doubt was entertained by his listener none was expressed considering bens large claims it was surprising that his services were not sought by leading new york firms but then merit is not always appreciated at once that was bens way of accounting for it sam was never tired of asking ben fresh questions about new york his imagination had been inflamed by the glowing descriptions of the latter and he was anxious to pass through a similar experience in fact he was slowly making up his mind to leave the deacon and set out for the brilliant paradise which so dazzled his youthful fancy there was one drawback however and that a serious one the lack of funds though the deacon supplied him with board and would doubtless keep him in wearing apparel there was no hint or intimation of any further compensation for his services and sams whole available money capital at this moment amounted to only three cents now three cents would purchase three sticks of candy and sam intended to appropriate them in this way but they formed a slender fund for travelling expenses and the worst of it was that sam knew of no possible way of increasing them if his journey depended upon that it would be indefinitely postponed but circumstances favored his bold design as we shall see one evening as sam was returning from the store a man from a neighboring town who was driving by reined up his horse and said you live with deacon hopkins dont you yes sir are you going home now yes sir then ill hand you a note for him will you think to give it to him yes sir i would stop myself but i havent time this evening all right ill give it to him take good care of it for theres money in it said the man as he passed it to the boy money in it this attracted sams attention and excited his curiosity i wonder how much there is in it he thought to himself i wish it was mine i could go to new york tomorrow if i only had it with this thought prominent in his mind sam entered the house mrs hopkins was at the table knitting but the deacon was not to be seen where is the deacon asked sam hes gone to bed said mrs hopkins did you want to see him no said sam slowly its time you were abed too sam said the lady youre out too late as i was tellin the deacon tonight boys like you ought to be abed at eight oclock instead of settin up half the night i guess ill go to bed now said sam taking a lamp from the table youd better and mind you get up early in the mornin sam did not answer for he was busy thinking he went upstairs fastened his door inside and taking out the letter surveyed the outside critically the envelope was not very securely fastened and came open sam could not resist the temptation presented and drew out the inclosure his face flushed with excitement as he spread out two fivedollar bills on the table before him ten dollars ejaculated sam what a lot of money if it was only mine id have enough to go to new york chapter ix sam takes french leave if sam had been brought up to entertain strict ideas on the subject of taking the property of others and appropriating it to his own use the temporary possession of the deacons money would not have exposed him to temptation but his conscience had never been awakened to the iniquity of theft so when it occurred to him that he had in his possession money enough to gratify his secret desire and carry him to new york there to enter upon a brilliant career it did not occur to him that it would be morally wrong to do so he did realize the danger of detection however and balanced in his mind whether the risk was worth incurring he decided that it was the deacon dont know ive got the money he reflected he wont find out for a good while when he does i shall be in new york where he wont think of going to find me this was the way sam reasoned and from his point of view the scheme looked very plausible sam had a shrewd idea that his services were not sufficiently valuable to the deacon to induce him to make any extraordinary efforts for his capture so on the whole he made up his mind to run away shall i go now or wait till mornin thought sam he looked out of his window there was no moon and the night was therefore dark it would not be very agreeable to roam about in the darkness besides he was liable to lose his way again he felt sleepy and the bed looked very inviting ill wait till mornin thought sam ill start about four and go over to wendell and take the train for new york ill be awful hungry when i get there i wish i could wait till after breakfast but it wont do sam was not usually awake at four indeed he generally depended on being waked up by the deacon knocking on his door but when boys or men have some pleasure in view it is apt to act upon the mind even when wrapped in slumber and produce wakefulness so sam woke up about quarter of four his plan flashed upon him and he jumped out of bed he dressed quickly and taking his shoes in his hand so that he might make no noise he crept downstairs and unlocked the front door and then after shutting it behind him sat down on the front doorstone and put on his shoes i guess they didnt hear me he said to himself now ill be going the sun had not risen but it was light with the gray light which precedes dawn there was every promise of a fine day and this helped to raise sams spirits whatll the deacon say when he comes to wake me up thought our hero though i am almost ashamed to give sam such a name for i am afraid he is acting in a manner very unlike the wellbehaved heroes of most juvenile stories my own among the number however since i have chosen to write about a young outlaw i must describe him as he is and warn my boy readers that i by no means recommend them to pattern after him before accompanying sam on his travels let us see how the deacon was affected by his flight at five oclock he went up to sams door and knocked there was no answer the deacon knocked louder still there was no answer how sound the boy sleeps muttered the old man and he applied his knuckles vigorously to the door still without effect thereupon he tried the door and found that it was unlocked he opened it and walked to the bed not doubting that he would see sam fast asleep but a surprise awaited him the bed was empty though it had evidently been occupied during the night bless my soul the boys up ejaculated the deacon a wild idea came to him that sam had voluntarily got up at this early hour and gone to work but he dismissed it at once as absurd he knew sam far too well for that why then had he got up perhaps he was unwell and could not sleep not dreaming of his running away this seemed to the deacon the most plausible way of accounting for sams disappearance but he decided to go down and communicate the news to his wife why were you gone so long deacon asked mrs hopkins couldnt you wake him up he wasnt there wasnt where in bed what do you mean i mean that sams got up already i couldnt find him couldnt find him no martha had the bed been slept in of course i spose he was sick and couldnt sleep so he went downstairs perhaps hes gone down to the pantry said mrs hopkins suspiciously ill go down and see she went downstairs followed by the deacon she instituted an examination but found sam guiltless of a fresh attempt upon the provision department she went to the front door and found it unlocked hes gone out she said so he has but i guess hell be back to breakfast said the deacon i dont said the lady why not because i think hes run away run away exclaimed the deacon why i never had a boy run away from me well you have now where would he go he aint no home he wouldnt go to the poorhouse of course not i never heard of anybody that had a comfortable home running away to the poorhouse but why should he run away argued the deacon boys often run away said his wife sententiously he had no cause yes he had you made him work and hes lazy and dont like work im not surprised at all i spose id better go after him said the deacon dont you stir a step to go deacon he aint worth going after im glad weve got rid of him well he didnt do much work admitted the deacon while he ate enough for two boys good riddance to bad rubbish i say i dont know how hes goin to get along he didnt have no money i dont care how he gets along as long as he dont come back theres plenty of better boys you can get sam would not have felt flattered if he had heard this final verdict upon his merits it must be confessed however that it was well deserved a few days afterwards the deacon obtained the services of another boy whom he found more satisfactory than the runaway and sam was no longer missed it was not till the tenth day that he learned of the theft while riding on that day he met mr comstock who had confided to sam the moneyletter goodmorning deacon hopkins said he stopping his horse goodmorning said the deacon i suppose your boy handed you a letter from me i havent received any letter said the deacon surprised it was early last week that i met a boy who said he lived with you as i was in a hurry i gave him a letter containing ten dollars which i asked him to give to you what day was it asked the deacon eagerly monday do you mean to say he didnt give it to you no he ran away the next morning and i havent seen him since then he ran away with the money the young thief i told him there was money in it bless my soul i didnt think sam was so bad ejaculated the deacon didnt you go after him no he wasnt very good to work and i thought id let him run ef id knowed about the money id have gone after him it isnt too late now ill ask my wife what id better do the deacon conferred with his wife who was greatly incensed against sam and would have advised pursuit but they had no clue to his present whereabouts hell come back some time deacon said she when he does have him took up but years passed and sam did not come back nor did the deacon set eyes on him for four years and then under the circumstances recorded in the first chapter chapter x sams adventures at the depot it was six miles to the station at wendell where sam proposed to take the cars for new york he had to travel on an empty stomach and naturally got ravenously hungry before he reached his destination about half a mile this side of the depot he passed a grocerystore and it occurred to him that he might get something to eat there entering he saw a young man in his shirtsleeves engaged in sweeping have you got anything good to eat asked sam this aint a hotel said the young man taking sam for a penniless adventurer i knew that before said sam but havent you got some crackers or something to stay a fellers stomach havent you had any breakfast asked the clerk curiously no dont they give you breakfast where you live not so early in the morning you see i had to take an early start cause im goin to attend my grandmothers funeral this of course was a story trumped up for the occasion weve got some raw potatoes said the clerk grinning ive had enough to do with potatoes said sam havent you got some crackers come to think of it we have how many will you have about a dozen while they were being put up in a paper bag the clerk inquired how far off does your grandmother live about twenty miles from here on the railroad answered sam who didnt care to mention that he was bound for new york warwick i suppose yes said sam at a venture how soon does the train start in about half an hour hold on though thats the new york train and dont stop at warwick i guess ill be goin said sam hurriedly wheres the depot half a mile straight ahead but you neednt hurry the train for warwick dont go till ten never mind i want to see the new york train start and sam hurried off eating crackers as he walked im glad the train starts so quick thought sam i dont want to wait round here long i might meet somebody that knows me he had no difficulty in finding the depot it was a plain building about twenty by thirty feet with a piazza on the side towards the track he entered and going up to the ticketoffice asked for a ticket to new york for yourself asked the stationmaster yes said sam how old are you twelve then youll have to pay for a whole ticket three dollars all right said sam promptly and he drew out a fivedollar bill receiving in return two dollars and a ticket do you live in new york sonny asked the stationmaster no im only goin to see my aunt answered sam with another impromptu falsehood i know something about new york in what street does your aunt live sam was posed for he did not know the name of even one street in the city he was going to i dont exactly remember he was forced to admit then how do you expect to find her if you dont know where she lives oh shell meet me at the depot said sam readily suppose she dont ill find her somehow but shes sure to meet me going to stay long in the city i hope so perhaps my auntll adopt me how soon will the train be along in about fifteen minutes here an old lady came up and asked for a ticket to new york three dollars maam three dollars cant you take less asked the old lady fumbling in her pocket for her purse no maam the price is fixed its a sight of money seems throwed away too jest for travellin you haint got anything to show for it i never was to york in my life please hurry maam there are others waiting massy sakes dont be so hasty theres the money and theres your ticket i wish i knowd somebody goin to new york im afeared to travel alone theres a boy going said the stationmaster pointing to sam are you goin to york asked the old lady peering over her spectacles at sam yes maam was you ever there afore no maam aint your folks afeared to have you go alone oh no they dont mind i wish you was older sos you could look after me sam was rather flattered by the idea of having a lady under his charge and said ill take care of you if you want me to will you thats a good boy whats your name sam barker answered our hero with some hesitation not feeling sure whether it was politic to mention his real name do you live in new york no maam but im goin to when will the cars git along in about ten minutes youll help me get in wont you ive got two bandboxes and i dont know how to manage yes maam ill help you im goin out on the platform but ill come in when the cars come along sam went out on the platform and watched eagerly for the approach of the cars up they came thundering along the track and sam rushed into the depot in excitement come along maam he said the cars are here the old lady was in a flutter of excitement also she seized one bandbox and sam the other and they hurried out on the platform they were just climbing up the steps when the conductor asked where are you going to york of course then this isnt the train it is going in the opposite direction lawful suz ejaculated the old lady in dismay what made you tell me wrong you bad boy and she glared at him reproachfully over her glasses how should i know said sam rather abashed i didnt know about no other train you come near makin me go wrong i cant help it it would be just as bad for me when does the train go to york somebody asked the old lady looking about her in a general way next train comes round in about five minutes sam helped the old lady back into the depot rather ashamed of the mistake he had made he saw that she had lost some of her confidence in him and it mortified him somewhat it was nearly ten minutes afterwards for the train was late before the right cars came up sam dashed into the depot again and seized a bandbox heres the cars come along he said i wont stir a step till i know if its the right cars said the old lady firmly then you may stay here said sam im goin dont leave your grandmother said a gentleman standing by she isnt my grandmother isnt this the train to new york yes sam seized the bandbox once more and this time the old lady followed him they got into the cars without difficulty and the old lady breathed a sigh of relief sam took a seat at the window just behind her and his heart bounded with exultation as he reflected that in a few hours he would be in the great city of which he had such vague and wonderful ideas the only drawback to his enjoyment was the loss of his usual morning meal the crackers helped to fill him up but they were a poor substitute for the warm breakfast to which he had been accustomed at the deacons still sam did not wish himself back indeed as he thought of the deacons bewilderment on discovering his disappearance he broke into an involuntary laugh what are you laffin at asked the old lady suspiciously sam answered i was thinkin how near we came to bein carried off to the wrong place that aint anything to laff at said the old lady grimly chapter xi first experiences in the city there are few boys who do not enjoy a trip on the railroad especially for the first time the five hours which sam spent on his journey gave him unqualified delight occasionally his attention was called off from the scenery by an exclamation from the old lady who at every jolt thought the cars were off the track sam liberally patronized the apple and peanut merchant who about once an hour walked through the cars the crackers which he had purchased at the grocery store had not spoiled his appetite but rather appeared to sharpen it the old lady apparently became hungry also for she called the apple vender to her what do you ask for them apples she inquired the largest are three cents apiece the smallest two cents thats an awful price they aint worth half that we cant sell em for less and make any profit ill give you a cent for that one she continued pointing to the largest in the basket that why thats a threecenter cant take it nohow ill give you three cents for them two no maam you may have em for five cents then i wont buy em my darter will give me plenty for nothin she may but i cant so the old lady heroically put away the temptation and refused to purchase all things must have an end and sams journey was at length over the cars entered the great depot sam hurried out of the cars never giving a thought to the old lady who expected his help in carrying out her bandboxes he was eager to make his first acquaintance with the streets of new york there was a crowd of hackmen in waiting all of whom appeared to sam to be seeing which could talk fastest have a carriage sir take you to any hotel one of them got hold of sam by the arms and attempted to lead him to his carriage hold on a minute mister said sam drawing back where are you goin to take me anywhere you say astor house st nicholas or any other is it far about five miles said the hackman glibly how much are you goin to charge only three dollars three dollars repeated sam in amazement he had less than seven dollars now and though he was not particularly provident he knew that it would never do to spend almost half his slender stock of money for cabhire never mind said he ill walk you cant its too far said the hackman eager for a fare ill try so sam walked out of the depot and walked away he didnt know exactly where to go and thought he would follow a man with a carpetbag who appeared to know his way this man unconsciously guided him to broadway sam realized from the stately character of the buildings that he was in an important street and cutting loose from his guide walked down towards the city hall park it seemed to him like a dream these beautiful warehouses showy stores and the moving throng which never seemed to grow less surprised him also though he knew in advance that new york must be very different from the little country town which until now had been his home he was not prepared for so great a difference and wandered on his mouth and eyes wide open at last he reached the city hall park and catching sight of a bench on which one or two persons were already sitting sam feeling tired with his walk entered the park and sat down too black yer boots inquired a dirtyfaced boy with a box slung over his shoulders sam looked at his shoes begrimed with a long country walk and hesitated what do you ask he said its worth a quarter to black them shoes said the boy swinging them critically then i cant afford it twenty cents no said sam ive got to earn my own living and i cant afford it is blackin boots a good business some days it is but if it comes rainy it isnt ill give you a bully shine for ten cents will you show me afterwards where i can get some dinner cheap asked sam who was still hungry yes said the bootblack i know a tiptop place is it far off right round in chatham street only a minutes walk all right go ahead ill give you ten cents sam felt that he was paying his money not only for the actual service done but for valuable information besides on the whole though he knew he must be economical it seemed to him a paying investment did you come from the country asked the young knight of the blackingbrush while he was vigorously brushing the first shoe yes said sam i only got here just now thats what i thought why because you look like a greenhorn do you mean to insult me asked sam nettled no said the other only if youve never been here before of course youre green i wont be long said sam hastily course you wont specially if you have me to show you round have you lived long in new york inquired sam i was born here said the boy have you been long blackin boots ever since i was kneehigh to a doorstep then you make a living at it i dont starve what made you leave the country i got tired of working on a farm did you have enough to eat yes and a good bed to sleep in yes then youd ought to have stayed there said the bootblack i think i shall like the city better said sam theres a good deal more goin on id like to try the country you dont live at the west do you no lots of boys goes west maybe ill go there some time is it a good place thats what they say the boys gets good homes out there on farms then i dont want to go said sam im tired of farmin by this time the shoes were polished aint that a bully shine asked the bootblack surveying his work with satisfaction yes said sam you know how to do it course i do now wheres the stamps sam drew out ten cents and handed to the boy now show me where i can get some dinner all right come along and the boy slinging his box over his shoulder led the way to a small place on chatham street it was in a basement and did not look overneat but sam was too hungry to be particular and the odor of the cooking was very grateful to him i guess ill get a plate o meat too said the bootblack i aint had anything since breakfast they sat down side by side at a table and sam looked over the bill of fare he finally ordered a plate of roast beef for ten cents and his companion followed his example the plates were brought accompanied by a triangular wedge of bread and a small amount of mashed potato it was not a feast for an epicure but both sam and his companion appeared to enjoy it sam was still hungry they didnt bring much he said i guess ill have another plate i aint got stamps enough said his companion if you want another plate ill pay for it said sam with a sudden impulse of generosity will you youre a brick said the bootblack heartily then i dont mind ill have another do they have any pie asked sam course they do then ill have a piece afterwards he did not offer to treat his companion to pie for he realized that his stock of money was not inexhaustible this did not appear to be expected however and the two parted on very good terms when the dinner was over chapter xii clarence brown sam continued to walk about in the neighborhood of the city hall park first in one direction then in another but at last he became fatigued it had been an unusually exciting day and he had taken more exercise than usual though he had not worked for his morning walk added to his rambles about the city streets probably amounted to not less than twelve miles then too sam began to realize what older and more extensive travellers know well that nothing is more wearisome than sightseeing so the problem forced itself upon his attention where was he to sleep the bed he slept in the night before was more than a hundred miles away it struck sam as strange for we must remember how inexperienced he was that he must pay for the use of a bed how much he had no idea but felt that it was time to make some inquiries illustration of sam speaking with the roomclerk he went into a hotel on the european system and asked a man who was standing at the cigar stand what do you charge for sleeping here ask of that man at the desk said the cigarvender sam followed directions and approaching the roomclerk preferred the same inquiry one dollar was the answer one dollar just for sleeping inquired sam in surprise for in his native village he knew that the schoolteacher got boarded for three dollars a week board and lodging complete for seven days those are our terms said the clerk i dont care about a nice room said sam hoping to secure a reduction we charge more for our nice rooms said the clerk aint there any cheaper hotels asked our hero rather dismayed at his sudden discovery of the great cost of living in new york i suppose so said the clerk carelessly but he did not volunteer any information as to their whereabouts sam walked slowly out of the hotel quite uncertain where to go or what to do he had money enough to pay for a nights lodging even at this high price but he judged wisely that he could not afford to spend so large a part of his small stock of money i wonder where the boys sleep that black boots he thought they cant pay a dollar a night for sleeping he looked around for the boy who had guided him to a restaurant but could not find him it was now eight oclock and he begun to think he should have to go back to the hotel after all when a shabbylooking man with watery eyes and a red nose accosted him are you a stranger in the city my young friend he asked yes said sam rather relieved at the opportunity of speaking to somebody so i thought where are you boarding nowhere said sam where do you sleep tonight i dont know said sam rather helplessly why dont you go to a hotel they charge too much said sam havent you got money enough to pay for a lodging at a hotel asked the stranger with rather less interest in his manner oh yes said sam a good deal more than that but then i want to make my money last till i can earn something to be sure to be sure answered the stranger his interest returning you are quite right my dear friend i am glad to see that you are so sensible of course you ought not to go to a hotel they charge too high altogether but i must sleep somewhere said sam anxiously i only got to new york this morning and i dont know where to go of course of course i thought you might be in trouble seeing you were a stranger its lucky you met me can you tell me of any place to spend the night asked sam encouraged by the strangers manner yes ill let you stay with me and it shant cost you a cent thank you said sam congratulating himself on his good luck in meeting so benevolent a man he could not help admitting to himself that the philanthropist looked shabby even seedy he was not the sort of man from whom he would have expected such kindness but that made no difference the offer was evidently a desirable one and sam accepted it without a moments hesitation i remember when i came to the city myself explained the stranger i was worse off than you for i had no money at all a kind man gave me a nights lodging just as i offer one to you and i determined that i would do the same by others when i had a chance you are very kind said sam perhaps you wont say so when you see my room said the other i am not a rich man glancing at the mans attire sam found no difficulty in believing him our hero though not very observing was not prepossessed in favor of the new york tailors by what he saw for the strangers coat was very long while his pants were very short and his vest was considerably too large for him instead of a collar and cravat he wore a ragged silk handkerchief tied round his throat his hat was crumpled and greasy and the best that could be said of it was that it corresponded with the rest of his dress i dont live in a very nice place said the stranger but perhaps you can put up with it for one night oh i dont mind said sam hastily i aint used to anything very nice then its all right said the stranger such as it is you are welcome now i suppose you are tired yes i am said sam then ill take you to my room at once well go up centre street sam cheerfully followed his conductor he felt like a stormtossed mariner who has just found port what is your name asked his guide sam barker mine is clarence brown is it asked sam he could not help thinking the name too fine for a man of such shabby appearance and yet it would be hard when names are so cheap if all the best ones should be bestowed on the wealthy its a good name isnt it asked the stranger tiptop i belong to a good family though you wouldnt think it to look at me now continued his guide my father was a wealthy merchant was he asked sam curiously yes we lived in a splendid mansion and kept plenty of servants i was sent to an expensive school and i did not dream of coming to this mr brown wiped his eyes with his coatsleeve as he thus revived the memories of his early opulence did your father lose his money asked sam getting interested he did indeed said the stranger with emotion it was in the panic of did you ever hear of it i guess not said sam who was not very conversant with the financial history of the country my father became a bankrupt and soon after died of grief continued the stranger i was called back from boardingschool and thrown upon the cold mercies of the world that was hard on you said sam it was indeed my young friend i perceive that you have a sympathetic heart you can feel for the woes of others yes said sam concluding that such an answer was expected i am glad i befriended you have you also seen better days well i dont know said sam its been pleasant enough today i dont mean that i mean were you ever rich not that i can remember said sam then you dont know what it is to be reduced from affluence to poverty it is a bitter experience i should think so said sam who felt a little tired of clarence browns reminiscences and wondered how soon they would reach that gentlemans house meanwhile they had gone up centre street and turned into leonard street it was not an attractive locality nor were the odors that reached sams nose very savory this is where i live said mr brown pausing before a large and dilapidatedlooking tenement house of discolored brick you dont live here alone do you inquired sam who was not used to crowded tenement houses oh no i only occupy an humble room upstairs follow me and ill lead you to it the staircase was dirty and in keeping with the external appearance of the house the wall paper was torn off in places and contrasted very unfavorably with the neat house of deacon hopkins sam noticed this but he was tired and sleepy and was not disposed to be overcritical as he followed mr brown in silence to the fourth floor chapter xiii robbed in his sleep arrived at his destination mr brown opened a door and bade sam enter it was rather dark and it was not until his host lighted a candle that sam could obtain an idea of the appearance of the room the ceiling was low and the furniture scanty a couple of chairs a small table of which the paint was worn off in spots and a bed in the corner were the complete outfit of mr browns home he set the candle on the table and remarked apologetically i dont live in much style as you see the fact is i am at present in straitened circumstances when my uncle dies i shall inherit a fortune then when you come to see me i will entertain you handsomely is your uncle rich asked sam i should say he was hes a millionnaire why dont he do something for you now mr clarence brown shrugged his shoulders hes a very peculiar man wants to keep every cent as long as he lives when hes dead its got to go to his heirs thats why he lives in a palatial mansion on madison avenue while i his nephew occupy a shabby apartment like this sam looked about him and mentally admitted the justice of the term it was a shabby apartment without question still he was to lodge there gratis and it was not for him to complain by the way said mr brown casually after exploring his pockets apparently without success you havent got a quarter have you yes i guess so all right ill borrow it till tomorrow if you dont mind certainly said sam handing over the sum desired ill go out and get some whiskey my system requires it you wont mind being left alone for five minutes oh no very good i wont stay long mr brown went out and our hero sat down on the bed to wait for him so this is my first night in the city he thought i expected they had better houses this room isnt half so nice as i had at the deacons but then i havent got to hoe potatoes i guess ill like it when i get used to it there isnt anybody to order me round here presently mr brown came back he had a bottle partially full of whiskey with him sorry to keep you waiting he said were you lonely oh no ive got a couple of glasses here somewhere oh here they are now well see how it tastes not much for me said sam i dont think ill like it itll be good for your stomach however i wont give you much he poured out a little in one tumbler for sam and a considerably larger amount for himself your health he said nodding thank you said sam sam tasted the whiskey but the taste did not please him he set down the glass but his host drained his at a draught dont you like it asked brown not very much dont you care to drink it i guess not its a pity it should be wasted to prevent this mr brown emptied sams glass also now if you are not sleepy we might have a game of cards suggested brown i think id rather go to bed said sam yawning all right go to bed any time i dare say you are tired do you go to sleep easily in a jiffy then you wont mind my absence ive got to make a call on a sick friend but i shant be out late just make yourself at home go to sleep and youll see me in the morning thank you sir dont bolt the door as i dont want to wake you up when i come in all right again mr brown went out and sam undressed and got into bed it was not very comfortable and the solitary sheet looked as if it had not been changed for three months or more however sam was not fastidious and he was sleepy so he closed his eyes and was soon in the land of dreams it was about two hours afterward that clarence brown entered the room he walked on tiptoe to the bed and looked at sam hes fast asleep he said to himself did he undress oh yes here are his clothes ill take the liberty of examining his pockets to see whether my trouble is likely to be rewarded brown explored one pocket after the other he found no pocketbook for sam did not possess any in fact he had never felt the need of one until he appropriated the deacons money the balance of this was tucked away in his vestpocket six dollars and ten cents said brown after counting it it isnt much of a haul thats a fact i thought he had twice as much at the least still he added philosophically its better than nothing i shall find a use for it without doubt he tucked the money away in his own pocket and sat on the edge of the bedstead in meditation i may as well go to bed he reflected he wont find out his loss in the night and in the morning i can be off before he is up even if i oversleep myself i can brazen it out hes only a green country boy probably he wont suspect me and if he does he can prove nothing he did not undress but lay down on the bed dressed as he was he too was soon asleep and sam unconscious of his loss slept on so the money was doubly stolen and the first thief suffered at the hands of a more experienced thief the sun had been up nearly three hours the next morning before clarence brown awoke as he opened his eyes his glance fell on sam still asleep and the events of the evening previous came to his mind i must be up and out of this he thought before the young greenhorn wakes up being already dressed with the exception of his coat he had little to do beyond rising he crept out of the room on tiptoe and making his way to a restaurant at a safe distance sat down and ordered a good breakfast at sams expense meanwhile sam slept on for half an hour more finally he opened his eyes and oblivious of his changed circumstances was surprised that he had not been called earlier but a single glance about the shabby room recalled to his memory that he was now beyond the deacons jurisdiction i am in new york he reflected with a thrill of joy but where is mr brown he looked in vain for his companion but no suspicion was excited in his mind he didnt want to wake me up he thought i suppose he has gone to his business he stretched himself and lay a little longer it was a pleasant thought that there was no stern taskmaster to force him up he might lie as long as he wanted to till noon if he chose perhaps he might have chosen but the claims of a healthy appetite asserted themselves and sam sprang out of bed ill have a good breakfast he said to himself and then i must look around and see if i cant find something to do my money will soon be out it was natural that he should have felt for his money at that moment but he did not no suspicion of mr browns integrity had entered his mind you see sam was very unsophisticated at that time and though he had himself committed a theft he did not suspect the honesty of others i suppose i shall have to go without thanking mr brown as he dont seem to be here he reflected perhaps i shall see him somewhere about the streets ive saved a dollar anyway or at least seventyfive cents he added thinking of the quarter he had lent his hospitable entertainer the evening before perhaps hell let me sleep here again tonight itll be a help to me as long as i havent got anything to do yet still sam did not feel for his money and was happily unconscious of his loss he opened his door and found his way downstairs into the street without difficulty the halls and staircases looked even more dingy and shabby in the daytime than they had done in the evening it isnt a very nice place to live thought sam however i suppose mr brown will be rich when his uncle dies i wish he was rich now he might give me a place shine yer boots asked a small knight of the brush no said sam who had grown economical they dont need it he walked on for five minutes or more presently he came to an eatinghouse he knew it by the printed bills of fare which were placarded outside now ill have some breakfast he thought with satisfaction and he entered confidently chapter xiv bounced sam sat down at a table and took up the bill of fare a colored waiter stood by and awaited his orders bring me a plate of beefsteak a cup of coffee and some teabiscuit said sam with the air of a man of fortune all right sir said the waiter after all its pleasant living in new york thought sam as he leaned back in his chair and awaited in pleasant anticipation the fulfilment of his order its different from livin at the deacons here a feller can be independent as long as he has money sam should have added but like some business men he was not aware of his present insolvency ignorance is bliss sometimes and it is doubtful whether our hero would have eaten his breakfast with as good a relish when it came if he had known that he had not a cent in his pocket sam was soon served and he soon made way with the articles he had ordered you cant get a very liberal supply of beefsteak for fifteen cents which was what sam was charged for his meat he felt hungry still after he had eaten what was set before him so he took the bill of fare once more and pored over its wellfilled columns they must have a tremendous big kitchen to cook so many things he thought why there are as many as a hundred let me see heres buckwheat cakes ten cents i guess ill have some anything more sir asked the waiter approaching to clear away the dirty dishes buckwheat cakes and another cup of coffee ordered sam all right sir they treat me respectful here thought sam what would the deacon say to hear me called sir i like it folks have better manners in the city than in the country this was rather a hasty conclusion on the part of sam and it was not long before he had occasion enough to change his mind he ate the buckwheat cakes with a relish and felt tolerably satisfied anything more sir asked the waiter sam was about to say no when his eye rested on that portion of the bill devoted to pastry and he changed his mind bring me a piece of mincepie he said sam was sensible that he was ordering breakfast beyond his means but he vaguely resolved that he would content himself with a small dinner he really could not resist the temptation of the pie at last it was eaten and the waiter brought him a ticket bearing the price of his breakfast fifty cents now for the first time he felt in his vestpocket for his money he felt in vain still he did not suspect his loss i thought i put it in my vestpocket he said to himself i guess i made a mistake and put it in some other he felt in another pocket and still another till he had explored every pocket he possessed and still no money sam turned pale and his heart gave a sudden thump as the extent of his misfortune dawned upon him it was not alone that he was without money in a strange city but he had eaten rather a hearty breakfast which he was unable to pay for what would they think of him what would they do to him he saw it all now that specious stranger clarence brown had robbed him in his sleep that was why he had invited him to spend the night in his room without charge that was why he had got up so early and stolen out without his knowledge after he had purloined all his money sam was not particularly bashful but he certainly felt something like it as he walked up to the cashiers desk a man stood behind it rather stout and on the whole not benevolent in his looks there was no softness about his keen business face sam inferred with a sinking heart that he was not a man likely to sympathize with him in his misfortunes or seem to give credence to them sam stood at the counter waiting while the proprietor was making change for another customer he was considering what he could best say to propitiate his creditor now then said the man behind the counter a little impatiently for another had come up behind sam wheres your ticket here sir said sam laying it on the counter fifty cents pay quick and dont keep me waiting i am very sorry sir sam began faltering but but what exclaimed the proprietor with an ominous scowl i cant pay you now cant pay me now repeated the other angrily what do you mean ive lost my money said sam feeling more and more uncomfortable by this time the patience of the restaurantkeeper was quite gone what business had you to come in here and order an expensive breakfast when you had no money he demanded furiously i thought i had some money said sam fervently wishing himself back at the deacons for the first time since his arrival in the city how could you think you had some when you hadnt any i had some last night said sam eagerly but i slept in mr browns room and he must have robbed me in the night thats a likely story sneered the proprietor what do you think of it mr jones he asked turning to a customer whom he knew by name mr jones shrugged his shoulders too thin he replied briefly of course it is said the proprietor angrily this boys evidently a beat a what inquired sam who had not been in the city long enough to understand the meaning of the term a dead beat but you dont play any of your games on me young man ive cut my eyeteeth i have you dont swindle me out of a fiftycent breakfast quite so easily here john call a policeman oh dont call a policeman exclaimed sam terrorstricken its true every word ive told you im from the country i only got to the city yesterday and ive been robbed of all my money over six dollars i hope youll believe me i dont believe a word you say said the restaurantkeeper harshly you are trying to come it over me i dare say youve been round the streets half your life i think you are wrong mr chucks said another customer who was waiting to pay his bill hes got a country look about him he dont look like one of the regular street boys better let him go i wouldnt call a policeman i ought to grumbled the proprietor fancy his impudence in ordering a fiftycent breakfast when he hadnt a cent to pay his bill i wouldnt have come in if i had known said sam dont tell me said the man sharply for i dont believe it do you think i can afford to give you breakfast for nothing ill pay you as soon as i get some money said sam only dont send me to prison i wont give you in charge this time though i ought to but ill give you something to settle your breakfast here peter you waited on this young man didnt you yes sir he hasnt paid for his breakfast and pretends he hasnt got any money bounce him if sam was ignorant of the meaning of the word bounce he was soon enlightened the waiter seized him by the collar before he knew what was going to happen pushed him to the door and then lifting his foot by a welldirected kick landed him across the sidewalk into the street this proceeding was followed by derisive laughter from the other waiters who had gathered near the door and it was echoed by two street urchins outside who witnessed sams ignominious exit from the restaurant sam staggered from the force of the bouncing and felt disgraced and humiliated to think that the waiter who had been so respectful and attentive should have inflicted upon him such an indignity which he had no power to resent i wish i was back at the deacons he thought bitterly how do you feel asked one of the boys who had witnessed sams humiliation not sympathetically but in a tone of mockery none of your business retorted sam savagely he feels bad mickey said the other hes heard bad news and thats what made him in such a hurry here both the boys laughed and sam retorted angrily ill make you feel bad if you aint careful hear him talk mickey aint he smart ill make you both smart said sam beginning to roll up his sleeves for he was no coward and the boys were only about his own size he wants to bounce us like he was bounced himself said pat riley how did it feel johnny sam gave chase but his tormentors were better acquainted with the city than he and he did not succeed in catching them finally he gave it up and sitting down on a convenient doorstep gave himself up to melancholy reflections chapter xv any way to make a living boys who have a good home are apt to undervalue it they do not realize the comfort of having their daily wants provided for without any anxiety on their part they are apt to fancy that they would like to go out into the great world to seek their fortunes sometimes it may be necessary and expedient to leave the safe anchorage of home and brave the dangers of the unknown sea but no boy should do this without his parents consent nor then without making up his mind that he will need all his courage and all his resolution to obtain success sam found himself penniless in a great city and with no way open that he could think of to earn money even the business of the bootblack humble as it is required a small capital to buy a brush and box of blacking so too a newsboy must pay for his papers when he gets them unless he is well known so sam sitting on the doorstep felt that he was in a tight place where was he to get his dinner from he did not care to repeat his operation of the morning for it was not pleasant to be bounced i wonder if i couldnt get a chance in a store he thought that wouldnt need any money there seems to be a lot of stores in the city i guess there must be a place for me somewhere this thought encouraged sam he rose from his lowly seat and determined to look about for a place presently he came to a realestate office sam did not understand very well what kind of a business that was but on the window a piece of paper was pasted on which was written a boy wanted i guess ill go in thought sam maybe theyll take me there were three boys ahead of him but they were not very eligiblelooking specimens so they were dismissed with small ceremony and sam was beckoned to the desk i suppose you have come about the place said a man with black whiskers and a pen behind his ear yes answered sam how old are you twelve rather young still you are large of your age i am pretty strong said sam anxious to succeed in his application there isnt any work to be done that requires strength said the blackwhiskered man how is your education pretty good said sam with hesitation do you live in the city yes sir with your parents no sir they are dead that is an objection perhaps however you live with an aunt or uncle that will answer as well yes said sam determined to obviate this objection i live with my uncle where does he live in new york answered sam dont you understand me i mean to ask the street and number sam was posed he could not at the moment think of the name of any street except broadway but it would not do to hesitate so he said promptly he lives at no broadway what is his business inquired the blackwhiskered man he keeps a store answered sam feeling that he was getting deeper and deeper into the mire what sort of a store a grocery store what at broadway demanded the other in surprise i didnt know there was a grocery store in that neighborhood oh murder thought sam im found out he made no answer because he could not think of any why dont your father give you a place in his own store asked the realestate agent with some suspicion in his tone hes got all the help he wants said sam quickly here another boy entered the office a boy neatly dressed and intelligent in appearance sit down a moment said the agent to sam while i speak with this other lad sam took a seat and listened to the conversation with the other boy the conclusion of the matter was that the other boy was engaged and sam was obliged to go out to offer his services in some other quarter what a lot of lies i had to tell he reflected whats the use of their asking so many questions i dont see ill have to try somewhere else as sam was sauntering along he was accosted by a tall man evidently from the country boy can you direct me to the tribune office yes sir said sam but its some ways from here itll be worth ten cents to lead you there the gentleman hesitated well he said after a pause ill give it to you will you give it to me now asked sam i will pay you when you have done your work the reason i asked was because i showed a man the other day and then he wouldnt pay me that was mean said the stranger i hope you dont think i would serve you so oh no sir youre a gentleman said sam you wouldnt cheat a poor boy that hasnt had any breakfast this mornin dear me you dont say so ejaculated the compassionate stranger shocked at sams fiction here take this twentyfive cents do you often have to go without your breakfast often sir said sam unblushingly its hard times for poor boys like me theres another quarter said the stranger his compassion still more deeply moved sam did feel some compunction now for he was about to make a very poor return for the kindness of his new acquaintance the fact was he had not the slightest idea where the tribune office was and he had therefore undertaken what he was unable to perform but he had gone too far to recede besides he did not feel prepared to give up the money which he had obtained through false pretences so counterfeiting a confidence which he did not feel he led the way up centre street saying this way sir ill lead you right to the office i never was at the office said the stranger though ive been a subscriber to the weekly tribune for ten years thats a good while said sam it is indeed my boy i live in illinois more than a thousand miles from this city indeed i have never been in new york before havent you no now you i suppose my young friend know your way all about the city of course i do said sam in an offhand manner if i had more time i would get you to guide me round the city said the stranger wouldnt i lead you a wildgoose chase old gentleman thought sam youd be pretty well taken in i guess i am obliged to go away tonight continued the old gentleman but i thought i would renew my subscription to the tribune before i went all right sir its a nice paper said sam who had never read a line in the tribune so i think are we almost at the office almost said sam if you dont mind waiting ill run over and speak to my cousin a minute there was a bootblack on the opposite side of the street it struck sam who did not like to deceive so generous a patron that he could obtain the information he needed of this boy can you tell me where the tribune office is he asked hurriedly the bootblack had no more scruples about lying than sam and answered glibly pointing to the tombs prison a little farther on do you see that big stone buildin yes said sam thats it thank you said sam feeling relieved and never doubting the correctness of this statement he returned to the stranger and said cheerfully were almost there is that boy your cousin asked his acquaintance yes said sam he blacks boots for a living yes sir does he do well at it pretty well did you ever black boots no sir answered sam telling the truth by way of variety thats the tribune office said sam a moment later pointing to the gloomylooking prison is it echoed the stranger in surprise really its a very massive structure yes said sam mistaking the word employed its very massy it doesnt look much like a newspaper office for the first time sam began to suspect that he had been deceived and he naturally felt in a hurry to get away you go right in he said confidently and theyll attend to you inside now ill go and get some breakfast to be sure you must be hungry the stranger walked up the massive steps and sam hurried away i wonder what place that is anyhow he said to himself now ive got money enough for dinner for a country boy sam was getting along fast chapter xvi sam meets brown and is unhappy never doubting sams assurance the stranger entered the gloomy building the lower part of which is divided into courtrooms out of one of these a man came to whom he addressed this question where is the countingroom the countingroom repeated the man staring there isnt any here that i know of i want to subscribe for the weekly edition explained the man from illinois it strikes me youre a weakly edition of a man yourself thought the other he must be a lunatic was the next thought i may as well humor him go in at that door he said the stranger entered as directed and at once recognized it as a courtroom it is very singular that there should be a courtroom in the tribune office he thought he took a seat and whispered to a man at his side can you tell me where the tribune office is printinghouse square was the whispered reply wheres that not much over a quarter of a mile from here the boy deceived me thought the stranger indignantly and i gave him fifty cents for doing it he must be a young rascal what building is this he asked still in a whisper the tombs what the prison yes didnt you know it asked the informant in surprise i am a stranger in the city said the illinois man apologetically did you want to go to the tribune office yes i wished to subscribe for the paper i am going that way i will show you if you desire it thank you i shall consider it a favor so the two retraced their steps and this time our illinois friend found the office of which he was in quest he came near finding sam also for as he stood in front of frenchs hotel he saw his recent acquaintance approaching and quickly dodged inside the hotel till he had passed a bootblack to whom he had been speaking followed him in surprise i say whats up johnny he asked yer didnt see a copp did yer no its that man that just went by whos he hes the man i ran away from said sam not caring to tell the truth what would he do if he should catch you asked the bootblack with curiosity lick me said sam laconically then you did right is he going to stay here long no hes going away today then youre safe youd better go the other way from him so i will said sam wheres the park ive heard so much about up that way is it far four or five miles its a long way to walk you can ride for five cents can i yes just go over to the astor house and take the sixth avenue cars and theyll take you there sam had intended to spend his entire fifty cents in buying dinner when the time came but he thought he would like to see central park besides he would be safe from pursuit and the punishment which he felt he deserved following the directions of his boy friend he entered a sixth avenue car and in a little less than an hour was set down at one of the gates of the park he entered with a number of others and followed the path that seemed most convenient coming out at last at the lake until now sam had thought rather slightingly of the park green fields were no novelty to him but he admired the lake with the boats that plied over its surface filled with lively passengers he would have invested ten cents in a passage ticket but he felt that if he did this he must sacrifice a part of his intended dinner and sam was growing prudent he wandered about the park two or three hours sitting down at times on the benches that are to be found here and there for the convenience of visitors he felt ready to go back but it was only noon and he was not sure but he might fall in with the gentleman from illinois whom he had left at the entrance of the tombs he was destined to meet an acquaintance but this time it was some one that had cheated him looking up from the bench on which he was seated he saw his host of the preceding night mr clarence brown lounging along smoking a cigar with a look of placid contentment on his face that cigar was bought with my money thought sam bitterly and in this conclusion he was right sam jumped from his seat and advanced to meet his enemy look here mr brown clarence brown started as he saw who addressed him for he was far from expecting to meet sam here he saw from the boys looks that he was suspected of robbing him and decided upon his course oh its you is it he said smiling how do you like the park never mind about that said sam impatiently i want my money mr brown arched his eyes in surprise really my young friend i dont comprehend you he said withdrawing his cigar from his mouth you speak as if i owed you some money quit fooling said sam provoked at the others coolness i want that money you took from me while i was asleep last night it strikes me you have been dreaming said brown composedly i dont know anything about your money how much did you have nearly seven dollars are you sure you had it when you went to bed yes i kept it in my vestpocket that was careless you should have concealed it somewhere i would have kept it for you if you had asked me i dare say you would said sam with withering sarcasm certainly i wouldnt refuse so small a favor are you sure you didnt keep it for me said sam how could i when you didnt give it to me returned the other innocently if you didnt take it said sam rather staggered by the others manner where did it go to i dont know of course but i shouldnt be surprised if it fell out of your vestpocket among the bedclothes did you look yes you might have overlooked it perhaps so said sam thoughtfully he began to think he had suspected mr brown unjustly otherwise how could he be so cool about it i am really sorry for your loss said brown in a tone of sympathy all the more so because i am hard up myself i wish i had seven dollars to lend you i wish you had muttered sam i cant get along without money did you have any breakfast yes sam did not furnish particulars not liking to acknowledge the treatment he had received oh youll get along said brown cheerfully come and lodge with me again tonight i dont know but what i will said sam reflecting that he had no money to lose now as he intended to spend all he had for dinner sit down and let us have a friendly chat said clarence brown wont you have a cigar ive got an extra one i never smoked said sam then its time you learned shall i show you how yes said sam the fact is our very badly behaved hero had long cherished a desire to see how it seemed to smoke a cigar but in the country he had never had the opportunity in the city he was master of his own actions and it occurred to him that he would never have a better opportunity hence his affirmative answer clarence brown smiled slightly to himself for he anticipated fun he produced the cigar lighted it by his own and gave sam directions how to smoke sam proved an apt pupil and was soon puffing away with conscious pride he felt himself several years older but all at once he turned pale and drew the cigar from his mouth whats the matter asked brown demurely i dont know gasped sam his eyes rolling i feel sick do you dont mind it itll pass off i think im going to die said sam in a hollow voice does smoking ever kill people not often said brown soothingly i think its goin to kill me said sam mournfully lie down on the bench youll feel better soon sam lay down on his back and again he wished himself safely back at the deacons new york seemed to him a very dreadful place his head ached his stomach was out of tune and he felt very unhappy lie here a little while and youll feel better said his companion ill be back soon he walked away to indulge in a laugh at his victims expense and sam was left alone chapter xvii tim brady an hour passed and clarence brown did not reappear he had intended to do so but reflecting that there was no more to be got out of sam changed his mind sam lay down on the bench for some time then raised himself to a sitting posture he did not feel so sick as at first but his head ached unpleasantly i wont smoke any more he said to himself i didnt think it would make me feel so bad i am sorry to say that sam did not keep the resolution he then made but at the time when he is first introduced to the reader in the first chapter had become a confirmed smoker why dont mr brown come back he thought after the lapse of an hour he waited half an hour longer when he was brought to the conviction that brown had played him false and was not coming back at all with this conviction his original suspicion revived and he made up his mind that brown had robbed him after all id like to punch his head thought sam angrily it did not occur to him that the deacon from whom the money was originally taken had the same right to punch his head as i have said sams conscience was not sensitive and selfinterest blinded him to the character of his own conduct his experience in smoking had given him a distaste for the park for this afternoon at least and he made his way to the horsecars determined to return it did make him feel a little forlorn to reflect that he had no place to return to no home but the streets he had not yet contracted that vagabond feeling which makes even them seem homelike to the hundreds of homeless children who wander about in them by day and by night he was in due time landed at the astor house it was about four oclock in the afternoon and he had had nothing to eat since breakfast but for the cigar he would have had a hearty appetite as it was he felt faint and thought he should relish some tea and toast he made his way therefore to a restaurant in fulton street between broadway and nassau streets it was a very respectable place but at that time in the afternoon there were few at the tables sam had forty cents left he found that this would allow him to buy a cup of tea a plate of beefsteak a plate of toast and a piece of pie he disposed of them and going up to the desk paid his bill again he found himself penniless i wonder where i am going to sleep he thought i guess ill ask some bootblacks where they live they cant afford to pay much the tea made his head feel better and though he was penniless he began to feel more cheerful than an hour before he wandered about till he got tired leaning against a building sometimes he began to feel lonely he knew nobody in the great city except clarence brown whom he did not care to meet again and the bootblack whose acquaintance he had made the day before i wish i had some other boy with me thought sam somebody i knew its awful lonesome sam was social by temperament and looked about him to see if he could not make some ones acquaintance sitting on the same bench with him for he was in city hall park was a boy of about his own age apparently to him sam determined to make friendly overtures what is your name boy asked sam the other boy looked round at him he was very much freckled and had a sharp look which made him appear preternaturally old what do you want to know for he asked i dont know anybody here id like to get acquainted the street boy regarded him attentively to see if he were in earnest and answered after a pause my name is tim brady whats yours sam barker where do you live nowhere said sam i havent got any home nor any money thats nothing said tim no more have i havent you said sam surprised then where are you going to sleep tonight i know an old wagon up an alley where i can sleep like a top aint you afraid of taking cold sleeping out of doors asked sam who poor as he had always been had never been without a roof to cover him take cold repeated the boy scornfully i aint a baby i dont take cold in the summer i shouldnt think you could sleep in a wagon oh i can sleep anywhere said tim it makes no difference to me where i curl up is there room enough in the wagon for me asked sam yes unless some other chap gets ahead of us may i go with you in course you can suppose we find somebody else ahead of us then well go somewhere else theres plenty of places i say johnny havent you got no stamps at all stamps yes money dont you know what stamps is no i spent my last cent for supper if youd got thirty cents wed go to the theatre what theatre the old bowery is it good you bet then i wish i had money enough to go i never went to the theatre in my life you didnt where was you raised said tim contemptuously in the country i thought so they dont have theatres in the country then i wouldnt live there it must be awful dull there so it is said sam thats why i ran away did you run away asked tim interested was it from the old man it was from the man i worked for he wanted me to work all the time and i got tired of it what sort of work was it asked tim it was on a farm i had to hoe potatoes split wood and such things i wouldnt like it its a good deal more jolly bein in the city if youve only got money enough to get along added sam oh you can earn money how asked sam eagerly different ways how do you make a livin sometimes i black boots sometimes i sell papers then again i smash baggage whats that asked sam bewildered oh i forgot exclaimed tim youre from the country i loaf round the depots and steamboat landins and carry carpetbags and such things for pay is that smashing baggage to be sure i could do that said sam thoughtfully can you make much that way pends on how many jobs you get and whether the coves liberal wimmens the wust theyll beat a chap down to nothin if they can how much do you get anyway for carrying a bundle i axes fifty cents and generally gets a quarter the wimmen dont want to pay moren ten cents i guess ill try it tomorrow if youll tell me where to go you can go along of me im goin smashin myself tomorrer thank you said sam im glad i met you you see i dont know much about the city didnt you bring no money with you yes but it was stolen was your pockets picked ill tell you about it i was robbed in my sleep so sam told the story of his adventures with clarence brown tim listened attentively he was smart he was said tim approvingly hes a rascal said sam hotly who did not relish hearing his spoiler praised course he is but hes smart too you might a knowed hed do it how should i know i thought he was a kind man that wanted to do me a favor tim burst out laughing aint you green though he remarked oh my eye but youre jolly green am i said sam rather offended is everybody a thief in new york most everybody if they gets a chance said tim coolly didnt you ever steal yourself sam colored he had temporarily forgotten the little adventure that preceded his departure from his country home after all why should he be so angry with clarence brown for doing the very same thing he had done himself why indeed but sam had an answer ready the deacon did not need the money while he could not get along very well without it so it was meaner in clarence brown to take all he had than in him to take what the deacon could so well spare i hope my readers understand that this was very flimsy and unsatisfactory reasoning stealing is stealing under whatever circumstances at any rate sam found it inconvenient to answer tims pointed question they talked awhile longer and then his companion rose from the bench come along johnny he said lets go to roost all right said sam and the two left the park chapter xviii sam turns impostor tim conducted our hero to an alleyway not far from the north river in which an old wagon had come to temporary anchor this is my hotel he said i like it cause its cheap they dont trouble you with no bills here tumble in tim without further ceremony laid himself down on the floor of the wagon and sam followed his example there is everything in getting used to things and that is where tim had the advantage he did not mind the hardness of his couch while sam who had always been accustomed to a regular bed did he moved from one side to another and then lay on his back seeking sleep in vain whats up muttered tim sleepily why dont you shut your peepers the boards are awful hard sam complained it aint nothin when youre used to it said tim you go to sleep and you wont mind it i wish i could said sam turning again finally he succeeded in getting to sleep but not till some time after his companion he slept pretty well however and did not awaken till at six oclock he was shaken by his companion whats the matter where am i asked sam feeling bewildered at first why here you are in course said the matteroffact tim did you think you was in the stationhouse no i hope not answered sam what time is it i dont know a chap stole my watch in the night i guess its after six have you got any stamps no nor i weve got to stir round and earn some breakfast howll we do it well go down to the pier and wait for the boston boat maybe well get a chance to smash some baggage i hope so said sam for im hungry im troubled that way myself said tim come along when they reached the pier they found a number of boys men and hackdrivers already in waiting they had to wait about half an hour when they saw the great steamer slowly approaching the wharf instantly tim was on the alert when they begin to come ashore you must go in and try your luck just do as i do this sam resolved to do a tall man emerged from the steamer bearing a heavy carpetbag smash yer baggage said tim no i think not i can carry it myself i havent had any breakfast said tim screwing up his freckled features into an expression of patient suffering nor i either said the stranger smiling youve got money to buy some and i havent said tim keeping at his side well you may carry it said the gentleman goodnaturedly tim turned half round and winked at sam as much as to say did you see how i did it sam was quick enough to take the hint smash your carpetbag he asked of a middleaged lady imitating as closely as possible tims professional accent what asked the lady startled she dont understand thought sam let me carry it for you maam i do not need it i am going to take a cab let me take it to the cab persisted sam but he was forestalled by a hackdriver who had heard the ladys remark let me take it maam he said thrusting sam aside ive got a nice carriage just outside take you anywhere you want to go so the lady was carried away and sam had to make a second application this time he addressed himself to a gentleman whose little daughter walked by his side no said the gentleman the carpetbag is small i dont need help the smallness of the bag by the way was one reason why sam who did not like heavy bundles wanted to carry it he felt that it was time to practise on the strangers feelings i want to earn some money to buy bread for my mother he whined in a very creditable manner considering how inexperienced he was this attracted the attention of the little girl who like most little girls had a tender and compassionate heart is your mother poor she asked very poor said sam she hasnt got a cent to buy bread for the children have you got many brothers and sisters asked the little girl her voice full of sympathy five answered sam piteously o papa said the little girl let him take your carpetbag think of it his mother hasnt got anything to eat well clara said her father indulgently i suppose i must gratify you here boy take the bag and carry it carefully all right sir said sam cheerfully i guess i can get along he thought complacently thats a good dodge when we get to broadway well take the stage said the gentleman take hold of my hand tight clara while we cross the street clara seemed disposed to be sociable and entered into conversation with the young baggagesmasher are your brothers and sisters younger than you she inquired yes said sam how many of them are boys theres two boys besides me and three girls said sam readily what are their names asked clara why answered sam hesitating a little theres tom and jim and john and sam and maggie i dont see how that can be said clara puzzled just now you said there were three girls and only two boys did i said sam rather abashed i didnt think what i was saying isnt your father alive asked the little girl no hes dead and do you have to support the family yes except what mother does what does she do oh she goes out washing poor boy i suppose you have a hard time yes said sam some days we dont get anything to eat o papa isnt it dreadful said clara her warm little heart throbbing with sympathy her father was less credulous and he was struck by sams hearty appearance certainly he looked very unlike a boy who did not have enough to eat you dont look as if you suffered much from hunger my boy said he with a penetrating look i had a good dinner yesterday said sam a gentleman gave me some money for showing him the way to the tribune office one dinner seems to have done you a great deal of good said the man it always does me good said sam and here he had no occasion to tell a falsehood i hope you carried some of the money home to your mother and brothers and sisters yes i did i bought some meat and mother cooked it we dont often have meat perhaps i am doing the boy injustice thought mr glenham for this was his name as for clara her childish sympathies were fully aroused papa she said may i give this poor boy the half dollar aunt lucy gave me i thought you had arranged some way of spending it clara so i had papa but id rather give it to this poor boy you may do as you like my darling said her father tenderly here poor boy take this home to your mother said clara my readers have probably inferred already that sam was not a boy of very high principles but i must do him the justice to say that he felt ashamed to take the money tendered him by the little girl upon whom he had imposed by his false story i dont like to take your money he said hanging back but i want you to said clara eagerly id a great deal rather your mother would have it you may take it said mr glenham who was disposed to regard sam with greater favor on account of the reluctance he exhibited to profit by claras compassion thank you said sam no longer withholding his hand you are very kind by this time they had reached broadway and sam delivered up the bag mr glenham handed him a quarter that is for your trouble he said thank you sir said sam a broadway stage came up and they both were lost to view sam was in good spirits over his good fortune seventyfive cents he said to himself thats what i call luck i dont believe tims done so well it aint so hard to make your living in new york after all i guess ill go and get some breakfast chapter xix how sam fared on the strength of his good luck sam provided himself with a good breakfast which cost him forty cents he felt pretty sure of earning something more during the day to add to the remaining thirtyfive but fortune is capricious and our hero found all his offers of service firmly refused he tried again to excite compassion by his fictitious story of a starving family at home but his appeals were made to the flintyhearted or the incredulous so about two oclock he went to dinner and spent the remainder of his money again he spent the night with tim in the wagon and again in the morning he set out to earn his breakfast but luck was against him people insisted on carrying their own carpetbags to the great detriment of the baggagesmashing business tim was no luckier than sam about ten oclock they were walking despondently through a side street discussing ways and means im awful hungry tim said sam mournfully so am i you bet i wouldnt mind if i had a couple of apples said sam fixing his eyes upon an old womans applestand wouldnt she trust not much said tim you try her if you want to i will said sam desperately the two boys approached the applestand i say said sam to the wrinkled old woman who presided over it how do you sell your apples a penny a piece she answered in a cracked voice is that cheap enough for ye ill take five said sam the old woman began eagerly to pick out the required number but stopped short when he finished the sentence if youll trust me till afternoon is it trust ye she ejaculated suspiciously no farther than i can see yer im up to your tricks you young spalpeen thryin to chate a poor widder out of her money ill pay you sure said sam but i havent earned anything yet today then its i that cant be supportin a big strong boy like you go away and come back whin youve got money here tim broke in my friend always pays his bills he said you neednt be afraid to trust him and who are you asked the old woman i dont know you and i cant take your word youre tryin the two of you to swindle a poor widder my fathers an alderman said tim giving the wink to sam is he now thin let him lind your friend money and dont ask a poor woman to trust well i would but hes gone to washington on business thin go after him and lave me alone i dont want no spalpeens like you round my applestand look here old woman ill have you arrested for callin me names come away sam her apples are rotten anyhow the old woman began to berate them soundly indignant at this attack upon her wares and in the midst of it the two boys walked off we didnt make much said sam im awful hungry take that then said tim pulling an apple out of his pocket sam opened his eyes how did you get it he asked in astonishment tim put his tongue in his cheek i took it when you were talkin to the ould woman he answered and heres another so saying he produced a companion apple and made a vigorous onslaught upon it sam following suit i dont see how you could do it said sam admiringly and she looking on all the time its easy enough when you know how said tim complacently shed catch me sure likely she would you aint used to it sam ought to have felt uneasy at appropriating the result of a theft but his conscience was an easy one and he felt hungry so he made short work of the apple and wished for more i wish youd taken two apiece he said i couldnt said tim shed have seen em stickin out of my pocket and called a copp ones better than none i feel a little better said sam philosophically i spose its stealing though oh whats the odds shell never miss em come along in the course of the forenoon sam managed to earn ten cents and was forced to content himself with a very economical dinner there was a place on ann street where for this small sum a plate of meat and a potato were furnished but enough only to whet the appetite of a hearty boy like sam a suspicion did enter his mind as he rose from the table penniless once more and his appetite still unsatisfied that he had bought his liberty dearly if his affairs did not improve in the country he had enough to eat a good bed to sleep in and no care or anxiety while he was not overworked here there was constant anxiety and he never knew when he rose in the morning where his dinner was to come from or whether he would be able to buy one still there was a fascination in the free lawless life and if he could only be sure of making even fifty cents a day he would probably have preferred it it is not necessary to describe sams life in detail for the next month he and tim were constant companions and under tims instruction he was rapidly acquiring the peculiar education of a street vagabond of his employments in that brief period it would be difficult to give a complete list at one time he blacked boots for another boy to whom he paid half his receipts in return for the use of the box and blacking but sam was detected by his employer in rendering a false account and was thrown upon his own resources again it would have been much more to his interest to have a blackingbrush and box of his own but whenever sam had capital enough he preferred to spend it for a good dinner so there did not seem much chance of his getting ahead he had before this time been introduced to the newsboys lodging house where he was interrogated about his past life by the superintendent sam was obliged to have recourse to his imagination in reply feeling that if he spoke the truth he would be liable to be returned to his country home are your parents living inquired mr oconnor no said sam telling the truth this time when did they die two years ago did they die in new york yes sir they died of smallpox volunteered sam and have you been supporting yourself since then yes sir how does it happen that you have not been round here before i was living with my uncle answered sam hesitating why have you left him he didnt treat me well perhaps you didnt behave well oh yes i did what is your uncles name james cooper where does he live in what street hes moved away from the city now said sam feeling that he must put a stop to these inconvenient inquiries so sam was admitted to the privileges of the lodginghouse now he found it much easier to get along for eighteen cents a day he was provided with lodging breakfast and supper and it was not often that he could not obtain as much as that when he could earn enough more to buy a square meal in the middle of the day and a fifteencent ticket to the pit of the old bowery theatre in the evening he felt happy he was fairly adrift in the streets of the great city and his future prospects did not look very brilliant it is hardly necessary to say that in a moral point of view he had deteriorated rather than improved in fact he was fast developing into a social outlaw with no particular scruples against lying or stealing one thing may be said in his favor he never made use of his strength to oppress a younger boy on the whole he was goodnatured and not at all brutal he had on one occasion interfered successfully to protect a young boy from one of greater strength who was beating him i like to mention this because i do not like to have it supposed that sam was wholly bad we will now advance the story some months and see what they have done for sam to begin with they have not improved his wardrobe when he first came to the city he was neatly though coarsely dressed now his clothes hang in rags about him and moreover they are begrimed with mud and grease his straw hat and he have some time since parted company and he now wears a greasy article which he picked up at a secondhand store in baxter street for twentyfive cents if sam were troubled with vanity he might feel disturbed by his disreputable condition but as he sees plenty of other boys of his own class no better dressed he thinks very little about it such as they are his clothes are getting too small for him for sam has grown a couple of inches since he came to the city such was our heros appearance when one day he leaned against a building on broadway and looked lazily at the vehicles passing wishing vaguely that he had enough money to buy a square meal a broadway stage was passing at the time a small man whose wrinkled face indicated that he was over sixty attempted to descend from the stage while in motion in some way he lost his footing and falling managed to sprain his ankle his hat falling off and rolling along on the pavement sam who was always on the lookout for chances here saw an opening he dashed forward lifted the old gentleman to his feet and ran after his hat and restored it are you hurt he asked i think i have sprained my ankle help me upstairs to my office said the old man he pointed to a staircase leading up from the sidewalk all right said sam lean on me chapter xx sam gets into a new business sam helped the old man up two flights of stairs shall we go any farther he asked no thats my office said his companion pointing to a door over which was the number from his pocket he drew a key and opened the door sam entered with him the room was small one corner was partitioned off for an inner office inside was a chair something like a barbers chair and a table covered with instruments sams curiosity was aroused he wondered what sort of business was carried on here he also wondered whether he would get anything for his trouble if you dont want me any longer ill go he said by way of a delicate hint stop a minute said the old man who had limped to a sofa in the outer office and sat down i guess ill get something thought sam cheerfully complying with the request what do you do for a living asked the old man sometimes i black boots sometimes i sell papers anything thatll pay what are you doing now nothing business aint good would you like something to do sam gave a glance into the office and answered dubiously yes he was not at all clear about the nature of the employment likely to be offered then i may be able to give you a job do you know my business no sir im a corndoctor youve heard of dr felix graham the celebrated corndoctor havent you said the old man complacently yes said sam thinking that this was the answer expected i am dr graham said the old man proudly are you said sam in some curiosity yes now ill tell you what i want you to do go and bring me that pile of circulars he pointed to a pile of papers on the floor in the corner sam brought them as directed can you read asked the doctor yes sir a little read that circular sam read as follows dr felix graham chiropodist corns and bunions cured without pain satisfaction guaranteed broadway room sam bungled over the word chiropodist but was put right by the doctor i want a boy to stand at the door and distribute these circulars said dr graham can you do it of course i can said sam what pay will i get ten cents a hundred said the doctor but you mustnt do as my last boy did how did he do asked sam he was so anxious to get rid of them that he gave half a dozen away at a time i caught him in it he wanted to earn money too fast he was smart said sam with a grin i dont like that kind of smartness said the doctor sharply i want you to serve me faithfully so i will said sam you neednt give to everybody there isnt much use in giving to children yes sir but if you see any one walking as if he had corns be sure to hand him one yes sir now count off a hundred of the circulars and go downstairs all right sir this was the first regular employment sam had obtained and he felt rather important he resolved to acquit himself to the satisfaction of the doctor in his zeal he even determined to improve upon his instructions he had no sooner taken his stand than he saw a gentleman and lady approaching they were young and being engaged were indulging in conversation more interesting to themselves than any one else the gentleman had on a pair of tight boots and from his style of walking sam concluded that he was a suitable customer here sir said he pressing a circular into the young mans gloved hand whats that asked the young man then glancing at it he showed it with a laugh to the young lady look here boy he said turning to sam what made you give me this you walked as if youd got corns said sam honestly walk right up and dr graham will cure em in a jiffy perhaps youll tell me what is to become of this young lady while i go up johnny maybe shes got corns too said sam she can go up too both the lady and gentleman laughed convulsively considerably to sams surprise for he was not aware that he had said anything unusual or funny shall we go up eliza asked the young man the only answer was a laugh and they passed on the next one who attracted sams attention was an elderly maiden lady have you got corns maam asked sam eagerly now it so happened that the lady was a little deaf and did not understand sams question unfortunately for herself she stopped short and inquired what did you say i guess shes hard of hearing sam concluded and raising his voice loud enough to be heard across the street he repeated his question have you got corns maam at the same time he thrust a circular into the hand of the astonished and mortified lady two schoolgirls just behind heard the question and laughed heartily the offended lady dropped the paper as if it were contamination and sailed by her sallow face red with anger thats funny thought sam i dont know whats got into all the people seems to me theyre ashamed of havin corns the next halfdozen took circulars mechanically glanced at them and dropped them indifferently guess they aint got corns thought the observing sam by and by a countryman came along and into his hand sam put the circular whats this he asked its corns just go upstairs and the doctorll cure em lessn no time wal i have got two said the countryman they hurt like time too what does this doctor charge sam did not know but he was not the boy to allow his ignorance to appear ten cents apiece he answered thats cheap enough anyway said he ive got a good mind to go up where is it come along ill show you said sam promptly i guess i may as well are you sure he can cure em i ought to know said sam i had one about as big as a marble on my big toe the doctor he cured it in a minute you dont say he must be pooty good you bet hes the great dr graham everybodys heard of him by such convincing assurances the mans faith was increased he followed sam into the doctors office here said sam ive brought you a customer dr graham i told him you could cure his corns in a jiffy the doctor smiled approvingly you are right there my friend sit down in this chair you wont hurt will you doctor asked the customer glancing with a little alarm at the table with its instruments oh no youll scarcely feel it sam returned to his post and began to distribute handbills once more about quarter of an hour later he was assailed by an angry voice looking up he saw the customer he had sent upstairs look here boy he said angrily you told me a lie how did i asked sam you told me the doctor only charged ten cents for each corn jerusalem he made me fork out a dollar sam was rather surprised himself at the price i guess they was tough ones mister he said he cured em didnt he ye es then its worth the money you dont want em back do you no admitted the other but its a thunderin sight to pay and he went off grumbling dont the doctor make money though thought sam hed orter give me a commission on them two dollars chapter xxi sam obtains a place having disposed of his circulars sam went up to the office have you distributed all the circulars asked the doctor yes sir well heres the ten cents i promised you sam took it but stood his ground i sent you up a customer he said a patient yes and you made two dollars out of him who told you he did i charged him my regular price what of that asked the doctor not comprehending sams meaning he wouldnt have come up if it hadnt been for me i think id ought to have a commission oh thats it said the doctor that doesnt follow he came up because of the circular no he didnt said sam he came up because i told him what a great doctor you was the doctor thought over sams proposal and being a sharp man he decided that it was for his advantage to secure an alliance with him you are right he said you are entitled to something sam brightened up here is a quarter in addition to the ten cents i just gave you thank you sir said sam gratified shall i go down and give away some more circulars he asked yes ill give you another hundred dont give them away too fast its of no use to give to children all right sir so sam went down into the street the first passerby was a boy of twelve give me one of them papers he said rather to his surprise sam did not immediately comply he first asked a question have you got a dollar a dollar you dont want a dollar for that paper do you no but i aint goin to waste it on you unless youve got a dollar what do i want of a dollar asked the boy surprised to pay for havin your corn cured the boy burst into a laugh i aint got no corns he said then go along and dont bother me youre no good a young dandy advanced dressed in the height of fashion swinging a light cane in his lavendergloved hand a rose was in his buttonhole and he was just in the act of saluting a young lady when sam thrust a circular into his hand go right upstairs he said and get your corns cured only a dollar the young lady burst into a ringing laugh and the mortified dandy reddened with mortification keep your dirty paper to yourself boy he said i am not troubled with those ah excrescences i never heard of them things said sam i said corns stand out of my way boy or ill cane you exclaimed the incensed fop your cane wouldnt hurt said sam regarding the slight stick with disdain never mind you neednt go up i dont believe youve got a dollar this was rather impudent in sam i acknowledge and the dandy would have been glad to chastise him miss winslow he said i hope you wont mind the rudeness of this ah ragamuffin oh i dont said the young lady merrily he amuses me so he does me ha ha very good joke said the dandy laughing too but not very merrily i hope you are quite well today thank you quite so but dont let me detain you if you have an engagement upstairs i assure you protested the young man hurriedly that i have no intention of going up at all then i must say goodmorning at any rate as i am out shopping and the young lady passed on ive a great mind to flog you said the dandy frowning at sam i would if you wasnt so dirty i wouldnt like to soil my hands by taking hold of you thats lucky for you said sam coolly the answer was a withering frown but sam was tough and not easily withered aint he stuck up though thought he as the young man left him he dont seem to like me much have you got any corns sir he asked thrusting a paper into the hands of a portly gentleman with a merry face the gentleman laughed really my boy he said that is a very singular question is it said sam i dont know why why do you ask because dr graham upstairs will cure you before you know it its only a dollar you are sure you are not dr graham yourself said the stout man regarding sam with an amused expression if i was id wear better clothes said sam he makes lots of money the doctor does youd better learn the business my young friend i guess i will if hell learn me said sam itll pay better than standin here givin away papers dont that pay not very well said sam i only get ten cents a hundred can you pay your board out of that no but i make commissions besides said sam how is that asked the stout gentleman in some curiosity if youd gone upstairs and had two corns cured the doctor hed have given me a quarter would he really yes he would hadnt you better go i have no occasion for dr grahams services at present said the gentleman laughing but still i dont want you to lose by me heres a quarter producing the same from his vestpocket and giving it to sam isnt that just as well as if i had gone up thank you sir youre a gentleman said sam do you come by here often his new acquaintance laughed every day he answered but i dont give away quarters every day if you expect that i am afraid i shall have to walk on the other side of the street goodmorning and success to you goodmornin said sam well heres luck thought sam i like this business pretty well ive made sixty cents already and the doctors goin to pay me ten cents more thatll buy me a good square dinner and take me to the old bowery besides so sam continued distributing his circulars some into whose hands they were thrust did not appear to be suitably grateful and though on the lookout for a customer he did not succeed in finding any till by good luck the last circular was placed in the hands of a man who was in search of just the relief which it promised where is dr grahams office he inquired right upstairs no said sam eagerly you just follow me ill show you i think i can find it without you said the other oh i can go up just as well as not said sam who had a special object as we know in serving as guide very well go ahead and i will follow you upstairs went sam the new patient following him ive brought another said sam as he burst into the office the doctor though glad of another patient was rather vexed at the style of sams announcement very well he said sit down there till i have leisure to attend to you all right sir said sam sitting down on the sofa in the outer office and taking up the morning herald in twenty minutes the patient departed relieved now said dr graham addressing sam i have something to say to you when you bring in a patient again dont break out as you did just now ive brought another i was very much mortified what shall i say then asked sam you neednt say anything except this is dr graham sir very well said sam ill remember how much did you make out of him dont speak in that way my charges were three dollars how much are you going to give me theres thirty cents i think ill go and get some dinner now said sam will you want me tomorrow ive been thinking said the doctor that i would engage you as my officeboy what would i have to do stay in the office when i am away and distribute circulars when i want you to how much will you pay me three dollars a week and commissions too no well say four days without commissions all right sir ill be on hand tomorrow mornin ive got a place at last thought sam in exultation now ill go to dinner chapter xxii the young doctor the fact that he had obtained a place gave sam a new sense of importance having drifted about the city streets for six months never knowing in the morning where his meals were to come from during the day or whether he was to have any it was pleasant to think that he was to have regular wages he presented himself in good season the next morning he was waiting outside when the doctor arrived so you are on hand said dr graham yes sir by the way what is your name sam barker very well sam come upstairs with me sam followed the doctor to his office the doctor surveyed his young assistant with critical eyes where do you buy your clothes he asked i havent bought any said sam i brought these from the country they seem to be considerably the worse for wear in fact your appearance doesnt do credit to my establishment i do look rather ragged said sam but i havent got enough money to buy any new clothes i have a son two years older than you he may have some old clothes that would suit you ill have a bundle made up and brought down to the office tomorrow thank you sir said sam the doctor kept his promise and the next day our hero was enabled to throw aside his rags and attire himself in a neat gray suit which considerably improved his outward appearance now said the doctor i would suggest that a little more attention to washing would be of advantage to you all right sir ill remember sam scrubbed himself to a considerable degree of cleanness and combed his hair the ultimate result was a very creditablelooking office boy now said the doctor i expect you to be faithful to my interests sam readily promised this already he formed glowing anticipations of learning the business and succeeding the doctor or at any rate being admitted to partnership at some future day several weeks passed by considering his previous course of life sam acquitted himself very well he opened the office in the morning swept it out and got it in order before the doctor arrived during the day he ran on errands distributed circulars in fact made himself generally useful the doctor was rather irregular in coming in the morning so that sam was sometimes obliged to wait for him two or three hours one morning when sitting at his ease reading the morning paper he was aroused by a knock at the door he rose and opened it is the doctor in asked a young man of irish extraction hasnt come yet said sam would you like to see him i would thin hes the man that cures corns isnt he yes said sam hes the best corndoctor in the city thin ive come to the right place sure have you got one ive got a murtherin big one it almost kills me step in and wait for the doctor hell be in soon im in a great hurry said the young man its porter i am in a store down town and i cant stay long how much does the doctor charge a dollar for each corn o murder does he now isnt it worth that its a mighty big price to pay you see said sam hes a famous doctor thats why he charges so much i dont care for that at all im a poor man and its hard on me payin that much here an idea struck sam he had often witnessed the doctors operations and to his inexperienced mind they seemed easy enough to perform why couldnt he operate a little on his own account before the doctor came by so doing he would make a little money and if successful he would have a future source of revenue as patients often came when he was alone im the doctors assistant he commenced are you now so youre the young doctor yes said sam then its a mighty young doctor ye are i know it said sam ive learnt the trade of dr graham do you work at it much asked the patient yes said sam when the doctors away i aint as good as he is he admitted candidly and that is why i work cheaper you work cheaper do yer yes said sam i only charge half price thats fifty cents yes and do you think you could cure me of course i could said sam confidently then go ahead said the irishman in a fit of reckless confidence which he was destined to repent sit down there said sam pointing out the patients chair the patient obeyed now take off your boots you dont think i can cut through the boot do you he was obeyed sam began to fumble among the sharp instruments what are you goin to do asked the patient rather alarmed oh dont be afraid said sam you wont feel it wont feel the knife no im goin to put on some liquid thatll take away the feeling shure you ought to know said the patient his confidence returning of course i do said sam now sit still illustration of sam and his patient thus far sam was perfectly selfpossessed he went about his preparations with an air that imposed upon the patient but the difficulty was to come things which look easy often are found difficult when attempted when sam began to wield the doctors instruments he did so awkwardly he lacked that delicacy of touch which can only be acquired by practice and the result was tragical the knife slipped inflicting a deep gash and causing a quick flow of blood oh murder im kilt exclaimed the terrified patient bounding to his feet and rushing frantically round the room im bladin to death sam was almost equally frightened he stood with the knife in his hand panicstricken ill have you up for murder i will shouted mr dennis obrien clutching the wounded member oh why did i ever come to a boy doctor oh whirra whirra i didnt mean to do it said sam frightened youll be hanged for killin me bad cess to you go for a doctor quick almost out of his wits sam was about to obey when as he opened the door he confronted his employer under ordinary circumstances he would have been sorry to have him come in so soon now he was glad whats the meaning of all this asked dr graham surveying with astonishment the irishman prancing around the office and sams scared face hes kilt me doctor said dennis groaning he who the young doctor shure whos he thats the one said mr obrien pointing to sam hes cut my toe off and im bladin to death what does this mean sam said the doctor sternly he was in a hurry stammered sam and i didnt want him to go away so i thought id try to cure him but the knife slipped and ill attend to your case afterwards sit down sir will i die asked dennis lugubriously no danger now you might if i hadnt come just as i did matters were soon remedied and dennis went away relieved well satisfied because the doctor declined under the circumstances to receive any fee now sam said the doctor after he had gone what do you mean by such work as this i thought i could do it said sam abashed i ought to turn you away for this it was only a mistake said sam it came near being a very serious mistake what would you have done if i had not come just as i did i dont know said sam never touch my instruments again if you do i shall discharge you at once that is after giving you a sound flogging sam felt that he had got off easily and determined not to set up again as doctor on his own account chapter xxiii sam falls into bad company for a time matters went on smoothly sam was abashed by the result of his experiment and discouraged from making another he felt that he had a good place living chiefly at the lodginghouse his expenses were small and four dollars a week were ample to meet them there was one thing he missed however the freedom to roam about the streets at will he felt this the more when the pleasant spring weather came on there were times when he got sick of the confinement and longed to leave the office it was a bright morning in may when dr graham called from the inner office sam what sir do you know the way to brooklyn yes sir i want you to go over there for me all right sir it may be explained that dr graham on the first of may had moved over to brooklyn and was occupying a house about a mile from fulton ferry i want you to go to my house said the doctor no h street and carry this letter to my wife yes sir i forgot entirely to leave her some money to meet a bill but if you go at once it will reach her in time stay i will give you the address on a card all right sir here is a quarter it will pay your carfare and over the ferry both ways now mind you come back as quick as you can this sam readily promised he was glad to get away for the morning as he calculated that the expedition would take him nearly or quite three hours he took a car and got out at the astor house on his way down to the ferry he met an old street acquaintance jim nolan how are you sam said jim tiptop answered sam where do you keep yourself are you blackin boots now no answered sam with rather an important air im in an office how much do you get four dollars a week thats good howd you get it oh the doctor took a fancy to me and asked me to come youre in luck so youre with a doctor yes dr graham hes a corndoctor where does he hang out no broadway do you have much to do not very much how do you come down here then im takin a letter to brooklyn for the doctor are you yes said sam adding unluckily theres money in it is there said jim pricking up his ears how do you know lets see the letter sam took the letter from his inside coatpocket and passed it to jim the latter held it up to the light and tried to look inside fortune favored his efforts the envelope was imperfectly fastened and came open there jim said sam now see what youve done lets look inside and see how much money there is suggested jim sam hesitated it wont do any harm to look at it said the tempter thats so said sam he accordingly drew out the enclosure and disclosed two tendollar bills jims eyes sparkled with greed twenty dollars he exclaimed what a lot of good that would do us sams principles were not firm but he had a good place and the temptation was not as strong as in jims case so he answered maybe it would but it aint ours jim fastened his little black eyes on sam cunningly it might be he answered how could it be you could keep it the doctord find it out tell him somebody hooked it out of your pocket he wouldnt know sam shook his head i aint goin to lose a good place just for that he said think what a lot of things you could do for ten dollars urged jim twenty you mean thats ten apiece isnt it oh you want some do you inquired sam yes ill take it from you and then give you back half so itll be me that stole it they cant do nothin to you come ill go over to brooklyn with you and then you can make up your mind on board the boat jim renewed his persuasions and finally sam yielded im afraid the doctorll think i took it he said no matter he cant prove nothin well find it hard to change the bills no we wont ill tell you where to go can you play billiards no but id like to learn i know and ill learn you theres a saloon over in brooklyn where we can go and have a game well pay out of one of the bills now sam had long wanted to learn the game of billiards and this seemed a good opportunity perhaps this consideration as much as any determined him to close with his friends proposal when therefore they had reached the brooklyn side instead of taking the horsecars to dr grahams house sam followed his companion to a low billiard saloon not far away there were four tables one of which only was occupied for it was too early on one side of the room was a bar behind which stood a man in his shirtsleeves well boys what do you want he asked we want a table said jim were goin to play a game the man in the shirtsleeves produced from underneath the counter a green pasteboard box containing four ivory billiard balls what table will you have he asked this one here said jim leading the way to one farthest from the door now take a cue sam he said well have a jolly game you must tell me how to play oh ill learn you jim was not a very skilful player but he knew something about the game and under his instruction sam made some progress being able to make a shot now and then he was very much pleased with the game and determined to devote his spare earnings to this form of recreation hereafter when the game was ended a full hour had passed i didnt think it was so late said sam starting i shall have to go go and pay for the game first you ought to pay half no i beat the one that loses the game has to pay of course you beat it was my first game never mind youll soon play as well as i and then i shall have to pay half the time do you think ill improve of course you will well play again tonight here no in new york ill show you a good saloon in chatham street sam stepped up to the counter how much do you want he asked sixty cents its only twentyfive cents a game said jim nolan your game was longer than two ordinary ones ill call it fifty cents sam produced the tendollar bill and received in return nine dollars and a half the clerk was rather surprised at a boy presenting so large a bill he suspected that it was not come by honestly but as he argued that was none of his business what he cared for most was to get paid for the billiards so sam who had felt a little uneasy about offering the money was more at his ease we had a good game didnt we said jim yes said sam and you did bully for the first time i couldnt play so well my first game sam felt flattered by this compliment from his companion now i must go back he said ill go along back with you but well take a drink first i want to change my bill too why didnt you do it in the billiardsaloon they had a bar there they might suspect something if both of us offered tens heres a place close by come in here jim led the way into a drinkingsaloon and sam followed its my treat said jim whatll you have what are you goin to take a whiskeypunch ill take one too two whiskeypunches and mind you make em stiff said jim he tossed down his glass but sam drank more slowly jim paid for the drinks and they went out into the street chapter xxiv sams excuses sam was not used to liquor and was more easily affected than most when he got out into the street his head spun round and he staggered his companion observed it why you dont mean ter say yer tight sam he said pausing and looking at him i dont know what it is said sam but i feel queer kinder light in the head and shaky in the legs yes thats the way i feel then youre drunk drunk ejaculated sam rather frightened for he was still unsophisticated compared with his companion just so i say you must be a chicken to get tight on one whiskeypunch added jim rather contemptuously it was strong said sam by way of apology leaning against a lamppost for support it was stiffish said jim i always take em so and dont you feel it at all queried sam not a bit said jim decidedly i aint a baby nor i either said sam with a spark of his accustomed spirit only i aint used to it why i could take three glasses one after the other without gettin tight said jim proudly i tell you ive got a strong stomach i wish i hadnt taken the drink said sam when will i feel better in an hour or two i cant go back to the doctor this way hell know ive been drinkin i wish i could lie down somewhere ill tell you what come round to the ferryroom you can sit down there till you feel better give me your arm jim im lightheaded with jims assistance sam made his way to fulton ferry but instead of going over in the next boat he leaned back in his seat in the waitingroom and rested jim walked about on the pier his hands in his pocket with an independent air he felt happy and prosperous never before in his life probably had he had so much money in his possession some men with a hundred thousand dollars would have felt poorer than jim with nine dollars and a half by and by sam felt enough better to start on his homeward journey jim agreed to accompany him as far as the new york side i dont know what the doctor will say when he finds out the money is gone said sam soberly you just tell him it was stolen from you by a pickpocket suppose he dont believe it he cant prove nothin he might search me so he might said jim ill tell you what youd better do what just give me the money to keep for you then if he searches you he wont find it if jim expected this suggestion to be adopted he undervalued sams shrewdness that young man had not knocked about the streets eight months for nothing i guess not said sam significantly maybe i wouldnt find it any easier if you took it you dont call me a thief do you demanded jim offended it looks as if we was both thieves said sam candidly you neednt talk so loud said jim hurriedly theres no use in tellin everybody that i see i dont want the money only if the old man finds it dont blame me you neednt be mad jim said sam ill need the money myself i guess ill have to hide it do you wear stockins asked jim yes dont you not in warm weather they aint no good they only get dirty but if you wear em thats the place to hide the money i guess youre right said sam i wouldnt have thought of it where can i do it wait till were on the new york side you can sit down on one of the piers and do it nobodyll see you sam thought this good advice and decided to follow it there is some use in stockins said jim reflectively if i was in your place i wouldnt know where to stow away the money where are you goin now ill have to go back said sam ive been a long time already im goin to get some dinner said jim i havent got time said sam besides i dont feel so hungry as usual i guess its the drink i took it dont take away my appetite said his companion with an air of superiority sam took the cars home knowing what he did it was with an uncomfortable feeling that he ascended the stairs and entered the presence of dr graham the doctor looked angry what made you so long he demanded abruptly did you find the house no answered sam wishing that his embarrassing explanations were fully over no i didnt you didnt find the house exclaimed the doctor in angry surprise why didnt you i thought it wasnt any use stammered sam wasnt any use repeated the chiropodist explain yourself sir at once as long as i hadnt got the letter proceeded sam now the secret was out what did you do with the letter demanded dr graham suspiciously i lost it lost it how could you lose it did you know there was money in it said his employer looking angry and disturbed yes sir you said so then why were you not careful of it you young rascal i was sir that is i tried to be but it was stolen who would steal the letter unless he knew that it contained money thats it sir i ought not to have told anybody sit down and tell me all about it or it will be the worse for you said the doctor now for it thought sam you see sir he commenced i was in the horsecars in brooklyn when i saw a boy i knew we got to talking and before i knew it i told him that i was carryin a letter with money in it i took it out of my coatpocket and showed it to him you had no business to do it said dr graham no one but a fool would show a moneyletter so the boy stole it did he oh no said sam hastily it wasnt he who was it then dont be all day telling your story said the doctor irritably there was a young man sitting on the other side of me said sam he was welldressed and i didnt think hed do such a thing but he must have stole the letter what makes you think so he got out only two or three minutes afterwards and it wasnt long after that that i missed the letter what did you do i stopped the car and went back jim went back along with me we looked all round tryin to find the man but we couldnt of course you couldnt growled the doctor did you think he would stay till you came up no sir that is i didnt know what to think i felt so bad about losing the money said sam artfully now this story was on the whole very well got up it did not do credit to sams principles but it did do credit to his powers of invention it might be true there are such men as pickpockets to be found riding in our city horsecars as possibly some of my readers may have occasion to know as yet dr graham did not doubt the story of his young assistant sam came very near getting off scotfree but for your carelessness this money would not have been lost said his employer you ought to make up the loss to me i havent got any money said sam a sudden thought came to dr graham empty your pockets he said how lucky i put the bills in my stocking thought sam he turned out his pockets disclosing fifty cents it was friday and tomorrow his weekly wages would come due thats all ive got he said twenty dollars is five weeks salary said dr graham you ought to work for me five weeks without pay id starve to death said sam in alarm i wouldnt be able to buy anything to eat i can keep back part of your salary then said his employer it is only proper that you should suffer for your negligence at this moment a friend of the doctors entered the office what is the matter he asked dr graham explained briefly perhaps said the visitor i can throw some light upon your loss you how i happened to be coming over from brooklyn an hour since on the same boat with that young man there he said quietly sam turned pale there was something in the speakers tone that frightened him chapter xxv brought to justice sam would have been glad to leave the office but he knew that to ask would be to subject him to increased suspicion besides the stranger might not be intending to accuse him dr grahams attention was excited and he asked do you know anything of this matter mr clement yes doctor as i said i was on board the brooklyn ferry with this young man and a friend of his whom i believe he addressed as jim i heard them talk being in the next seat about money and something was said about concealment my curiosity was aroused and i made up my mind to follow them after they left the boat he knows all about it thought sam i wish i hadnt come back go on said dr graham eying sam sternly as he spoke you followed the boys yes they made their way to the end of a pier where this young man of yours slipped off his stockings and as well as i could tell for i was watching at a distance concealed some bills in them and afterwards drew them on again it struck me at once that if the money had been honestly come by they wouldnt have been so anxious to secrete it sam said the doctor sternly what have you to say to this charge it was my money stammered sam what did you put it in your stockings for jim told me how dangerous it was to carry it round in my pocket loose so as i hadnt any pocketbook i put it in my stockings very probable indeed suppose you take off your stockings sam had decided objections to this but he saw that it would be of no use to urge them and slowly and reluctantly complied now put in your hand and take out the money sam did so the doctor counted the bills here are only nine dollars he said take out the rest there isnt any more said sam dont attempt to deceive me said his employer sternly it will be the worse for you if you do there isnt any more persisted sam earnestly if you dont believe it you may look yourself dr graham did so and found the statement correct there were twenty dollars in the letter he said sternly what has become of the other eleven there was no use in persisting in denial further and sam made a virtue of necessity jim got half the money he confessed whos jim jim nolan how came he to get half the money did you owe it to him for the first time it struck sam that he had been a fool to give away ten dollars without adequate return all that jim had given him was bad advice which is never worth taking i dont know how i came to give it to him said sam it was he who wanted me to take the money i wouldnt have done it but for jim it strikes me said mr clement that jim is not a very desirable companion so you gave him ten dollars yes sir did you spend any of the money asked dr graham yes sir in what way i went in with jim and played a game of billiards paying for the game with my money yes sir what else jim took me into a drinkingplace and treated me to a whiskeypunch also with my money i suppose yes sir he wanted to get the tendollar bill changed was this in brooklyn or new york in brooklyn upon my word very well planned so you expected me to believe your story about having your pocket picked did you yes sir a pretty story mr clement said the doctor turning to his friend what would you advise me to do arrest the boy oh dont implored sam turning pale ill never do it again you wont have the chance said the doctor drily if you ask my advice said mr clement i will give it i suspect this jim is the worse boy of the two now hes got ten dollars of your money yes sir do you mean to let him keep it hes spent part of it by this time you can get the rest back how i dont know the boy you know his name the superintendent of the newsboys lodging house could probably put you on his track besides your boy here can help you i dont know but you are right sam said mr clement are you willing to help dr graham get back his money i dont like to get jim into a scrape said sam it seems hes got you into a scrape it is your only chance of escaping being sent to blackwells island will jim be sent there that depends on the doctor if this jim will give back what he has of the money you gave him and agree to give back the rest as soon as he earns it i think the doctor will let him off then ill do what i can said sam as for you said the doctor i shall retain these nine dollars also the four i was to have paid you tomorrow if i get back the full amount from your confederate i will pay you the difference now how can you get at this jim hell be somewhere around city hall park said sam you may go in search of him tell him to come to this office with you if he dont come he will be arrested and i will have no mercy upon him if you undertake to play me false the same fate awaits you dont be afraid said sam ill come back honor bright do you think he will asked dr graham turning to mr clement yes for he knows it wouldnt be safe for him to stay away go away then and come back as soon as possible sam made all haste to the city hall park where he expected to find jim he was not disappointed jim was sitting on one of the steps of the city hall smoking a cigar he had the air of a gentleman of leisure and independent income with no cares to disturb or harass him he did not see sam till the latter called him by name whered you come from sam he asked placidly from the office did the boss make a row about the money you bet he did ho didnt find out did he yes he did jim looked up now he dont know anything about me does he he inquired i had to tell him thats mean exclaimed jim youd ought to be ashamed to tell on a friend i had to there was a chap a friend of the doctors that was on the boat and heard us talkin about the money he followed us and saw me stuff the money in my stockin jim indulged in a profane ejaculation whats he goin to do about it he asked hes made me give up the money and hes sent me for you i wont go said jim hastily youd better if you dont youll be took up what am i to go to the office for asked jim rather startled to give up the money ive spent two dollars if you give up whats left and agree to pay the rest hell let you off did he say so yes he told me so if there had been any hope of escaping with the money jim would have declined calling on dr graham but of that he knew there was little chance indeed he was not altogether unknown to the police having on two or three previous occasions come under their notice so considerably less cheerful than before he accompanied sam to the office is this the boy asked the doctor surveying sams companion attentively yes sir i am glad to see you young man said the doctor drily suppose we settle money matters first of all how much have you left jim drew out eight dollars in bills so far so good you owe me two dollars yes sir i wont ask for your note of hand im afraid i couldnt negotiate it but i expect you to pay me back the balance by instalments if not i shall know where to lay hold of you jim had nothing to say now you can go sam you can stay i suppose hes goin to send me off thought sam you may stay till tomorrow night sam said the doctor and i will pay you what balance i owe you after that i think we had better part company you are a little too enterprising for me sam made no objection in fact he had got tired of the confinement and thought it would be an agreeable variety to return to his old life again the next evening therefore he retired from professional life and with a balance of fifty cents in his possession set up once more as a street vagabond when jim nolan paid up his indebtedness he would be entitled to two dollars more until then he was held for the debt of his confederate chapter xxvi pipkins diningrooms sunday is a dull day with the streetboys whatever their business may be the bootblacks lose least but if the day be unpropitious their earnings are small on such a day the newsboys lodge is a great resource it supplies all that a boy actually needs lodging and two meals for the small sum of eighteen cents and in cases of need will trust boys to that amount sam naturally had recourse to this hold on finding himself out of a situation he had enough to pay his expenses and did not feel compelled to go to work till monday monday morning however the reduced state of his finances compelled him to look for employment if he had had a little capital he might have set up as a newsboy or bootblack but five cents can hardly be considered sufficient capital for either of these lines of business credit is the next best thing to capital but sam had no credit he found that out after an ineffectual attempt to borrow money of a bootblack who having ten dollars in a savingsbank was regarded in his own class with high respect as a wealthy capitalist the name of this exceptional young man was william clark better known among the boys as ready money bill when twelve oclock came and sam had earned nothing he bethought himself of bill the capitalist bill he said i want to borrer a dollar you do said bill sharply what for to set me up in business what business evenin papers havent you got no stamps no what have you been doin ive been in an office why didnt you stay the boss thought he wouldnt need me no longer i see said bill nodding you got sacked not exactly same thing will you lend me the money id never get it back agin yes you would i dunno about that whered you get money to pay me back the boss owes me two dollars why dont he pay you one of my friends cheated him out of it and he wont pay me till its paid back may be he wont pay it back yes he will will you lend me the money no i wont youd ought to have saved money like i have id have had two dollars if jim hadnt stolen money that aint my fault i aint goin to lose my money for you you can save like i do bill was right no doubt he was a bee and sam was a drone and the drones are always ready to avail themselves of the accumulations of their more industrious brothers sam began to feel hungry however irregular he might be in other ways his appetite was surprisingly regular he paused in front of a restaurant and looked wistfully in at the windows i wish i was a waiter he thought they have all they want to eat every day it will be seen that sams ambition was not a lofty one but then he was practical enough to see that three square meals a day are more to be desired than empty fame as he was standing at the window a man from within came to the door being without a hat sam supposed him to be connected with the restaurant as indeed he was sam drew back supposing that he was to be sent off but here he was mistaken come here johnny said the proprietor for it was the owner of the restaurant who addressed our hero sam approached wondering have you had dinner no said sam promptly would you like some sams answer in the affirmative was equally prompt but you havent any money eh thats so said sam wonder how he found out he thought we dont give away dinners but you can earn one said mr pipkin for it was pipkins restaurant do you want me for a waiter asked sam hopefully no you wouldnt do you havent had experience i want a boy to distribute handbills in front of the saloon can you do that yes i can said sam eagerly ive done that before all right come in sam entered he hoped that a preliminary dinner would be offered him but mr pipkin was not in the habit of paying in advance and perhaps he was right he brought forward a pile of circulars about the same size as dr grahams and handed them to sam ive just opened a new saloon he said and i want to invite the patronage of the public stand here and distribute these to the passersby all right said sam when will you give me some dinner in about an hour this is the time when people generally dine and i want to catch as many as i can sam read one of the circulars rapidly this is the way it read pipkins diningrooms unsurpassed for the excellence of cookery and the cheapness of prices call once and you will be sure to come again im goin to come once and ill call again if theyll let me said sam to himself in about an hour he was called in the customers had thinned out but there were a few at the tables sam was directed to sit down at a table in the back part of the room now then said the waiter hurry up young un and tell us what you want roast turkey and cranberry sauce ordered sam all out try again was the laconic reply roast chicken thats all out too sam looked disappointed oyster stew all out is everything out no theres some roast veal unless you prefer hash i dont like hash said sam decidedly bring on your veal and dont forget the potatoes and some bread and butter youve got a healthy appetite said the waiter you bet i have and ive a right to it ive earned my dinner and i want it the articles he had ordered were brought and he attacked them with vigor then he called for a second course a piece of mincepie all out said the waiter applepie thats out i guess your customers all had healthy appetites today said sam bring on something or other and mind you bring enough of it a plate of ricepudding was set before him and speedily appropriated he tried to get a second plate but his application was unsuccessful he was given to understand that he was entitled to only one plate and was forced to rise from the table not wholly satisfied chapter xxvii conclusion sam did not retain his new position long a week later he was dismissed though no reason was assigned the proprietor probably thought it better to engage a boy with a smaller appetite but sam was by no means discouraged he was more selfreliant than when nearly a year before he entered the city and more confident of rubbing along somehow if he could not sell papers he could black boots if wholly without capital he could haunt the neighborhood of the piers and seek employment as a baggagesmasher for the next two years it will be unnecessary to detail sams experiences they did not differ materially from those of other streetboys now a day of plenty now of want now a stroke of luck which made him feel rich as a millionnaire now a season of bad fortune day by day and week by week his recollections of his country home became more vague and he could hardly realize that he had ever lived anywhere else than in the streets of new york it was at this time that the unexpected encounter with deacon hopkins brought back the memories of his early life and led him to contrast them curiously with his present experiences there did not seem much for sam to be proud of ragged vagabond as he was but for all that he looked down upon his former self with ineffable contempt what a greenhorn i was when i first came to the city he reflected how easy i was took in i didnt know nothin about life then how sick i was when i smoked my first cigar now i can smoke half a dozen one after the other only i cant raise the stamps to buy em how i fooled the deacon though and sam laughed in hearty enjoyment of the joke i wonder whatll he say of me when he gets back sam plunged his hands deep down into his pockets there was nothing to hinder for as usual they were empty he had spent the small amount obtained from the deacon and he was just even with the world he had neither debts nor assets he had only daily recurring wants and these he was not always able to supply it was in the afternoon of the day made memorable by his interview with the deacon that another adventure befell sam as it exhibits him in a more favorable light than usual i am glad to chronicle it he was lounging about waiting for something to turn up when he felt a little hand slipped into his and heard a small voice pleading take me home im lost sam looked down in surprise to find his hand clasped by a little boy apparently about four years of age what attracted him to sam is uncertain possibly his face seemed familiar to the little boy whats your name johnny asked sam gently my name aint johnny its bertie said the little boy whats your other name dalton bertie dalton yes i want to go home so you shall said sam goodnaturedly if youll tell me where you live dont you know asked bertie no i thought you did said bertie disappointed i want to go home to mamma sam was puzzled how did you come to be lost he asked i went out with marie thats the nurse and when she was talking with another nurse i went to play then i couldnt find her and im so frightened dont be frightened bertie said sam gently for his heart was drawn to the little fellow i guess ill find your home let me guess do you live in twentieth street bertie shook his head where were you playing in the park it must be union park thought sam an idea struck him he went into a neighboring druggists and asking for a directory turned to the list of daltons there was only one living near union park this one lived on fourteenth street between sixth and seventh avenues sam decided to take the child into this street and see if he recognized it the experiment proved successful arrived in the street the child cried joyfully this is where i live can you find the house yes its right on said bertie in brief sam took bertie home he found the family in great distress the nurse had returned and declared incoherently that master bertie had been carried off and she couldnt find him anywhere a message was about to be sent to the police when the young truant was brought home the mother clasped him fondly in her arms and kissed him many times then she bethought herself of sam how can i thank you she said gratefully for bringing my darling home oh its nothing said sam i was afraid at first i couldnt find where he lived but he told me his name and i looked in the directory mrs dalton saw that sam was ragged and her grateful heart prompted her to do something for him have you any place she asked no said sam wouldnt you like one yes i should said sam promptly its hard work getting a living about the streets it must be said the lady with sympathy have you no friends none except poor boys like i am you have been kind to my dear bertie and i want to do something to show my gratitude without you i shudder to think what might have become of him nobodyd hurt a little chap like him said sam they might steal him said mrs dalton have you had any dinner no maam come into the house maggie see that this boy has a good meal take care of him till mr dalton comes home then i will see what can be done for him all right mum sam had no objections to this arrangement he was never at a loss for an appetite and the prospect was an attractive one he made himself at home in the kitchen where his rescue of little bertie and the evident favor of mrs dalton made him the recipient of much attention he felt that he was in luck for once in his life and was convinced of it when on the arrival of mr dalton he was offered the post of errandboy at five dollars a week with a present of five dollars in advance he asked no time for consideration but accepted at once you may report for service tomorrow morning said mr dalton there is my businesscard can you find it i know where it is said sam ill be there sams chance had come he was invited to fill an humble but respectable position would he give satisfaction or drift back after a while to his vagabond habits young outlaw as he had been was he likely to grow into an orderly member of society if any of my readers are curious on this subject they are referred to the next volume of this series entitled sams chance and how he improved it
