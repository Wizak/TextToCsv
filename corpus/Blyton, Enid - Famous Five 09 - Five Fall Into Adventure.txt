 chapter one at kirrin cottage again georgina was at the station to meet her three cousins timmy her dog was with her his long tail wagging eagerly he knew quite well they had come to meet julian dick and anne and he was glad it was much more fun when the five were all together here comes the train timmy said george nobody called her georgina because she wouldnt answer if they did she looked like a boy with her short curly hair and her shorts and opennecked shirt her face was covered with freckles and her legs and arms were as brown as a gipsys there was the faroff rumble of a train and as it came nearer a short warning hoot timmy whined and wagged his tail he didnt like trains but he wanted this one to come nearer and nearer it came slowing down as it reached kirrin station long before it came to the little platform three heads appeared out of one of the windows and three hands waved wildly george waved back her face one big smile the door swung open almost before the train stopped out came a big boy and helped down a small girl then came another boy not quite so tall as the first one with a bag in each hand he dragged a third bag out and then george and timmy were on him julian dick anne your trains late we thought you were never coming hallo george here we are at last get down timmy dont eat me hallo george oh timmy you darling youre just as licky as ever woof said timmy joyfully and bounded all round like a mad thing getting into everybodys way any trunk or anything asked george only those three bags well we havent come for long this time worse luck said dick only a fortnight still its better than nothing you shouldnt have gone off to france all those six weeks said george halfjealously i suppose youve gone all french now dick laughed waved his hands in the air and went off into a stream of quick french that sounded just like gibberish to george french was not one of her strong subjects shut up she said giving him a friendly shove youre just the same old idiot oh im so glad youve come its been lonely and dull at kirrin without you a porter came up with a barrow dick turned to him waved his hands again and addressed the astonished man in fluent french but the porter knew dick quite well go on with you he said argybargying in doubledutch like that do you want me to wheel these up to kirrin cottage for you yes please said anne stop it dick it isnt funny when you go on so long oh let him go on said george and she linked her arms in annes and dicks its lovely to have you again mothers looking forward to seeing you all i bet uncle quentin isnt said julian as they went along the little platform timmy capering round them fathers in quite a good temper said george you know hes been to america with mother lecturing and hearing other scientists lecturing too mother says everyone made a great fuss of him and he liked it georges father was a brilliant scientist wellknown all over the world but he was rather a difficult man at home impatient hottempered and forgetful the children were fond of him but held him in great respect they all heaved a sigh of relief when he went away for a few days for then they could make as much noise as they liked tear up and down the stairs play silly jokes and generally be as mad as they pleased will uncle quentin be at home all the time were staying with you asked anne she was really rather afraid of her hottempered uncle no said george mother and father are going away for a tour in spain so well be on our own wizard said dick we can wear our bathing costumes all day long then if we want to and timmy can come in at mealtimes without being sent out whenever he moves said george hes been sent out every single mealtime this week just because he snapped at the flies that came near him father goes absolutely mad if timmy suddenly snaps at a fly shame said anne and patted timmys roughhaired back you can snap at every single fly you like timmy when were on our own woof said timmy gratefully there wont be time for any adventure these hols said dick regretfully as they walked down the lane to kirrin cottage red poppies danced along the way and in the distance the sea shone as blue as cornflowers only two weeks and back we go to school well lets hope the weather keeps fine i want to bathe six times a day soon they were all sitting round the teatable at kirrin cottage and their aunt fanny was handing round plates of her nicest scones and teacake she was very pleased to see her nephews and niece again now george will be happy she said smiling at the hungry four shes been going about like a bear with a sore head the last week or two have another scone dick take two while youre about it good idea said dick and helped himself nobody makes scones and cakes like you do aunt fanny wheres uncle quentin in his study said his aunt he knows its teatime and hes heard the bell but i expect hes buried in something or other ill have to fetch him in a minute i honestly believe hed go without food all day long if i didnt go and drag him into the diningroom here he is said julian hearing the familiar impatient footsteps coming down the hall to the diningroom the door was flung open uncle quentin stood there a newspaper in his hand scowling he didnt appear to see the children at all look here fanny he shouted see what theyve put in this paper the very thing i gave orders was not to be put in the dolts the idiots the quentin whatevers the matter said his wife look here are the children theyve just arrived but uncle quentin simply didnt see any of the four children at all he went on glaring at the paper he rapped at it with his hand now well get the place full of reporters wanting to see me and wanting to know all about my new ideas he said beginning to shout see what theyve said this eminent scientist conducts all his experiments and works out all his ideas at his home kirrin cottage here are his stack of notebooks to which are now added two more fruits of his visit to america and here at his cottage are his amazing diagrams and so on and so on i tell you fanny well have hordes of reporters down no we shant dear said his wife and anyway we are soon off to spain do sit down and have some tea and look cant you say a word to welcome julian dick and anne uncle quentin grunted and sat down i didnt know they were coming he said and helped himself to a scone you might have told me fanny i told you three times yesterday and twice today said his wife anne suddenly squeezed her uncles arm she was sitting next to him youre just the same as ever uncle quentin she said you never never remember were coming shall we go away again her uncle looked down at her and smiled his temper never lasted very long he grinned at julian and dick well here you are again he said do you think you can hold the fort for me while im away with your aunt rather said all three together well keep everyone at bay said julian with timmys help ill put up a notice beware very fierce dog woof said timmy sounding delighted he thumped his tail on the floor a fly came by his nose and he snapped at it uncle quentin frowned have another scone father said george hurriedly when are you and mother going to spain tomorrow said her mother firmly now dont look like that quentin you know perfectly well its been arranged for weeks and you need a holiday and if we dont go tomorrow all our arrangements will be upset well you might have warned me it was tomorrow said her husband looking indignant i mean ive all my notebooks to check and put away and quentin ive told you heaps of times that we leave on september the third said his wife still more firmly i want a holiday too the four children will be quite all right here with timmy theyll love being on their own julian is almost grownup now and he can cope with anything that turns up timmy snapped twice at a fly and uncle quentin jumped if that dog does that again he began but his wife interrupted him at once there you see youre as touchy and nervy as can be quentin dear it will do you good to get away and the children will have a lovely two weeks on their own nothing can possibly happen so make up your mind to leave tomorrow with an easy mind nothing can possibly happen aunt fanny was wrong of course anything could happen when the five were left on their own chapter two a meeting on the beach it really was very difficult to get uncle quentin off the next day he was shut up in his study until the last possible moment sorting out his precious notebooks the taxi arrived and hooted outside the gate aunt fanny who had been ready for a long time went and rapped at the study door quentin unlock the door you really must come we shall lose the plane if we dont go now just one minute shouted back her husband aunt fanny looked at the four children in despair thats the fourth time hes called out just one minute said george the telephone shrilled out just then and she picked up the receiver yes she said no im afraid you cant see him hes off to spain and nobody will know where he is for the next two weeks whats that wait a minute ill ask my mother who is it said her mother its the daily clarion said george they want to send a reporter down to interview daddy i told them he was going to spain and they said could they publish that of course said her mother thankfully once thats in the papers nobody will ring up and worry you say yes george george said yes the taxi hooted more loudly than ever and timmy barked madly at the hooting the study door was flung open and uncle quentin stood in the doorway looking as black as thunder why cant i have a little peace and quiet when im doing important work he began but his wife made a dart at him and dragged him down the hall she put his hat in one hand and would have put his stick into the other if he hadnt been carrying a heavy despatch case youre not doing important work youre off on a holiday she said oh quentin youre worse than ever whats that case in your hand surely you are not taking work away with you the taxi hooted again and timmy woofed just behind uncle quentin he jumped violently and the telephone rang loudly thats another reporter coming down to see you father said george better go quickly whether that bit of news really did make uncle quentin decide at last to go nobody knew but in two seconds he was sitting in the taxi still clutching his despatch case telling the taxidriver exactly what he thought of people who kept hooting their horns goodbye dears called aunt fanny thankfully dont get into mischief were off at last the taxi disappeared down the lane poor mother said george its always like this when they go for a holiday well theres one thing certain i shall never marry a scientist everyone heaved a sigh of relief at the thought that uncle quentin was gone when he was overworked he really was impossible still you simply have to make excuses for anyone with a brain like his said julian whenever our science master at school speaks of him he almost holds his breath with awe worst of it is he expects me to be brilliant because ive got a brilliant uncle yes its difficult to live up to clever relations said dick well were on our own except for joan good old joan i bet shell give us some smashing meals lets go and see if shes got anything we can have now said george im hungry so am i said dick they marched down the hall into the kitchen calling for joan now you dont need to tell me what youve come for said joan the smiling goodtempered cook and i dont need to tell you this the larders locked oh joan what a mean thing to do said dick mean or not its the only thing to do when all four of you are around to say nothing of that great hungry dog said joan rolling out some pastry vigorously why last holidays i left a meat pie and half a tongue and a cherry tart and trifle sitting on the shelves for the next days meals and when i came back from my halfdays outing there wasnt a thing to be seen well we thought youd left them there for our supper said julian sounding quite hurt all right but you wont get the chance of thinking anything like that again said joan firmly that larder doors going to be kept locked maybe ill unlock it sometimes and hand you out a snack or two but im the one thats going to unlock it not you the four drifted out of the kitchen again disappointed timmy followed at their heels lets go down and have a bathe said dick if im going to have six bathes a day id better hurry up and have my first one ill get some ripe plums said anne we can take those down with us and i expect the icecream man will come along to the beach too we shant starve and wed better wear our shirts and shorts over our bathing costumes so we dont catch too much sun soon they were all down on the sand they found a good place and scraped out comfortable holes to sit in timmy scraped his own i cant imagine why timmy bothers to scrape one said george because he always squeezes into mine sooner or later dont you timmy timmy wagged his tail and scraped so violently that they were all covered with sand pooh said anne spitting sand out of her mouth stop it timmy as fast as i scrape my hole you fill it up timmy paused to give her a lick and then scraped again making a very deep hole indeed he lay down in it panting his mouth looking as if he were smiling hes smiling again said anne i never knew a dog that smiled like timmy timmy its nice to have you again woof said timmy politely meaning that it was nice to have anne and the others back again too he wagged his tail and sent a shower of sand over dick they all wriggled down comfortably into their soft warm holes well eat the plums first and then well have a bathe said dick chuck me one anne two people came slowly along the beach dick looked at them out of halfclosed eyes a boy and a man and what a ragamuffin the boy looked he wore tom dirty shorts and a filthy jersey no shoes at all the man looked even worse he slouched as he came and dragged one foot he had a straggly moustache and mean clever little eyes that raked the beach up and down the two were walking at highwater mark and were obviously looking for anything that might have been cast up by the tide the boy already had an old box one wet shoe and some wood under his arm what a pair said dick to julian i hope they dont come near us i feel as if i can smell them from here the two walked along the beach and then back then to the childrens horror they made a beeline for where they were lying in their sandy holes and sat down close beside them timmy growled an unpleasant unwashed kind of smell at once came to the childrens noses pooh timmy growled again the boy took no notice of timmys growling but the man looked uneasy come on lets have a bathe said julian annoyed at the way the two had sat down so close to them after all there was practically the whole of the beach to choose from why come and sit almost on top of somebody else when they came back from their bathe the man had gone but the boy was still there and he had actually sat himself down in georges hole get out said george shortly her temper rising at once thats my hole and you jolly well know it findings keepings said the boy in a curious singsong voice its my hole now george bent down and pulled the boy roughly out of the hole he was up in a trice his fists clenched george clenched hers too dick came up at a run now george if theres any fighting to be done ill do it he said he turned to the scowling boy clear off we dont want you here the boy hit out with his right fist and caught dick unexpectedly on the jawbone dick looked astounded he hit out too and sent the tousleheaded boy flying yah coward said the boy holding his chin tenderly hitting someone smaller than yourself ill fight that first boy but i wont fight you you cant fight him said dick hes a girl you cant fight girls and girls oughtnt to fight anyway ses you said the dirty little ragamuffin standing up and doubling his fists again well you look here im a girl too so i can fight her all right cant i george and the ragamuffin stood scowling at one another each with fists clenched they looked so astonishingly alike with their short curly hair brown freckled faces and fierce expressions that julian suddenly roared with laughter he pushed them firmly apart fighting forbidden he said he turned ta the ragamuffin clear off he ordered do you hear me go on off with you the gipsylike girl stared at him then she suddenly burst into tears and ran off howling shes a girl all right said dick grinning at the howls shes got some spunk though facing up to me like that well thats the last well see of her but he was wrong it wasnt chapter three face at the window the five curled up in their holes once more dick felt his jawbone that ragamuffin of a girl gave me a good bang he said halfadmiringly little demon isnt she a bit of live wire i cant see why julian wouldnt let me have a go at her said george sulkily it was my hole she sat in she meant to be annoying how dare she girls cant go about fighting said dick dont be an ass george i know you make out youre as good as a boy and you dress like a boy and climb trees as well as i can but its really time you gave up thinking youre as good as a boy this sort of speech didnt please george at all well anyway i dont burst into howls if im beaten she said turning her back on dick no you dont agreed dick youve got as much spunk as any boy much more than that other kid had im sorry i sent her flying now its the first time ive ever hit a girl and i hope itll be the last im jolly glad you hit her said george shes a nasty little beast if i see her again ill tell her what i think of her no you wont said dick not if im there anyway she had her punishment when i sent her flying do shut up arguing you two said anne and sent a shower of sand over them george dont go into one of your moods for goodness sake we dont want to waste a single day of this two weeks heres the icecream man said julian sitting up and feeling for the waterproof pocket in the belt of his bathing trunks lets have one each woof said timmy and thumped his tail on the sand yes all right one for you too said dick though what sense there is in giving you one i dont know one lick one swallow and its gone it might be a fly for all you taste of it timmy gulped his icecream down at once and then went into georges hole squeezing beside her hoping for a lick of her ice too but she pushed him away no timmy icecreams wasted on you you cant even have a lick of mine and do get back into your hole youre making me frightfully hot timmy obligingly got out and went into annes hole she gave him a little bit of her icecream he sat panting beside her looking longingly at the rest of the ice youre melting it with your hot breath said anne go into julians hole now the five of them had a thoroughly lazy morning as none of them had a watch they went in far too early for lunch and were shooed out again by joan how you can come in at ten past twelve for a one oclock lunch i dont know she scolded i havent even finished the housework yet well it felt like one oclock said anne disappointed to find there was so long to wait still when lunchtime came joan really did them well cold ham and tongue cold baked beans beetroot crisp lettuce straight from the garden heaps of tomatoes cucumber hardboiled egg recited anne in glee just the kind of meal i like said dick sitting down whats for pudding there it is on the sideboard said anne wobbly blancmange fresh fruit salad and jelly im glad im hungry now dont you give timmy any of that ham and tongue joan warned george ive got a fine bone for him coming timmy timmy knew the word bone very well indeed he trotted after joan at once his feet sounding loudly in the hall they heard joan talking kindly to him in the kitchen as she found him his bone good old joan said dick shes like timmy her bark is worse than her bite timmys got a good bite though said george helping herself to three tomatoes at once and his bite came in useful heaps of times for us they ate steadily thinking of some of the hairraising adventures they had had when timmy and his bite had certainly come in very useful timmy came in after a while licking his lips nothing doing old chap said dick looking at the empty dishes on the table dont tell me youve chomped up that bone already timmy had he lay down under the table and put his nose on his paws he was happy he had had a good meal and he was with the people he loved best he put his head as near georges feet as he could your whiskers are tickling me she said and screwed up her bare toes pass the tomatoes someone you cant manage any more tomatoes surely said anne youve had five already theyre out of my own garden said george so i can eat as many as i like after lunch they lazed on the beach till it was time for a bathe again it was a happy day for all of them warm lazy with plenty of fun and romping about george looked out for the ragamuffin girl but she didnt appear again george was half sorry she would have liked a battle of words with her even if she couldnt have a fight they were all very tired when they went to bed that night julian yawned so loudly when joan came in with a jug of hot cocoa and some biscuits that she offered to lock up the house for him oh no thank you joan said julian at once thats the mans job you know locking up the house you can trust me all right ill see to every window and every door right master julian said joan and bustled away to wind up the kitchen clock rake out the fire and go up to bed the children went up too timmy as usual at georges heels julian was left downstairs to lock up he was a very responsible boy joan knew that he wouldnt leave a single window unfastened she heard him trying to shut the little window in the pantry and she called down master julian its swollen or something and wont shut properly you neednt bother about it its too small for anyone to get into right said julian thankfully and went upstairs he yawned a terrific yawn again and set dick off too as soon as he came into the bedroom they both shared the girls undressing in the next room laughed to hear them you wouldnt hear a burglar in the middle of the night julian and dick called anne youll sleep like logs old timmy can listen out for burglars said julian cleaning his teeth vigorously thats his job not mine isnt it timmy woof said timmy clambering on to georges bed he always slept curled up in the crook of her knees her mother had given up trying to insist that george didnt have timmy on her bed at night as george said even if she agreed to that timmy wouldnt nobody stayed awake for more than five seconds nobody even said anything in bed except for a sleepy good night timmy gave a little grunt and settled down too his head on georges feet it was heavy but she liked it there she put out a hand and stroked timmy gently he licked one of her feet through the bedclothes he loved george more than anyone in the world it was dark outside that night thick clouds had come up and put out all the stars there was no sound to be heard but the wind in the trees and the distant surge of the sea and both sounded so much the same that it was hard to tell the difference not another sound not even an owl hooting to its mate or the sound of a hedgehog pattering in the ditch then why did timmy wake up why did he open first one eye and then another why did he prick up his ears and lie there listening he didnt even lift his head at first he simply lay listening in the darkness he lifted his head cautiously at last he slid off the bed as quietly as a cat he padded across the room and out of the door down the stairs he went and into the hall where his claws rattled on the tiled floor but nobody heard him everyone in the house was fast asleep timmy stood and listened in the hall he knew he had heard something could it have been a rat somewhere timmy lifted his nose and sniffed and then he stiffened from head to tail and stood as if turned into stone something was climbing up the wall of the house scrape scrape scrape rustle rustle would a rat dare to do that upstairs in her bed anne didnt know why she suddenly woke up just then but she did she was thirsty and she thought she would get a drink of water she felt for her torch and switched it on the light fell on the window first and anne saw something that gave her a terrible shock she screamed loudly and dropped her torch in fright george woke up at once timmy came bounding up the stairs julian wailed anne come quickly i saw a face at the window a horrible dreadful face looking in at me george rushed to the window switching on her torch as she did so there was nothing there timmy went with her he sniffed at the open window and growled hark i can hear someone running quickly down the path said julian who now appeared with dick come on timmy downstairs with you and after them and down they all went anne too they flung the front door wide and timmy sped out barking loudly a face at the window hed soon find out who it belonged to chapter four the next day the four children waited at the open front door listening to timmys angry excited barking anne was trembling and julian put his arm round her comfortingly what was this dreadful face like he asked her anne shivered in his arm i didnt see very much she said you see i just switched on my torch and the beam was directed on the window nearby and it lighted up the face for a second it had nasty gleaming eyes and it looked very dark perhaps it was a black mans face oh i was frightened then did it disappear asked julian i dont know said anne i was so frightened that i dropped my torch and the light went out then george woke up and rushed to the window where on earth was timmy said dick feeling suddenly surprised that timmy hadnt awakened them all by barking surely he must have heard the owner of the face climbing up to the window i dont know he came rushing into the bedroom when i screamed said anne perhaps he had heard a noise and had gone down to see what it was thats about it said julian never mind anne it was a tramp i expect he found all the doors and windows downstairs fastened and shinned up the ivy to see if he could enter by way of a bedroom timmy will get him thats certain but timmy didnt get him he came back after a time with his tail down and a puzzled look in his eyes couldnt you find him timmy asked george anxiously woof said timmy mournfully his tail still down george felt him he was wet through goodness where have you been to get so wet she said in surprise feel him dick dick felt him and so did the others hes been in the sea said julian thats why hes wet i guess the burglar or whatever he was must have sprinted down to the beach when he knew timmy was after him and jumped into a boat it was his only chance of getting away and timmy must have swum after him till he couldnt keep up any more said george poor old tim so you lost him did you timmy wagged his tail a little he looked very downhearted indeed to think he had heard noises and thought it was a rat and now whoever it was had got away from him timmy felt ashamed julian shut and bolted the front door he put up the chain too i dont think the face will come back again in a hurry he said now he knows theres a big dog here hell keep away i dont think we need worry any more they all went back to bed again julian didnt go to sleep for some time although he had told the others not to worry he felt worried himself he was sorry that anne had been frightened and somehow the boldness of the burglar in climbing up to a bedroom worried him too he must have been determined to get in somehow joan the cook slept through all the disturbance julian wouldnt wake her no he said dont tell her anything about it shed want to send telegrams to uncle quentin or something so joan knew nothing about the nights happenings and they heard her cheerfully humming in the htchen the next morning as she cooked bacon and eggs and tomatoes for their breakfast anne was rather ashamed of herself when she woke up and remembered the fuss she had made the face was rather dim in her memory now she half wondered if she had dreamed it all she asked julian if he thought she might have had a bad dream quite likely said julian cheerfully very glad that anne should think this more than likely i wouldnt worry about it any more if i were you he didnt tell anne that he had examined the thicklygrowing ivy outside the window and had found clear traces of the nightclimber part of the sturdy clinging ivystem had come away from the wall and beneath the window were strewn brokenoff ivy leaves julian showed them to dick there was somebody he said what a nerve he had climbing right up to the window like that a real catburglar there were no footprints to be seen anywhere in the garden julian didnt expect to find any for the ground was dry and hard the day was very fine and warm again i vote we do what we did yesterday go off to the beach and bathe said dick we might take a picnic lunch if joan will give us one ill help her to make it up for us said anne and she and george went off to beg for sandwiches and buns soon they were busy wrapping up a colossal lunch do for twelve i should think said joan with a laugh heres a bottle of homemade lemonade too you can take as many ripe plums as you like as well i shant prepare any supper for you tonight youll not need it after all this lunch george and anne looked at her in alarm no supper then they caught the twinkle in her eye and laughed well make all the beds and do our rooms before we go said anne and is there anything you want from the village no not today you hurry up with your jobs and get along to the beach said joan ill be quite glad of a peaceful day to myself i shall turn out the larder and the hall cupboards and the scullery and enjoy myself in peace anne seemed quite to have forgotten her fright of the night before as they went down to the beach that day chattering and laughing together even if she had thought about it something soon happened that swept everything else from her mind the little ragamuffin girl was down on the beach again she was alone her dreadful old father or whatever he was was not there george saw the girl first and scowled julian saw the scowl and then the girl and made up his mind at once he led the others firmly to where rocks jutted up from the beach surrounded by limpid rockpools well be here today he said its so hot well be glad of the shade from the rocks what about just here its all right said george half sulky and half amused at julian for being so firm about things dont worry im not having anything more to do with that smelly girl im glad to hear it said julian they had now turned a corner and were out of sight of the girl big rocks ran in an upwards direction behind them and jutted up all around them julian sat down in a lovely little corner with rocks protecting them from the sun and the wind lets have a read before we bathe said dick ive got a mystery story here i simply must find out who the thief is he settled himself comfortably anne went to look for sea anemones in the pool she liked the petallike creatures that looked so like plants and werent she liked feeding them with bits of biscuit seeing their petals close over the fragment and draw them quickly inside george lay back and stroked timmy julian began to sketch the rocks around and the little pools it was all very peaceful indeed suddenly something landed on georges middle and made her jump she sat up and so did timmy what was that said george indignantly did you throw something at me dick no said dick his eyes glued to his book something else hit george on the back of the neck and she put her hand up with an exclamation whats happening whos throwing things she looked to see what had hit her lying on the sand was a small roundish thing george picked it up why its a damson stone she said and ping another one hit her on the shoulder she leapt up in a rage she could see nobody at all she waited for another damson stone to appear but none did i just wish i could draw your face george said julian with a grin i never saw such a frown in my life ooch the ooch was nothing to do with georges frown it was caused by another damson stone that caught julian neatly behind the ear he leapt to his feet too a helpless giggle came from behind a rock some way behind and above them george was up on the ledge in a second behind one of the rocks sat the ragamuffin girl her pockets were full of damsons some of them spilling out as she rolled on the rocks laughing she sat up when she saw george and grinned what do you mean throwing those stones at us demanded george i wasnt throwing them said the girl dont tell lies said george scornfully you know you were l wasnt i was just spitting them said the awful girl watch she slipped a stone into her mouth took a deep breath and then spat out the stone it flew straight at george and hit her sharply and squarely on the nose george looked so extremely surprised that dick and julian roared with laughter bet i can spit stones farther than any of you said the ragamuffin have some of my damsons and see right said dick promptly if you win ill buy you an icecream if i do you can clear off from here and not bother us any more see yes said the girl and her eyes gleamed and danced but i shall win chapter five ragamuffin jo george was most astonished at dick how very shocking to see who could spit damson stones out the farthest its all right said julian to her in a low voice you know how good dick is at that sort of game hell win and well send the girl scooting off well and truly beaten i think youre horrible dick said george in a loud voice horrible who used to spit cherrystones out and try and beat me last year said dick at once dont be so highandmighty george anne came slowly back from her pool wondering why the others were up on the rocks damson stones began to rain round her she stopped in astonishment surely surely it couldnt be the others doing that a stone hit her on her bare arm and she squealed the ragamuffin girl won handsomely she managed to get her stones at least three feet farther than dick she lay back laughing her teeth gleaming very white indeed you owe me an icecream she said in her singsong voice julian wondered if she was welsh dick looked at her marvelling that she managed to get her stones so far ill buy you the icecream dont worry he said nobodys ever beaten me before like that not even stevens a boy at school with a most enormous mouth i do think you really are dreadful said anne go and buy her the icecream and tell her to go home im going to eat it here said the girl and she suddenly looked exactly as mulish and obstinate as george did when she wanted something she didnt think she would get you look like george now said dick and immediately wished he hadnt george glared at him furious what that nasty rude tanglyhaired girl like me stormed george pooh i cant bear to go near her shut up said dick shortly the girl looked surprised what does she mean she asked dick am i nasty youre as rude as i am anyway theres an icecream man said julian afraid that the hottempered george would fly at the girl and slap her he whistled to the man who came to the edge of the rocks and handed out six icecreams here you are said julian handing one to the girl you eat that up and go they all sat and ate icecreams george still scowling timmy gulped his at once as usual look hes had all his marvelled the girl i call that a waste here boy have a bit of mine to georges annoyance timmy licked up the bit of icecream thrown to him by the girl how could timmy accept anything from her dick couldnt help being amused by this queer bold little girl with her tangled short hair and sharp darting eyes he suddenly saw something that made him feel uncomfortable on her chin the girl had a big black bruise i say said dick i didnt give you that bruise yesterday did i what bruise oh this one on my chin said the girl touching it yes thats where you hit me when you sent me flying i dont mind ive had plenty worse ones from my dad im sorry i hit you said dick awkwardly i honestly thought you were a boy whats your name jo said the girl but thats a boys name said dick sos george but you said she was a girl said jo licking the last bits of icecream from her fingers yes but george is short for georgina said anne whats jo short for dont know said jo i never heard all i know is im a girl and my name is jo its probably short for josephine said julian they all stared at the possible josephine the short name of jo certainly suited her but not the long and pretty name of josephine its really queer said anne at last but jo is awfully like you george same short curly hair only jos is terribly messy and tangly same freckles dozens of them same turnedup nose same way of sticking her chin up in the air same scowl same glare said dick george put on her fiercest glare at these remarks which she didnt like at all well all i can say i hope i havent her layers of dirt and her sm she began angrily but dick stopped her shes probably not got any soap or hairbrush or anything shed be all right cleaned up dont be unkind george george turned her back how could dick stick up for that awful girl isnt she ever going she said or is she going to park herself on us all day long ill go when i want to said jo and put on a scowl so exactly like georges that julian and dick laughed in surprise jo laughed too but george clenched her fists furiously anne looked on in distress she wished jo would go then everything would be all right again i like that dog said jo suddenly and she leaned over to where timmy lay beside george she patted him with a hand that was like a little brown paw george swung round dont touch my dog she said he doesnt like you either oh but he does said jo surprisingly all dogs like me so do cats i can make your dog come to me as easy as anything try said george scornfully he wont go to you will you tim jo didnt move she began to make a queer little whining noise down in her throat like a forlorn puppy timmy pricked up his ears at once he looked inquiringly at jo jo stopped making the noise and held out her hand timmy looked at it and turned away but when he heard the whining again he got up listening he stared intently at jo was this a kind of doggirl that she could so well speak his language jo flung herself on her face and went on with the small whining noises that sounded as if she were a small dog in pain or sorrow timmy walked over to her and sat down his head on one side puzzled then he suddenly bent down and licked the girls halfhidden face she sat up at once and put her arms round timmys neck come here timmy said george jealously timmy shook off the brown arms that held him and walked over to george at once jo laughed see i made him come to me and give me one of his best licks i can do that to any dog how can you asked dick in wonder he had never seen timmy make friends before with anyone who was disliked by george i dont know really said jo pushing back her hair again as she sat up i reckon its in the family my mother was in a circus and she trained dogs for the ring we had dozens lovely they were i loved them all where is your mother asked julian is she still in the circus no she died said jo and i left the circus with my dad weve got a caravan dad was an acrobat till he hurt his foot the four children remembered how the man had dragged his foot as he walked they looked silently at dirty little jo what a strange life she must have led shes dirty shes probably very good at telling lies and thieving but shes got pluck thought julian still ill be glad when she goes i wish i hadnt given her that awful bruise thought dick i wonder what shed be like cleaned up and brushed she looks as if a little kindness would do her good im sorry for her but i dont much like her thought anne i dont believe a word she says thought george angrily not one word shes a humbug and im ashamed of timmy for going to her i feel very cross with him wheres your father asked julian at last gone off somewhere to meet somebody said jo vaguely im glad he was in one of his tempers this morning i went and hid under the caravan there was a silence can i stay with you today till my dad comes back said jo suddenly in her singsong voice ill wash myself if you like im all alone today no we dont want you said george feeling as if she really couldnt bear jo any longer do we anne anne didnt like hurting anyone she hesitated well she said at last perhaps jo had better go yes said julian its time you scooted off now jo youve had a long time with us jo looked at dick with mournful eyes and touched the bruise on her chin as if it hurt her dick felt most uncomfortable again he looked round at the others dont you think she could stay and share our picnic he said after all she cant help being dirty and and its all right said jo suddenly scrambling up im going theres my dad they saw the man in the distance dragging his foot as he walked he caught sight of jo and gave a shrill and piercing whistle jo made a face at them all an impudent ugly insolent face i dont like you she said then she pointed at dick i only like him hes nice yah to the rest of you and off she went like a hare over the sand her bare feet hardly touching the ground what an extraordinary girl said julian l dont feel weve seen the last of her yet chapter six what happened in the night that night anne began to look rather scared as darkness fell she was remembering the face at the window it wont come again ju will it she said to her big brother half a dozen times no anne but if you like ill come and lie down on georges bed instead of george tonight and stay with you all night long said julian anne considered this and then shook her head no i think id almost rather have george and timmy i mean george and i and even you might be scared of faces but timmy wouldnt hed simply leap at them youre quite right said julian he would all right then i wont keep you company but youll see nothing whatever will happen tonight anyway if you like well all close our bedroom windows and fasten them even if we are too hot for anything then well know nobody can possibily get in so that night julian not only closed all the doors and windows downstairs as he had done the night before but he also shut and fastened all the ones upstairs what about joans window asked anne she always sleeps with it shut summer and winter said julian with a grin country folk often do they think the night airs dangerous now youve nothing at all to worry about silly so anne went to bed with her mind at rest george drew the curtains across their window so that even if the face came again they wouldnt be able to see it let timmy out for me julian will you called george anne doesnt want me to leave her even to take old timmy out for his last walk just open the door and let him out hell come in when hes ready right called julian and opened the front door timmy trotted out tail wagging he loved his last sniff round he liked to smell the trail of the hedgehog who was out on his nightrounds he liked to put his nose down a rabbithole and listen to stirrings down below and he loved to follow the meanderings of rats and mice round by the thick hedges isnt timmy in yet called george from the top of the stairs do call him ju i want to get into bed annes halfasleep already hell be in in a moment said julian who wanted to finish his book dont fuss but no timmy had appeared even when he had finished his book julian went to the door and whistled he listened for timmy to come then hearing nothing he whistled once more this time he heard the sound of pattering footsteps coming up the path to the door oh there you are tim said julian what have you been up to chasing rabbits or something timothy wagged his tail feebly he didnt jump up at julian as he usually did you look as if youve been up to some mischief tim said julian go on up to bed with you and mind you bark if you hear the smallest sound in the night woof said timmy in rather a subdued voice and went upstairs he climbed on to georges bed and sighed heavily what a sigh said george and what have you been eating timmy pooh youve dug up some frightful old bone i know you have ive a good mind to push you off my bed i suppose you suddenly remembered one you buried months ago pooh timmy wouldnt be pushed off the bed he settled down to sleep his nose on georges feet as usual he snored a little and woke george in about half an hour shut up timmy she said pushing him with her feet anne woke up alarmed what is it george she whispered her heart thumping nothing only timmy snoring hark at him he wont stop said george irritated wake up timmy and stop snoring timmy moved sleepily and settled down again he stopped snoring and george and anne fell sound asleep julian woke once thinking he heard something fall but hearing timmy gently snoring again through the open doors of the two rooms he lay down his mind at rest if the noise had really been a noise timmy would have heard it no doubt about that george always said that timmy slept with one ear open julian heard nothing more till joan went downstairs at seven oclock he heard her go into the kitchen and do something to the kitchen grate he turned over and fell asleep again he was wakened suddenly twenty minutes later by loud screams from downstairs he sat up and then leapt out of bed at once he rushed downstairs dick followed him look at this the masters study turned upside down those drawers ransacked the safes open too mercy me whos been here in the night with all the doors locked and bolted too joan wailed loudly and wrung her hands as she gazed at the untidy room i say said dick horrified someones been searching for something pretty thoroughly even got the safe open and wrenched the drawers out how did he get in said julian feeling bewildered he went round the house looking at doors and windows except for the kitchen door which joan said she had unlocked and unbolted herself as soon as she came down not a window or door had been touched all were fastened securely anne came down looking scared whats the matter she said but julian brushed her aside how did that burglar get in that was what he wanted to know through one of the upstairs windows he supposed one that somebody had opened last night after he had fastened it perhaps in the girls room but no not one window was open all were fastened securely including joans then a thought struck him as he looked into georges room why hadnt timmy barked after all there must have been quite a bit of noise however quiet the thief had been he had himself heard something and had awakened why hadnt timmy then george was trying to pull timmy off the bed ju ju theres something wrong with timmy he wont wake up she cried hes breathing so heavily too just listen to him and whats the matter downstairs whats happened julian told her shortly while he examined timmy somebody got in last night your fathers studys in the most awful mess absolutely ransacked from top to bottom safe and all goodness knows how the fellow got in to do it how awful said george looking very pale and now somethings wrong with tim he didnt wake up last night when the burglar came hes ill julian no hes not hes been doped said julian pulling back timmys eyelids so thats why he was so long outside last night somebody gave him some meat or something with dope in some kind of drug and he ate it and slept so soundly that he never heard a thing and isnt even awake yet oh julian will he be all right asked george anxiously stroking timmys motionless body but how could he take any food from a stranger in the night maybe he picked it up the burglar may have flung it down hoping that timmy would eat it said julian now i understand why he looked so sheepish when he came in he didnt even jump up and lick me oh dear timmy do do wake up begged poor george and she shook the big dog gently he groaned a little and snuggled down again leave him said julian hell be all right hes not poisoned only drugged come down and see the damage george was horrified at the state of her fathers study they were after his two special books of american notes im sure they were she said father said that any other country in the world would be glad to have those whatever are we to do better get in the police said julian gravely we cant manage this sort of thing ourselves and do you know your fathers address in spain no wailed george he and mother said they were going to have a real holiday this time no letters to be forwarded and no address left till they had been settled somewhere for a few days then theyd telegraph it well well certainly have to get the police in then said julian looking rather white and stern george glanced at him he seemed suddenly very grownup indeed she watched him go out of the room he went into the hall and rang up the police station joan was very relieved yes get in the police thats what we ought to do she said theres that nice constable wilkins and that other one with the red face whats he called mr donaldson ill be making some coffee for them when they come she cheered up considerably at the thought of handing out cups of her good hot coffee to two interested policemen who would ask her plenty of questions that she would be only too delighted to answer she bustled off to the kitchen the four children stared silently at the ruins of the study what a mess could it ever be cleared up nobody would know what was gone till uncle quentin came back how furious he would be i hope nothing very important has been taken said dick it looks as if somebody knew there was something valuable here and meant to get it and has probably got it said julian hallo that must be the police come on i can see it will be a long time before we get our breakfast this morning chapter seven policemen in the house the police were very very thorough the children got tired of them long before lunchtime joan didnt she made them cups of coffee and put some of her homemade buns on a plate and sent anne to pick up ripe plums she felt proud to think that it was she who had discovered the ransacked study there were two policemen one was a sergeant rather solemn and very correct he interviewed each of the children and asked them exactly the same questions the other man went over the study bit by bit very thoroughly indeed looking for fingerprints i suppose said anne oh dear when can we go and bathe the thing that puzzled everyone the police included was how did the thief or thieves get in both policemen went round the house slowly and deliberately trying every door and window still locked or fastened they stood and looked at the pantry window for some time got in there i suppose said one of them must have been as small as a monkey then said the other he turned to anne who was the smallest of the four children could you squeeze through there missy do you think no said anne but ill try if you like so she tried but she stuck fast before she got even halfway through and julian had to pull hard to get her down again have you any idea what has been stolen sir the sergeant asked julian who seemed extraordinarily grownup that morning no sergeant none of us has said julian not even george here who knows her fathers work better than any of us the only thing we know is that my uncle went to america to lecture a short time ago and he brought back two notebooks full of valuable diagrams and notes he did say that other countries might be very glad to get hold of those i expect they were in that safe well theyll certainly be gone then said the sergeant shutting his own fat notebook with a snap pity when people leave such things in an ordinary safe and then go off without leaving an address cant we possibly get in touch with him this may be terribly important i know said julian looking worried we shall have an address in a day or two but i honestly dont see how we can get in touch before then right said the sergeant well well go now but well bring back a photographer with us after lunch to photograph the room then your cook can tidy it up i know shes longing to coming back again said anne when the two men had solemnly walked down the path mounted very solidlooking bicycles and gone sailing down the lane good gracious have we got to answer questions all over again well well go down to the beach and take a boat and go rowing said julian with a laugh well be out of reach then i dont see that we can give them any more help i must say its all very peculiar i wish to goodness i knew how the thief got in george had been very quiet and subdued all the morning she had worried about timmy fearing that he had been poisoned and not merely drugged as julian had said but timmy was now quite recovered except that he seemed a bit sleepy still and not inclined to gambol round in his usual ridiculous way he looked extremely sheepish too i cant think why timmy looks like that said george puzzled he usually only puts that look on when hes done something hes ashamed of or got into mischief he couldnt possibly know could he that whatever he picked up and ate last night was something he shouldnt eat no said dick hes sensible though i think not to touch poisoned meat but he couldnt know if some harmless sleeping powder had been put into anything it might have no smell and no taste perhaps hes just ashamed of being so sleepy if only hed been awake groaned george he would have heard any noise downstairs at once and hed have barked and waked us all and flown downstairs himself to attack whoever was there why oh why didnt i take him out myself last night as i usually do it was a chapter of accidents said julian you didnt take him out so he was alone and it happened that someone was waiting there with drugged food which he either found or took from the thief no said george timmy would never never take anything from someone he didnt know ive always taught him that well he got it somehow and slept through the very night he should have been awake said julian what im so afraid of george is that the thieves have got your fathers two american notebooks they seem to have left most of the stuff piles and piles of books of all kinds filled with your fathers tiny handwriting joan came in to say lunch was ready she told the children that the policemen had eaten every one of her homemade buns she still felt important and excited and was longing to get out to the village and tell everyone the news youd better stay in and give the policemen a good tea said julian theyre coming back with a photographer then id better do another baking said joan pleased yes make one of your chocolate cakes said anne oh do you think theyd like one said joan not for them joan for us of course said george dont waste one of your marvellous chocolate cakes on policemen can you make us up a picnic tea were fed up with being indoors were going out in a boat joan packed them a good tea after they had had their lunch and they all set off before the police came back timmy was much less sleepy now and did a little caper round them as they walked to the beach george brightened up at once hes getting better she said timmy i simply shant let you out of my sight now if anyones going to dope you again theyll have to do it under my very nose they had a lovely time out in georges boat they went halfway to kirrin island and bathed from the boat diving in and having swimming races till they were tired out timmy joined them though he couldnt swim nearly as fast as they could he doesnt really swim said anne he just tries to run through the water i wish hed let me ride on his back like a seadog but he always slips away under me when i try they got back about six oclock to find that the policemen had eaten the whole of the chocolate cake that joan had made besides an extraordinary amount of scones and buns also the study was now tidied up and a man had come to mend the safe everything was safely back there though the police had told joan that if there was anything of real value it should be handed to them till georges father came back but we dont know which of all those papers are valuable said julian well well have to wait till uncle quentin cables us and that may not be for days anyway i dont expect well be worried by the thief again hes got what he wanted the exciting happenings of the day had made them all tired except julian im off to bed said dick about nine oclock anne why dont you go you look fagged out yes i will said anne coming george im going to take timmy out for his last walk said george i shall never let him go out alone at night again come on timmy if you want to go to bed ill lock up the front door ju right said julian ill go up in a minute i dont fancy staying down here by myself tonight ill fasten everything and lock up except the front door dont forget to put up the chain too george though im pretty certain we dont need to expect any more burglaries or faces at the window said anne at once no said julian there wont be any more of those either good night anne sleep well anne and dick went upstairs julian finished the paper be was reading and then got up to go round the house and lock up joan was already upstairs dreaming of policemen eating her chocolate cakes george went out with timmy he ran eagerly to the gate and then set off down the lane for his usual night walk with george at a gate in the lane he suddenly stood still and growled as if he saw something unusual silly timmy said george coming up its only somebody camping in a caravan havent you seen a caravan before stop growling they went on timmy sniffing into every rathole and rabbithole enjoying himself thoroughly george was enjoying the walk too she didnt hurry julian could always go up to bed if he didnt want to wait julian did go up to bed he left the front door ajar and went yawning upstairs suddenly feeling sleepy he got into bed quietly and quickly seeing that dick was already asleep he lay awake listening for george when he was half asleep he heard the front door shut there she is he thought and turned over to go to sleep but it wasnt george her bed was empty all that night and nobody knew not even anne george and timmy didnt come back chapter eight where can george be anne woke up in the night feeling thirsty she whispered across the room george are you awake there was no answer so very cautiously and quietly anne got herself a drink from the decanter on the washstand george was sometimes cross if she was awakened in the middle of the night anne got back into bed not guessing that george hadnt answered because she wasnt there she fell asleep and didnt wake till she heard dicks voice hey you two get up its a quarter to eight were going for a bathe anne sat up yawning her eyes went to georges bed it was empty more than that it was all neat and tidy as if it had just been made well said anne in astonishment george is up already and has even made her bed she might have waked me and i could have gone out with her its such a lovely day i suppose shes taken timmy for an early morning walk like she sometimes does anne slipped into her bathing costume and ran to join the boys they went downstairs together their bare feet padding on the carpet george has gone out already said anne i expect she woke early and took timmy i never even heard her julian was now at the front door yes he said the door isnt locked or bolted george must have slipped down undone it and then just pulled the door softly to how very considerate of her last time she went out early she banged the door so hard that she woke everyone in the house she may have gone fishing in her boat said dick she said yesterday shed like to some early morning when the tide was right shell probably arrive complete with stacks of fish for joan to cook they looked out to sea when they got to the beach there was a boat far out on the water with what looked like two people in it fishing i bet thats george and timmy said dick he yelled and waved his hands but the boat was too far away and nobody waved back the three of them plunged into the cold waves brrrrrrrrr lovely said anne when they came out again the drops of seawater running down their bodies and glistening in the early morning sun lets have a run now they chased one another up and down the beach and then glowing and very hungry went back to breakfast wheres george asked joan as she brought in their breakfast i see her beds made and all whats come over her i think shes out fishing with timmy said dick she was up and about long before we were i never heard her go said joan she must have been very quiet there you are now theres a fine breakfast for you sausages and tomatoes and fried eggs oooh lovely said anne and youve done the sausages just how i like them joan all bursting their skins do you think wed better eat georges too shes still out in the boat she may not be back for ages well then youd better eat her share said joan ive no doubt she took something out of the larder before she went pity i didnt lock it last night as usual they finished georges share between them and then started on toast and marmalade after that anne went to help joan make the beds and dust and mop julian and dick went off to the village to do the mornings shopping at the grocers nobody worried about george at all julian and dick came back from their shopping and saw the little boat still out on the sea george will be absolutely starving by the time she comes back said julian perhaps shes got one of her moods on and wants to be alone she was awfully upset about timmy being drugged they met the ragamuffin jo she was walking along the beach collecting wood and she looked sullen and dirtier than ever hallo jo called dick she looked up and came towards them without a smile she looked as if she had been crying her small brown face was streaked where the tears had run through the dirt hallo she said looking at dick she looked so miserable that dick felt touched whats the matter kid he said kindly tears trickled down jos face as she heard the kindness in his voice she rubbed them away and smudged her face more than ever nothing she said wheres anne annes at home and george is out in that boat with timmy fishing said dick pointing out to sea oh said jo and turned away to go on with her collecting of wood dick went after her hey he said dont go off like that you just tell me whats wrong with you this morning he caught hold of jo and swung her round to face him he looked closely at her and saw that she now had two bruises on her face one going yellow that he had given her when he had sent her flying two or three days before and a new one dark purple where did you get that bruise he said touching it lightly that was my dad said jo hes gone off and left me taken the caravan and all i wanted to go too but he wouldnt let me into the caravan and when i hammered at the door he came out and pushed me down the steps thats when i got this bruise and ive got another on my leg too dick and julian listened in horror what kind of a life was this that jo had to live the boys sat down on the beach and dick pulled jo down between them but surely your father is coming back said julian is the caravan your only home yes said jo ive never had another home weve always lived in a caravan mum did too when she was alive things were better then but this is the first time dads gone off without me but how are you going to live asked dick dad said jake would give me money to buy food said jo but only if i do what he tells me i dont like jake hes mean whos jake asked julian most astonished at all this jakes a gipsy fellow he knows my father said jo hes always turning up for a day or two and going away again if i wait about here hell come and give me five pence or so i expect what will he tell you to do said dick puzzled it all seems very queer and horrible to me youre only a kid oh he may tell me to go poaching with him or or well theres things we do that folks like you dont said jo suddenly realizing that dick and julian would not at all approve of some of the things she did i hope he gives me some money today though i havent got any at all and im hungry dick and julian looked at one another to think that in these days there should be a forlorn waif like jo going in fear of others and often hungry and lonely dick put his hand in the shopping basket and pulled out a packet of chocolate and some biscuits here you are he said tuck into these and if youd like to go to the kitchen door some time today and ask joan our cook for a meal shell give you one ill tell her about you folks dont like me at kitchen doors said jo cramming biscuits into her mouth theyre afraid ill steal something she glanced up at dick and i do she said you shouldnt do that said dick well wouldnt you if you were so hungry you couldnt even bear to look at a bakers cart said jo no i dont think so at least i hope not said dick wondering what he really would feel like if he were starving wheres this jake fellow i dont know somewhere about said jo hell find me when he wants me ive got to stay on the beach dad said so i couldnt come to your house anyway i dursent leave here the boys got up to go worried about this little ragamuffin but what could they do nothing except feed her and give her money dick had slipped five pence into her hand and she had pocketed it without a word her eyes gleaming george was still not home by lunchtime and now julian for the first time began to feel anxious he slipped out to the beach to see if the boat was still at sea it was just pulling in and with a sinking heart julian saw that it was not george and timmy who were in it but two boys he went to look for georges boat and there it was high up on the boatbeach with many others george had not been out in it at all he ran back to kirrin cottage and told the others they were at once as anxious as he was what could have become of george well wait till teatime said julian then if shes not back well really have to do something about it tell the police i should think but she has sometimes gone off for the day before so well just wait a bit longer teatime came but no george and no timmy then they heard someone pattering up the garden path was it timmy they leaned out of the window to see its jo said dick in disappointment shes got a note or something whatever does she want chapter nine an extraordinary message and a plan julian opened the front door jo silently gave him a plain envelope julian tore it open not knowing what in the least to expect jo turned to go but julian put out his hand and caught hold of her firmly whilst he read the note in complete amazement dick he called hold on to jo dont let her go better take her indoors this is serious jo wasnt going to be taken indoors she squealed and wriggled like an eel then she began to kick dick viciously with her bare feet let me go im not doing any harm i only brought you that note stop squealing and being silly said dick i dont want to hurt you you know that but you must come indoors but jo wouldnt stop wriggling and pulling and kicking she looked scared out of her life it was as much as dick and julian could do to get the little wriggler into the diningroom and shut the door anne followed looking very frightened whatever was happening listen to this said julian when the door was shut its unbelievable he held out the typewritten note for the others to see as he read it out loud we want the second notebook the one with figures in and we mean to have it find it and put it under the last stone on the crazy paving path at the bottom of the garden put it there tonight we have got the girl and the dog we will set them free when we have what we want from you if you tell the police neither the girl nor the dog will come back the house will be watched to see that nobody leaves it to warn the police the telephone wires are cut when it is dark put the lights on in the front room and all three of you sit there with the maid joan so that we can keep a watch on you let the big boy leave the house at eleven oclock shining a torch and put the notebook where we said he must then go back to the lighted room you will hear a hoot like an owl when we have collected it the girl and the dog will then be returned this amazing and terrifying note made anne burst into tears and cling to julians arm julian julian george cant have come back from her walk with timmy last night she must have been caught then and timmy too oh why didnt we start hunting for her then julian looked very grim and white he was thinking hard yes someone was lying in wait ive no doubt and she and timmy were kidnapped then the kidnapper or one of them came back to the house and shut the front door to make it seem as if george was back and someone has probably been hanging round all day to find out whether were worried about george or just think shes gone off for the day who gave you the note said dick sharply to the scared jo she trembled a man she said what sort of a man asked julian i dont know said jo yes you do said dick you must tell jo jo looked sullen dick shook her and she tried to get away but he held her far too tightly go on tell us what the fellow was like he said he was tall and had a long beard and a long nose and brown eyes rattled off jo suddenly and he was dressed in fishermans clothes and he spoke foreign the two boys looked sternly at her i believe youre making all that up jo said julian im not said jo sulkily id never seen him before so there jo said anne taking jos brown little paw in hers tell us truly anything you know were so very worried about george tears sprang out of her eyes as she spoke and she gave a little wail serve that georgegirl right if shes got taken away said jo fiercely she was rude to me shes crool and unkind serve her right i say i wouldnt tell you anything not even if i knew something to tell you do know something said dick youre a bad little girl jo i shant have anything more to do with you i felt sorry and unhappy about you but now i dont jo looked sullen again but her eyes were bright with tears she turned away let me go she said i tell you that fellow gave me fifteen pence to bring this note to you and thats all i know and im glad george is in trouble people like her deserve it see let her go said julian wearily shes like a savage little cat all claws and spite i thought there might be some good in her but there isnt i thought so too said dick letting go jos arm i quite liked her well go jo we dont want you any more jo rushed to the door wrenched it open and fled down the hall and out of the house there was a silence after she had gone julian whispered anne what are we going to do julian said nothing he got up and went into the hall he picked up the telephone receiver and put his ear to it listening for the faint crackling that would tell him he was connected to the exchange after a moment he put it back again no connection he said the wires have been cut as the note said and no doubt theres somebody on watch to see we dont slip out to give warning this is all crazy it cant be true but it is said dick horribly true julian do you know what notebook they want ive no idea nor have i said julian and its impossible to go and hunt for it because the safe has been mended and locked and the police have the key well thats that then said dick what are we going to do shall i slip out and warn the police julian considered no he said at last i think these people mean business it would be terrible if anything happened to george also you might be caught and spirited away yourself there are people watching the house dont forget but julian we cant just sit here and do nothing said dick i know this will have to be thought about carefully said julian if only we knew where george had been taken to we could rescue her then but i cant see how we can find out if one of us went and hid down the bottom of the garden and waited to see whoever came to take up the notebook we could follow the fellow and maybe hed lead us to where george is hidden suggested dick you forget that weve all got to sit in the lighted front room so it would easily be spotted if one of us were missing said julian even joan has to sit there this is all very stupid and melodramatic does anyone come to the house this evening any of the tradesmen for instance asked anne again in a whisper she felt as if people must be all round the house listening and watching no else we could give them a note said julian then he gave the table a rap that made the others jump wait a bit yes of course the paperboy comes ours is almost the last house he delivers at but perhaps it would be risky to give him a note cant we think of something better listen said dick his eyes shining ive got it i know the paperboy hes all right well have the front door open and yank him in as soon as he appears and ill go out immediately with his cap on and his satchel of papers whistling jump on his bike and ride away and none of the watchers will know im not the boy ill come back when its dark sneak round the garden at the bottom and hide to watch who comes for the hidden notebook and ill follow him good idea dick said julian turning it quickly over in his mind yes its possible it would be better to watch and see who comes rather than tell the police because if these kidnappers mean business george would certainly be in trouble once they knew wed been able to get in touch with the police wont the newspaper boy think its queer asked anne not very hes a bit simple said dick he believes anything hes told well make up something to satisfy him and give him such a good time that hell want to keep visiting us about this notebook said julian wed better get some kind of book out of one of the drawers and wrap it up with a note inside to say we hope its the one the fellow who comes to collect it will have to have some kind of parcel to take off with him to give to the kidnappers it isnt likely hed undo it and look at it or even know if it was the right one or not go and hunt out a book anne said dick ill be looking out for the newspaper boy hes not due till halfpast seven but i dont dare to risk missing him and he may be early you never know anne shot off to the study thankful to have something to do her hands were trembling as she pulled out drawer after drawer to look for a big notebook that would do to wrap up in a parcel julian went with dick to the front door to help him to deal with the unsuspecting newspaper boy they stood there patiently waiting hearing the clock strike six oclock then halfpast then seven here he comes said dick suddenly now get ready to yank him in hallo sid chapter ten sids wonderful evening sid the paperboy was most amazed to find himself yanked quickly through the front door by julian he was even more amazed to find his very lurid check cap snatched off his head and his bag of papers torn from his shoulder ere he said feebly what you doing its all right sid said julian holding him firmly just a joke weve got a little treat in store for you sid didnt like jokes of this sort he struggled but soon gave it up julian was big and strong and very determined sid turned and watched dick stride out with his bright check cap sideways on his head and his paperbag over his shoulder he gasped when he saw dick leap on the bicyle that he sid had left by the gate and go sailing off up the lane on it whats he doing he asked julian amazed funny sort of joke this i know hope you dont mind said julian leading him firmly into the sittingroom somebody betted him he wouldnt deliver the papers maybe said sid so hes taken the bet on youre clever you are sid said julian and sid beamed all over his round simple face well i hope hell deliver them all right he said anyway theres only two more up at the farm yours is the last house but one that i go to whens he coming back soon said julian will you stay and have supper with us sid sids eyes nearly fell out of his head supper with you folks he said coo thatd be a rare treat all right you sit and look at these books said julian giving him two or three story books belonging to anne ill just go and tell our cook to make a specially nice supper for you sid was all at sea about this unexpected treat but quite willing to accept a free meal and sit down he sat beaming on the couch turning over the pages of a fairystory book coo what would his mother say when she heard hed had supper at kirrin cottage she wouldnt half be surprised thought sid and now julian had to tackle joan and get her to join in their little plot he went into the kitchen and shut the door he looked so grave that joan was startled whats the matter she said julian told her he told her about the kidnapping of george and the strange note he gave it to her to read she sat down her knees beginning to shake its the kind of thing you read in the papers master julian she said in rather a shaky voice but its queer when it happens to you i dont like it thats flat i dont nor do we said julian and went on to tell joan all they had arranged to do she smiled a watery smile when he told her how dick had gone off as the paperboy in order to watch who took the notebook that night and described how surprised sid was that sid she said well never hear the last of it down in the village him being invited here to supper hes simple that boy but theres no harm in him ill get him a fine supper dont you worry and ill come and sit with you tonight in the lighted room well play a card game see one that sid knows hes never got much beyond snap and happy families thats a very good idea said julian who had been wondering how in the world they could amuse sid all the evening well play snap and let him win sid was quite overcome at his wonderful evening first there was what he called a smasher of a supper with ham and eggs and chip potatoes followed by jam tarts and a big chocolate mould of which sid ate about threequarters im partial to chocolate mould he explained to anne joan knows that she knows im partial to anything in the chocolate line shes friendly with my mum so she knows the things im partial to i like very much see anne giggled and agreed she was enjoying sid although she was very worried and anxious but sid was so comical he didnt mean to be he was just enjoying himself hugely and he said so every other minute in fact he was really a very nice guest to have it wasnt everybody who could welcome everything with so much gusto and say how wonderful it was half a dozen times on end he went out to the kitchen after supper and offered to wash up for joan i always do it for mum he said i wont break a thing so he did the washing up and anne did the drying julian thought it was a good thing to give her as much to do as possible to stop her worrying sid looked a bit takenaback when he was asked to play games later on well i dunno he said im not much good at games i did try to learn draughts but all that jumping over one another got me muddled if i want to jump over things ill play leapfrog and do the thing properly well we did think of playing snap said julian and sid brightened up at once snap thats right up my street he said and so it was his habit of shouting snap and collecting all the cards at the same moment as his shout led to his winning quite a lot of games he was delighted this is a smasher of an evening he kept saying dont know when ive enjoyed myself so much wonder how that brother of yours is getting on hope he brings my bike back all right oh he will said julian dealing out the cards for the sixth game of snap they were all in the lighted sittingroom now sitting round a table in the window julian joan anne and sid anyone watching would see them clearly and would certainly not guess that sid the fourth one was the paperboy and not dick at eleven oclock julian left to put the parcel that anne had carefully wrapped up under the stone at the bottom of the garden she had found a big notebook she thought would do one that didnt seem at all important and had wrapped it in paper and tied it with string julian had slipped a note inside here is the notebook please release our cousin at once you will get into serious trouble if you hold her any longer he slipped down the garden and shone his torch on the crazy paving there when he came to the last stone he found that it had been loosened he lifted it up easily and put the parcel into a hollow that seemed to have been prepared ready for it he took a cautious look round wondering if dick was hidden anywhere about but could see no one he was back in the lighted sittingroom in under two minutes yelling snap with the others he played stupidly partly because he wanted the delighted sid to win and partly because he was wondering about dick was he all right an outbreak of owls hooting loudly made them all jump julian glanced at joan and anne and they nodded they guessed that it was the signal to tell them that the parcel had been found and collected now they could get rid of sid and wait for dick joan disappeared and came back with cups of chocolate and some buns sids eyes gleamed talk about an evening another hour was spent in eating and drinking and hearing sid relate details of all the most exciting games of snap he had ever played he then went on to talk of happy families and seemed inclined to stay a bit longer and have a garne at that your mum will be getting worried about you said julian looking at the clock its very late wheres my bike said sid realizing with sorrow that his smasher of an evening was now over hasnt that brother of yours come back yet well you tell him to leave it at my house in time for my paperround tomorrow morning and my cap too thats my special cap that is im very partial to that cap its a bit of a smasher it certainly is agreed julian who was now feeling very tired now listen sid its very late and there may be bad folks about if anyone speaks to you run for your life and dont stop till you get home coo said sid his eyes nearly falling out of his head yes ill run all right he shook hands solemnly with each of them and departed he whistled loudly to keep his spirits up the village policeman came unexpectedly round a corner on rubber soles and made him jump now then young sid said the policeman sternly what you doing out this time of night sid didnt wait to answer he fled and when he got home there was his bicycle by the front gate complete with checked cap and paperbag that was a bit of all right thought sid he glanced in disappointment at the dark windows of his house mum was in bed and asleep now he would have to wait till morning to tell her of his most remarkable evening and now what had happened to dick he had shot out of the house and sailed away on sids bicycle with sids dazzling cap on his head he thought he saw a movement in the hedge nearby and guessed someone was hidden there watching he deliberately slowed down got off his bicycle and pretended to do something to the wheel let the watcher see his bag of papers and be deceived into thinking he was without any doubt the paperboy he rode to the farm and delivered the two papers there then down to the village where he left sids things outside his house then he went into the cinema for a long while until it was dark and he could safely creep back to kirrin cottage he set off at last going a very roundabout way indeed he came to the back of kirrin garden where should he hide was anyone already hidden there if so the game was up and hed be caught too chapter eleven dick makes a capture dick stood and listened holding his breath he could hear no sound except for the rustling of the trees around and the sudden squeak of a fieldmouse it was a dark night and cloudy was there anyone hidden nearby or could he find a hidingplace in safety and wait he thought for a few minutes and decided that there wouldnt be anyone watching the back of the house now that it was dark julian and the others would be in full view of any watcher at the front seated as they were in the lighted sittingroom there would be no need for anyone to watch the back he debated where to hide and then made a quick decision ill climb a tree he thought what about that one just near the crazy paving path if the clouds clear away i could perhaps catch a glimpse of what the mans like who comes to collect the parcel then ill shin quietly down the tree and stalk him he climbed up into an oak tree that spread its broad branches over the path he wriggled down in a comfortable fork and set himself to wait patiently what time had that note said eleven odock yes julian was to go down at eleven oclock and put the parcel under the stone he listened for the church clock to strike if the wind was in the right direction he would hear it clearly it struck just then halfpast ten half an hour to wait the waiting was the worst part dick put his hand into his pocket and brought out a bar of halfmelted chocolate he began to nibble it very gently to make it last a long time the church clock struck a quarter to eleven dick finished the chocolate and wondered if julian would soon be along just as the clock began to chime the hour at eleven the kitchen door opened and dick saw julian outlined in the opening he had the parcel under his arm he saw julian go swiftly down the path and sensed him looking all about he dared not give the slightest hint to him that he was just above his head he heard julian scrabble about in the path and then drop the big stone back into its place he watched the light of julians torch bobbing back up the path to the kitchen door then the door shut with a bang and now dick could hardly breathe who would come for the parcel he listened stiff with excitement the wind blew and a leaf rustled against the back of his neck making him jump it felt as if a finger had touched him five minutes went by and nobody came then he heard the slightest sound was that somebody crawling through the hedge dick strained his eyes but could only make out a deeper shadow that seemed to be moving then he could most distinctly hear somebody breathing hard as they tugged at the heavy stone the parcel was being collected as arranged the stone plopped back a shadow crept over to the hedge again whoever had the parcel was now going off with it dick dropped quietly down he had rubber shoes on and made no noise he slipped through a big gap in the hedge nearby and stood straining his eyes to find the man he wanted to follow ah there was a shadow moving steadily down the fieldpath to the stile dick followed keeping close to the hedge he kept well behind the moving shadow till it reached the stile got over it and went into the lane beyond when it got there it stopped and a perfect fusillade of loud owlhoots came to dicks startled ears of course that was the signal that the parcel had been collected dick admired the excellent imitation of a little owls loud excited hooting the shadow stopped hooting and went on again it obviously did not suspect that it might be followed and although it moved quietly it did not attempt to keep under cover down the lane it went and into a field dick was about to follow when he heard the sound of voices they were very low and he couldnt hear a word he crouched in the shadow of the gate which was swung right back leaving an entry into the field a loud noise made him jump then a brilliant light dazzled him and he felt glad he could duck down behind the gate there was a car in the field a car that had just started up its engine and switched on its lights it was going moving slowly down to the gate dick tried his hardest to see who was in the car he could make out only one man and he was driving it didnt seem as if anyone else was in the car at all where was the other fellow then the one who must have collected the parcel and given it to the man in the car had he been left behind if so dick had better be careful the car was soon out in the lane it gained speed and then dick heard it roaring off in the distance he couldnt stalk a car that was certain he held his breath listening for some movement of the other man who he felt certain was still there he heard a sniff and crouched lower still then a shadow passed quickly through the gate turned back in the direction of kirrin cottage and was lost in the darkness of the lane in a trice dick was after it again at least he could track down this fellow he must be going somewhere down the lane to the stile over the stile and into the field across the field and back at the hedge that grew at the bottom of kirrin cottage why was this fellow going back there dick was puzzled he heard the shadow creeping through the hedge and he followed he watched it go silently up the path and peer in at a darkened window going to get into the house again and ransack it i suppose thought dick in a rage he considered the shadowy figure by the window it didnt look big it must be a small man one that dick could tackle and bring to the ground he could yell loudly for julian and maybe he could hold the fellow down till julian came and then perhaps we could do a little kidnapping and a little bargaining too thought dick grimly if they hold george as a hostage well hold one of them too tit for tat he waited till the shadow left the window and then he pounced his victim went down at once with a yell dick was surprised how small he was but how he fought he bit and scratched and heaved and kicked and the two of them rolled over and over and over breaking down michaelmas daisies in the beds and scratching legs and arms and faces on rose bushes dick yelled for julian all the time julian julian help julian julian heard he tore out at once dick dick where are you what is it he flashed his torch towards the shouting and saw dick rolling on top of somebody he ran to help at once throwing his torch on the grass so that both hands were free it wasnt long before they had the struggling figure firmly in their grasp and dragged it wailing to the back door dick recognized that wailing voice good gracious no it couldnt be it couldnt be jo but it was when they dragged her inside she collapsed completely sobbing and wailing rubbing her scratched and bruised legs calling both boys all the names she could think of anne and joan looked on in complete amazement nore what had happened put her upstairs said julian get her to bed shes in a awful state now so am i i wouldnt have lammed her like that if id known it was only jo i never guessed said dick wiping his filthy face with his handkerchief my word what a wildcat see how shes bitten me i didnt know it was you dick i didnt know wailed jo you pounced on me and i fought back i wouldnt have bitten you like that youre a savage deceitful doubledealing little wildcat said dick looking at his bites and scratches pretending you know nothing about the man who gave you that note and all the time youre in with that crooked lot of thieves and kidnappers whoever they are im not in with them wept jo dont tell lies shouted dick in a fury i was up in a tree when you came and took that parcel from under the stone yes and i followed you right to that car and followed you back again you came back here to steal again i suppose jo gulped no i didnt you did youll be handed over to the police tomorrow said dick still furious i didnt come back to steal i came back for something else insisted jo her eyes peering through her tangled hair like a frightened animals ho so you say and what did you come back for to find another dog to dope jeered dick no said jo miserably i came back to tell you id take you to where george was if you wouldnt tell on me my dad would half kill me if he thought id split on him i know i took the parcel i had to i didnt know what it was or anything i took it to the place i was told to jake told me and then i came back to tell you all i could and you set on me like that four pairs of eyes bored into jo and she covered her face dick took her hands away and made her look at him look here he said this matters a lot to us whether you are speaking the truth or not do you know where george is jo nodded and will you take us there said julian his voice stern and cold jo nodded again yes i will youve been mean to me but ill show you im not as bad as you make out ill take you to george chapter twelve jo begins to talk the hall clock suddenly struck loudly dong one oclock said joan one oclock in the morning master julian we cant do any more tonight this gipsy child here shes not fit to take you trapesing out anywhere else shes done for she can hardly stand yes youre right joan said julian at once giving up the idea of going out to find george that night well have to wait till tomorrow its a pity the telephone wires are cut i do really think we ought to let the police know something about all this jo looked up at once then i wont tell you where george is she said do you know what the police will do to me if they get hold of me theyd put me into a home for bad girls and ill never get out again because i am a bad girl and i do bad things ive never had a chance every one gets a chance sooner or later said julian gently youll get yours jo but see you take it when it comes all right well leave the police out of it if you promise youll take us to where george is thats a bargain jo understood bargains she nodded joan pulled her to her feet and half led half carried her upstairs theres a couch in my room she told julian she can bed down there for the night but late or not shes going to have a bath first she smells like something the dog brought in in half an hours time jo was tucked up on the couch in joans room perfectly clean though marked with scratches and bruises from top to toe hair washed dried and brushed so that it stood up in wiry curls like georges a basin of steaming bread and milk was on a tray in front of her joan went to the landing and called across to julians room master julian jos in bed she wants to say something to you and master dick dick and julian put on dressinggowns and went into joans neat room they hardly recognized jo she was wearing one of annes old nightgowns and looked very clean and childish and somehow pathetic jo looked at them and gave them a very small smile what do you want to say to us asked julian ive got some things to tell you said jo stirring the bread round and round in the basin i feel good now good and clean and and all that but maybe tomorrow ill feel like i always do and then i wouldnt tell you everything so id better tell you now go ahead said julian well i let the men into your house here the night they came said jo julian and dick stared in astonishment jo went on stirring her bread round and round its true she said i got in at that tiny window that was left unfastened and then i went to the back door and opened it and let the men in they did make a mess of that room didnt they i watched them they took a lot of papers you couldnt possibly squeeze through that window said dick at once well i did said jo ive ive squeezed through quite a lot of little windows i know how to wriggle you see i cant get through such tiny ones as i used to because i keep on growing but yours was easy phew said julian and let out a long breath he hardly knew what to say well go on i suppose when the men had finished you locked and bolted the kitchen door after them and then squeezed out of the pantry window again yes said jo and put a piece of milky bread into her mouth what about timmy who doped him so that he slept all that night demanded dick i did said jo that was easy too both boys were speechless to think that jo did that too the wicked little misery i made friends with timmy on the beach dont you remember said jo george was cross about it i like dogs we always had dozens till mum died and theyd do anything i told them dad told me what i was to do make friends with timmy so that i could meet him that night and give him meat with something in it i see and it was very very easy because we sent timmy out alone straight into your hands said dick bitterly yes he came to me at once he was glad to see me i took him quite a long walk letting him sniff the meat id got when i gave it to him he swallowed it all at once with hardly a chew and slept all night long so that your precious friends could break into the house said julian all i can say is that you are a hardened little rogue arent you ashamed of anything i dont know said jo who wasnt really quite certain what feeling ashamed meant shall i stop telling you things no for goodness sake go on said dick hastily had you anything to do with georges kidnapping i just had to hoot like an owl when she and timmy were coming said jo they were ready for her with a sack to put over her head and they were going to bang timmy on the head with a stick to knock him out then put him into a sack too thats what i heard them say but i didnt see them l had to creep back here and shut the front door so that if nobody missed george till morning theyd just think shed gone out early somewhere which is what we did think groaned dick what mutts we are the only clever thing we thought of was to stalk the person who collected the parcel it was only me though said jo and anyway i was coming back to tell you i would take you to george not because i like her i dont i think shes rude and horrible id like her to stay kidnapped for years what a nice kind nature said julian to dick helplessly what can you do with a kid like this he turned to jo again seeing that you wish george would stay kidnapped for years what made you decide to come and tell us where to find her he asked puzzled well i dont like george but i do like him said jo pointing with her spoon at dick he was nice to me so i wanted to be nice back i dont often feel like that she added hurriedly as if being kind was some sort of weakness not really to be admired i wanted him to go on liking me she said dick looked at her i shall like you if you take us to george he said not unless if you deceive us i shall think youre like one of those sour damson stones only fit to be spat out as far away as possible ill take you tomorrow said jo where is george asked julian bluntly thinking it would be as well to know now in case jo changed her mind by the morning and became her wicked little self again jo hesitated she looked at dick it would be very nice of you to tell us said dick in a kind voice jo loved a bit of kindness and couldnt resist this well she whispered you know i told you my dad had gone off and left me to jake dad didnt tell me why but jake did he shut george and timmy into our caravan harnessed blackie the horse and drove away in the night with them both and i guess i know where hes gone where he always goes when he wants to hide where asked julian feeling so astounded at these extraordinary revelations that he really began to wonder if he was dreaming in the middle of ravens wood said jo you dont know where that is but i do ill take you tomorrow i cant tell you any more now she began to spoon up her bread and milk very fast indeed watching the boys through her long eyelashes dick considered her he felt pretty sure she had told them the truth though he was equally certain she would have told lies if she could have got more by doing so he thought her a bad coldblooded savage little monkey but he pitied her and admired her unwillingly for her courage he caught sight of her bruises and grazes and bit his lip as he remembered how he had pounced on her and pummelled her giving her back kick for kick and blow for blow he hadnt guessed for one moment it was jo im sorry i hurt you so he said you know i didnt mean to it was a mistake jo looked at him as a slave might look at a king i dont mind she said id do anything for you straight i would youre kind joan knocked impatiently at the door arent you ready yet you boys she said i want to come to bed tell jo to stop talking and you come on out too and go to bed the boys opened the door joan took one look at their solemn faces and guessed that what jo had told them was important she took the empty basin from the girls hands and pushed her down on the couch now you go straight off to sleep and mind if i hear any hankypanky from you in the night ill get up and give you such a spanking you wont be able to sit down for a month of sundays she said roughly but not unkindly jo grinned she understood that kind of talk she snuggled down into the rugs marvelling at the warmth and softness she was already halfasleep joan got into bed and switched off her light two oclock in the morning she muttered as she heard the hall clock strike such goingson ill never wake up in time to tell the milkman i want more milk soon only julian was awake he worried about whether he was doing right or not poor george was she safe would that scamp of a jo really lead them to the caravan next day or might she lead them right into the lions mouth and get them all captured julian simply didnt know chapter thirteen off to find george joan was the only one in the household who woke up reasonably early the next morning but even she was too late ta catch the milkman she scurried downstairs at halfpast seven an hour later than usual tying up her apron as she went halfpast seven what a time to wake up she muttered as she began to do the kitchen fire she thought of all the happenings of the night before the queer evening with young sid dicks capture of jo and jos extraordinary tale she had had a look at jo before she went down half expecting that lively young rogue to have disappeared in the night but jo was curled up like a kitten her brown cheek on her brown paw her hair unusually bright and tidy falling over her tightlyshut eyes she didnt even stir when joan scurried about the bedroom washing and dressing the others were fast asleep too julian woke first but not till eight oclock he remembered immediately all that had happened and jumped out of bed at once he went to joans room he could hear joan downstairs talking to herself as usual he peeped round the open door of her bedroom thank goodness jo was still there he went and shook her gently she wriggled away turned over and buried her face in the pillow julian shook her more vigorously he meant to get her up and make her take them to where george was as soon as possible most miraculously everyone was down at halfpast eight eating porridge and looking rather subdued jo had hers in the kitchen and the others could hear joan scolding her for her manners have you got to stuff yourself like that as if the dogs going to come and lick your plate before youve finished and who told you to stick your fingers into the syrup and lick them ive eyes in the back of my head so just you be careful what youre doing jo liked joan she knew where she was with her if she kept on joans right side and did what she was told joan would feed her well and not interfere too much but if she didnt then she could expect something else she understood very well indeed scoldings and a sharp slap joan was goodhearted but impatient and no child was ever afraid of her jo followed her about like a little dog when she had finished her breakfast julian came out into the kitchen at nine oclock wheres jo he said oh there you are now what about taking us to where you fathers caravan is youre sure you know the way jo laughed scornfully course i do i know everywhere round here for miles right said julian and he produced a map which he spread out on the kitchen table he put a finger on one spot thats kirrin he said and heres a place called ravens wood is that the place you mean how do you propose to get there by this road or that one jo looked at the map it meant nothing to her at all she gazed vaguely at the spot that julian had pointed to well said julian impatiently is that the ravens wood you mean i dont know said jo helplessly the one i mean is a real wood i dont know anything about yours on this map joan gave a little snort master julian maps are wasted on her i dont expect shes ever seen one in her life she cant even read cant she said julian amazed then she cant write either he looked questioningly at jo she shook her head mum tried to learn me to read she said but mum wasnt very good herself whats the good of reading anyway wont help you to trap rabbits or catch fish for your dinner will it no its used for other things said julian amused well maps are no good to you i can see he rolled his map up looking thoughtful it was very difficult to know exactly how to deal with a person like jo who knew so little of some things and so much of others shell know the way all right said joan scraping out a saucepan theyre like dogs these folk they can smell out any road they want do you smell out your way like a dog asked anne curiously she had come in to see what was going on and was quite willing to believe that jo really could smell her way here and there as timmy did no i dont said jo i just know the way i have to go and i dont go by the roads either they take too long to get to a place i take the shortest way see how do you know its the shortest way asked anne jo shrugged her thin shoulders all this was very boring to her wheres that other boy she said isnt he coming i want to see him shes just crazy on dick said joan taking up another saucepan here he is now you can go and lick his boots if you want to young jo hallo jo said dick with one of his amiable grins ready to take us travelling better go at night said jo staring at dick oh no said dick were going now were not going to be put off like that now jo now if my dad sees us coming hell be mad said jo obstinately very well said dick looking at julian well go by ourselves weve found ravens wood on the map we can easily get there pooh said jo rudely you can get there all right but its a big place ravens wood is and nobody but me and dad knows where we hide the caravan there and if dad wants to keep george quite safe hell take her to our hideyhole in the middle of the wood see you cant go without me right then well get the police to take us said julian quite cheerfully they will help us to comb the wood from end to end well soon find george no cried jo in alarm you said you wouldnt you promised you made a promise too said julian it was a bargain but i see youre not really to be trusted ill just get on my bike and ride down to the policestation but before he could go out of the room jo flung herself on him and clung to his arm like a cat no no ill take you ill keep my promise but it would be best to go at night im not putting things off any more said julian shaking jo off his arm if you mean what you say youll come with us now make up your mind ill come said jo hadnt we better give her another pair of shorts or something said anne suddenly seeing a tremendous hole in jos grubby shorts she cant go out like that and look at her awful jersey its full of holes the boys looked at it shed smell a bit better if she had clean clothes said joan theres that old pair of shorts i washed for george last week and mended up jo could have those and theres an old shirt of hers she could have too in five minutes time jo was proudly wearing a pair of perfectly clean muchmended shorts of georges and a shirt like the one anne had on anne looked at her and laughed now shes more like george than ever they might be sisters brothers you mean said dick george and jo what a pair jo scowled she didnt like george and she didnt want to look like her shes even got georges scowl said anne jo turned her back at once and joan then got the benefit of the scowl my word what an ugly creature you are said joan you be careful the wind doesnt change you might get your face stuck like that oh come on said julian impatiently jo do you hear me come along now and take us to ravens wood jake might see us said jo sulkily she was determined to put off going as long as she could yes he might said julian who hadnt thought of that well you go on a long way ahead and well follow we wont let jake know youre leading us anywhere at last they set off joan had packed them up a meal in case they wanted one julian slipped the package into a bag and slid it over his shoulder jo slipped out the back way went down to the bottom of the garden and made her way out to the lane through a little thicket the others went out of the front gate and walked up the lane slowly watching for jo to appear there she is said julian come on we must keep the little wretch in sight i wouldnt be surprised if she gave us the slip even now jo danced on in front a good way ahead she took no notice of the others behind and they followed steadily then suddenly something happened a dark figure strode out from the hedge stood in front of jo and said something to her she screamed and tried to dodge away but the man caught hold of her and firmly pulled her into the hedge it was jake said dick im sure it was jake he was watching out for her now what do we do chapter fourteen simmys caravan they all hurried up to the place where jake had caught hold of jo there was absolutely nothing to be seen except a few broken twigs in the hedge there no jake no jo there was not a sound to be heard either not a scream from jo not a shout from jake it was as if both had faded into the hedge and disappeared dick squeezed through the hedge and into the field beyond nobody was there either except a few cows who looked at him in surprise their tails whisking theres a little copse at the end of the field called back dick i bet theyre there ill go and see he ran across the field to the copse but there was nobody there either beyond the copse was a row of huddledup cottages dick looked along the untidy row exasperated i suppose jakes taken her to one of those he thought angrily probably lives there well he wont let her go thats certain he most likely guesses that shes in with us now poor jo he went back to the others and they had a lowvoiced conference in the lane lets tell the police now begged anne no lets go to ravens wood ourselves said dick we know where it is we wouldnt be able to go the way jo would have taken us but at least we can go by the map yes i think we will said julian come on then quick march they went on up the lane took a field path and came out eventually on to a road a bus passed them in the opposite direction to which they were going when we come to a bus stop well find out if one goes anywhere near ravens wood said julian it would save a lot of time if we caught a bus wed be there long before jake if he thinks of going to warn jos father were on the way i bet jo will tell him you might as well trust a snake as that slippery little thing i hate jo said anne almost in tears i dont trust her a bit do you dick i dont know said dick i cant make up my mind she hasnt really proved whether shes trustable or not yet anyway she came back to tell us all she knew last night didnt she i dont believe she did come back for that said anne obstinately i believe she was coming back to pry and snoop you may be right said dick look heres a busstop and a timetable a bus did apparently go quite near ravens wood and was due in five minutes time they sat down on the busstop seat and waited the bus was punctual and came rumbling down the road full of women going to ravens market they all seemed very plump women and had enormous baskets so it was difficult to squeeze inside everyone got out at ravens market julian asked his way to ravens wood there it is said the conductor pointing down the hill to where trees grew thickly in the valley its a big place dont get lost and look out for the gipsies theres usually hordes of them there thanks said julian and the three of them set off down the hill into the valley they came to the wood its a proper wood said anne nothing but trees and trees i should think it gets very thick in the middle like a forest they came to a clearing where there was a little gipsy camp three rather dirtylooking caravans stood together and a crowd of brown gipsy children were playing some sort of a game with a rope julian took a quick look at the caravans all had their doors open no george here he said in a low voice to the others i wish i knew exactly where to go i suppose if we follow this broad pathway it would be best after all jos caravan must have a fairly broad way to go on cant we ask if anyone knows if jos caravan is anywhere about said anne we dont know her fathers name said julian but we could say its a caravan drawn by a horse called blackie and that a girl called jo lives in it with her father said anne yes id forgotten the horse said julian he went up to an old woman who was stirring something in a black pot over a fire of sticks julian thought she looked very like a witch she peered up at him through tangled grey hair can you tell me if theres a caravan in the wood drawn by a horse called blackie he asked politely a girl called jo lives in it with her father we want to see her the old woman blinked she took an iron spoon out of the pot and waved it to the right simmys gone downaway there she said i never saw jo this time but the caravan door was shut so maybe she was inside what you want with jo oh only just to see her said julian quite unable to think up a good reason for going to visit a gipsychild on the spur of the moment is simmy her father the old woman nodded and began to stir her pot again julian went back to the others this way he said and they went down the rutted path it was just wide enough for a caravan to go down anne looked up tree branches waved overhead i should think they brush against the roof of a caravan all the time she said what a queer life to live in a little caravan day in and day out hiding yourself away in woods and fields they walked on down the path which wound about through the trees following the clear spaces sometimes the trees were so close together that it seemed impossible for a caravan to go between but the wheelruts showed that caravans did go down the path after a time the wood became thicker and the sunlight could hardly pierce through the branches still the path went on but now it seemed as if only one set of wheelruts was marked on it they were probably the wheels of simmys caravan here and there a tree was shorn of one of its branches and a bush uprooted and thrown to one side simmy meant to go deep into the wood last time he came said julian pointing to where a bush lay dying by the side of the path hes cleared the way here and there actually we arent on a proper path any longer were only following wheelruts it was true the path had faded out they were now in a thick part of the wood with only the ruts of the caravan wheels to guide them they fell silent the wood was very quiet there were no birds singing and the branches of the trees were so thick that there was a kind of green twilight round them i wish we had timmy with us halfwhispered anne at last julian nodded he had been wishing that a long time he was also wishing he hadnt brought anne but when they had started out they had jo with them to guide them and warn them of any danger now they hadnt i think wed better go very cautiously he said in a low voice we may come on the caravan unexpectedly we dont want simmy to hear us and lie in wait ill go a little way in front and warn you if i hear or see anything said dick julian nodded to him and he went on ahead peering round the trees when he came to any curve in the wheelrut path julian began to think of what they would do when they reached the caravan he was pretty certain that both george and timmy would be found locked up securely inside if we can undo the door and let them out timmy will do the rest he thought hes as good as three policemen yes thats the best plan dick suddenly stopped and lifted up his hand in warning he peered round the bole of a big tree and then turned and nodded excitedly hes found the caravan said anne and her heart began its usual thumpthumpthump of excitement stay heresaid julian to anne and went on quietly to join dick anne crept under a bush she didnt like this dark silent wood with the green light all round she peered out watching the boys dick had suddenly seen the caravan it was small badly needed painting and appeared quite deserted no fire burned outside no simmy was sitting anywhere about not even blackie the horse was to be seen the boys watched intently for a few minutes not daring to move or speak there was absolutely no sound or movement from the tiny clearing in which the caravan stood windows and doors were shut the shafts rested crookedly on the ground the whole place seemed deserted dick whispered julian at last simmy doesnt seem to be about this is our chance well creep over to the caravan and look into the window well attract georges attention and get her out as soon as we can timmy too funny he doesnt bark said dick also in a whisper i suppose he cant have heard us well shall we get over to the caravan now they ran quietly to the little caravan and julian peered through the dirty window it was too dark inside to see anything at all george he whispered george are you there chapter fifteen anne doesnt like adventures there was no answer from inside the caravan perhaps george was asleep or drugged and timmy too julians heart sank it would be dreadful if george had been illtreated he tried to peer inside the window again but what with the darkness of the wood and the dirt on the pane it really was impossible to see inside shall we bang on the door asked dick no that would only bring simmy if hes anywhere about and if george is inside and awake our voices would have attracted her attention said julian they went quietly round the caravan to the door at the back it had no key in the lock julian frowned simmy must have got the key with him that would mean breaking down the door and making a noise he went up the few steps and pushed at the door it seemed very solid indeed how could he break it down anyway he had no tools and it didnt look as if kicking and shoving would burst it in he knocked gently on the door rapraprap not a movement from inside it seemed very strange he tried the round handle and it turned easily it not only turned easily but the door opened dick its not locked said julian forgetting to whisper in his surprise he went inside the dark caravan hardly hoping now to see george or timmy dick pushed in after him there was a nasty sour smell and it was very untidy nobody was there it was quite empty as julian had feared he groaned all this way for nothing theyve taken george somewhere else were done now dick we havent a clue where to go next dick fished his torch out of his pocket he flashed it over the untidy jumble of things in the caravan looking for some sign that george had been there but there was nothing at all that he could see to show him that either timmy or george had been there its quite likely that jo made the whole story up about her father taking george away he groaned it doesnt look as if theyve been here at all his torch flashed on to the wooden wall of the caravan and dick saw something that arrested his attention somebody had written something on the wall he looked more closely julian isnt that georges writing look whats written there both boys bent towards the dirty wall red tower red tower red tower was written again and again in very small writing red tower said dick what does that mean is it georges writing yes i think so said julian but why should she keep writing that do you suppose thats where they have taken her to she might have heard them saying something and scribbled it down quickly just in case we found the caravan and examined it red tower it sounds queer it must be a house with a red tower i should think said dick well wed better get back and tell the police now and theyll have to hunt for a red tower somewhere bitterly disappointed the boys went back to anne she scrambled out from under her bush as they came george is not there said dick shes gone but she has been there we saw some scribbled writing on the wall of the caravan inside how do you know its hers said anne well shes written red tower ever so many times and the rs and the ts are just like hers said dick we think she must have heard someone talking and say they were taking her to red tower wherever it is were going straight back to the police now i wish we hadnt trusted jo weve wasted such a lot of time lets have something to eat said julian we wont sit down well eat as we go come on but somehow nobody wanted anything to eat anne said she felt sick julian was too worried to eat and dick was so anxious to go that he felt he couldnt even wait to unpack sandwiches so they started back down the path following the wheelruts as before it suddenly grew very dark indeed and on the leaves of the trees heavy rain fell with a loud pattering sound thunder suddenly rolled anne caught hold of julians arm startled julian its dangerous to be in a wood isnt it in a storm oh julian well be struck by lightning no we shant said julian a woods no more dangerous than anywhere else its sheltering under a lone tree somewhere thats dangerous look theres a little clearing over there well go to that if you like but when they got to the little clearing the rain was falling down in such heavy torrents that julian could see that they would immediately be soaked through he hurried anne to a clump of bushes and they crouched underneath waiting for the storm to pass soon the rain stopped and the thunder rolled away to the east there had been no lightning that they could see the wood grew just a little lighter as if somewhere above the thick green branches the sun might be shining i hate this wood said dick crawling out from the bushes come on for goodness sake lets get back to the wheelrut path he led the way through the trees julian called to him wait dick are you sure this is right dick stopped anxious at once well he said uncertainly i thought it was but i dont know do you i thought it was through those trees there said julian where that little clearing is they went to it its not the same clearing though said anne at once the other clearing had a dead tree at one side theres no dead tree here blow said julian well try this way then they went to the left and soon found themselves in a thicker part of the wood than ever julians heart went cold what an absolute idiot he was he might have known that it was madness to leave the only path they knew without marking it in some way now he hadnt the very faintest idea where the wheelrut way was it might be in any direction he hadnt even the sun to guide him he looked gloomily at dick bad show said dick well well have to make up our minds which way to go we cant just stay here we might go deeper and deeper and deeper said anne with a sudden little gulp of fear julian put his arm round her shoulder well if we go deeper and deeper we shall come out on the other side he said its not an endless wood you know well lets go straight on through the wood then said anne well have to come out the other side some time the boys didnt tell her that it was impossible to go straight through a wood it was necessary to go round clumps of bushes to double back sometimes when they came to an impenetrable part and to go either to the left or right when clumps of trees barred their way it was quite impossible to go straight through for all i know were probably going round and round in circles like people do when theyre lost in the desert he thought he blamed himself bitterly for having left the wheelruts they made their way on and on for about two or three hours and then anne stumbled and fell i cant go on any further she wept i must have a rest dick glanced at his watch and whistled where ever had the time gone it was almost three oclock he sat down by anne and pulled her close to him what we want is a jolly good meal he said weve had nothing since breakfast anne said she still wasnt hungry but when she smelt the meat sandwiches that joan had made she changed her mind she was soon eating with the others and feeling much better theres nothing to drink unfortunately said dick but joans packed tomatoes and plums too so well have those instead of a drink theyre nice and juicy they ate everything though secretly julian wondered if it was a good thing to wolf all their food at once there was no telling how long they might be lost in ravens wood joan might get worried sooner or later and tell the police they had gone there and a search would be made but it might be ages before they were found anne fell asleep after her meal the boys talked softly over her head i dont much like this said dick we set out to find george and all weve done is to lose ourselves we dont seem to be managing this adventure as well as we usually do if we dont get out before dark well have to make up some kind of bed under a bush said julian well have another go when anne wakes and well do a bit of yelling too then if were still lost well bed down for the night but when darkness came and it came very early in that thick wood they were still as much lost as ever they were all hoarse with shouting too in silence they pulled bracken from an open space and piled it under a sheltering bush thank goodness its warm tonight said dick trying to sound cheerful well well all feel much more lively in the morning cuddle up to me anne and keep warmthats right julians on the other side of you this is quite an adventure i dont like adventures said anne in a small voice and immediately fell asleep chapter sixteen visitor in the night it took a long time for julian and dick to fall asleep they were both worried worried about george and worried about themselves too they were also very hungry and their hunger kept them awake as much as their anxiety dick fell asleep at last julian still lay awake hoping that anne was nice and warm between them he didnt feel very warm himself he heard the whisper of the leaves in the trees and then the scamper of tiny paws behind his head he wondered what animal it was a mouse something ran lightly over his hair and he shivered a spider perhaps well he couldnt move or he would disturb anne if it wanted to make a web over his hair it would have to he shut his eyes and began to doze off soon he was dreaming he awoke very suddenly with a jump he heard the hoot of an owl that must have been what wakened him now it would be ages before he slept again he shut his eyes the owl hooted again and julian frowned hoping that anne would not wake she stirred and muttered in her sleep julian touched her lightly she felt quite warm he settled down again and shut his eyes then he opened them he had heard something not an owl or the pattering of some little animals feet but another sound a bigger one he listened there was a rustling going on somewhere some much bigger animal was about julian was suddenly panicstricken then he reasoned sternly with himself there were no dangerous wild animals in this country not even a wolf it was probably a badger out on a nightly prowl he listened for any snuffling sound but he heard none only the rustling as the animal moved about through the bushes it came nearer it came right over to him he felt warm breath on his ear and made a quick movement of revulsion he sat up swiftly and put out his hand it fell on something warm and hairy he withdrew his hand at once feeling for his torch in panic to touch something warm and hairy in the pitch darkness was too much even for julian something caught hold of his arm and he gave a yell and fought it off then he got the surprise of his life the animal spoke julian said a voice its me julian his hands trembling flashed his torch round the light fell on a dirty dark face with tangled hair over its eyes jo said julian jo what on earth are you doing here you scared me stiff i thought you were some horrible hairy animal i must have touched your head you did said jo squeezing in under the bush anne and dick who had both wakened up at julians yell gazed at her speechless with surprise jo of all people here in the middle of the wood how had she got there youre surprised to see me arent you said jo i got caught by jake but he didnt know you were following behind he dragged me off to the cottage he lives in and locked me up he knew id spent the night at kirrin cottage and he said he was going to take me to my dad who would give me the worst hiding id ever had in my life so he would too so thats what happened to you said dick then i broke the window and got out said jo that jake ill never do a thing he tells me again locking me up like that i hate that worse than anything well then i came to look for you how did you find us said julian in wonder well first i went to the caravan said jo old ma smith the one who always sits stirring a pot she told me youd been asking for my dads caravan i guessed youd go off to find it so along i went after you but there was the caravan all by itself and nobody there not even george where is george do you know asked anne no i dont said jo dads taken her somewhere else i expect he put her on blackie because blackies gone too what about timmy asked dick jo looked away i reckon theyve done timmy in she said nobody said anything the thought that timmy might have come to harm was too dreadful to speak about how did you find us here asked julian at last that was easy said jo i can follow anybodys trail id have come quicker but it got dark my you did wander round didnt you yes we did said dick do you mean to say you followed all our wanderings in and out and round about oh yes said jo properly tired me out you did with all your messing round and round why did you leave the wheelruts julian told her youre daft said jo if youre going somewhere off the path just mark the trees with a nick as you go along one here and one there and then you can always find your way back we didnt even know we were lost till we were said anne she took jos hand and squeezed it she was so very very glad to see her now they would be able to get out of this horrible wood jo was surprised and touched but she withdrew her hand at once she didnt like being fondled though she would not have minded dick taking her hand dick was her hero someone above all others he had been kind to her and she was glad she had found him we found something written on the caravan wall said julian we think we know where george has been taken its a place called red tower do you know it theres no place called red tower said jo at once its dont be silly jo you cant possibly know if theres no place called red tower said dick impatiently there may be hundreds of places with that name thats the place weve got to find anyway the police will know it jo gave a frightened movement you promised you wouldnt tell the police yes we promised that but only if you took us to george said dick and you didnt and anyway if you had taken us to the caravan george wouldnt have been there so well jolly well have to call in the police now and find out where red tower is was it red tower george had written down asked jo well then i can take you to george how can you when you say theres no place called red tower began julian exasperated i dont believe a word you say jo youre a fraud and i halfbelieve youre still working for our enemies too im not said jo im not youre mean i tell you red tower isnt a place red tower is a man there was a most surprised silence after this astonishing remark a man nobody had thoughtof that jo spoke again pleased at the surprise she had caused his names tower and hes got red hair flaming red so hes called red tower see are you making this up by any chance asked dick after a pause you have made up things before you know all right you can think i made it up then said jo sulkily ill go get yourselves out of this the best you can youre mean she wriggled away but julian caught hold of her arm oh no you dont youll just stay with us now if i have to tie you to me all night long you see we find it difficult to trust you jo and thats your fault not ours but well trust you just this once tell us about red tower and take us to where he lives if you do that well trust you for evermore will dick trust me too said jo trying to get away from julians hand yes said dick shortly he felt as if he would dearly like to smack this unpredictable annoying extraordinary yet somehow likeable ragamuffin girl but i dont feel as if i like you very much at present if you want us to like you as well as to trust you youll have to help us a lot more than you have done all right said jo and she wriggled down again im tired ill show you the way out in the morning and then ill take you to reds but you wont like red hes a beast she would say nothing more so once again they tried to sleep they felt happier now that jo was with them and would show them the right way out of the wood julian hardly thought she would leave them in the lurch now he shut his eyes and was soon dreaming jo woke first she uncurled like an animal and stretched forgetting where she was she woke up the others and they all sat up feeling stiff dirty and hungry im thirsty as well as hungry complained anne where can we get something to eat and drink better get back home for a wash and a meal and to let joan know where we are said julian come on jo show us the way jo led the way immediately the others wondered how in the world she knew it they were even more astonished when they found themselves on the wheelrut path in about two minutes gracious we were as near to it as that said dick and yet we seemed to walk for miles through this horrible wood you did said jo you went round in an enormous circle and you were almost back where you started come on ill take you my way back to your house now its much better than any bus chapter seventeen off in georges boat joan was extremely thankful to see them she had been so worried the night before that if the telephone wires in the house had been mended she would most certainly have rung up the police as it was she couldnt telephone and the night was so dark that she was really afraid of walking all the way down to the village i havent slept all night she declared this mustnt happen again master julian its worrying me to death and now you havent got george or timmy i tell you if they dont turn up soon ill take matters into my own hands i havent heard from your uncle and aunt either lets hope theyre not lost too she bustled about after this outburst and was soon frying sausages and tomatoes for them they couldnt wait till they were cooked and helped themselves to great hunks of bread and butter i cant even go and wash till ive had something said anne im glad you knew so many short cuts back here jo the way didnt seem nearly so long as when we came by bus it had really been amazing to see the deft confident manner in which jo had taken them home through fields and little narrow paths over stiles and across allotments she was never once at a loss they had arrived not long after joan had got up and she had almost cried with surprise and relief when she had seen them walking up the front path and a lot of dirty little tatterdemalions you looked she said as she turned their breakfast out on to a big dish and still do for that matter ill get the kitchen fire going for a bath for you you might all be sister and brothers to that ragamuffin jo jo didnt mind remarks of this sort at all she chewed her bread and grinned she wolfed the breakfast with no manners at all but the others were nearly as bad they were so hungry its a spade and trowel you want for your food this morning not a knife and fork said joan disapprovingly youre just shovelling it in no i cant cook you any more master julian theres not a sausage left in the house nor a bit of bacon either you fill up with toast and marmalade the bath water ran vigorously after breakfast all four had baths jo didnt want to but joan ran after her with a carpet beater vowing and declaring she would beat the dust and dirt out of her if she didnt bath so jo bathed and quite enjoyed it they had a conference after breakfast about this fellow red tower said julian who is he jo what do you know about him not much said jo hes rich and he talks queer and i think hes mad he gets fellows like dad and jake to do his dirty work for him what dirty work asked dick oh stealing and such said jo vaguely i dont really know dad doesnt tell me much i just do what im told and dont ask questions i dont want more slaps than i get where does he live said anne far away hes taken a house on the cliff said jo i dont know the way by land only by boat its a queer place like a small castle almost with very thick stone walls just the place for red my dad says have you been there asked dick eagerly jo nodded oh yes she said twice my dad took a big iron box there once and another time he took something in a sack i went with him why asked julian i shouldnt have thought hed wanted you messing round i rowed the boat said jo i told you reds place is up on the cliff we got to it by boat i dont know the way by road theres a sort of cave behind a cove we landed at and we went in there red met us he came from his house on the cliff he said but i dont know how dick looked at jo closely i suppose youll say next that theres a secret way from the cave to the house he said go on must be said jo she suddenly glared at dick dont you believe me all right find the place yourself well it does sound like a tale in a book said julian youre sure it is all true jo we dont want to go on a wildgoose chase again you know theres no wild goose in my story said jo puzzled she hadnt the faintest idea what a wildgoose chase was im telling you about red im ready to go when you are well have to have a boat though well take georges said dick getting up look jo i think wed better leave anne behind this time i dont like taking her into something that may be dangerous i want to come said anne at once no you stay with me said joan i want company today im getting scared of being by myself with all these things happening you stay with me so anne stayed behind really rather glad and watched the other three go off together jo slipped into the hedge to avoid being seen by jake in case he was anywhere about julian and dick went down to the beach and glanced round to make sure the gipsy was nowhere in sight they beckoned to jo and she came swiftly from hiding and leapt into georges boat she lay down in it so that she couldnt be seen the boys hauled the boat down to the sea dick jumped in and julian pushed off when a big wave came then he jumped in too how far up the coast is it he asked jo who was still at the bottom of the boat i dont know said jo with her usual irritating vagueness two hours three hours maybe time didnt mean the same to jo as it did to the others for one thing jo had no wristwatch as they had always there to be glanced at she wouldnt have found one any use if she had because she couldnt tell the time time was just day and night to her nothing else dick put up the little sail the wind was in their favour so he thought he might as well use it they would get there all the more quickly did you bring the lunch that joan put up for us said julian to dick i cant see it anywhere jo you must be lying on it said dick it wont hurt it said jo she sat up as soon as they were well out to sea and offered to take the tiller she was very deft with it and the boys soon saw that they could leave her to guide the boat julian unfolded the map he had brought with him i wonder whereabouts this place is where red lives he said its pretty desolate all the way up to the next place port limmersley if there is a castlelike building it must be a very lonely place to live in theres not even a little fishing village shown for miles the boat went on and on scudding at times before a fairly strong wind julian took the tiller from jo weve come a long way already he said where is this place are you sure youll know it jo of course said jo scornfully i think its round that faroff rocky cliff she was right as they rounded the high cliff which jutted fiercely with great slanting rocks she pointed in triumph there you are see that place up there thats reds place the boys looked at it it was a dour grey stone building and was as jo had said a little like a small castle it brooded over the sea with one square tower overlooking the waves theres a cove before you come to the place said jo watch out for it its very well hidden it certainly was the boat went right past it before they saw it there it is cried jo urgently they took the sail down and then rowed back the cove lay between two high layers of rock that jutted out from the cliff they rowed right into it it was very quiet and calm there and their boat merely rose and fell as the water swelled and subsided under it can anyone see us from the house above asked dick as they rowed right to the back of the cove i dont know said jo i shouldnt think so look pull the boat up behind that big rock we dont know who else might come here they dragged the boat up dick draped it with great armfuls of seaweed and soon it looked almost like a rock itself now what next said julian wheres this cave you were talking about up here said jo and began to climb up the rocky cliff like a monkey both the boys were very good climbers but soon they found it impossible to get any further jo scrambled down to them whats the matter she said if my dad can climb up surely you can your dad was an acrobat said julian sliding down a few feet much too suddenly oooh i dont much like this i wish we had a rope theres one in the boat ill get it said jo and slithered down the cliff to the cove below at a most alarming rate she limbed up again with the rope she went on a good bit higher and tied the rope to something it hung down to where dick and julian stood clinging for dear life it was much easier to climb up with the help of a rope both boys were soon standing on a ledge looking into a curious shaped cave it was ovalshaped and very dark in here said jo and led the way dick and julian followed stumblingly where in the world were they going to now chapter eighteen things begin to happen jo led them into a narrow rocky tunnel and then out into a wider cave whose walls dripped with damp julian was thankful for his torch it was eerie and chilly and musty he shivered something brushed his face and he leapt back what was that he said bats said jo theres hundreds of them here thats why the place smells so sour come on we go round this rocky bit here into a better cave they squeezed round a rocky corner and came inta a drier cave that did not smell so strongly of bats i havent been any farther than this said jo this is where me and dad came and waited for red he suddenly appeared but i dont know where from well he must have come from somewhere said dick switching on his torch too theres a passage probably well soon find it he and julian began to hunt round the cave looking for a passage or little tunnel or even a hole that led into the cliff upwards towards the house obviously red must have come down some such passage to reach the cave jo stayed in a corner waiting she had no torch suddenly the boys had a tremendous shock a voice boomed into their cave a loud and angry voice that made their hearts beat painfully so you dare to come here jo slipped behind a rock immediately like an animal going to cover the boys stood where they were rooted to the spot where did the voice come from who are you boomed the voice who are you shouted julian come out and show yourself weve come to see a man called red take us to him there was a moments silence as if the owner of the voice was rather taken aback then it boomed out again why do you want to see red who sent you nobody we came because we want our cousin back and her dog too boomed julian making a funnel of his hands and trying to outdo the other voice there was another astonished silence then two legs appeared out of a hole in the low ceiling and someone leapt lightly down beside them the boys started back in surprise they hadnt expected that the voice came from the roof of the cave julian flashed his torch on the man he was a giantlike fellow with flaming red hair his eyebrows were red too and he had a red beard that partly hid a cruel mouth julian took one look into the mans eyes and then no more hes mad he thought so this is red tower what is he a scientist like uncle quentin jealous of uncles work or a thief working on a big scale trying to get important papers and sell them hes mad whatever he is red was looking closely at the two boys so you think i have your cousin he said who told you such a stupid tale julian didnt answer red took a threatening step towards him who told you ill tell you that when the police come said julian boldly red stepped back the police what do they know why should they come here answer me boy theres a lot to know about you mr red tower said julian who sent men to steal my uncles papers who sent a note to ask for another lot who kidnapped our cousin so that she could be held till the papers were sent who brought her here from simmys old caravan who aaaaaah said red and there was panic in his voice how do you know all this it isnt true but the police have they heard this fantastic tale too what do you suppose said julian wishing with all his heart that the police did know and that he was not merely bluffing red pulled at his beard his green eyes gleamed as he thought quickly and urgently he suddenly called loudly turning his head up to the hole in the ceiling markhoff come down two legs were swung down through the hole and a short burly man leapt down beside the two startled boys go down the cliff you will find a boat in the cove somewhere the boat we saw these boys coming in said red sharply smash it to pieces then come back here and take the boys to the yard tie them up we must leave quickly and take the girl with us the man stood listening his face sullen how can we go he said you know the helicopter is not ready you know that make it ready then snapped red we leave tonight the police will be here do you hear that this boy knows everything he has told me and the police must know everything too i tell you we must go what about the dog said the man shoot it ordered red shoot it before we go its a brute of a dog we should have shot it before now go and smash the boat the man disappeared round the rocky corner that led into the cave of bats julian clenched his fist he hated to think of georges boat being smashed to bits red stood there waiting his eyes glinting in the light of the torches id take you with us too if there was room he suddenly snarled at julian yes and drop you into the sea you can tell your uncle hell hear from me about his precious daughter well make an exchange if he wants her back he can send me the notes i want and many thanks for coming to warn me ill be off before the police break in he began to pace up and down the cave muttering dick and julian watched in silence they felt afraid for george would red really take her off in his helicopter he looked mad enough for anything the sullen man came back at last its smashed he said right said red ill go first then the boys then you and boot them if they make any trouble red swung himself up into the hole in the roof julian and dick followed not seeing any point in resisting the man behind was too sulky to stand any nonsense he followed immediately there had been no sign of jo she had kept herself well hidden scared stiff julian didnt know what to do about her he couldnt possibly tell red about her and yet it seemed terrible to leave her behind all alone well she was a sharpbrained little monkey maybe she would think up something for herself red led the way through another cave into a passage with such a low roof that he had to walk bent almost double the man behind had now switched on a very powerful torch and it was easier to see the passage sloped upwards and was obviously leading to the building on the cliff at one part it was so steep that a handrail had been put for the climber to help himself up then came a flight of steps hewn out of the rock itself rough badlyshaped steps so steep that it was quite an effort to climb from one to the next at the top of the steps was a stout door set on a broad ledge red pushed it open and daylight flooded in julian blinked he was looking out on an enormous yard paved with great flat stones with weeds growing in all the crevices and cracks in the middle stood a helicopter it looked very strange and outofplace in that old yard the house with its one tall square tower was built round three sides of the yard it was covered with creeper and thickstemmed ivy a high wall ran along the fourth side with an enormous gate in the middle it was shut and from where he stood julian could see the huge bolts that were drawn across its almost like a small fort thought julian in astonishment then he felt himself seized and taken to a shed nearby his arms were forced behind him and his wrists were tightly tied then the rope was run through an iron loop and tied again julian glared at the burly fellow now doing the same to dick he twisted about to try to see how the rope was tied but he couldnt even turn he was so tightly tethered he looked up at the tower a small forlorn face was looking out of the window there julians heart jumped and beat fast that must be poor old george up there he wondered if she had seen them he hoped not because she would know that he and dick had been captured and she would be very upset where was timmy there seemed no sign of him but wait a minute what was that lying inside what looked like a summerhouse on the opposite side of the yard was it timmy surely he would have barked a welcome when he heard them coming into the yard if it was timmy is that my cousins dog he asked the sullen man the man nodded yes hes been doped half the time he barked so savage brute isnt he ought to be shot i reckon red had gone across the yard and had disappeared through a stone archway the sullen man now followed him julian and dick were left by themselves weve muddled things again said julian with a groan now these fellows will be off and away and take george with them theyve been nicely warned dick said nothing he felt very miserable and his bound wrists hurt him too both boys stood there wondering what would happen to them psssssst what was that julian turned round sharply and looked in the direction of the door that led from underground into the yard jo stood there halfhidden by the archway over the door pssssst ill come and untie you is the coast clear chapter nineteen jo is very surprising jo said the boys together and their spirits lifted at once come on there was no one about in the yard jo skipped lightly across from the doorway and slipped inside the shed theres a knife in my back pocket said julian get it out it would be quicker to cut these ropes than to untie them my word jo i was never so pleased to see anyone in my life jo grinned as she hauled out julians sturdy pocketknife she opened it and ran her thumb lightly over the blade it was beautifully sharp she set to work to saw the blade across the thick rope it cut easily through the fibres i waited behind she said rapidly then i followed when it was safe but it was very dark and i didnt like it then i came to that door and peeped out i was glad when i saw you good thing the men didnt guess you were there said dick good old jo i take back any nasty thing ive ever said about you jo beamed she cut the last bit of rope that bound julian and he swung himself away from the iron loop and began to rub his stiff aching wrists jo set to work on dicks bonds she soon had those cut through too wheres george she asked after she had helped dick to rub his wrists and arms up in that tower said julian if we dared to go out in that yard you could look up and see her and theres poor old tim look halfdoped lying in that summerhouse place over there i shant let him be shot said jo hes a nice dog i shall go and drag him down into those caves underground not now said julian horrified if youre seen now youll spoil everything well all be tied up then but jo had already darted over to the summerhouse and was fondling poor old timmy the slam of a door made the boys jump and sent jo into the shadows at the back of the summerhouse at once it was red coming across the yard quick hes coming over here said dick in a panic lets get back to the iron loops and put our hands behind us so that he thinks were still bound so when red came over to the door of the shed it looked exactly as if the boys still had their hands tied behind them he laughed you can stay here till the police come he said then he shut the shed door and locked it he strolled over to the helicopter and examined it thoroughly then back he went to the door he had come from opened it and slammed it shut he was gone when everything was quiet jo sped back from the summerhouse to the shed she unlocked the door of the shed come out she said and well lock it again then nobody will know you arent here hurry there was nothing for it but to come out and hope there was nobody looking jo locked the shed door after them and hurried them back to the door that led underground they slipped through it and halffell down the steep steps thanks jo said dick they sat down julian scratched his head and for the life of him could not think of anything sensible to do the police were not coming because they didnt know a thing about red or where george was or anything and before long george would be flown off in that helicopter and timmy would be shot julian thought of the high square tower and groaned theres no way of getting george out of that tower he said aloud itll be locked and barred or george would have got out at once we cant even get to her its no good trying to make our way into the house wed be seen and caught at once jo looked at dick do you badly want george to be rescued she said thats a silly question said dick i want it more than anything else in the world well ill go and get her then said jo and she got up as if she really meant it dont make jokes now said julian this really is serious jo well so am i retorted jo ill get her out you see if i dont then youll know im trustable wont you you think im mean and thieving and not worth a penny and i expect youre right but i can do some things you cant and if you want this thing ill do it for you how said julian astonished and disbelieving jo sat down again you saw that tower didnt you she began well its a big one so i reckon theres more than one room in it and if i can get into the room next to georges i could undo her door and set her free and how do you think youre going to get into the room next to hers said dick scornfully climb up the wall of course said jo its set thick with ivy ive often climbed up walls like that the boys looked at her were you the face at the window by any chance said julian remembering annes fright i bet you were youre like a monkey climbing and darting about but you cant climb up that great high wall so dont think it youd fall and be killed we couldnt let you pooh said jo with great scorn fall off a wall like that ive climbed up a wall without any ivy at all theres always holes and cracks to hold on to that one would be easy julian was quite dumbfounded to think that jo really meant all this dick remembered that jos father was an acrobat perhaps that kind of thing was in the family you just ought to see me on a tightrope said jo earnestly i can dance on it and i never have a safetynet underneath thats babyplay well im going without another word she climbed the steep steps lightly as a goat and stood poised in the archway of the door all was quiet like a squirrel she leapt and bounded over the courtyard and came to the foot of the ivycovered tower julian and dick were now at the doorway that led into the yard watching her shell be killed said julian talk about pluck said dick i never saw such a kid in my life there she goes just like a monkey and sure enough up the ivy went jo climbing lightly and steadily her hands reached out and tested each ivystem before she threw her weight on it and her feet tried each one too before she stood on it once she slipped when an ivystem came away from the wall julian and dick watched their hearts in their mouths but jo merely clutched at another piece of stem and steadied herself once then up she went again up and up past the first storey past the second and up to the third only one more now and she would be up to the topmost one she seemed very small as she neared the top i cant bear to look and i cant bear not to said dick pretending to shield his eyes and almost trembling with nervousness if she fell now what should we do do shut up said julian between his teeth she wont fall shes like a cat there shes making for the window next to georges its open at the bottom jo now sat triumphantly on the broad windowsill of the room next to georges she waved impudently to the boys far below then she pushed with all her might at the window to open it a little more it wouldnt budge so jo laid herself flat and by dint of much wriggling and squeezing she managed to slip through the narrow space between the bottom of the windowpane and the sill she disappeared from sight both boys heaved heartfelt sighs of relief dick found that his knees were shaking he and julian retired into the underground passage below the steep steps and sat there in silence worse than a circus said dick at last ill never be able to watch acrobats again whats she doing now do you suppose jo was very busy she had fallen off the inside windowsill with a bump and bruised herself on the floor below but she was used to bruises she picked herself up and shot behind a chair in case anyone had heard her nobody seemed to have heard anything so she peeped cautiously out the room was furnished with enormous pieces of furniture old and heavy dust was on everything and cobwebs hung down from the stone ceiling jo tiptoed to the door her feet were bare and made no sound at all she looked out there was a spiral stone stairway nearby going downwards and on each side was a door there must be four rooms in the tower then one for each corner two windows in each she looked at the door next to the room she was in that must be the door of georges room there was a very large key in the lock and a great bolt had been drawn across jo leapt across and dragged at the bolt it made a loud noise and she darted back into the room again but still nobody came back she went to the door again and this time turned the enormous key it was well oiled and turned easily jo pushed open the door and put her head cautiously round george was there a thin and unhappy george sitting by the window she stared at jo as if she couldnt believe her eyes psssst said jo enjoying all this very much indeed ive come to get you out chapter twenty the adventure boils up george looked as if she had seen a ghost jo she whispered it cant really be you it is feel said jo and pattered across the room to give george quite a hard pinch then she pulled at her arm come on she said we must go before red comes hurry i dont want to be caught george got up as if she was in a dream she went across to the door she and jo slipped out and stood at the top of the spiral staircase have to go down here i suppose said jo she cocked her head and listened then she went down a few steps and turned the first spiral bend but before she had gone down more than a dozen steps she stopped in fright somebody was coming up in panic jo ran up again and pushed george roughly into the room she had climbed into first of all someones coming she panted now were finished its that redhaired man i expect said george he comes up three or four times a day and tries to make me tell him about my fathers work but i dont know a thing what are we to do the slow steps came up and up sounding hollowly on the stone stairs they could hear a panting breath now too an idea came to jo she put her mouth close to georges ear listen we look awfully alike ill let myself be caught and locked up in that room and you take the chance to slip down and go to dick and julian red will never know im not you weve even got the same clothes on now because joan gave me old ones of yours no said george astounded youll be caught i dont want you to do that youve got to whispered jo fiercely dont be daft i can open the window and climb down the ivy easy as winking when reds gone its your only chance theyre going to take you off in that helicopter tonight the footsteps were now at the top jo pushed george well behind a curtain and whispered fiercely again anyway im not really doing this for you im doing it for dick you keep there and ill do the rest there was a loud exclamation when the man outside discovered the door of georges room open he went in quickly and found nobody there out he came and yelled down the stairs markhoff the doors open and the girls gone who opened the door markhoff came up two steps at a time looking bewildered no one who could anyway the girl cant be far off ive been in the room below all the time since i locked her in last time id have seen her if shes gone who unlocked the door screamed red quite beside himself with anger weve got to have that girl to bargain with well she must be in one of the other rooms said markhoff stolidly quite unmoved by his masters fury he went into one on the opposite side to the room where jo and george crouched trembling then he came into their room and at once saw the top of jos head showing behind the chair he pounced on her and dragged her out here she is he said and didnt seem to realize that it was not george at all but jo with their short hair freckled faces and their similar clothes they really were alike jo yelled and struggled most realistically nobody would have guessed that she had planned to be caught and locked up george shook and shivered behind the curtain longing to go to jos help but knowing that it wouldnt be of the least use besides there might be a chance now of finding timmy it had almost broken georges heart to be parted from him for so long jo was dragged yelling and kicking into the room and locked in again red and markhoff began to quarrel about which of them must have left the door unlocked you were there last said red well if i was i tell you i didnt leave the door unlocked markhoff raged back i wouldnt be so fatheaded thats the kind of thing you do thatll do snapped red have you shot that dog yet no you havent go down and do it before he escapes too georges heart went stonecold shoot timmy oh no dear darling old timmy she couldnt let him be shot she didnt know what to do she heard red and markhoff go down the stone stairway their boots making a terrific noise at first and then gradually becoming fainter she slipped down after them they went into a nearby room still arguing george risked being seen and shot past the open door she came to another stairway not a spiral one this time and went down it so fast that she almost lost her footing down and down and down she met nobody at all what a very strange place this was she came into a dark enormous hall that smelt musty and old she ran to the great door at the front and tried to open it it was very heavy but at last it swung slowly back she stood there in the bright sunlight peering out cautiously she knew where timmy was she had been able to see him sometimes flopping queerly in and out of the summerhouse she knew that because of his continual barking he had been doped red had told her that when she had asked him he enjoyed making her miserable poor george she tore across the courtyard and came to the summerhouse timmy was there lying as if he were asleep george flung herself on him her arms round his thick neck timmy oh timmy she cried and couldnt see him for tears timmy far away in some drugged dream heard the voice he loved best in all the world he stirred he opened his eyes and saw george he was too heavy with his sleep to do more than lick her face then his eyes dosed again george was in despair she was afraid markhoff would come and shoot him in a very short time timmy she called in his ear timmy do wake up timmy tim opened his eyes again what his mistress still here then it couldnt be a dream perhaps his world would soon be right again timmy didnt understand at all what had been happening the last few days he staggered to his feet somehow and stood swaying there shaking his head george put her hand on his collar thats right tim she said now you come with me quick but timmy couldnt walk though he had managed to stand in despair george glanced over the courtyard fearful that she would see markhoff coming at any moment she saw somebody else she saw julian standing in an archway opposite staring at her she was too upset about timmy even to feel much astonishment ju she called come and help me with timmy theyre going to shoot him in a trice julian and dick shot across the courtyard to george what happened jo said julian did you find george ju its me george said george and julian suddenly saw that indeed it was george herself he had been so certain that it was still jo that he hadnt known it was george help me with timmy said george and she pulled at the heavy dog where shall we hide him down underground said dick its the only place come on how they managed it they never quite knew but they did drag the heavy stupid timmy all the way across the yard and into the archway they opened the door and shoved him inside poor timmy fell over and immediately rolled down the steep steps landing at the bottom with a frightful thud george gave a little scream hell be hurt but astonishingly enough timmy didnt seem to be hurt at all in fact the shaking seemed to have done him good he got up and looked round him in rather a surprised way then he whined and looked up at george he tried to climb the steep steps but wasnt lively enough george was down beside him in a moment patting him and stroking him the two boys joined in timmy began to feel that things might be all right again if only he could get rid of the dreadful heavy feeling in his head he couldnt understand why he kept wanting to lie down and go to sleep bring him right down to the caves said dick those men are sure to hunt for him and for us too when they find timmy gone and us not in the shed so down the narrow passages and into the little cave with the hole in the roof they all went timmy feeling as if he didnt quite know which of his legs to use next they all sat down in a heap together when they got there and george got as close to timmy as she could she was glad when the boys switched off their torches she badly wanted to cry and as she never did cry it was most embarrassing if anyone saw her she told the boys in a low voice all that had happened with jo she made me stay hidden so that she could be caught she said shes wonderful shes the bravest girl i ever knew and she did it all even though she doesnt like me shes a queer one said dick shes all right at heart though very much all right they talked quickly in low voices exchanging their news george told them how she had been caught and taken to the caravan with timmy who had been knocked out with a cudgel we saw where you had written reds name said dick that gave us the clue to come here listen said julian suddenly i think we ought to make a plan quickly i keep thinking i hear things were sure to be looked for soon you know what can we do chapter twentyone a few surprises as soon as julian had said that he kept hearing noises the others felt as if they could hear some too they sat and listened intently georges heart beating so loudly that she was certain the boys would be able to hear it i think perhaps its the sound of the sea echoing in through the caves and the tunnels said julian at last in the ordinary way of course we wouldnt need to bother to listen timmy would growl at once but poor old chap hes so doped and sleepy that i dont believe he hears anything will he get all right again asked george anxiously fondling timmys silky ears oh yes said julian sounding much more certain than he really felt poor timmy he really did seem ill there wasnt even a growl in him youve had an awful time these last few days havent you george asked dick yes said george i dont much want to talk about it if id had timmy with me it wouldnt have been so bad but at first when they brought me here all i knew of timmy was hearing him bark and snarl and bark and snarl down below in that yard then red told me he had doped him how did you get to reds place asked julian well you know i was locked in that horriblesmelling caravan said george then suddenly a man called simmy hes jos father i think came and dragged us out timmy was all stupid with the blow theyd given him and they put him in a sack and put us both on the caravan horse and took us through the wood and along a desolate path by the coast till we came here that was in the middle of the night poor old george said julian i wish tim was himself again id love to set him loose on red and the other fellow i wonder whats happening to jo said dick suddenly remembering that jo was now imprisoned in the tower room where george had been kept so long and do you suppose red and markhoff have discovered that weve got out of that shed and that timmy has disappeared too said julian theyll be in a fury when they do discover it cant we get away said george feeling suddenly scared you came in a boat didnt you well cant we get away in that and go and fetch help for jo there was a silence neither of the boys liked to tell george that her beloved boat had been smashed to pieces by markhoff but she had to know of course and julian told her in a few short words george said nothing at all they all sat silently for a few minutes hearing nothing but timmys heavy almost snoring breathing would it be possible when its dark to creep up into the courtyard and go round the walls to the big gate said dick breaking the silence we cant escape anywhere down here its certain not without a boat anyhow should we wait till red and markhoff have gone off in the helicopter said julian then wed be much safer yes but what about jo asked dick they think shes george dont they and theyll take her away with them just as they planned to do with george i dont see how we can try to escape ourselves without first trying to save jo shes been a brick about george they talked round and round the idea of trying to save jo but nobody could think of any really sensible plan at all time went on and they all felt hungry and rather cold if only we could do something it wouldnt be so bad groaned dick i wonder whats happening up at the house up at the grey stone house with its big squaretower plenty was happening to begin with markhoff had gone to shoot timmy as red had ordered but when he got to the summerhouse there was no dog there markhoff stared in the greatest amazement the dog had been tied up even though he was doped and now there was the loose rope and no dog attached to it markhoff gazed round the summerhouse in astonishment who could have loosed timmy he darted across to the locked shed where he had tied julian and dick with rope to the iron staples the door was still locked of course and markhoff turned the key and pushed it open here you he began shouting roughly then he stopped dead nobody was there again there was loose rope this time cut here and there so that it lay in short pieces and again the prisoners had gone no dog no boys markhoff couldnt believe his eyes he looked all round the shed but it was locked from the outside he muttered whats all this whos freed the dog and the boys what will red say markhoff looked at the helicopter standing ready for flight in the middle of the yard and half decided to desert red and get away himself then remembering reds mad tempers and his cruel revenges on anyone who dared to let him down he changed his mind wed better get off now before its dark he thought theres something queer going on here there must be somebody else here that we know nothing about id better find red and tell him he went in through the massive front door and in the hall he came face to face with two men waiting there at first he couldnt see who they were and he stepped back hurriedly then he saw it was simmy and jake what are you doing here shouted markhoff werent you told to keep watch on kirrin cottage and make sure the police werent told anything yes said jake sulkily and weve come to say that that cook woman called joan went down to the police this morning she had one of the kids with her a girl the boys dont seem to be about no theyre here at least they were said markhoff theyve disappeared again as for the police weve heard theyre on the way and weve made our plans youre a bit late with your news lot of good you are with your spying clear off now were taking the girl off in the helicopter before the police come how did anyone know where the girl was have you been spilling the beans pah said simmy contemptuously think we want to be messed up with the police you must be mad we want some money weve done all your dirty work and youve only paid us half you promised give us the rest you can ask red for it growled markhoff whats the good of asking me go and ask him right we will said jake his face as black as thunder weve done all he told us took the papers for him took the girl and that savage brute of a dog too see where he bit me on my hand and all we get is half our money i reckon weve only just come in time too planning to go off in that there helithing and do us out of our pay pah wheres red demanded simmy upstairs said markhoff ive got some bad news for him so he wont be pleased to see you and your ugly mugs better let me find him for you and say what ive got to say then you can chip in with your polite little speeches funny arent you said jake in a dangerous voice neither he nor simmy liked markhoff they followed him up the broad stairway and then up again till they came to the room that lay below the spiral staircase red was there scanning through the papers that had been stolen from the study of georges father he was in a black temper he flung down the papers as markhoff came in these arent the notes i wanted he began loudly well ill hold the girl till i get why markhoff whats up anything wrong plenty said markhoff the dogs gone he wasnt there when i went to shoot him and the two boys have gone too yes escaped out of a locked shed beats me and here are two visitors for you they want money theyve come to tell you what you already know the police have been told about you red went purple in the face and his strange eyes shone with rage he stared first at markhoff then at simmy and jake markhoff looked uneasy but simmy and jake looked back insolently you you you dare to come here when i told you to keep away he shouted youve been paid you cant blackmail me for any more money what he would have said next nobody knew because from up the spiral stairs there came yells and screams and the noise of someone apparently trying to batter down a door thats that girl i suppose muttered markhoff whats up with her shes been quiet enough before wed better get her out now and go said red his face still purple jake go and get her bring her down here and knock some sense into her if she goes on screaming fetch her yourself said jake insolently red looked at markhoff who immediately produced a revolver my orders are always obeyed said red in a suddenly cold voice always you understand not only jake scuttled up the stairs then but also simmy they went to the locked and bolted room at the top and unlocked the door they pulled back the bolt and door simmy stepped into the room to deal with the imprisoned girl but he stopped dead and gaped he blinked rubbed his eyes and gaped again jake gaped too hallo dad said jo you do seem surprised to see me chapter twentytwo jo is very smart jo said simmy well of all the well jo jake recovered first whats all this he said roughly to simmy whats jo doing here how did she get here wheres the other kid the one we caught how do i know said simmy still staring at jo look here jo what are you doing here go on tell us and wheres the other kid hunt round the room and see if you can find her said jo brightly keeping on her toes in case her father or jake was going to pounce on her the two men looked hurriedly round the room jake went to a big cupboard yes she might be in there said jo enjoying herself you have a good look the two bewildered men didnt know what to think they had come to get george and had only found jo but how why what had happened they didnt know what to do neither of them wanted to go back and tell red so they began to search the room feverishly looking into likely and unlikely places with jo jeering at them all the time better take the drawers out of that chest and see if shes here and dont forget to look under the rug thats right jake poke your head up the chimney mind george doesnt kick soot down into your eyes ill lam you in a minute growled jake furiously opening a small cupboard door an angry voice came up the stairway jake what are you doing up there bring that kid down shes not here yelled back jake suddenly losing his temper what have you done with her shes gone red came tearing up two steps at a time his eyes narrow with anger the first thing he saw in the room was jo and of course he thought she was george what do you mean saying shes not here he raged are you mad nope said jake his eyes narrow too not so mad as you are anyway red this kid isnt that fellows daughter the scientist chap we took the papers from this is simmys kid jo red looked at jake as if he had gone off his head then he looked at jo he could see no difference between jo and the absent george at all short hair freckles turnedup nose he couldnt believe that she was simmys daughter in fact he didnt believe it he thought jake and simmy were suddenly deceiving him for some strange reason but jo had a word to say too yes im jo she said im not georgina shes gone im just jo and simmys my dad youve come to save me havent you dad simmy hadnt come to do anything of the sort of course he stared helplessly at jo completely bewildered red completely lost his temper as soon as he heard jos voice he realized she was not george somehow or other he had been deceived and seeing that this was simmys daughter then it must be simmy who had had a hand in the deception he went suddenly over to simmy and struck him hard his eyes blazing have you doublecrossed me he shouted simmy was sent flying to the floor jake came up immediately to help him he tripped up red and leapt on him jo looked at the three struggling shouting men and shrugged her shoulders let them fight they had forgotten all about her and that suited her very well she ran to the door and was just going down the stairs when an idea came into her sharp little mind with an impish grin she turned back she pulled the door to quietly and then she turned the key in the lock and shot the bolt the three men inside heard the key turn and in a trice jake was at the door pulling at the handle shes locked us in he raged and shot the bolt too yell for markhoff shouted red trembling with fury and markhoff left down in the room at the bottom of the stairs suddenly heard yells and shouts and tremendous hammerings at the door he tore up at once wondering what in the world had happened jo was hiding in the next room as soon as markhoff went to the door and shot back the bolt she slipped out and was down the spiral stairway in a trice unseen by markhoff she grinned to herself and hugged something to her thin little chest it was the big key belonging to the door upstairs nobody could unlock that door now the key was missing jo had it unlock the door shouted red that kids gone theres no key yelled back markhoff she must have taken it ill go after her but it was one thing to go after jo and quite another to find her she seemed to have disappeared into thin air markhoff raged through every room but she was nowhere to be seen he went out into the courtyard and looked round there actually she had made her way to the kitchen and found the larder she was very hungry and wanted something to eat there was nobody in the kitchen at all though a fine fire burned in the big range there she slipped into the larder took the key from the outer side of the door and locked herself in she saw that there was a small window and she carefully unfastened it so that she could make her escape if anyone discovered that she was locked in the larder then she tucked in three sausage rolls a large piece of cheese a hunk of bread half a meat pie and two jam tarts went the same way after that jo felt a lot better she remembered the others and thought how hungry they must be feeling too she found a rush bag hanging on a nail and slipped some food into it more sausage rolls some rockbuns some cheese and bread now if only she could find the others how they would welcome her jo put the big key at the bottom of the rush basket she was feeling very very pleased with herself red and simmy and jake were all nicely locked up and out of the way she didnt fear markhoff as much as red she was sure she could get away from him she wasnt even sorry for her father simmy she had no love for him and no respect because he was everything that a father shouldnt be she heard markhoff come raging into the kitchen and she clambered quickly up on the larder shelf ready to drop out of the window if he tried the door but he didnt he raged out again and she heard him no more jo unlocked the door very cautiously there was now an old woman in the kitchen standing by the table folding some clothes she had brought in from the clothes line in the yard she stared in the greatest surprise at jo peeping out of the larder what she began indignantly but jo was out of the room before she had even got out the next word the old dame waddled over to the larder and began to wail as she saw all the empty plates and dishes jo went cautiously into the front hall she could hear markhoff upstairs still tearing about she smiled delightedly and slipped over to the door she undid it and pulled it open then keeping to the wall she sidled like a weasel to the door that led underground she opened it and went through shutting it softly behind her now to find the others she felt sure they must be down in the caves how pleased they would be with the food in her bag she halffell down the steep steps and made her way as quickly as she could down the slanting passage she had no torch and had to feel her way in the dark she wasnt in the least afraid only when she trod on a sharp stone with her bare foot did she make a sound the other three julian dick and george were still sitting crouched together with timmy in the centre julian had been once up to the door that led into the yard and had cautiously peered out to see what was to be seen but had seen nothing at all except for an old woman hanging out some clothes on a line the three had decided to wait till night before they did anything they thought maybe timmy might have recovered a little then and would be of some help in protecting them against red or markhoff they halfdozed sitting together for warmth enjoying the heat of timmys big body timmy growled yes he actually growled a thing he hadnt done at all so far george put a warning hand on him they all sat up listening a voice came to them julian dick where are you ive lost my way its jo cried dick and switched on his torch at once here we are jo how did you escape whats happened heaps said jo and came gladly over to them my it was dark up in those passages without a torch somehow i went the wrong way thats why i yelled but i hadnt gone far wrong have a sausage roll what cried three hungry voices and even timmy lifted his head and began to sniff at the rush basket that jo carried jo laughed and opened the basket she handed out all the food and the three of them fell on it like wolves jo youre the eighth wonder of the world said dick is there anything left in the basket yes said jo and took out the enormous key this look i locked red and jake and simmy into that tower room and heres the key what do you think of that chapter twentythree markhoff goes hunting george took the big key and looked at it with awe jo is this really the key and youve locked them all in honestly i think youre a marvel she is said dick and to jos enormous delight he gave her a sudden quick hug i never knew such a girl in my life never shes got the pluck of twenty it was easy really said jo her eyes shining joyfully in the light of the torch you trust me now dick dont you you wont be mean to me any more any of you will you of course not said julian youre our friend for ever not georges said jo at once oh yes you are said george i take back every single mean thing i said about you youre as good as a boy this was the very highest compliment that george could ever pay any girl jo beamed and gave george a light punch i did it all for dick really she said but next time ill do it for you goodness i hope there wont be a next time said george with a shiver i cant say i enjoyed one single minute of the last few days timmy suddenly put his head on jos knee she stroked him look at that she said he remembers me hes better isnt he george george carefully removed timmys head from jos knee to her own she felt decidedly friendly towards jo now but not to the extent of having timmy put his head on jos knee she patted him yes hes better she said he ate half the sausage roll i gave him though he sniffed at it like anything first i think he knows something has been put into his food and now hes suspicious of it good old timmy they all felt much more lively and cheerful now that they were no longer so dreadfully empty julian looked at his watch its getting on towards evening now he said i wonder what all those fellows are doing three of them were still locked up no matter how markhoff had tried to batter in the door it held it was old and immensely strong and the lock held without showing any sign of giving way even an eighth of an inch two other men had been called in from the garage to help but except that the door looked decidedly worse for wear it stood there just the same sturdy and unbreakable simmy and jake watched red as he walked up and down the tower room like a caged lion they were glad they were two against one he seemed like a madman to them as he raged and paced up and down markhoff outside with the other two men he had brought up to help was getting very worried no police had arrived as yet but red and markhoff didnt know this they felt sure that a police ambush was somewhere nearby if only they could get away in the helicopter before anything else happened markhoff take carl and tom and go down into those underground caves ordered red at last those children are sure to be there its the only place for them to hide they cant get out of here because the front gate is locked and bolted and the walls too high to climb get hold of the kids and search them for the key so markhoff and two burly fellows went downstairs and out of the door they crossed the yard to the door that led to the caves they got down the steep steps and were soon stumbling along the narrow slanting passage their nailed boots making a great noise as they went they hung on to the handrail when they came to the difficult stretch of tunnel and finally came out into the cave that had the hole in the floor there was nobody there the children had heard the noise of the coming men and had hurriedly swung themselves down through the hole into the cave below they ran through into another cave the sour smelling one where bats lived and slept then round the rocky corner into the first cave the curious ovalshaped one that led out to the ledge of rock overlooking the steep cliff theres nowhere to hide groaned julian he looked back into the cave at least it was better in there than out on this ledge outlined by the daylight he pulled the others back into the cave and shone his torch up and down the walls to find some corner that they could squeeze behind halfway up the wall was a shelf of rock he hoisted george up there and she dragged timmy up too poor timmy he wasnt much use to them he was still so bemused and so very sleepy he had growled at the noise made by the coming men but had dropped his head again almost immediately dick got up beside george julian found a juttingout rock and tried to hide behind it while jo lay down in a hole beside one wall and covered herself cleverly with sand julian couldnt help thinking how sharp jo was she always seemed to know the best thing to do but as it happened jo was the only one to be discovered it was quite by accident markhoff trod on her he and the other two men had let themselves down through the hole into the cave below had then gone into the cave of bats seen no sign of anyone there and were now in the cave that led to the cliff those kids arent here said one of the men theyve gone to hide somewhere else what a horrible place this is lets go back markhoff was flashing his torch up and down the walls to see if any of the children were crouching behind a jutting rock and he trod heavily on jos hand she gave an agonized yell and markhoff almost dropped his torch in a trice he had pulled the girl out of her bed of sand and was shaking her like a rat this is the one we want he said to the others shes got the key where is it you little rat give it to me or ill throw you down the cliff julian was horrified he felt quite certain that markhoff really would throw jo down the cliff and he was just about to jump down to help her when he heard her speak all right let me go you brute heres the key you go and let my dad out before the police come i dont want him caught markhoff gave an exclamation of triumph and snatched a shining key out of jos hand he gave her a resounding box on the ear you little toad you can just stay down here with the others and itll be a very very long stay do you know what were going to do were going to roll a big rock over the hole in that other caves roof and youll be prisoners you cant escape upwards and you wont be able to escape downwards youll be dashed on the rocks by the sea if you try to swim away thatll teach you to interfere the other two men guffawed good idea mark said one theyll all be nicely boxed up here and nobody will know where they are come on weve no time to lose if red isnt unlocked soon hell go mad they made their way into the heart of the cliff again and the listening children heard their footsteps getting fainter finally they ceased altogether as one by one the men levered themselves up through the hole in the roof of the last cave and disappeared up the narrow lowroofed tunnel that led to the courtyard julian came out from his hidingplace looking grim and rather scared thats done it he said if those fellows really do block up that hole and i bet they have already it looks as if were here for keeps as he said we cant get up and we cant escape down the seas too rough for us to attempt any swimming and the cliffs unclimbable above the ledge ill go and have a look and see if they have blocked up that hole said dick they may be bluffing but it hadnt been bluff when julian and dick shone their torches on to the hole in the roof they saw that a great rock was now blocking it up they could not get through the hole again it was impossible to move the rock from below they went soberly back to the front cave and sat out on the ledge in the light of the sinking sun its a pity poor jo was found said george and an even greater pity she had to give up the key now red and the others will go free they wont said jo surprisingly i didnt give them the key of the tower room id another key with me the key of the kitchen larder and i gave them that well im blessed said julian astounded the things you do jo but how on earth did you happen to have the key of the larder jo told them how she had taken it out and locked herself in when she was having a meal there i had to unlock the door to get out again of course she said and i thought id take that key too because who knows i might have wanted to get into that larder again and lock myself in with the food no one will ever get the better of you jo said dick with the utmost conviction never youre as cute as a bagful of monkeys so youve still got the right key with you yes said jo and red and my dad and jake are still locked up in the tower room but suddenly a most disagreeable thought struck dick wait a bit he said whats going to happen when they find theyve got the wrong key theyll be down here again and my word whatll happen to us all then chapter twentyfour a grand surprise the thought that the men might soon return even angrier than they had been before was most unpleasant as soon as markhoff tries the key in the door of the tower room hell find it wont unlock it and hell know that jo has tricked him said george and then hell be in such a fury that hell tear down here again and goodness knows what will happen to us groaned julian what shall we do hide again no said dick lets get out of here and climb down the cliff to the sea id feel safer there than up here in this cave we might be able to find a better hidingplace down on the rocks in that little cove its a pity my boats smashed said george with a sigh for her lovely boat and i say how are we going to get old timmy down there was a conference about this timmy couldnt climb down that was certain jo remembered the rope still hanging down the side of the cliff to the ledges below the one she had tied there to help julian and dick climb up the steep sides of the cliff i know she said her quick mind working hard again you go down first julian then dick then george can go each of you holding on to the rope as you climb down in case you fall then ill haul up the rope and tie old timmy to it round his waist and ill lower him down to you hes so sleepy still he wont struggle he wont even know whats happening but what about you said dick youll be last of all will you mind youll be all alone up on this ledge with the men coming behind you at any minute no i dont mind said jo but lets be quick julian went down first glad of the rope to hold to as his feet and hands searched for crevices and cracks then came dick almost slipping in his anxiety to get down then george climbed down slowly and anxiously not at all liking the steep cliff once she glanced down to the sea below and felt sick she shut her eyes for a moment and clung with one hand to the rope it was a dreadful business getting timmy down george stood below anxiously waiting jo found it very difficult to tie timmy safely he was big and heavy and didnt like being tied up at all though he really seemed hardly to know what was going on at last jo had got the knots well and securely tied and called out to the others here he comes watch out that the rope doesnt break oh dear i wish he wouldnt struggle now hes bumped himself against the cliff it was not at all a nice experience for poor timmy he swung to and fro on the rope as he was slowly let down and was amazed to find that he was suspended in mid air above him jo panted and puffed oh hes so awfully heavy i hope i shant have to let go look out for him she screamed the weight was too much for her just at the last and the rope was let out with rather a rush fortunately timmy was only about six feet up then and julian and george managed to catch him as he suddenly descended im coming now called jo and without even holding the rope or looking at it she climbed down like a monkey seeming to find handholds and footholds by magic the others watched her admiringly soon she was standing beside them george was untying timmy thanks awfully jo said george looking up gratefully at jo youre a wonder tim must have been frightfully heavy he was said jo giving him a pat i nearly dropped him well whats the next move well hunt round this queer little cove a bit and see if theres any place we can hide said julian you go that way george and well go this they parted and began to hunt for a hidingplace as far as julian and dick could see there was none at all at least on the side they were exploring the sea swept into the cove swelling and subsiding and just outside the great waves battered on to the rocks there was certainly no chance of swimming out there was suddenly an excited shriek from george ju come here look what ive found they all rushed round to where george was standing behind a big ledge of rock she pointed to a great mass of something draped with seaweed a boat its covered with seaweed but its a boat its your boat yelled dick suddenly and began to pull the fronds of seaweed madly off the hidden boat markhoff didnt smash it its here perfectly all right he couldnt find it it was hidden so well with seaweed so he just came back to red and told him a lie he didnt smash it shouted jo and she too began to pull away the seaweed its quite all right theres nothing wrong with it he didnt smash it the four children were so tremendously surprised and joyful that they thumped each other ridiculously on the back and leapt about like mad things they had their boat after all georges good sound boat they could escape hip hip hurrah a roar from above made them fall silent they gazed up startled markhoff and the other two men were on the ledge far above shouting and shaking their fists you wait till we get you yelled markhoff quick quick said julian urgently pulling at the boat weve got just a chance pull her down to the water pull hard markhoff was now coming down the cliff and jo wished she had untied the rope before she herself had climbed down for markhoff was finding it very useful she tugged at the boat with the others wishing it wasnt so heavy the boat was almost down to the water when something happened timmy who had been gazing at everything in a most bewildered manner suddenly slid off the ledge he was on and fell straight into the sea george gave a scream oh timmy hes in the water quick quick hes too doped to swim hell drown julian and dick didnt dare to stop heaving at the boat because they could see that markhoff would soon be down beside them george rushed to timmy who was splashing around in the waves still looking surprised and bemused but the water had an amazing effect on him it was cold and it seemed to bring him to his senses quite suddenly he became much more lively and swam strongly to the rock off which he had slipped he clambered out with georges help barking loudly the boat slid into the water and julian grabbed at george come on in you get buck up jo was in the boat and so was dick george trying to clutch at timmy was hauled in too julian took a despairing look at markhoff who was almost at the end of the rope about to jump down they just wouldnt get off in time timmy suddenly slipped out of georges grasp and tore madly over to the cliff barking warningly he seemed to be perfectly all right the sudden coldness of the sea had washed away all his dopeyness and sleepiness timmy was himself again markhoff was about five feet above the ledge when he heard timmy barking he looked down in horror and saw the big dog trying to jump up at him he tried to climb up quickly out of timmys reach woof barked timmy woof woof woof grrrrrrr look out hell have your foot off yelled one of the men above on the ledge hes mad angry hes savage look out mark markhoff was looking out he was terrified he clambered up another few feet and then found that timmy was making runs at the cliff to try and get up after him he went up a bit further and clung to the rope with one hand afraid of falling and being pounced on by the furious timmy come on timmy suddenly cried george come on the four of them had now got the boat on the waves and if only they had timmy they could set off and row round the rocks at the cave entrance before markhoff could possibly reach them timmy timmy timmy heard cast a last regretful look at markhoffs legs and bounded across to the boat he leapt right in and stood there still barking madly markhoff dropped down the rope to the ledge but he was too late the boat shot out to the entrance of the cove and rounded it in half a minute it had disappeared round the rocky corner and was out at sea julian and dick rowed steadily george put her arms round timmy and buried her face in his fur jo did the same hes all right again quite all right said george happily yes falling into the cold water did it agreed jo ruffling up his fur good old timmy timmy was now snuffling about in the bottom of the boat joyfully he had smelt a lovely smell jo wondered what he had found then she knew its the packet of sandwiches we brought with us in the boat and never ate she cried good old timmy hes wolfing the lot let him said julian pulling hard at the oars he deserves them all my word its nice to hear his bark again and see his tail wagging and wag it certainly did it never stopped the world had come right again for timmy he could see and hear properly again he could bark and caper and jump and he had his beloved george with him once more now for home said julian anne will be pleased to see us gosh what a time weve had chapter twentyfive everything okay it was getting dark as georges boat came into kirrin bay it had seemed a very long pull indeed and everyone was tired out the girls had helped in the rowing when the boys had almost collapsed from exhaustion and timmy had cheered everyone up by his sudden high spirits honestly his tail hasnt stopped wagging since he got into the boat said george hes so pleased to be himself again a small figure was on the beach as they came in halflost in the darkness it was anne she called out to them in a trembling voice is it really you ive been watching for you all day long are you all right rather and weve got george and timmy too shouted back dick as the boat scraped on the shingle were fine they jumped out timmy too and hauled the boat up the beach anne gave a hand almost crying with joy to have them all again its bad enough being in the middle of an adventure she said but its much much worse when youre left out ill never be left out again woof said timmy wagging his tail in full agreement he never wanted to be left out of adventures either they all went home rather slowly because they were so tired joan was on the lookout for them as she had been all day she screamed for joy when she saw george george youve got george at last oh you bad children youve been away all day and i didnt know where and ive been worried to death george are you all right yes thank you said george who felt as if she was about to fall asleep at any moment i just want something to eat before i fall absolutely sound asleep but where have you been all day what have you been doing cried joan as she bustled off to get them a meal i got so worked up i went to the police and what a silly i felt i couldnt tell them where youd gone or anything all i could say was youd gone to find a man called red and had rowed away in georges boat the police have been up and down the coast in a motorboat ever since said anne trying to spot you but they couldnt no our boat was well hidden said dick and so were we so well hidden that i began to think wed stay hidden for the rest of our lives the telephone bell rang julian jumped oh good youve had the telephone mended ill go and phone the police when youve answered this call joan but it was the police themselves on the telephone very pleased to hear joan saying excitedly that all the children were back safely well be up in ten minutes they said in ten minutes time the five children and timmy were tucking into a good meal dont stop said the police sergeant when he came into the room with the constable the children had seen before just talk while youre eating so they talked they told about every single thing first george told a bit then jo then dick then julian at first the sergeant was bewildered but then the bits of information began to piece themselves together in his mind like a jigsaw puzzle will my father go to prison asked jo im afraid so said the sergeant bad luck jo said dick i dont mind said jo im better off when hes away i dont have to do things he tells me then well see if we cant fix you up with a nice home said the sergeant kindly youve run wild jo you want looking after i dont want to go to a home for bad girls said jo looking scared i shant let you said dick youre one of the pluckiest kids ive ever known well none of us let you go to a home well find someone wholl be kind to you someone like like like me said joan who was listening and she put her arm rouund jo and gave her a squeeze ive got a cousin whod like a ragamuffin like you a bad little girl with a very good heart dont you fret well look after you i wouldnt mind living with somebody like you said jo in an offhand way i wouldnt be mean any more then and i daresay i wouldnt be bad id like to see dick and all of you sometimes though you will if youre good said dick with a grin but mind if i ever hear youve got in at anyones pantry window again or anything like that ill never see you again jo grinned she was very happy she suddenly remembered something and put her hand into the little rush basket she still carried she took out an enormous key here you are she said to the sergeant heres the key to the tower room i bet red and the others are still locked up there ready for you to catch my wont they get a shock when you unlock the door and walk in quite a lot of people are going to get shocks said the sergeant putting away his very full notebook miss georgina youre lucky to get away unharmed you and your dog by the way we got in touch with a friend of your fathers when we tried to find out about those papers that were stolen he says your father gave him all his important american papers before he went so this fellow red hasnt anything of value at all he went to all his trouble for nothing do you know anything about red asked julian he seemed a bit mad to me if hes the fellow we think he is hes not very sane said the sergeant well be glad to have him under lock and key and that man markhoff too hes not as clever as red but hes dangerous i hope he hasnt escaped in that helicopter said dick he meant to go tonight well well be there in under an hour or so said the sergeant ill just use your telephone if i may and set things going things were certainly set going that night cars roared up to reds house and the gate was broken in when no one came to open it the helicopter was still in the yard but alas it was on its side smashed beyond repair the children were told afterwards that markhoff and the other two men had tried to set off in it but there was something wrong and it had risen some way and then fallen back to the yard the old woman was trying to look after the three hurt men who had crawled from their seats and gone to bathe their cuts and bruises marthon had hurt his head and showed no fight at all and what about red the sergeant asked markhoff is he still locked up yes said markhoff savagely and a good thing too youll have to break that door down with a batteringram to get him and the others out oh no we shant said the sergeant and produced the key markhoff stared at it that kid he said she gave me the key of the larder wait till i get her shell be sorry itll be a long wait markhoff said the sergeant a long long wait well have to take you off with us im afraid red simmy and jake were still locked up and were mad with rage but they saw that the game was up and it wasnt long before all of them were safely tucked away in police cars a very very nice little haul said the sergeant to one of his men very neat too three of them all locked up ready for us what about that kid jo said the man she seems a bad lot and as clever as they make them shes going to have a chance now said the sergeant everybody has a chance sometimes and this is hers shes just about halfandhalf i reckon half bad and half good but shell be all right now shes got a chance jo was sleeping in joans room again the rest were in their own bedrooms getting ready for bed they suddenly didnt feel sleepy any more timmy especially was very lively darting in and out of the rooms and sending the landing mats sliding about all over the place timmy if you jump on my bed again ill slam the door on you threatened anne but she didnt of course it was so lovely to see old timmy quite himself once more the telephone bell suddenly rang and made everyone jump now whats up said julian
