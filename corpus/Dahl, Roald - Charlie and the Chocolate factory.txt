roald dahl charlie and the chocolate factory there are five children in this book augustus gloop a greedy boy veruca salt a girl who is spoiled by her parents violet beauregarde a girl who chews gum all day long mike teavee a boy who does nothing but watch television and charlie bucket the hero here comes charlie these two very old people are the father and mother of mr bucket their names are grandpa joe and grandma josephine and these two very old people are the father and mother of mrs bucket their names are grandpa george and grandma georgina this is mr bucket this is mrs bucket mr and mrs bucket have a small boy whose name is charlie this is charlie how dyou do and how dyou do and how dyou do again he is pleased to meet you the whole of this family the six grownups and little charlie bucket live together in a small wooden house on the edge of a great town the house wasnt nearly large enough for so many people and life was extremely uncomfortable for them all there were only two rooms in the place altogether and there was only one bed the bed was given to the four old grandparents because they were so old and tired they were so tired they never got out of it grandpa joe and grandma josephine on this side grandpa george and grandma georgina on this side mr and mrs bucket and little charlie bucket slept in the other room upon mattresses on the floor in the summertime this wasnt too bad but in the winter freezing cold draughts blew across the floor all night long and it was awful there wasnt any question of them being able to buy a better house or even one more bed to sleep in they were far too poor for that mr bucket was the only person in the family with a job he worked in a toothpaste factory where he sat all day long at a bench and screwed the little caps on to the tops of the tubes of toothpaste after the tubes had been filled but a toothpaste capscrewer is never paid very much money and poor mr bucket however hard he worked and however fast he screwed on the caps was never able to make enough to buy one half of the things that so large a family needed there wasnt even enough money to buy proper food for them all the only meals they could afford were bread and margarine for breakfast boiled potatoes and cabbage for lunch and cabbage soup for supper sundays were a bit better they all looked forward to sundays because then although they had exactly the same everyone was allowed a second helping the buckets of course didnt starve but every one of them the two old grandfathers the two old grandmothers charlies father charlies mother and especially little charlie himself went about from morning till night with a horrible empty feeling in their tummies charlie felt it worst of all and although his father and mother often went without their own share of lunch or supper so that they could give it to him it still wasnt nearly enough for a growing boy he desperately wanted something more filling and satisfying than cabbage and cabbage soup the one thing he longed for more than anything else was chocolate walking to school in the mornings charlie could see great slabs of chocolate piled up high in the shop windows and he would stop and stare and press his nose against the glass his mouth watering like mad many times a day he would see other children taking bars of creamy chocolate out of their pockets and munching them greedily and that of course was pure torture only once a year on his birthday did charlie bucket ever get to taste a bit of chocolate the whole family saved up their money for that special occasion and when the great day arrived charlie was always presented with one small chocolate bar to eat all by himself and each time he received it on those marvellous birthday mornings he would place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned and treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold and for the next few days he would allow himself only to look at it but never to touch it then at last when he could stand it no longer he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate and then he would take a tiny nibble just enough to allow the lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue the next day he would take another tiny nibble and so on and so on and in this way charlie would make his sixpenny bar of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month but i havent yet told you about the one awful thing that tortured little charlie the lover of chocolate more than anything else this thing for him was far far worse than seeing slabs of chocolate in the shop windows or watching other children munching bars of creamy chocolate right in front of him it was the most terrible torturing thing you could imagine and it was this in the town itself actually within sight of the house in which charlie lived there was an enormous chocolate factory just imagine that and it wasnt simply an ordinary enormous chocolate factory either it was the largest and most famous in the whole world it was wonkas factory owned by a man called mr willy wonka the greatest inventor and maker of chocolates that there has ever been and what a tremendous marvellous place it was it had huge iron gates leading into it and a high wall surrounding it and smoke belching from its chimneys and strange whizzing sounds coming from deep inside it and outside the walls for half a mile around in every direction the air was scented with the heavy rich smell of melting chocolate twice a day on his way to and from school little charlie bucket had to walk right past the gates of the factory and every time he went by he would begin to walk very very slowly and he would hold his nose high in the air and take long deep sniffs of the gorgeous chocolatey smell all around him oh how he loved that smell and oh how he wished he could go inside the factory and see what it was like mr willy wonkas factory in the evenings after he had finished his supper of watery cabbage soup charlie always went into the room of his four grandparents to listen to their stories and then afterwards to say good night every one of these old people was over ninety they were as shrivelled as prunes and as bony as skeletons and throughout the day until charlie made his appearance they lay huddled in their one bed two at either end with nightcaps on to keep their heads warm dozing the time away with nothing to do but as soon as they heard the door opening and heard charlies voice saying good evening grandpa joe and grandma josephine and grandpa george and grandma georgina then all four of them would suddenly sit up and their old wrinkled faces would light up with smiles of pleasure and the talking would begin for they loved this little boy he was the only bright thing in their lives and his evening visits were something that they looked forward to all day long often charlies mother and father would come in as well and stand by the door listening to the stories that the old people told and thus for perhaps half an hour every night this room would become a happy place and the whole family would forget that it was hungry and poor one evening when charlie went in to see his grandparents he said to them is it really true that wonkas chocolate factory is the biggest in the world true cried all four of them at once of course its true good heavens didnt you know that its about fifty times as big as any other and is mr willy wonka really the cleverest chocolate maker in the world my dear boy said grandpa joe raising himself up a little higher on his pillow mr willy wonka is the most amazing the most fantastic the most extraordinary chocolate maker the world has ever seen i thought everybody knew that i knew he was famous grandpa joe and i knew he was very clever clever cried the old man hes more than that hes a magician with chocolate he can make anything anything he wants isnt that a fact my dears the other three old people nodded their heads slowly up and down and said absolutely true just as true as can be and grandpa joe said you mean to say ive never told you about mr willy wonka and his factory never answered little charlie good heavens above i dont know whats the matter with me will you tell me now grandpa joe please i certainly will sit down beside me on the bed my dear and listen carefully grandpa joe was the oldest of the four grandparents he was ninetysix and a half and that is just about as old as anybody can be like all extremely old people he was delicate and weak and throughout the day he spoke very little but in the evenings when charlie his beloved grandson was in the room he seemed in some marvellous way to grow quite young again all his tiredness fell away from him and he became as eager and excited as a young boy oh what a man he is this mr willy wonka cried grandpa joe did you know for example that he has himself invented more than two hundred new kinds of chocolate bars each with a different centre each far sweeter and creamier and more delicious than anything the other chocolate factories can make perfectly true cried grandma josephine and he sends them to all the four corners of the earth isnt that so grandpa joe it is my dear it is and to all the kings and presidents of the world as well but it isnt only chocolate bars that he makes oh dear me no he has some really fantastic inventions up his sleeve mr willy wonka has did you know that hes invented a way of making chocolate ice cream so that it stays cold for hours and hours without being in the refrigerator you can even leave it lying in the sun all morning on a hot day and it wont go runny but thats impossible said little charlie staring at his grandfather of course its impossible cried grandpa joe its completely absurd but mr willy wonka has done it quite right the others agreed nodding their heads mr wonka has done it and then again grandpa joe went on speaking very slowly now so that charlie wouldnt miss a word mr willy wonka can make marshmallows that taste of violets and rich caramels that change colour every ten seconds as you suck them and little feathery sweets that melt away deliciously the moment you put them between your lips he can make chewinggum that never loses its taste and sugar balloons that you can blow up to enormous sizes before you pop them with a pin and gobble them up and by a most secret method he can make lovely blue birds eggs with black spots on them and when you put one of these in your mouth it gradually gets smaller and smaller until suddenly there is nothing left except a tiny little pink sugary baby bird sitting on the tip of your tongue grandpa joe paused and ran the point of his tongue slowly over his lips it makes my mouth water just thinking about it he said mine too said little charlie but please go on while they were talking mr and mrs bucket charlies mother and father had come quietly into the room and now both were standing just inside the door listening tell charlie about that crazy indian prince said grandma josephine hed like to hear that you mean prince pondicherry said grandpa joe and he began chuckling with laughter completely dotty said grandpa george but very rich said grandma georgina what did he do asked charlie eagerly listen said grandpa joe and ill tell you mr wonka and the indian prince prince pondicherry wrote a letter to mr willy wonka said grandpa joe and asked him to come all the way out to india and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate did mr wonka do it grandpa he did indeed and what a palace it was it had one hundred rooms and everything was made of either dark or light chocolate the bricks were chocolate and the cement holding them together was chocolate and the windows were chocolate and all the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate so were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture and the beds and when you turned on the taps in the bathroom hot chocolate came pouring out when it was all finished mr wonka said to prince pondicherry i warn you though it wont last very long so youd better start eating it right away nonsense shouted the prince im not going to eat my palace im not even going to nibble the staircase or lick the walls im going to live in it but mr wonka was right of course because soon after this there came a very hot day with a boiling sun and the whole palace began to melt and then it sank slowly to the ground and the crazy prince who was dozing in the living room at the time woke up to find himself swimming around in a huge brown sticky lake of chocolate little charlie sat very still on the edge of the bed staring at his grandfather charlies face was bright and his eyes were stretched so wide you could see the whites all around is all this really true he asked or are you pulling my leg its true cried all four of the old people at once of course its true ask anyone you like and ill tell you something else thats true said grandpa joe and now he leaned closer to charlie and lowered his voice to a soft secret whisper nobody ever comes out out of where asked charlie and nobody ever goes in in where cried charlie wonkas factory of course grandpa what do you mean i mean workers charlie workers all factories said grandpa joe have workers streaming in and out of the gates in the mornings and evenings except wonkas have you ever seen a single person going into that place or coming out little charlie looked slowly around at each of the four old faces one after the other and they all looked back at him they were friendly smiling faces but they were also quite serious there was no sign of joking or legpulling on any of them well have you asked grandpa joe i i really dont know grandpa charlie stammered whenever i walk past the factory the gates seem to be closed exactly said grandpa joe but there must be people working there not people charlie not ordinary people anyway then who cried charlie ahha thats it you see thats another of mr willy wonkas clevernesses charlie dear mrs bucket called out from where she was standing by the door its time for bed thats enough for tonight but mother i must hear tomorrow my darling thats right said grandpa joe ill tell you the rest of it tomorrow evening the secret workers the next evening grandpa joe went on with his story you see charlie he said not so very long ago there used to be thousands of people working in mr willy wonkas factory then one day all of a sudden mr wonka had to ask every single one of them to leave to go home never to come back but why asked charlie because of spies spies yes all the other chocolate makers you see had begun to grow jealous of the wonderful sweets that mr wonka was making and they started sending in spies to steal his secret recipes the spies took jobs in the wonka factory pretending that they were ordinary workers and while they were there each one of them found out exactly how a certain special thing was made and did they go back to their own factories and tell asked charlie they must have answered grandpa joe because soon after that fickelgrubers factory started making an ice cream that would never melt even in the hottest sun then mr prodnoses factory came out with a chewinggum that never lost its flavour however much you chewed it and then mr slugworths factory began making sugar balloons that you could blow up to huge sizes before you popped them with a pin and gobbled them up and so on and so on and mr willy wonka tore his beard and shouted this is terrible i shall be ruined there are spies everywhere i shall have to close the factory but he didnt do that charlie said oh yes he did he told all the workers that he was sorry but they would have to go home then he shut the main gates and fastened them with a chain and suddenly wonkas giant chocolate factory became silent and deserted the chimneys stopped smoking the machines stopped whirring and from then on not a single chocolate or sweet was made not a soul went in or out and even mr willy wonka himself disappeared completely months and months went by grandpa joe went on but still the factory remained closed and everybody said poor mr wonka he was so nice and he made such marvellous things but hes finished now its all over then something astonishing happened one day early in the morning thin columns of white smoke were seen to be coming out of the tops of the tall chimneys of the factory people in the town stopped and stared whats going on they cried someones lit the furnaces mr wonka must be opening up again they ran to the gates expecting to see them wide open and mr wonka standing there to welcome his workers back but no the great iron gates were still locked and chained as securely as ever and mr wonka was nowhere to be seen but the factory is working the people shouted listen you can hear the machines theyre all whirring again and you can smell the smell of melting chocolate in the air grandpa joe leaned forward and laid a long bony finger on charlies knee and he said softly but most mysterious of all charlie were the shadows in the windows of the factory the people standing on the street outside could see small dark shadows moving about behind the frosted glass windows shadows of whom said charlie quickly thats exactly what everybody else wanted to know the place is full of workers the people shouted but nobodys gone in the gates are locked its crazy nobody ever comes out either but there was no question at all said grandpa joe that the factory was running and its gone on running ever since for these last ten years whats more the chocolates and sweets its been turning out have become more fantastic and delicious all the time and of course now when mr wonka invents some new and wonderful sweet neither mr fickelgruber nor mr prodnose nor mr slugworth nor anybody else is able to copy it no spies can go into the factory to find out how it is made but grandpa who cried charlie who is mr wonka using to do all the work in the factory nobody knows charlie but thats absurd hasnt someone asked mr wonka nobody sees him any more he never comes out the only things that come out of that place are chocolates and sweets they come out through a special trap door in the wall all packed and addressed and they are picked up every day by post office trucks but grandpa what sort of people are they that work in there my dear boy said grandpa joe that is one of the great mysteries of the chocolatemaking world we know only one thing about them they are very small the faint shadows that sometimes appear behind the windows especially late at night when the lights are on are those of tiny people people no taller than my knee there arent any such people charlie said just then mr bucket charlies father came into the room he was home from the toothpaste factory and he was waving an evening newspaper rather excitedly have you heard the news he cried he held up the paper so that they could see the huge headline the headline said wonka factory to be opened at last to lucky few the golden tickets you mean people are actually going to be allowed to go inside the factory cried grandpa joe read us what it says quickly all right said mr bucket smoothing out the newspaper listen evening bulletin mr willy wonka the confectionery genius whom nobody has seen for the last ten years sent out the following notice today i willy wonka have decided to allow five children just five mind you and no more to visit my factory this year these lucky five will be shown around personally by me and they will be allowed to see all the secrets and the magic of my factory then at the end of the tour as a special present all of them will be given enough chocolates and sweets to last them for the rest of their lives so watch out for the golden tickets five golden tickets have been printed on golden paper and these five golden tickets have been hidden underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary bars of chocolate these five chocolate bars may be anywhere in any shop in any street in any town in any country in the world upon any counter where wonkas sweets are sold and the five lucky finders of these five golden tickets are the only ones who will be allowed to visit my factory and see what its like now inside good luck to you all and happy hunting the mans dotty muttered grandma josephine hes brilliant cried grandpa joe hes a magician just imagine what will happen now the whole world will be searching for those golden tickets everyone will be buying wonkas chocolate bars in the hope of finding one hell sell more than ever before oh how exciting it would be to find one and all the chocolate and sweets that you could eat for the rest of your life free said grandpa george just imagine that theyd have to deliver them in a truck said grandma georgina it makes me quite ill to think of it said grandma josephine nonsense cried grandpa joe wouldnt it be something charlie to open a bar of chocolate and see a golden ticket glistening inside it certainly would grandpa but there isnt a hope charlie said sadly i only get one bar a year you never know darling said grandma georgina its your birthday next week you have as much chance as anybody else im afraid that simply isnt true said grandpa george the kids who are going to find the golden tickets are the ones who can afford to buy bars of chocolate every day our charlie gets only one a year there isnt a hope the first two finders the very next day the first golden ticket was found the finder was a boy called augustus gloop and mr buckets evening newspaper carried a large picture of him on the front page the picture showed a nineyearold boy who was so enormously fat he looked as though he had been blown up with a powerful pump great flabby folds of fat bulged out from every part of his body and his face was like a monstrous ball of dough with two small greedy curranty eyes peering out upon the world the town in which augustus gloop lived the newspaper said had gone wild with excitement over their hero flags were flying from all the windows children had been given a holiday from school and a parade was being organized in honour of the famous youth i just knew augustus would find a golden ticket his mother had told the newspapermen he eats so many bars of chocolate a day that it was almost impossible for him not to find one eating is his hobby you know thats all hes interested in but still thats better than being a hooligan and shooting off zip guns and things like that in his spare time isnt it and what i always say is he wouldnt go on eating like he does unless he needed nourishment would he its all vitamins anyway what a thrill it will be for him to visit mr wonkas marvellous factory were just as proud as anything what a revolting woman said grandma josephine and what a repulsive boy said grandma georgina only four golden tickets left said grandpa george i wonder wholl get those and now the whole country indeed the whole world seemed suddenly to be caught up in a mad chocolatebuying spree everybody searching frantically for those precious remaining tickets fully grown women were seen going into sweet shops and buying ten wonka bars at a time then tearing off the wrappers on the spot and peering eagerly underneath for a glint of golden paper children were taking hammers and smashing their piggy banks and running out to the shops with handfuls of money in one city a famous gangster robbed a bank of a thousand pounds and spent the whole lot on wonka bars that same afternoon and when the police entered his house to arrest him they found him sitting on the floor amidst mountains of chocolate ripping off the wrappers with the blade of a long dagger in faroff russia a woman called charlotte russe claimed to have found the second ticket but it turned out to be a clever fake the famous english scientist professor foulbody invented a machine which would tell you at once without opening the wrapper of a bar of chocolate whether or not there was a golden ticket hidden underneath it the machine had a mechanical arm that shot out with tremendous force and grabbed hold of anything that had the slightest bit of gold inside it and for a moment it looked like the answer to everything but unfortunately while the professor was showing off the machine to the public at the sweet counter of a large department store the mechanical arm shot out and made a grab for the gold filling in the back tooth of a duchess who was standing near by there was an ugly scene and the machine was smashed by the crowd suddenly on the day before charlie buckets birthday the newspapers announced that the second golden ticket had been found the lucky person was a small girl called veruca salt who lived with her rich parents in a great city far away once again mr buckets evening newspaper carried a big picture of the finder she was sitting between her beaming father and mother in the living room of their house waving the golden ticket above her head and grinning from ear to ear verucas father mr salt had eagerly explained to the newspapermen exactly how the ticket was found you see boys he had said as soon as my little girl told me that she simply had to have one of those golden tickets i went out into the town and started buying up all the wonka bars i could lay my hands on thousands of them i must have bought hundreds of thousands then i had them loaded on to trucks and sent directly to my own factory im in the peanut business you see and ive got about a hundred women working for me over at my place shelling peanuts for roasting and salting thats what they do all day long those women they sit there shelling peanuts so i says to them okay girls i says from now on you can stop shelling peanuts and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead and they did i had every worker in the place yanking the paper off those bars of chocolate full speed ahead from morning till night but three days went by and we had no luck oh it was terrible my little veruca got more and more upset each day and every time i went home she would scream at me wheres my golden ticket i want my golden ticket and she would lie for hours on the floor kicking and yelling in the most disturbing way well i just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that so i vowed i would keep up the search until id got her what she wanted then suddenly on the evening of the fourth day one of my women workers yelled ive got it a golden ticket and i said give it to me quick and she did and i rushed it home and gave it to my darling veruca and now shes all smiles and we have a happy home once again thats even worse than the fat boy said grandma josephine she needs a really good spanking said grandma georgina i dont think the girls father played it quite fair grandpa do you charlie murmured he spoils her grandpa joe said and no good can ever come from spoiling a child like that charlie you mark my words come to bed my darling said charlies mother tomorrows your birthday dont forget that so i expect youll be up early to open your present a wonka chocolate bar cried charlie it is a wonka bar isnt it yes my love his mother said of course it is oh wouldnt it be wonderful if i found the third golden ticket inside it charlie said bring it in here when you get it grandpa joe said then we can all watch you taking off the wrapper charlies birthday happy birthday cried the four old grandparents as charlie came into their room early the next morning charlie smiled nervously and sat down on the edge of the bed he was holding his present his only present very carefully in his two hands wonkas whipplescrumptious fudgemallow delight it said on the wrapper the four old people two at either end of the bed propped themselves up on their pillows and stared with anxious eyes at the bar of chocolate in charlies hands mr and mrs bucket came in and stood at the foot of the bed watching charlie the room became silent everybody was waiting now for charlie to start opening his present charlie looked down at the bar of chocolate he ran his fingers slowly back and forth along the length of it stroking it lovingly and the shiny paper wrapper made little sharp crackly noises in the quiet room then mrs bucket said gently you mustnt be too disappointed my darling if you dont find what youre looking for underneath that wrapper you really cant expect to be as lucky as all that shes quite right mr bucket said charlie didnt say anything after all grandma josephine said in the whole wide world there are only three tickets left to be found the thing to remember grandma georgina said is that whatever happens youll still have the bar of chocolate wonkas whipplescrumptious fudgemallow delight cried grandpa george its the best of them all youll just love it yes charlie whispered i know just forget all about those golden tickets and enjoy the chocolate grandpa joe said why dont you do that they all knew it was ridiculous to expect this one poor little bar of chocolate to have a magic ticket inside it and they were trying as gently and as kindly as they could to prepare charlie for the disappointment but there was one other thing that the grownups also knew and it was this that however small the chance might be of striking lucky the chance was there the chance had to be there this particular bar of chocolate had as much chance as any other of having a golden ticket and that was why all the grandparents and parents in the room were actually just as tense and excited as charlie was although they were pretending to be very calm youd better go ahead and open it up or youll be late for school grandpa joe said you might as well get it over with grandpa george said open it my dear grandma georgina said please open it youre making me jumpy very slowly charlies fingers began to tear open one small corner of the wrapping paper the old people in the bed all leaned forward craning their scraggy necks then suddenly as though he couldnt bear the suspense any longer charlie tore the wrapper right down the middle and on to his lap there fell a lightbrown creamycoloured bar of chocolate there was no sign of a golden ticket anywhere well thats that said grandpa joe brightly its just what we expected charlie looked up four kind old faces were watching him intently from the bed he smiled at them a small sad smile and then he shrugged his shoulders and picked up the chocolate bar and held it out to his mother and said here mother have a bit well share it i want everybody to taste it certainly not his mother said and the others all cried no no we wouldnt dream of it its all yours please begged charlie turning round and offering it to grandpa joe but neither he nor anyone else would take even a tiny bit its time to go to school my darling mrs bucket said putting an arm around charlies skinny shoulders come on or youll be late two more golden tickets found that evening mr buckets newspaper announced the finding of not only the third golden ticket but the fourth as well two golden tickets found today screamed the headlines only one more left all right said grandpa joe when the whole family was gathered in the old peoples room after supper lets hear who found them the third ticket read mr bucket holding the newspaper up close to his face because his eyes were bad and he couldnt afford glasses the third ticket was found by a miss violet beauregarde there was great excitement in the beauregarde household when our reporter arrived to interview the lucky young lady cameras were clicking and flashbulbs were flashing and people were pushing and jostling and trying to get a bit closer to the famous girl and the famous girl was standing on a chair in the living room waving the golden ticket madly at arms length as though she were flagging a taxi she was talking very fast and very loudly to everyone but it was not easy to hear all that she said because she was chewing so ferociously upon a piece of gum at the same time im a gum chewer normally she shouted but when i heard about these ticket things of mr wonkas i gave up gum and started on chocolate bars in the hope of striking lucky now of course im back on gum i just adore gum i cant do without it i munch it all day long except for a few minutes at mealtimes when i take it out and stick it behind my ear for safekeeping to tell you the truth i simply wouldnt feel comfortable if i didnt have that little wedge of gum to chew on every moment of the day i really wouldnt my mother says its not ladylike and it looks ugly to see a girls jaws going up and down like mine do all the time but i dont agree and whos she to criticize anyway because if you ask me id say that her jaws are going up and down almost as much as mine are just from yelling at me every minute of the day now violet mrs beauregarde said from a far corner of the room where she was standing on the piano to avoid being trampled by the mob all right mother keep your hair on miss beauregarde shouted and now she went on turning to the reporters again it may interest you to know that this piece of gum im chewing right at this moment is one ive been working on for over three months solid thats a record that is its beaten the record held by my best friend miss cornelia prinzmetel and was she furious its my most treasured possession now this piece of gum is at nighttime i just stick it on the end of the bedpost and its as good as ever in the mornings a bit hard at first maybe but it soon softens up again after ive given it a few good chews before i started chewing for the world record i used to change my piece of gum once a day i used to do it in our lift on the way home from school why the lift because i liked sticking the gooey piece that id just finished with on to one of the control buttons then the next person who came along and pressed the button got my old gum on the end of his or her finger haha and what a racket they kicked up some of them you get the best results with women who have expensive gloves on oh yes im thrilled to be going to mr wonkas factory and i understand that afterwards hes going to give me enough gum to last me for the rest of my whole life whoopee hooray beastly girl said grandma josephine despicable said grandma georgina shell come to a sticky end one day chewing all that gum you see if she doesnt and who got the fourth golden ticket charlie asked now let me see said mr bucket peering at the newspaper again ah yes here we are the fourth golden ticket he read was found by a boy called mike teavee another bad lot ill be bound muttered grandma josephine dont interrupt grandma said mrs bucket the teavee household said mr bucket going on with his reading was crammed like all the others with excited visitors when our reporter arrived but young mike teavee the lucky winner seemed extremely annoyed by the whole business cant you fools see im watching television he said angrily i wish you wouldnt interrupt the nineyearold boy was seated before an enormous television set with his eyes glued to the screen and he was watching a film in which one bunch of gangsters was shooting up another bunch of gangsters with machine guns mike teavee himself had no less than eighteen toy pistols of various sizes hanging from belts around his body and every now and again he would leap up into the air and fire off half a dozen rounds from one or another of these weapons quiet he shouted when someone tried to ask him a question didnt i tell you not to interrupt this shows an absolute whizbanger its terrific i watch it every day i watch all of them every day even the rotten ones where theres no shooting i like the gangsters best theyre terrific those gangsters especially when they start pumping each other full of lead or flashing the old stilettos or giving each other the onetwothree with their knuckledusters gosh what wouldnt i give to be doing that myself its the life i tell you its terrific thats quite enough snapped grandma josephine i cant bear to listen to it nor me said grandma georgina do all children behave like this nowadays like these brats weve been hearing about of course not said mr bucket smiling at the old lady in the bed some do of course in fact quite a lot of them do but not all and now theres only one ticket left said grandpa george quite so sniffed grandma georgina and just as sure as ill be having cabbage soup for supper tomorrow that ticketll go to some nasty little beast who doesnt deserve it grandpa joe takes a gamble the next day when charlie came home from school and went in to see his grandparents he found that only grandpa joe was awake the other three were all snoring loudly ssshh whispered grandpa joe and he beckoned charlie to come closer charlie tiptoed over and stood beside the bed the old man gave charlie a sly grin and then he started rummaging under his pillow with one hand and when the hand came out again there was an ancient leather purse clutched in the fingers under cover of the bedclothes the old man opened the purse and tipped it upside down out fell a single silver sixpence its my secret hoard he whispered the others dont know ive got it and now you and i are going to have one more fling at finding that last ticket how about it eh but youll have to help me are you sure you want to spend your money on that grandpa charlie whispered of course im sure spluttered the old man excitedly dont stand there arguing im as keen as you are to find that ticket here take the money and run down the street to the nearest shop and buy the first wonka bar you see and bring it straight back to me and well open it together charlie took the little silver coin and slipped quickly out of the room in five minutes he was back have you got it whispered grandpa joe his eyes shining with excitement charlie nodded and held out the bar of chocolate wonkas nutty crunch surprise it said on the wrapper good the old man whispered sitting up in the bed and rubbing his hands now come over here and sit close to me and well open it together are you ready yes charlie said im ready all right you tear off the first bit no charlie said you paid for it you do it all the old mans fingers were trembling most terribly as they fumbled with the wrapper we dont have a hope really he whispered giggling a bit you do know we dont have a hope dont you yes charlie said i know that they looked at each other and both started giggling nervously mind you said grandpa joe there is just that tiny chance that it might be the one dont you agree yes charlie said of course why dont you open it grandpa all in good time my boy all in good time which end do you think i ought to open first that corner the one furthest from you just tear off a tiny bit but not quite enough for us to see anything like that said the old man yes now a little bit more you finish it said grandpa joe im too nervous no grandpa you must do it yourself very well then here goes he tore off the wrapper they both stared at what lay underneath it was a bar of chocolate nothing more all at once they both saw the funny side of the whole thing and they burst into peals of laughter what on earths going on cried grandma josephine waking up suddenly nothing said grandpa joe you go on back to sleep the family begins to starve during the next two weeks the weather turned very cold first came the snow it began very suddenly one morning just as charlie bucket was getting dressed for school standing by the window he saw the huge flakes drifting slowly down out of an icy sky that was the colour of steel by evening it lay four feet deep around the tiny house and mr bucket had to dig a path from the front door to the road after the snow there came a freezing gale that blew for days and days without stopping and oh how bitter cold it was everything that charlie touched seemed to be made of ice and each time he stepped outside the door the wind was like a knife on his cheek inside the house little jets of freezing air came rushing in through the sides of the windows and under the doors and there was no place to go to escape them the four old ones lay silent and huddled in their bed trying to keep the cold out of their bones the excitement over the golden tickets had long since been forgotten nobody in the family gave a thought now to anything except the two vital problems of trying to keep warm and trying to get enough to eat there is something about very cold weather that gives one an enormous appetite most of us find ourselves beginning to crave rich steaming stews and hot apple pies and all kinds of delicious warming dishes and because we are all a great deal luckier than we realize we usually get what we want or near enough but charlie bucket never got what he wanted because the family couldnt afford it and as the cold weather went on and on he became ravenously and desperately hungry both bars of chocolate the birthday one and the one grandpa joe had bought had long since been nibbled away and all he got now were those thin cabbagy meals three times a day then all at once the meals became even thinner the reason for this was that the toothpaste factory the place where mr bucket worked suddenly went bust and had to close down quickly mr bucket tried to get another job but he had no luck in the end the only way in which he managed to earn a few pennies was by shovelling snow in the streets but it wasnt enough to buy even a quarter of the food that seven people needed the situation became desperate breakfast was a single slice of bread for each person now and lunch was maybe half a boiled potato slowly but surely everybody in the house began to starve and every day little charlie bucket trudging through the snow on his way to school would have to pass mr willy wonkas giant chocolate factory and every day as he came near to it he would lift his small pointed nose high in the air and sniff the wonderful sweet smell of melting chocolate sometimes he would stand motionless outside the gates for several minutes on end taking deep swallowing breaths as though he were trying to eat the smell itself that child said grandpa joe poking his head up from under the blanket one icy morning that child has got to have more food it doesnt matter about us were too old to bother with but a growing boy he cant go on like this hes beginning to look like a skeleton what can one do murmured grandma josephine miserably he refuses to take any of ours i hear his mother tried to slip her own piece of bread on to his plate at breakfast this morning but he wouldnt touch it he made her take it back hes a fine little fellow said grandpa george he deserves better than this the cruel weather went on and on and every day charlie bucket grew thinner and thinner his face became frighteningly white and pinched the skin was drawn so tightly over the cheeks that you could see the shapes of the bones underneath it seemed doubtful whether he could go on much longer like this without becoming dangerously ill and now very calmly with that curious wisdom that seems to come so often to small children in times of hardship he began to make little changes here and there in some of the things that he did so as to save his strength in the mornings he left the house ten minutes earlier so that he could walk slowly to school without ever having to run he sat quietly in the classroom during break resting himself while the others rushed outdoors and threw snowballs and wrestled in the snow everything he did now he did slowly and carefully to prevent exhaustion then one afternoon walking back home with the icy wind in his face his eye was caught suddenly by something silvery lying in the gutter in the snow charlie stepped off the kerb and bent down to examine it part of it was buried under the snow but he saw at once what it was it was a fiftypence piece quickly he looked around him had somebody just dropped it no that was impossible because of the way part of it was buried several people went hurrying past him on the pavement their chins sunk deep in the collars of their coats their feet crunching in the snow none of them was searching for any money none of them was taking the slightest notice of the small boy crouching in the gutter then was it his this fifty pence could he have it carefully charlie pulled it out from under the snow it was damp and dirty but otherwise perfect a whole fifty pence he held it tightly between his shivering fingers gazing down at it it meant one thing to him at that moment only one thing it meant food automatically charlie turned and began moving towards the nearest shop it was only ten paces away it was a newspaper and stationery shop the kind that sells almost everything including sweets and cigars and what he would do he whispered quickly to himself he would buy one luscious bar of chocolate and eat it all up every bit of it right then and there and the rest of the money he would take straight back home and give to his mother the miracle charlie entered the shop and laid the damp fifty pence on the counter one wonkas whipplescrumptious fudgemallow delight he said remembering how much he had loved the one he had on his birthday the man behind the counter looked fat and wellfed he had big lips and fat cheeks and a very fat neck the fat around his neck bulged out all around the top of his collar like a rubber ring he turned and reached behind him for the chocolate bar then he turned back again and handed it to charlie charlie grabbed it and quickly tore off the wrapper and took an enormous bite then he took another and another and oh the joy of being able to cram large pieces of something sweet and solid into ones mouth the sheer blissful joy of being able to fill ones mouth with rich solid food you look like you wanted that one sonny the shopkeeper said pleasantly charlie nodded his mouth bulging with chocolate the shopkeeper put charlies change on the counter take it easy he said itll give you a tummyache if you swallow it like that without chewing charlie went on wolfing the chocolate he couldnt stop and in less than half a minute the whole thing had disappeared down his throat he was quite out of breath but he felt marvellously extraordinarily happy he reached out a hand to take the change then he paused his eyes were just above the level of the counter they were staring at the silver coins lying there the coins were all fivepenny pieces there were nine of them altogether surely it wouldnt matter if he spent just one more i think he said quietly i think ill have just one more of those chocolate bars the same kind as before please why not the fat shopkeeper said reaching behind him again and taking another whipplescrumptious fudgemallow delight from the shelf he laid it on the counter charlie picked it up and tore off the wrapper and suddenly from underneath the wrapper there came a brilliant flash of gold charlies heart stood still its a golden ticket screamed the shopkeeper leaping about a foot in the air youve got a golden ticket youve found the last golden ticket hey would you believe it come and look at this everybody the kids found wonkas last golden ticket there it is its right here in his hands it seemed as though the shopkeeper might be going to have a fit in my shop too he yelled he found it right here in my own little shop somebody call the newspapers quick and let them know watch out now sonny dont tear it as you unwrap it that things precious in a few seconds there was a crowd of about twenty people clustering around charlie and many more were pushing their way in from the street everybody wanted to get a look at the golden ticket and at the lucky finder where is it somebody shouted hold it up so all of us can see it there it is there someone else shouted hes holding it in his hands see the gold shining how did he manage to find it id like to know a large boy shouted angrily twenty bars a day ive been buying for weeks and weeks think of all the free stuff hell be getting too another boy said enviously a lifetime supply hell need it the skinny little shrimp a girl said laughing charlie hadnt moved he hadnt even unwrapped the golden ticket from around the chocolate he was standing very still holding it tightly with both hands while the crowd pushed and shouted all around him he felt quite dizzy there was a peculiar floating sensation coming over him as though he were floating up in the air like a balloon his feet didnt seem to be touching the ground at all he could hear his heart thumping away loudly somewhere in his throat at that point he became aware of a hand resting lightly on his shoulder and when he looked up he saw a tall man standing over him listen the man whispered ill buy it from you ill give you fifty pounds how about it eh and ill give you a new bicycle as well okay are you crazy shouted a woman who was standing equally close why id give him two hundred pounds for that ticket you want to sell that ticket for two hundred pounds young man thats quite enough of that the fat shopkeeper shouted pushing his way through the crowd and taking charlie firmly by the arm leave the kid alone will you make way there let him out and to charlie as he led him to the door he whispered dont you let anybody have it take it straight home quickly before you lose it run all the way and dont stop till you get there you understand charlie nodded you know something the fat shopkeeper said pausing a moment and smiling at charlie i have a feeling you needed a break like this im awfully glad you got it good luck to you sonny thank you charlie said and off he went running through the snow as fast as his legs would go and as he flew past mr willy wonkas factory he turned and waved at it and sang out ill be seeing you ill be seeing you soon and five minutes later he arrived at his own home what it said on the golden ticket charlie burst through the front door shouting mother mother mother mrs bucket was in the old grandparents room serving them their evening soup mother yelled charlie rushing in on them like a hurricane look ive got it look mother look the last golden ticket its mine i found some money in the street and i bought two bars of chocolate and the second one had the golden ticket and there were crowds of people all around me wanting to see it and the shopkeeper rescued me and i ran all the way home and here i am its the fifth golden ticket mother and ive found it mrs bucket simply stood and stared while the four old grandparents who were sitting up in bed balancing bowls of soup on their laps all dropped their spoons with a clatter and froze against their pillows for about ten seconds there was absolute silence in the room nobody dared to speak or move it was a magic moment then very softly grandpa joe said youre pulling our legs charlie arent you youre having a little joke i am not cried charlie rushing up to the bed and holding out the large and beautiful golden ticket for him to see grandpa joe leaned forward and took a close look his nose almost touching the ticket the others watched him waiting for the verdict then very slowly with a slow and marvellous grin spreading all over his face grandpa joe lifted his head and looked straight at charlie the colour was rushing to his cheeks and his eyes were wide open shining with joy and in the centre of each eye right in the very centre in the black pupil a little spark of wild excitement was slowly dancing then the old man took a deep breath and suddenly with no warning whatsoever an explosion seemed to take place inside him he threw up his arms and yelled yippeeeeeeee and at the same time his long bony body rose up out of the bed and his bowl of soup went flying into the face of grandma josephine and in one fantastic leap this old fellow of ninetysix and a half who hadnt been out of bed these last twenty years jumped on to the floor and started doing a dance of victory in his pyjamas yippeeeeeeeeee he shouted three cheers for charlie hip hip hooray at this point the door opened and mr bucket walked into the room he was cold and tired and he looked it all day long he had been shovelling snow in the streets cripes he cried whats going on in here it didnt take them long to tell him what had happened i dont believe it he said its not possible show him the ticket charlie shouted grandpa joe who was still dancing around the floor like a dervish in his striped pyjamas show your father the fifth and last golden ticket in the world let me see it charlie mr bucket said collapsing into a chair and holding out his hand charlie came forward with the precious document it was a very beautiful thing this golden ticket having been made so it seemed from a sheet of pure gold hammered out almost to the thinness of paper on one side of it printed by some clever method in jetblack letters was the invitation itself from mr wonka read it aloud said grandpa joe climbing back into bed again at last lets all hear exactly what it says mr bucket held the lovely golden ticket up close to his eyes his hands were trembling slightly and he seemed to be overcome by the whole business he took several deep breaths then he cleared his throat and said all right ill

factory i will shouted grandpa joe leaping out of bed once again ill take him ill look after him you leave it to me mrs bucket smiled at the old man then she turned to her husband and said how about you dear dont you think you ought to go well mr bucket said pausing to think about it no im not so sure that i should but you must theres no must about it my dear mr bucket said gently mind you id love to go itll be tremendously exciting but on the other hand i believe that the person who really deserves to go most of all is grandpa joe himself he seems to know more about it than we do provided of course that he feels well enough yippeeeeee shouted grandpa joe seizing charlie by the hands and dancing round the room he certainly seems well enough mrs bucket said laughing yes perhaps youre right after all perhaps grandpa joe should be the one to go with him i certainly cant go myself and leave the other three old people all alone in bed for a whole day hallelujah yelled grandpa joe praise the lord at that point there came a loud knock on the front door mr bucket went to open it and the next moment swarms of newspapermen and photographers were pouring into the house they had tracked down the finder of the fifth golden ticket and now they all wanted to get the full story for the front pages of the morning papers for several hours there was complete pandemonium in the little house and it must have been nearly midnight before mr bucket was able to get rid of them so that charlie could go to bed the big day arrives the sun was shining brightly on the morning of the big day but the ground was still white with snow and the air was very cold outside the gates of wonkas factory enormous crowds of people had gathered to watch the five lucky ticket holders going in the excitement was tremendous it was just before ten oclock the crowds were pushing and shouting and policemen with arms linked were trying to hold them back from the gates right beside the gates in a small group that was carefully shielded from the crowds by the police stood the five famous children together with the grownups who had come with them the tall bony figure of grandpa joe could be seen standing quietly among them and beside him holding tightly on to his hand was little charlie bucket himself all the children except charlie had both their mothers and fathers with them and it was a good thing that they had otherwise the whole party might have got out of hand they were so eager to get going that their parents were having to hold them back by force to prevent them from climbing over the gates be patient cried the fathers be still its not time yet its not ten oclock behind him charlie bucket could hear the shouts of the people in the crowd as they pushed and fought to get a glimpse of the famous children theres violet beauregarde he heard someone shouting thats her all right i can remember her face from the newspapers and you know what somebody else shouted back shes still chewing that dreadful old piece of gum shes had for three months you look at her jaws theyre still working on it whos the big fat boy thats augustus gloop so it is enormous isnt he fantastic whos the kid with a picture of the lone ranger stencilled on his windcheater thats mike teavee hes the television fiend he must be crazy look at all those toy pistols hes got hanging all over him the one i want to see is veruca salt shouted another voice in the crowd shes the girl whose father bought up half a million chocolate bars and then made the workers in his peanut factory unwrap every one of them until they found a golden ticket he gives her anything she wants absolutely anything she only has to start screaming for it and she gets it dreadful isnt it shocking i call it which do you think is her that one over there on the left the little girl in the silver mink coat which one is charlie bucket charlie bucket he must be that skinny little shrimp standing beside the old fellow who looks like a skeleton very close to us just there see him why hasnt he got a coat on in this cold weather dont ask me maybe he cant afford to buy one goodness me he must be freezing charlie standing only a few paces away from the speaker gave grandpa joes hand a squeeze and the old man looked down at charlie and smiled somewhere in the distance a church clock began striking ten very slowly with a loud creaking of rusty hinges the great iron gates of the factory began to swing open the crowd became suddenly silent the children stopped jumping about all eyes were fixed upon the gates there he is somebody shouted thats him and so it was mr willy wonka mr wonka was standing all alone just inside the open gates of the factory and what an extraordinary little man he was he had a black top hat on his head he wore a tail coat made of a beautiful plumcoloured velvet his trousers were bottle green his gloves were pearly grey and in one hand he carried a fine goldtopped walking cane covering his chin there was a small neat pointed black beard a goatee and his eyes his eyes were most marvellously bright they seemed to be sparkling and twinkling at you all the time the whole face in fact was alight with fun and laughter and oh how clever he looked how quick and sharp and full of life he kept making quick jerky little movements with his head cocking it this way and that and taking everything in with those bright twinkling eyes he was like a squirrel in the quickness of his movements like a quick clever old squirrel from the park suddenly he did a funny little skipping dance in the snow and he spread his arms wide and he smiled at the five children who were clustered near the gates and he called out welcome my little friends welcome to the factory his voice was high and flutey will you come forward one at a time please he called out and bring your parents then show me your golden ticket and give me your name whos first the big fat boy stepped up im augustus gloop he said augustus cried mr wonka seizing his hand and pumping it up and down with terrific force my dear boy how good to see you delighted charmed overjoyed to have you with us and these are your parents how nice come in come in thats right step through the gates mr wonka was clearly just as excited as everybody else my name said the next child to go forward is veruca salt my dear veruca how do you do

salt overjoyed to see you yes the ticket is quite in order please go in the next two children violet beauregarde and mike teavee came forward to have their tickets examined and then to have their arms practically pumped off their shoulders by the energetic mr wonka and last of all a small nervous voice whispered charlie bucket charlie cried mr wonka well well well so there you are youre the one who found your ticket only yesterday arent you yes yes i read all about it in this mornings papers just in time my dear boy im so glad so happy for you and this your grandfather delighted to meet you sir overjoyed enraptured enchanted all right excellent is everybody in now five children yes good now will you please follow me our tour is about to begin but do keep together please dont wander off by yourselves i shouldnt like to lose any of you at this stage of the proceedings oh dear me no charlie glanced back over his shoulder and saw the great iron entrance gates slowly closing behind him the crowds on the outside were still pushing and shouting charlie took a last look at them then as the gates closed with a clang all sight of the outside world disappeared here we are cried mr wonka trotting along in front of the group through this big red door please thats right its nice and warm inside i have to keep it warm inside the factory because of the workers my workers are used to an extremely hot climate they cant stand the cold theyd perish if they went outdoors in this weather theyd freeze to death but who are these workers asked augustus gloop all in good time my dear boy said mr wonka smiling at augustus be patient you shall see everything as we go along are all of you inside good would you mind closing the door thank you charlie bucket found himself standing in a long corridor that stretched away in front of him as far as he could see the corridor was so wide that a car could easily have been driven along it the walls were pale pink the lighting was soft and pleasant how lovely and warm whispered charlie i know and what a marvellous smell answered grandpa joe taking a long deep sniff all the most wonderful smells in the world seemed to be mixed up in the air around them the smell of roasting coffee and burnt sugar and melting chocolate and mint and violets and crushed hazelnuts and apple blossom and caramel and lemon peel and far away in the distance from the heart of the great factory came a muffled roar of energy as though some monstrous gigantic machine were spinning its wheels at breakneck speed now this my dear children said mr wonka raising his voice above the noise this is the main corridor will you please hang your coats and hats on those pegs over there and then follow me thats the way good everyone ready come on then here we go he trotted off rapidly down the corridor with the tails of his plumcoloured velvet coat flapping behind him and the visitors all hurried after him it was quite a large party of people when you came to think of it there were nine grownups and five children fourteen in all so you can imagine that there was a good deal of pushing and shoving as they hustled and bustled down the passage trying to keep up with the swift little figure in front of them come on cried mr wonka get a move on please well never get round today if you dawdle like this soon he turned right off the main corridor into another slightly narrower passage then he turned left then left again then right then left then right then right then left the place was like a gigantic rabbit warren with passages leading this way and that in every direction dont you let go my hand charlie whispered grandpa joe notice how all these passages are sloping downwards called out mr wonka we are now going underground all the most important rooms in my factory are deep down below the surface why is that somebody asked there wouldnt be nearly enough space for them up on top answered mr wonka these rooms we are going to see are enormous theyre larger than football fields no building in the world would be big enough to house them but down here underneath the ground ive got all the space i want theres no limit so long as i hollow it out mr wonka turned right he turned left he turned right again the passages were sloping steeper and steeper downhill now then suddenly mr wonka stopped in front of him there was a shiny metal door the party crowded round on the door in large letters it said the chocolate room the chocolate room an important room this cried mr wonka taking a bunch of keys from his pocket and slipping one into the keyhole of the door this is the nerve centre of the whole factory the heart of the whole business and so beautiful i insist upon my rooms being beautiful i cant abide ugliness in factories in we go then but do be careful my dear children dont lose your heads dont get overexcited keep very calm mr wonka opened the door five children and nine grownups pushed their ways in and oh what an amazing sight it was that now met their eyes they were looking down upon a lovely valley there were green meadows on either side of the valley and along the bottom of it there flowed a great brown river what is more there was a tremendous waterfall halfway along the river a steep cliff over which the water curled and rolled in a solid sheet and then went crashing down into a boiling churning whirlpool of froth and spray below the waterfall a whole mass of enormous glass pipes were dangling down into the river from somewhere high up in the ceiling they really were enormous those pipes there must have been a dozen of them at least and they were sucking up the brownish muddy water from the river and carrying it away to goodness knows where and because they were made of glass you could see the liquid flowing and bubbling along inside them and above the noise of the waterfall you could hear the neverending sucksucksucking sound of the pipes as they did their work graceful trees and bushes were growing along the riverbanks weeping willows and alders and tall clumps of rhododendrons with their pink and red and mauve blossoms in the meadows there were thousands of buttercups there cried mr wonka dancing up and down and pointing his goldtopped cane at the great brown river its all chocolate every drop of that river is hot melted chocolate of the finest quality the very finest quality theres enough chocolate in there to fill every bathtub in the entire country and all the swimming pools as well isnt it terrific and just look at my pipes they suck up the chocolate and carry it away to all the other rooms in the factory where it is needed thousands of gallons an hour my dear children thousands and thousands of gallons the children and their parents were too flabbergasted to speak they were staggered they were dumbfounded they were bewildered and dazzled they were completely bowled over by the hugeness of the whole thing they simply stood and stared the waterfall is most important mr wonka went on it mixes the chocolate it churns it up it pounds it and beats it it makes it light and frothy no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall but its the only way to do it properly the only way and do you like my trees he cried pointing with his stick and my lovely bushes dont you think they look pretty i told you i hated ugliness and of course they are all eatable all made of something different and delicious and do you like my meadows do you like my grass and my buttercups the grass you are standing on my dear little ones is made of a new kind of soft minty sugar that ive just invented i call it swudge try a blade please do its delectable automatically everybody bent down and picked one blade of grass everybody that is except augustus gloop who took a big handful and violet beauregarde before tasting her blade of grass took the piece of worldrecordbreaking chewinggum out of her mouth and stuck it carefully behind her ear isnt it wonderful whispered charlie hasnt it got a wonderful taste grandpa i could eat the whole field said grandpa joe grinning with delight i could go around on all fours like a cow and eat every blade of grass in the field try a buttercup cried mr wonka theyre even nicer suddenly the air was filled with screams of excitement the screams came from veruca salt she was pointing frantically to the other side of the river look look over there she screamed what is it hes moving hes walking its a little person its a little man down there below the waterfall everybody stopped picking buttercups and stared across the river shes right grandpa cried charlie it is a little man can you see him i see him charlie said grandpa joe excitedly and now everybody started shouting at once theres two of them my gosh so there is theres more than two theres one two three four five what are they doing where do they come from who are they children and parents alike rushed down to the edge of the river to get a closer look arent they fantastic no higher than my knee look at their funny long hair the tiny men they were no larger than mediumsized dolls had stopped what they were doing and now they were staring back across the river at the visitors one of them pointed towards the children and then he whispered something to the other four and all five of them burst into peals of laughter but they cant be real people charlie said of course theyre real people mr wonka answered theyre oompaloompas the oompaloompas oompaloompas everyone said at once oompaloompas imported direct from loompaland said mr wonka proudly theres no such place said mrs salt excuse me dear lady but mr wonka cried mrs salt im a teacher of geography then youll know all about it said mr wonka and oh what a terrible country it is nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the world hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible wicked whangdoodles a whangdoodle would eat ten oompaloompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping when i went out there i found the little oompaloompas living in tree houses they had to live in tree houses to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers and the snozzwangers and they were living on green caterpillars and the caterpillars tasted revolting and the oompaloompas spent every moment of their days climbing through the treetops looking for other things to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better red beetles for instance and eucalyptus leaves and the bark of the bongbong tree all of them beastly but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars poor little oompaloompas the one food that they longed for more than any other was the cacao bean but they couldnt get it an oompaloompa was lucky if he found three or four cacao beans a year but oh how they craved them they used to dream about cacao beans all night and talk about them all day you had only to mention the word cacao to an oompaloompa and he would start dribbling at the mouth the cacao bean mr wonka continued which grows on the cacao tree happens to be the thing from which all chocolate is made you cannot make chocolate without the cacao bean the cacao bean is chocolate i myself use billions of cacao beans every week in this factory and so my dear children as soon as i discovered that the oompaloompas were crazy about this particular food i climbed up to their treehouse village and poked my head in through the door of the tree house belonging to the leader of the tribe the poor little fellow looking thin and starved was sitting there trying to eat a bowl full of mashedup green caterpillars without being sick look here i said look here if you and all your people will come back to my country and live in my factory you can have all the cacao beans you want ive got mountains of them in my storehouses you can have cacao beans for every meal you can gorge yourselves silly on them ill even pay your wages in cacao beans if you wish you really mean it asked the oompaloompa leader leaping up from his chair of course i mean it i said and you can have chocolate as well chocolate tastes even better than cacao beans because its got milk and sugar added the little man gave a great whoop of joy and threw his bowl of mashed caterpillars right out of the treehouse window its a deal he cried come on lets go so i shipped them all over here every man woman and child in the oompaloompa tribe it was easy i smuggled them over in large packing cases with holes in them and they all got here safely they are wonderful workers they all speak english now they love dancing and music they are always making up songs i expect you will hear a good deal of singing today from time to time i must warn you though that they are rather mischievous they like jokes they still wear the same kind of clothes they wore in the jungle they insist upon that the men as you can see for yourselves across the river wear only deerskins the women wear leaves and the children wear nothing at all the women use fresh leaves every day daddy shouted veruca salt daddy i want an oompaloompa i want you to get me an oompaloompa i want an oompaloompa right away i want to take it home with me go on daddy get me an oompaloompa now now my pet her father said to her we mustnt interrupt mr wonka but i want an oompaloompa screamed veruca all right veruca all right but i cant get it for you this second please be patient ill see you have one before the day is out augustus shouted mrs gloop augustus sweetheart i dont think you had better do that augustus gloop as you might have guessed had quietly sneaked down to the edge of the river and he was now kneeling on the riverbank scooping hot melted chocolate into his mouth as fast as he could augustus gloop goes up the pipe when mr wonka turned round and saw what augustus gloop was doing he cried out oh no please augustus please i beg of you not to do that my chocolate must be untouched by human hands augustus called out mrs gloop didnt you hear what the man said come away from that river at once this stuff is fabulous said augustus taking not the slightest notice of his mother or mr wonka gosh i need a bucket to drink it properly augustus cried mr wonka hopping up and down and waggling his stick in the air you must come away you are dirtying my chocolate augustus cried mrs gloop augustus cried mr gloop but augustus was deaf to everything except the call of his enormous stomach he was now lying full length on the ground with his head far out over the river lapping up the chocolate like a dog augustus shouted mrs gloop youll be giving that nasty cold of yours to about a million people all over the country be careful augustus shouted mr gloop youre leaning too far out mr gloop was absolutely right for suddenly there was a shriek and then a splash and into the river went augustus gloop and in one second he had disappeared under the brown surface save him screamed mrs gloop going white in the face and waving her umbrella about hell drown he cant swim a yard save him save him good heavens woman said mr gloop im not diving in there ive got my best suit on augustus gloops face came up again to the surface painted brown with chocolate help help help he yelled fish me out dont just stand there mrs gloop screamed at mr gloop do something i am doing something said mr gloop who was now taking off his jacket and getting ready to dive into the chocolate but while he was doing this the wretched boy was being sucked closer and closer towards the mouth of one of the great pipes that was dangling down into the river then all at once the powerful suction took hold of him completely and he was pulled under the surface and then into the mouth of the pipe the crowd on the riverbank waited breathlessly to see where he would come out there he goes somebody shouted pointing upwards and sure enough because the pipe was made of glass augustus gloop could be clearly seen shooting up inside it head first like a torpedo help murder police screamed mrs gloop augustus come back at once where are you going its a wonder to me said mr gloop how that pipe is big enough for him to go through it it isnt big enough said charlie bucket oh dear look hes slowing down so he is said grandpa joe hes going to stick said charlie i think he is said grandpa joe by golly he has stuck said charlie its his stomach thats done it said mr gloop hes blocked the whole pipe said grandpa joe smash the pipe yelled mrs gloop still waving her umbrella augustus come out of there at once the watchers below could see the chocolate swishing around the boy in the pipe and they could see it building up behind him in a solid mass pushing against the blockage the pressure was terrific something had to give something did give and that something was augustus whoof up he shot again like a bullet in the barrel of a gun hes disappeared yelled mrs gloop where does that pipe go to quick call the fire brigade keep calm cried mr wonka keep calm my dear lady keep calm there is no danger no danger whatsoever augustus has gone on a little journey thats all a most interesting little journey but hell come out of it just fine you wait and see how can he possibly come out just fine snapped mrs gloop hell be made into marshmallows in five seconds impossible cried mr wonka unthinkable inconceivable absurd he could never be made into marshmallows and why not may i ask shouted mrs gloop because that pipe doesnt go anywhere near it that pipe the one augustus went up happens to lead directly to the room where i make a most delicious kind of strawberryflavoured chocolatecoated fudge then hell be made into strawberryflavoured chocolatecoated fudge screamed mrs gloop my poor augustus theyll be selling him by the pound all over the country tomorrow morning quite right said mr gloop i know im right said mrs gloop its beyond a joke said mr gloop mr wonka doesnt seem to think so cried mrs gloop just look at him hes laughing his head off how dare you laugh like that when my boys just gone up the pipe you monster she shrieked pointing her umbrella at mr wonka as though she were going to run him through you think its a joke do you you think that sucking my boy up into your fudge room like that is just one great big colossal joke hell be perfectly safe said mr wonka giggling slightly hell be chocolate fudge shrieked mrs gloop never cried mr wonka of course he will shrieked mrs gloop i wouldnt allow it cried mr wonka and why not shrieked mrs gloop because the taste would be terrible said mr wonka just imagine it augustusflavoured chocolatecoated gloop no one would buy it they most certainly would cried mr gloop indignantly i dont want to think about it shrieked mrs gloop nor do i said mr wonka and i do promise you madam that your darling boy is perfectly safe if hes perfectly safe then where is he snapped mrs gloop lead me to him this instant mr wonka turned around and clicked his fingers sharply click click click three times immediately an oompaloompa appeared as if from nowhere and stood beside him the oompaloompa bowed and smiled showing beautiful white teeth his skin was rosywhite his long hair was goldenbrown and the top of his head came just above the height of mr wonkas knee he wore the usual deerskin slung over his shoulder now listen to me said mr wonka looking down at the tiny man i want you to take mr and mrs gloop up to the fudge room and help them to find their son augustus hes just gone up the pipe the oompaloompa took one look at mrs gloop and exploded into peals of laughter oh do be quiet said mr wonka control yourself pull yourself together mrs gloop doesnt think its at all funny you can say that again said mrs gloop go straight to the fudge room mr wonka said to the oompaloompa and when you get there take a long stick and start poking around inside the big chocolatemixing barrel im almost certain youll find him in there but youd better look sharp youll have to hurry if you leave him in the chocolatemixing barrel too long hes liable to get poured out into the fudge boiler and that really would be a disaster wouldnt it my fudge would become quite uneatable mrs gloop let out a shriek of fury im joking said mr wonka giggling madly behind his beard i didnt mean it forgive me im so sorry goodbye mrs gloop and mr gloop goodbye ill see you later as mr and mrs gloop and their tiny escort hurried away the five oompaloompas on the far side of the river suddenly began hopping and dancing about and beating wildly upon a number of very small drums augustus gloop they chanted augustus gloop augustus gloop augustus gloop grandpa cried charlie listen to them grandpa what are they doing ssshh whispered grandpa joe i think theyre going to sing us a song augustus gloop chanted the oompaloompas augustus gloop augustus gloop the great big greedy nincompoop how long could we allow this beast to gorge and guzzle feed and feast on everything he wanted to great scott it simply wouldnt do however long this pig might live were positive hed never give even the smallest bit of fun or happiness to anyone so what we do in cases such as this we use the gentle touch and carefully we take the brat and turn him into something that will give great pleasure to us all a doll for instance or a ball or marbles or a rocking horse but this revolting boy of course was so unutterably vile so greedy foul and infantile he left a most disgusting taste inside our mouths and so in haste we chose a thing that come what may would take the nasty taste away come on we cried the time is ripe to send him shooting up the pipe he has to go it has to be and very soon hes going to see inside the room to which hes gone some funny things are going on but dont dear children be alarmed augustus gloop will not be harmed although of course we must admit he will be altered quite a bit hell be quite changed from what hes been when he goes through the fudge machine slowly the wheels go round and round the cogs begin to grind and pound a hundred knives go slice slice slice we add some sugar cream and spice we boil him for a minute more until were absolutely sure that all the greed and all the gall is boiled away for once and all then out he comes and now by grace a miracle has taken place this boy who only just before was loathed by men from shore to shore this greedy brute this louses ear is loved by people everywhere for who could hate or bear a grudge against a luscious bit of fudge i told you they loved singing cried mr wonka arent they delightful arent they charming but you mustnt believe a word they said its all nonsense every bit of it are the oompaloompas really joking grandpa asked charlie of course theyre joking answered grandpa joe they must be joking at least i hope theyre joking dont you down the chocolate river off we go cried mr wonka hurry up everybody follow me to the next room and please dont worry about augustus gloop hes bound to come out in the wash they always do we shall have to make the next part of the journey by boat here she comes look a steamy mist was rising up now from the great warm chocolate river and out of the mist there appeared suddenly a most fantastic pink boat it was a large open row boat with a tall front and a tall back and it was of such a shining sparkling glistening pink colour that the whole thing looked as though it were made of bright pink glass there were many oars on either side of it and as the boat came closer the watchers on the riverbank could see that the oars were being pulled by masses of oompaloompas at least ten of them to each oar this is my private yacht cried mr wonka beaming with pleasure i made her by hollowing out an enormous boiled sweet isnt she beautiful see how she comes cutting through the river the gleaming pink boiledsweet boat glided up to the riverbank one hundred oompaloompas rested on their oars and stared up at the visitors then suddenly for some reason best known to themselves they all burst into shrieks of laughter whats so funny asked violet beauregarde oh dont worry about them cried mr wonka theyre always laughing they think everythings a colossal joke jump into the boat all of you come on hurry up as soon as everyone was safely in the oompaloompas pushed the boat away from the bank and began to row swiftly downriver hey there mike teavee shouted mr wonka please do not lick the boat with your tongue itll only make it sticky daddy said veruca salt i want a boat like this i want you to buy me a big pink boiledsweet boat exactly like mr wonkas and i want lots of oompaloompas to row me about and i want a chocolate river and i want i want she wants a good kick in the pants whispered grandpa joe to charlie the old man was sitting in the back of the boat and little charlie bucket was right beside him charlie was holding tightly on to his grandfathers bony old hand he was in a whirl of excitement everything that he had seen so far the great chocolate river the waterfall the huge sucking pipes the minty sugar meadows the oompaloompas the beautiful pink boat and most of all mr willy wonka himself had been so astonishing that he began to wonder whether there could possibly be any more astonishments left where were they going now what were they going to see and what in the world was going to happen in the next room isnt it marvellous said grandpa joe grinning at charlie charlie nodded and smiled up at the old man suddenly mr wonka who was sitting on charlies other side reached down into the bottom of the boat picked up a large mug dipped it into the river filled it with chocolate and handed it to charlie drink this he said itll do you good you look starved to death then mr wonka filled a second mug and gave it to grandpa joe you too he said you look like a skeleton whats the matter hasnt there been anything to eat in your house lately not much said grandpa joe charlie put the mug to his lips and as the rich warm creamy chocolate ran down his throat into his empty tummy his whole body from head to toe began to tingle with pleasure and a feeling of intense happiness spread over him you like it asked mr wonka oh its wonderful charlie said the creamiest loveliest chocolate ive ever tasted said grandpa joe smacking his lips thats because its been mixed by waterfall mr wonka told him the boat sped on down the river the river was getting narrower there was some kind of a dark tunnel ahead a great round tunnel that looked like an enormous pipe and the river was running right into the tunnel and so was the boat row on shouted mr wonka jumping up and waving his stick in the air full speed ahead and with the oompaloompas rowing faster than ever the boat shot into the pitchdark tunnel and all the passengers screamed with excitement how can they see where theyre going shrieked violet beauregarde in the darkness theres no knowing where theyre going cried mr wonka hooting with laughter theres no earthly way of knowing which direction they are going theres no knowing where theyre rowing or which way the rivers flowing not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing and theyre certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing hes gone off his rocker shouted one of the fathers aghast and the other parents joined in the chorus of frightened shouting hes crazy they shouted hes balmy hes nutty hes screwy hes batty hes dippy hes dotty hes daffy hes goofy hes beany hes buggy hes wacky hes loony no he is not said grandpa joe switch on the lights shouted mr wonka and suddenly on came the lights and the whole tunnel was brilliantly lit up and charlie could see that they were indeed inside a gigantic pipe and the great upwardcurving walls of the pipe were pure white and spotlessly clean the river of chocolate was flowing very fast inside the pipe and the oompaloompas were all rowing like mad and the boat was rocketing along at a furious pace mr wonka was jumping up and down in the back of the boat and calling to the rowers to row faster and faster still he seemed to love the sensation of whizzing through a white tunnel in a pink boat on a chocolate river and he clapped his hands and laughed and kept glancing at his passengers to see if they were enjoying it as much as he look grandpa cried charlie theres a door in the wall it was a green door and it was set into the wall of the tunnel just above the level of the river as they flashed past it there was just enough time to read the writing on the door storeroom number it said all the creams dairy cream whipped cream violet cream coffee cream pineapple cream vanilla cream and hair cream hair cream cried mike teavee you dont use hair cream row on shouted mr wonka theres no time to answer silly questions they streaked past a black door storeroom number it said on it whips all shapes and sizes whips cried veruca salt what on earth do you use whips for for whipping cream of course said mr wonka how can you whip cream without whips whipped cream isnt whipped cream at all unless its been whipped with whips just as a poached egg isnt a poached egg unless its been stolen from the woods in the dead of night row on please they passed a yellow door on which it said storeroom number all the beans cacao beans coffee beans jelly beans and has beans has beans cried violet beauregarde youre one yourself said mr wonka theres no time for arguing press on press on but five seconds later when a bright red door came into sight ahead he suddenly waved his goldtopped cane in the air and shouted stop the boat the inventing room everlasting gobstoppers and hair toffee when mr wonka shouted stop the boat the oompaloompas jammed their oars into the river and backed water furiously the boat stopped the oompaloompas guided the boat alongside the red door on the door it said inventing room private keep out mr wonka took a key from his pocket leaned over the side of the boat and put the key in the keyhole this is the most important room in the entire factory he said all my most secret new inventions are cooking and simmering in here old fickelgruber would give his front teeth to be allowed inside just for three minutes so would prodnose and slugworth and all the other rotten chocolate makers but now listen to me i want no messing about when you go in no touching no meddling and no tasting is that agreed yes yes the children cried we wont touch a thing up to now mr wonka said nobody else not even an oompaloompa has ever been allowed in here he opened the door and stepped out of the boat into the room the four children and their parents all scrambled after him dont touch shouted mr wonka and dont knock anything over charlie bucket stared around the gigantic room in which he now found himself the place was like a witchs kitchen all about him black metal pots were boiling and bubbling on huge stoves and kettles were hissing and pans were sizzling and strange iron machines were clanking and spluttering and there were pipes running all over the ceiling and walls and the whole place was filled with smoke and steam and delicious rich smells mr wonka himself had suddenly become even more excited than usual and anyone could see that this was the room he loved best of all he was hopping about among the saucepans and the machines like a child among his christmas presents not knowing which thing to look at first he lifted the lid from a huge pot and took a sniff then he rushed over and dipped a finger into a barrel of sticky yellow stuff and had a taste then he skipped across to one of the machines and turned half a dozen knobs this way and that then he peered anxiously through the glass door of a gigantic oven rubbing his hands and cackling with delight at what he saw inside then he ran over to another machine a small shiny affair that kept going phutphutphutphutphut and every time it went phut a large green marble dropped out of it into a basket on the floor at least it looked like a marble everlasting gobstoppers cried mr wonka proudly theyre completely new i am inventing them for children who are given very little pocket money you can put an everlasting gobstopper in your mouth and you can suck it and suck it and suck it and suck it and it will never get any smaller its like gum cried violet beauregarde it is not like gum mr wonka said gum is for chewing and if you tried chewing one of these gobstoppers here youd break your teeth off and they never get any smaller they never disappear never at least i dont think they do theres one of them being tested this very moment in the testing room next door an oompaloompa is sucking it hes been sucking it for very nearly a year now without stopping and its still just as good as ever now over here mr wonka went on skipping excitedly across the room to the opposite wall over here i am inventing a completely new line in toffees he stopped beside a large saucepan the saucepan was full of a thick gooey purplish treacle boiling and bubbling by standing on his toes little charlie could just see inside it thats hair toffee cried mr wonka you eat just one tiny bit of that and in exactly half an hour a brandnew luscious thick silky beautiful crop of hair will start growing out all over the top of your head and a moustache and a beard a beard cried veruca salt who wants a beard for heavens sake it would suit you very well said mr wonka but unfortunately the mixture is not quite right yet ive got it too strong it works too well i tried it on an oompaloompa yesterday in the testing room and immediately a huge black beard started shooting out of his chin and the beard grew so fast that soon it was trailing all over the floor in a thick hairy carpet it was growing faster than we could cut it in the end we had to use a lawn mower to keep it in check but ill get the mixture right soon and when i do then therell be no excuse any more for little boys and girls going about with bald heads but mr wonka said mike teavee little boys and girls never do go about with dont argue my dear child please dont argue cried mr wonka its such a waste of precious time now over here if you will all step this way i will show you something that i am terrifically proud of oh do be careful dont knock anything over stand back the great gum machine mr wonka led the party over to a gigantic machine that stood in the very centre of the inventing room it was a mountain of gleaming metal that towered high above the children and their parents out of the very top of it there sprouted hundreds and hundreds of thin glass tubes and the glass tubes all curled downwards and came together in a bunch and hung suspended over an enormous round tub as big as a bath here we go cried mr wonka and he pressed three different buttons on the side of the machine a second later a mighty rumbling sound came from inside it and the whole machine began to shake most frighteningly and steam began hissing out of it all over and then suddenly the watchers noticed that runny stuff was pouring down the insides of all the hundreds of little glass tubes and squirting out into the great tub below and in every single tube the runny stuff was of a different colour so that all the colours of the rainbow came sloshing and splashing into the tub it was a lovely sight and when the tub was nearly full mr wonka pressed another button and immediately the runny stuff disappeared and a whizzing whirring noise took its place and then a giant whizzer started whizzing round inside the enormous tub mixing up all the different coloured liquids like an icecream soda gradually the mixture began to froth it became frothier and frothier and it turned from blue to white to green to brown to yellow then back to blue again watch said mr wonka click went the machine and the whizzer stopped whizzing and now there came a sort of sucking noise and very quickly all the blue frothy mixture in the huge basin was sucked back into the stomach of the machine there was a moment of silence then a few queer rumblings were heard then silence again then suddenly the machine let out a monstrous mighty groan and at the same moment a tiny drawer popped out of the side of the machine and in the drawer there lay something so small and thin and grey that everyone thought it must be a mistake the thing looked like a little strip of grey cardboard the children and their parents stared at the little grey strip lying in the drawer you mean thats all said mike teavee disgusted thats all answered mr wonka gazing proudly at the result dont you know what it is there was a pause then suddenly violet beauregarde the silly gumchewing girl let out a yell of excitement by gum its gum she shrieked its a stick of chewinggum right you are cried mr wonka slapping violet hard on the back its a stick of gum its a stick of the most amazing and fabulous and sensational gum in the world goodbye violet this gum mr wonka went on is my latest my greatest my most fascinating invention its a chewinggum meal its its its that tiny little strip of gum lying there is a whole threecourse dinner all by itself what sort of nonsense is this said one of the fathers my dear sir cried mr wonka when i start selling this gum in the shops it will change everything it will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking there will be no more shopping to do no more buying of meat and groceries therell be no knives and forks at mealtimes no plates no washing up no rubbish no mess just a little strip of wonkas magic chewinggum and thats all youll ever need at breakfast lunch and supper this piece of gum ive just made happens to be tomato soup roast beef and blueberry pie but you can have almost anything you want what do you mean its tomato soup roast beef and blueberry pie said violet beauregarde if you were to start chewing it said mr wonka then that is exactly what you would get on the menu its absolutely amazing you can actually feel the food going down your throat and into your tummy and you can taste it perfectly and it fills you up it satisfies you its terrific its utterly impossible said veruca salt just so long as its gum shouted violet beauregarde just so long as its a piece of gum and i can chew it then thats for me and quickly she took her own worldrecord piece of chewinggum out of her mouth and stuck it behind her left ear come on mr wonka she said hand over this magic gum of yours and well see if the thing works now violet said mrs beauregarde her mother dont lets do anything silly violet i want the gum violet said obstinately whats so silly i would rather you didnt take it mr wonka told her gently you see i havent got it quite right yet there are still one or two things oh to blazes with that said violet and suddenly before mr wonka could stop her she shot out a fat hand and grabbed the stick of gum out of the little drawer and popped it into her mouth at once her huge welltrained jaws started chewing away on it like a pair of tongs dont said mr wonka fabulous shouted violet its tomato soup its hot and creamy and delicious i can feel it running down my throat stop said mr wonka the gum isnt ready yet its not right of course its right said violet its working beautifully oh my what lovely soup this is spit it out said mr wonka its changing shouted violet chewing and grinning both at the same time the second course is coming up its roast beef its tender and juicy oh boy what a flavour the baked potato is marvellous too its got a crispy skin and its all filled with butter inside but how interesting violet said mrs beauregarde you are a clever girl keep chewing baby said mr beauregarde keep right on chewing this is a great day for the beauregardes our little girl is the first person in the world to have a chewinggum meal everybody was watching violet beauregarde as she stood there chewing this extraordinary gum little charlie bucket was staring at her absolutely spellbound watching her huge rubbery lips as they pressed and unpressed with the chewing and grandpa joe stood beside him gaping at the girl mr wonka was wringing his hands and saying no no no no no it isnt ready for eating it isnt right you mustnt do it blueberry pie and cream shouted violet here it comes oh my its perfect its beautiful its its exactly as though im swallowing it its as though im chewing and swallowing great big spoonfuls of the most marvellous blueberry pie in the world good heavens girl shrieked mrs beauregarde suddenly staring at violet whats happening to your nose oh be quiet mother and let me finish said violet its turning blue screamed mrs beauregarde your nose is turning blue as a blueberry your mother is right shouted mr beauregarde your whole nose has gone purple what do you mean said violet still chewing away your cheeks screamed mrs beauregarde theyre turning blue as well so is your chin your whole face is turning blue spit that gum out at once ordered mr beauregarde mercy save us yelled mrs beauregarde the girls going blue and purple all over even her hair is changing colour violet youre turning violet violet what is happening to you i told you i hadnt got it quite right sighed mr wonka shaking his head sadly ill say you havent cried mrs beauregarde just look at the girl now everybody was staring at violet and what a terrible peculiar sight she was her face and hands and legs and neck in fact the skin all over her body as well as her great big mop of curly hair had turned a brilliant purplishblue the colour of blueberry juice it always goes wrong when we come to the dessert sighed mr wonka its the blueberry pie that does it but ill get it right one day you wait and see violet screamed mrs beauregarde youre swelling up i feel sick violet said youre swelling up screamed mrs beauregarde again i feel most peculiar gasped violet im not surprised said mr beauregarde great heavens girl screeched mrs beauregarde youre blowing up like a balloon like a blueberry said mr wonka call a doctor shouted mr beauregarde prick her with a pin said one of the other fathers save her cried mrs beauregarde wringing her hands but there was no saving her now her body was swelling up and changing shape at such a rate that within a minute it had turned into nothing less than an enormous round blue ball a gigantic blueberry in fact and all that remained of violet beauregarde herself was a tiny pair of legs and a tiny pair of arms sticking out of the great round fruit and little head on top it always happens like that sighed mr wonka ive tried it twenty times in the testing room on twenty oompaloompas and every one of them finished up as a blueberry its most annoying i just cant understand it but i dont want a blueberry for a daughter yelled mrs beauregarde put her back to what she was this instant mr wonka clicked his fingers and ten oompaloompas appeared immediately at his side roll miss beauregarde into the boat he said to them and take her along to the juicing room at once the juicing room cried mrs beauregarde what are they going to do to her there squeeze her said mr wonka weve got to squeeze the juice out of her immediately after that well just have to see how she comes out but dont worry my dear mrs beauregarde well get her repaired if its the last thing we do i am sorry about it all i really am already the ten oompaloompas were rolling the enormous blueberry across the floor of the inventing room towards the door that led to the chocolate river where the boat was waiting mr and mrs beauregarde hurried after them the rest of the party including little charlie bucket and grandpa joe stood absolutely still and watched them go listen whispered charlie listen grandpa the oompaloompas in the boat outside are starting to sing the voices one hundred of them singing together came loud and clear into the room dear friends we surely all agree theres almost nothing worse to see than some repulsive little bum whos always chewing chewinggum its very near as bad as those who sit around and pick the nose so please believe us when we say that chewing gum will never pay this sticky habits bound to send the chewer to a sticky end did any of you ever know a person called miss bigelow this dreadful woman saw no wrong in chewing chewing all day long she chewed while bathing in the tub she chewed while dancing at her club she chewed in church and on the bus it really was quite ludicrous and when she couldnt find her gum shed chew up the linoleum or anything that happened near a pair of boots the postmans ear or other peoples underclothes and once she chewed her boyfriends nose she went on chewing till at last her chewing muscles grew so vast that from her face her giant chin stuck out just like a violin for years and years she chewed away consuming fifty bits a day until one summers eve alas a horrid business came to pass miss bigelow went late to bed for half an hour she lay and read chewing and chewing all the while like some great clockwork crocodile at last she put her gum away upon a special little tray and settled back and went to sleep but now how strange although she slept those massive jaws of hers still kept on chewing chewing through the night even with nothing there to bite they were you see in such a groove they positively had to move and very grim it was to hear in pitchy darkness loud and clear this sleeping womans great big trap opening and shutting snapsnapsnap faster and faster chopchopchop the noise went on it wouldnt stop until at last her jaws decide to pause and open extra wide and with the most tremendous chew they bit the ladys tongue in two thereafter just from chewing gum miss bigelow was always dumb and spent her life shut up in some disgusting sanatorium and that is why well try so hard to save miss violet beauregarde from suffering an equal fate shes still quite young its not too late provided she survives the cure we hope she does we cant be sure along the corridor well well well sighed mr willy wonka two naughty little children gone three good little children left i think wed better get out of this room quickly before we lose anyone else but mr wonka said charlie bucket anxiously will violet beauregarde ever be all right again or will she always be a blueberry theyll dejuice her in no time flat declared mr wonka theyll roll her into the dejuicing machine and shell come out just as thin as a whistle but will she still be blue all over asked charlie shell be purple cried mr wonka a fine rich purple from head to toe but there you are thats what comes from chewing disgusting gum all day long if you think gum is so disgusting said mike teavee then why do you make it in your factory i do wish you wouldnt mumble said mr wonka i cant hear a word youre saying come on off we go hurry up follow me were going into the corridors again and so saying mr wonka scuttled across to the far end of the inventing room and went out through a small secret door hidden behind a lot of pipes and stoves the three remaining children veruca salt mike teavee and charlie bucket together with the five remaining grownups followed after him charlie bucket saw that they were now back in one of those long pink corridors with many other pink corridors leading out of it mr wonka was rushing along in front turning left and right and right and left and grandpa joe was saying keep a good hold of my hand charlie it would be terrible to get lost in here mr wonka was saying no time for any more messing about well never get anywhere at the rate weve been going and on he rushed down the endless pink corridors with his black top hat perched on the top of his head and his plumcoloured velvet coattails flying out behind him like a flag in the wind they passed a door in the wall no time to go in shouted mr wonka press on press on they passed another door then another and another there were doors every twenty paces or so along the corridor now and they all had something written on them and strange clanking noises were coming from behind several of them and delicious smells came wafting through the keyholes and sometimes little jets of coloured steam shot out from the cracks underneath grandpa joe and charlie were half running and half walking to keep up with mr wonka but they were able to read what it said on quite a few of the doors as they hurried by eatable marshmallow pillows it said on one marshmallow pillows are terrific shouted mr wonka as he dashed by theyll be all the rage when i get them into the shops no time to go in though no time to go in lickable wallpaper for nurseries it said on the next door lovely stuff lickable wallpaper cried mr wonka rushing past it has pictures of fruits on it bananas apples oranges grapes pineapples strawberries and snozzberries snozzberries said mike teavee dont interrupt said mr wonka the wallpaper has pictures of all these fruits printed on it and when you lick the picture of a banana it tastes of banana when you lick a strawberry it tastes of strawberry and when you lick a snozzberry it tastes just exactly like a snozzberry but what does a snozzberry taste like youre mumbling again said mr wonka speak louder next time on we go hurry up hot ice creams for cold days it said on the next door extremely useful in the winter said mr wonka rushing on hot ice cream warms you up no end in freezing weather i also make hot ice cubes for putting in hot drinks hot ice cubes make hot drinks hotter cows that give chocolate milk it said on the next door ah my pretty little cows cried mr wonka how i love those cows but why cant we see them asked veruca salt why do we have to go rushing on past all these lovely rooms we shall stop in time called out mr wonka dont be so madly impatient fizzy lifting drinks it said on the next door oh those are fabulous cried mr wonka they fill you with bubbles and the bubbles are full of a special kind of gas and this gas is so terrifically lifting that it lifts you right off the ground just like a balloon and up you go until your head hits the ceiling and there you stay but how do you come down again asked little charlie you do a burp of course said mr wonka you do a great big long rude burp and up comes the gas and down comes you but dont drink it outdoors theres no knowing how high up youll be carried if you do that i gave some to an old oompaloompa once out in the back yard and he went up and up and disappeared out of sight it was very sad i never saw him again he should have burped charlie said of course he should have burped said mr wonka i stood there shouting burp you silly ass burp or youll never come down again but he didnt or couldnt or wouldnt i dont know which maybe he was too polite he must be on the moon by now on the next door it said square sweets that look round wait cried mr wonka skidding suddenly to a halt i am very proud of my square sweets that look round lets take a peek square sweets that look round everybody stopped and crowded to the door the top half of the door was made of glass grandpa joe lifted charlie up so that he could get a better view and looking in charlie saw a long table and on the table there were rows and rows of small white squareshaped sweets the sweets looked very much like square sugar lumps except that each of them had a funny little pink face painted on one side at the end of the table a number of oompaloompas were busily painting more faces on more sweets there you are cried mr wonka square sweets that look round they dont look round to me said mike teavee they look square said veruca salt they look completely square but they are square said mr wonka i never said they werent you said they were round said veruca salt i never said anything of the sort said mr wonka i said they looked round but they dont look round said veruca salt they look square they look round insisted mr wonka they most certainly do not look round cried veruca salt veruca darling said mrs salt pay no attention to mr wonka hes lying to you my dear old fish said mr wonka go and boil your head how dare you speak to me like that shouted mrs salt oh do shut up said mr wonka now watch this he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door and flung it open and suddenly at the sound of the door opening all the rows of little square sweets looked quickly round to see who was coming in the tiny faces actually turned towards the door and stared at mr wonka there you are he cried triumphantly theyre looking round theres no argument about it they are square sweets that look round by golly hes right said grandpa joe come on said mr wonka starting off down the corridor again on we go we mustnt dawdle butterscotch and buttergin it said on the next door they passed now that sounds a bit more interesting said mr salt verucas father glorious stuff said mr wonka the oompaloompas all adore it it makes them tiddly listen you can hear them in there now whooping it up shrieks of laughter and snatches of singing could be heard coming through the closed door theyre drunk as lords said mr wonka theyre drinking butterscotch and soda they like that best of all buttergin and tonic is also very popular follow me please we really mustnt keep stopping like this he turned left he turned right they came to a long flight of stairs mr wonka slid down the banisters the three children did the same mrs salt and mrs teavee the only women now left in the party were getting very out of breath mrs salt was a great fat creature with short legs and she was blowing like a rhinoceros this way cried mr wonka turning left at the bottom of the stairs go slower panted mrs salt impossible said mr wonka we should never get there in time if i did get where asked veruca salt never you mind said mr wonka you just wait and see veruca in the nut room mr wonka rushed on down the corridor the nut room it said on the next door they came to all right said mr wonka stop here for a moment and catch your breath and take a peek through the glass panel of this door but dont go in whatever you do dont go into the nut room if you go in youll disturb the squirrels everyone crowded around the door oh look grandpa look cried charlie squirrels shouted veruca salt crikey said mike teavee it was an amazing sight one hundred squirrels were seated upon high stools around a large table on the table there were mounds and mounds of walnuts and the squirrels were all working away like mad shelling the walnuts at a tremendous speed these squirrels are specially trained for getting the nuts out of walnuts mr wonka explained why use squirrels mike teavee asked why not use oompaloompas because said mr wonka oompaloompas cant get walnuts out of walnut shells in one piece they always break them in two nobody except squirrels can get walnuts whole out of walnut shells every time it is extremely difficult but in my factory i insist upon only whole walnuts therefore i have to have squirrels to do the job arent they wonderful the way they get those nuts out and see how they first tap each walnut with their knuckles to be sure its not a bad one if its bad it makes a hollow sound and they dont bother to open it they just throw it down the rubbish chute there look watch that squirrel nearest to us i think hes got a bad one now they watched the little squirrel as he tapped the walnut shell with his knuckles he cocked his head to one side listening intently then suddenly he threw the nut over his shoulder into a large hole in the floor hey mummy shouted veruca salt suddenly ive decided i want a squirrel get me one of those squirrels dont be silly sweetheart said mrs salt these all belong to mr wonka i dont care about that shouted veruca i want one all ive got at home is two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle and a bowl of goldfish and a cage of white mice and a silly old hamster i want a squirrel all right my pet mrs salt said soothingly mummyll get you a squirrel just as soon as she possibly can but i dont want any old squirrel veruca shouted i want a trained squirrel at this point mr salt verucas father stepped forward very well wonka he said importantly taking out a wallet full of money how much dyou want for one of these squirrels name your price theyre not for sale mr wonka answered she cant have one who says i cant shouted veruca im going in to get myself one this very minute dont said mr wonka quickly but he was too late the girl had already thrown open the door and rushed in the moment she entered the room one hundred squirrels stopped what they were doing and turned their heads and stared at her with small black beady eyes veruca salt stopped also and stared back at them then her gaze fell upon a pretty little squirrel sitting nearest to her at the end of the table the squirrel was holding a walnut in its paws all right veruca said ill have you she reached out her hands to grab the squirrel but as she did so in that first split second when her hands started to go forward there was a sudden flash of movement in the room like a flash of brown lightning and every single squirrel around the table took a flying leap towards her and landed on her body twentyfive of them caught hold of her right arm and pinned it down twentyfive more caught hold of her left arm and pinned that down twentyfive caught hold of her right leg and anchored it to the ground twentyfour caught hold of her left leg and the one remaining squirrel climbed up on to her shoulder and started taptaptapping the wretched girls head with its knuckles save her screamed mrs salt veruca come back what are they doing to her theyre testing her to see if shes a bad nut said mr wonka you watch veruca struggled furiously but the squirrels held her tight and she couldnt move the squirrel on her shoulder went taptaptapping the side of her head with his knuckles then all at once the squirrels pulled veruca to the ground and started carrying her across the floor my goodness she is a bad nut after all said mr wonka her head must have sounded quite hollow veruca kicked and screamed but it was no use the tiny strong paws held her tightly and she couldnt escape where are they taking her shrieked mrs salt shes going where all the other bad nuts go said mr willy wonka down the rubbish chute by golly she is going down the chute said mr salt staring through the glass door at his daughter then save her cried mrs salt too late said mr wonka shes gone and indeed she had but where shrieked mrs salt flapping her arms what happens to the bad nuts where does the chute go to that particular chute mr wonka told her runs directly into the great big main rubbish pipe which carries away all the rubbish from every part of the factory all the floor sweepings and potato peelings and rotten cabbages and fish heads and stuff like that who eats fish and cabbage and potatoes in this factory id like to know said mike teavee i do of course answered mr wonka you dont think i live on cacao beans do you but but but shrieked mrs salt where does the great big pipe go to in the end why to the furnace of course mr wonka said calmly to the incinerator mrs salt opened her huge red mouth and started to scream dont worry said mr wonka theres always a chance that theyve decided not to light it today a chance yelled mrs salt my darling veruca shell shell shell be sizzled like a sausage quite right my dear said mr salt now see here wonka he added i think youve gone just a shade too far this time i do indeed my daughter may be a bit of a frump i dont mind admitting it but that doesnt mean you can roast her to a crisp ill have you know im extremely cross about this i really am oh dont be cross my dear sir said mr wonka i expect shell turn up again sooner or later she may not even have gone down at all she may be stuck in the chute just below the entrance hole and if thats the case all youll have to do is go in and pull her up again hearing this both mr and mrs salt dashed into the nut room and ran over to the hole in the floor and peered in veruca shouted mrs salt are you down there there was no answer mrs salt bent further forward to get a closer look she was now kneeling right on the edge of the hole with her head down and her enormous behind sticking up in the air like a giant mushroom it was a dangerous position to be in she needed only one tiny little push one gentle nudge in the right place and that is exactly what the squirrels gave her over she toppled into the hole head first screeching like a parrot good gracious me said mr salt as he watched his fat wife go tumbling down the hole what a lot of rubbish theres going to be today he saw her disappearing into the darkness whats it like down there angina he called out he leaned further forward the squirrels rushed up behind him help he shouted but he was already toppling forward and down the chute he went just as his wife had done before him and his daughter oh dear cried charlie who was watching with the others through the door what on earths going to happen to them now i expect someone will catch them at the bottom of the chute said mr wonka but what about the great fiery incinerator asked charlie they only light it every other day said mr wonka perhaps this is one of the days when they let it go out you never know they might be lucky ssshh said grandpa joe listen here comes another song from far away down the corridor came the beating of drums then the singing began veruca salt sang the oompaloompas veruca salt the little brute has just gone down the rubbish chute and as we very rightly thought that in a case like this we ought to see the thing completely through weve polished off her parents too down goes veruca down the drain and here perhaps we should explain that she will meet as she descends a rather different set of friends to those that she has left behind these wont be nearly so refined a fish head for example cut this morning from a halibut hello good morning how dyou do how nice to meet you how are you and then a little further down a mass of others gather round a bacon rind some rancid lard a loaf of bread gone stale and hard a steak that nobody could chew an oyster from an oyster stew some liverwurst so old and grey one swelled it from a mile away a rotten nut a reeky pear a thing the cat left on the stair and lots of other things as well each with a rather horrid smell these are verucas newfound friends that she will meet as she descends and this is the price she has to pay for going so very far astray but now my dears we think you might be wondering is it really right that every single bit of blame and all the scolding and the shame should fall upon veruca salt is she the only one at fault for though shes spoiled and dreadfully so a girl cant spoil herself you know who spoiled her then ah who indeed who pandered to her every need who turned her into such a brat who are the culprits who did that alas you neednt look so far to find out who these sinners are they are her loving parents mum and dad and that is why were glad they fell into the rubbish chute as well the great glass lift ive never seen anything like it cried mr wonka the children are disappearing like rabbits but you mustnt worry about it theyll all come out in the wash mr wonka looked at the little group that stood beside him in the corridor there were only two children left now mike teavee and charlie bucket and there were three grownups mr and mrs teavee and grandpa joe shall we move on mr wonka asked oh yes cried charlie and grandpa joe both together my feet are getting tired said mike teavee i want to watch television if youre tired then wed better take the lift said mr wonka its over here come on in we go he skipped across the passage to a pair of double doors the doors slid open the two children and the grownups went in now then cried mr wonka which button shall we press first take your pick charlie bucket stared around him in astonishment this was the craziest lift he had ever seen there were buttons everywhere the walls and even the ceiling were covered all over with rows and rows and rows of small black push buttons there must have been a thousand of them on each wall and another thousand on the ceiling and now charlie noticed that every single button had a tiny printed label beside it telling you which room you would be taken to if you pressed it this isnt just an ordinary upanddown lift announced mr wonka proudly this lift can go sideways and longways and slantways and any other way you can think of it can visit any single room in the whole factory no matter where it is you simply press the button and zing youre off fantastic murmured grandpa joe his eyes were shining with excitement as he stared at the rows of buttons the whole lift is made of thick clear glass mr wonka declared walls doors ceiling floor everything is made of glass so that you can see out but theres nothing to see said mike teavee choose a button said mr wonka the two children may press one button each so take your pick hurry up in every room something delicious and wonderful is being made quickly charlie started reading some of the labels alongside the buttons the rockcandy mine feet deep it said on one cokernutice skating rinks it said on another then strawberryjuice water pistols toffeeapple trees

pencils for sucking fizzy lemonade swimming pools magic handfudge when you hold it in your hand you taste it in your mouth rainbow drops suck them and you can spit in six different colours come on come on cried mr wonka we cant wait all day isnt there a television room in all this lot asked mike teavee certainly theres a television room mr wonka said that button over there he pointed with his finger everybody looked television chocolate it said on the tiny label beside the button whoopee shouted mike teavee thats for me he stuck out his thumb and pressed the button instantly there was a tremendous whizzing noise the doors clanged shut and the lift leaped away as though it had been stung by a wasp but it leapt sideways and all the passengers were flung off their feet on to the floor get up get up cried mr wonka roaring with laughter but just as they were staggering to their feet the lift changed direction and swerved violently round a corner and over they went once more help shouted mrs teavee take my hand madam said mr wonka gallantly there you are now grab this strap everybody grab a strap the journeys not over yet old grandpa joe staggered to his feet and caught hold of a strap little charlie who couldnt possibly reach as high as that put his arms around grandpa joes legs and hung on tight the lift rushed on at the speed of a rocket now it was beginning to climb it was shooting up and up and up on a steep slanty course as if it were climbing a very steep hill then suddenly as though it had come to the top of the hill and gone over a precipice it dropped like a stone and charlie felt his tummy coming right up into his throat and grandpa joe shouted yippee here we go and mrs teavee cried out the rope has broken were going to crash and mr wonka said calm yourself my dear lady and patted her comfortingly on the arm and then grandpa joe looked down at charlie who was clinging to his legs and he said are you all right charlie charlie shouted i love it its like being on a roller coaster and through the glass walls of the lift as it rushed along they caught sudden glimpses of strange and wonderful things going on in some of the other rooms an enormous spout with brown sticky stuff oozing out of it on to the floor a great craggy mountain made entirely of fudge with oompaloompas hacking huge hunks of fudge out of its sides a machine with white powder spraying out of it like a snowstorm a lake of hot caramel with steam coming off it a village of oompaloompas with tiny houses and streets and hundreds of oompaloompa children no more than four inches high playing in the streets and now the lift began flattening out again but it seemed to be going faster than ever and charlie could hear the scream of the wind outside as it hurtled forward and it twisted and it turned and it went up and it went down and im going to be sick yelled mrs teavee turning green in the face please dont be sick said mr wonka try and stop me said mrs teavee then youd better take this said mr wonka and he swept his magnificent black top hat off his head and held it out upside down in front of mrs teavees mouth make this awful thing stop ordered mr teavee cant do that said mr wonka it wont stop till we get there i only hope no ones using the other lift at this moment what other lift screamed mrs teavee the one that goes the opposite way on the same track as this one said mr wonka holy mackerel cried mr teavee you mean we might have a collision ive always been lucky so far said mr wonka now i am going to be sick yelled mrs teavee no no said mr wonka not now were nearly there dont spoil my hat the next moment there was a screaming of brakes and the lift began to slow down then it stopped altogether some ride said mr teavee wiping his great sweaty face with a handkerchief never again gasped mrs teavee and then the doors of the lift slid open and mr wonka said just a minute now listen to me i want everybody to be very careful in this room there is dangerous stuff around in here and you must not tamper with it the televisionchocolate room the teavee family together with charlie and grandpa joe stepped out of the lift into a room so dazzlingly bright and dazzlingly white that they screwed up their eyes in pain and stopped walking mr wonka handed each of them a pair of dark glasses and said put these on quick and dont take them off in here whatever you do this light could blind you as soon as charlie had his dark glasses on he was able to look around him in comfort he saw a long narrow room the room was painted white all over even the floor was white and there wasnt a speck of dust anywhere from the ceiling huge lamps hung down and bathed the room in a brilliant bluewhite light the room was completely bare except at the far ends at one of these ends there was an enormous camera on wheels and a whole army of oompaloompas was clustering around it oiling its joints and adjusting its knobs and polishing its great glass lens the oompaloompas were all dressed in the most extraordinary way they were wearing brightred space suits complete with helmets and goggles at least they looked like space suits and they were working in complete silence watching them charlie experienced a queer sense of danger there was something dangerous about this whole business and the oompaloompas knew it there was no chattering or singing among them here and they moved about over the huge black camera slowly and carefully in their scarlet space suits at the other end of the room about fifty paces away from the camera a single oompaloompa was sitting at a black table gazing at the screen of a very large television set here we go cried mr wonka hopping up and down with excitement this is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention television chocolate but what is television chocolate asked mike teavee good heavens child stop interrupting me said mr wonka it works by television i dont like television myself i suppose its all right in small doses but children never seem to be able to take it in small doses they want to sit there all day long staring and staring at the screen thats me said mike teavee shut up said mr teavee thank you said mr wonka i shall now tell you how this amazing television set of mine works but first of all do you know how ordinary television works it is very simple at one end where the picture is being taken you have a large cinй camera and you start photographing something the photographs are then split up into millions of tiny little pieces which are so small that you cant see them and these little pieces are shot out into the sky by electricity in the sky they go whizzing around all over the place until suddenly they hit the antenna on the roof of somebodys house they then go flashing down the wire that leads right into the back of the television set and in there they get jiggled and joggled around until at last every single one of those millions of tiny pieces is fitted back into its right place and presto the photograph appears on the screen that isnt exactly how it works mike teavee said i am a little deaf in my left ear mr wonka said you must forgive me if i dont hear everything you say i said that isnt exactly how it works shouted mike teavee youre a nice boy mr wonka said but you talk too much now then the very first time i saw ordinary television working i was struck by a tremendous idea look here i shouted if these people can break up a photograph into millions of pieces and send the pieces whizzing through the air and then put them together again at the other end why cant i do the same thing with a bar of chocolate why cant i send a real bar of chocolate whizzing through the air in tiny pieces and then put the pieces together at the other end all ready to be eaten impossible said mike teavee you think so cried mr wonka well watch this i shall now send a bar of my very best chocolate from one end of this room to the other by television get ready there bring in the chocolate immediately six oompaloompas marched forward carrying on their shoulders the most enormous bar of chocolate charlie had ever seen it was about the size of the mattress he slept on at home it has to be big mr wonka explained because whenever you send something by television it always comes out much smaller than it was when it went in even with ordinary television when you photograph a big man he never comes out on your screen any taller than a pencil does he here we go then get ready no no stop hold everything you there mike teavee stand back youre too close to the camera there are dangerous rays coming out of that thing they could break you up into a million tiny pieces in one second thats why the oompaloompas are wearing space suits the suits protect them all right thats better now then switch on one of the oompaloompas caught hold of a large switch and pulled it down there was a blinding flash the chocolates gone shouted grandpa joe waving his arms he was quite right the whole enormous bar of chocolate had disappeared completely into thin air its on its way cried mr wonka it is now rushing through the air above our heads in a million tiny pieces quick come over here he dashed over to the other end of the room where the large television set was standing and the others followed him watch the screen he cried here it comes look the screen flickered and lit up then suddenly a small bar of chocolate appeared in the middle of the screen take it shouted mr wonka growing more and more excited how can you take it asked mike teavee laughing its just a picture on a television screen charlie bucket cried mr wonka you take it reach out and grab it charlie put out his hand and touched the screen and suddenly miraculously the bar of chocolate came away in his fingers he was so surprised he nearly dropped it eat it shouted mr wonka go on and eat it itll be delicious its the same bar its got smaller on the journey thats all its absolutely fantastic gasped grandpa joe its its its a miracle just imagine cried mr wonka when i start using this across the country youll be sitting at home watching television and suddenly a commercial will flash on to the screen and a voice will say eat wonkas chocolates theyre the best in the world if you dont believe us try one for yourself now and you simply reach out and take one how about that eh terrific cried grandpa joe it will change the world mike teavee is sent by television mike teavee was even more excited than grandpa joe at seeing a bar of chocolate being sent by television but mr wonka he shouted can you send other things through the air in the same way breakfast cereal for instance oh my sainted aunt cried mr wonka dont mention that disgusting stuff in front of me do you know what breakfast cereal is made of its made of all those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners but could you send it by television if you wanted to as you do chocolate asked mike teavee of course i could and what about people asked mike teavee could you send a real live person from one place to another in the same way a person cried mr wonka are you off your rocker but could it be done good heavens child i really dont know i suppose it could yes im pretty sure it could of course it could i wouldnt like to risk it though it might have some very nasty results but mike teavee was already off and running the moment he heard mr wonka saying im pretty sure it could of course it could he turned away and started running as fast as he could towards the other end of the room where the great camera was standing look at me he shouted as he ran im going to be the first person in the world to be sent by television no no no no cried mr wonka mike screamed mrs teavee stop come back youll be turned into a million tiny pieces but there was no stopping mike teavee now the crazy boy rushed on and when he reached the enormous camera he jumped straight for the switch scattering oompaloompas right and left as he went see you later alligator he shouted and he pulled down the switch and as he did so he leaped out into the full glare of the mighty lens there was a blinding flash then there was silence then mrs teavee ran forward but she stopped dead in the middle of the room and she stood there she stood staring at the place where her son had been and her great red mouth opened wide and she screamed hes gone hes gone great heavens he has gone shouted mr teavee mr wonka hurried forward and placed a hand gently on mrs teavees shoulder we shall have to hope for the best he said we must pray that your little boy will come out unharmed at the other end mike screamed mrs teavee clasping her head in her hands where are you ill tell you where he is said mr teavee hes whizzing around above our heads in a million tiny pieces dont talk about it wailed mrs teavee we must watch the television set said mr wonka he may come through any moment mr and mrs teavee and grandpa joe and little charlie and mr wonka all gathered round the television and stared tensely at the screen the screen was quite blank hes taking a heck of a long time to come across said mr teavee wiping his brow oh dear oh dear said mr wonka i do hope that no part of him gets left behind what on earth do you mean asked mr teavee sharply i dont wish to alarm you said mr wonka but it does sometimes happen that only about half the little pieces find their way into the television set it happened last week i dont know why but the result was that only half a bar of chocolate came through mrs teavee let out a scream of horror you mean only a half of mike is coming back to us she cried lets hope its the top half said mr teavee hold everything said mr wonka watch the screen somethings happening the screen had suddenly begun to flicker then some wavy lines appeared mr wonka adjusted one of the knobs and the wavy lines went away and now very slowly the screen began to get brighter and brighter here he comes yelled mr wonka yes thats him all right is he all in one piece cried mrs teavee im not sure said mr wonka its too early to tell faintly at first but becoming clearer and clearer every second the picture of mike teavee appeared on the screen he was standing up and waving at the audience and grinning from ear to ear but hes a midget shouted mr teavee mike cried mrs teavee are you all right are there any bits of you missing isnt he going to get any bigger shouted mr teavee talk to me mike cried mrs teavee say something tell me youre all right a tiny little voice no louder than the squeaking of a mouse came out of the television set hi mum it said hi pop look at me im the first person ever to be sent by television grab him ordered mr wonka quick mrs teavee shot out a hand and picked the tiny figure of mike teavee out of the screen hooray cried mr wonka hes all in one piece hes completely unharmed you call that unharmed snapped mrs teavee peering at the little speck of a boy who was now running to and fro across the palm of her hand waving his pistols in the air he was certainly not more than an inch tall hes shrunk said mr teavee of course hes shrunk said mr wonka what did you expect this is terrible wailed mrs teavee what are we going to do and mr teavee said we cant send him back to school like this hell get trodden on hell get squashed he wont be able to do anything cried mrs teavee oh yes i will squeaked the tiny voice of mike teavee ill still be able to watch television never again shouted mr teavee im throwing the television set right out the window the moment we get home ive had enough of television when he heard this mike teavee flew into a terrible tantrum he started jumping up and down on the palm of his mothers hand screaming and yelling and trying to bite her fingers i want to watch television he squeaked i want to watch television i want to watch television i want to watch television here give him to me said mr teavee and he took the tiny boy and shoved him into the breast pocket of his jacket and stuffed a handkerchief on top squeals and yells came from inside the pocket and the pocket shook as the furious little prisoner fought to get out oh mr wonka wailed mrs teavee how can we make him grow well said mr wonka stroking his beard and gazing thoughtfully at the ceiling i must say thats a wee bit tricky but small boys are extremely springy and elastic they stretch like mad so what well do well put him in a special machine i have for testing the stretchiness of chewinggum maybe that will bring him back to what he was oh thank you said mrs teavee dont mention it dear lady how far dyou think hell stretch asked mr teavee maybe miles said mr wonka who knows but hes going to be awfully thin everything gets thinner when you stretch it you mean like chewinggum asked mr teavee exactly how thin will he be asked mrs teavee anxiously i havent the foggiest idea said mr wonka and it doesnt really matter anyway because well soon fatten him up again all well have to do is give him a triple overdose of my wonderful supervitamin chocolate supervitamin chocolate contains huge amounts of vitamin a and vitamin b it also contains vitamin c vitamin d vitamin e vitamin f vitamin g vitamin i vitamin j vitamin k vitamin l vitamin m vitamin n vitamin o vitamin p vitamin q vitamin r vitamin t vitamin u vitamin v vitamin w vitamin x vitamin y and believe it or not vitamin z the only two vitamins it doesnt have in it are vitamin s because it makes you sick and vitamin h because it makes you grow horns on the top of your head like a bull but it does have in it a very small amount of the rarest and most magical vitamin of them all vitamin wonka and what will that do to him asked mr teavee anxiously itll make his toes grow out until theyre as long as his fingers oh no cried mrs teavee dont be silly said mr wonka its most useful hell be able to play the piano with his feet but mr wonka no arguments please said mr wonka he turned away and clicked his fingers three times in the air an oompaloompa appeared immediately and stood beside him follow these orders said mr wonka handing the oompaloompa a piece of paper on which he had written full instructions and youll find the boy in his fathers pocket off you go goodbye mr teavee goodbye mrs teavee and please dont look so worried they all come out in the wash you know every one of them at the end of the room the oompaloompas around the giant camera were already beating their tiny drums and beginning to jog up and down to the rhythm there they go again said mr wonka im afraid you cant stop them singing little charlie caught grandpa joes hand and the two of them stood beside mr wonka in the middle of the long bright room listening to the oompaloompas and this is what they sang the most important thing weve learned so far as children are concerned is never never never let them near your television set or better still just dont install the idiotic thing at all in almost every house weve been weve watched them gaping at the screen they loll and slop and lounge about and stare until their eyes pop out last week in someones place we saw a dozen eyeballs on the floor they sit and stare and stare and sit until theyre hypnotized by it until theyre absolutely drunk with all that shocking ghastly junk oh yes we know it keeps them still they dont climb out the window sill they never fight or kick or punch they leave you free to cook the lunch and wash the dishes in the sink but did you ever stop to think to wonder just exactly what this does to your beloved tot it rots the senses in the head it kills imagination dead it clogs and clutters up the mind it makes a child so dull and blind he can no longer understand a fantasy a fairyland his brain becomes as soft as cheese his powers of thinking rust and freeze he cannot think he only sees all right youll cry all right youll say but if we take the set away what shall we do to entertain our darling children please explain well answer this by asking you what used the darling ones to do how used they keep themselves contented before this monster was invented have you forgotten dont you know well say it very loud and slow they used to read theyd read and read and read and read and then proceed to read some more great scott gadzooks one half their lives was reading books the nursery shelves held books galore books cluttered up the nursery floor and in the bedroom by the bed more books were waiting to be read such wondrous fine fantastic tales of dragons gypsies queens and whales and treasure isles and distant shores where smugglers rowed with muffled oars and pirates wearing purple pants and sailing ships and elephants and cannibals crouching round the pot stirring away at something hot it smells so good what can it be good gracious its penelope the younger ones had beatrix potter with mr tod the dirty rotter and squirrel nutkin pigling bland and mrs tiggywinkle and just how the camel got his hump and how the monkey lost his rump and mr toad and bless my soul theres mr rat and mr mole oh books what books they used to know those children living long ago so please oh please we beg we pray go throw your tv set away and in its place you can install a lovely bookshelf on the wall then fill the shelves with lots of books ignoring all the dirty looks the screams and yells the bites and kicks and children hitting you with sticks fear not because we promise you that in about a week or two of having nothing else to do theyll now begin to feel the need of having something good to read and once they start oh boy oh boy you watch the slowly growing joy that fills their hearts theyll grow so keen theyll wonder what theyd ever seen in that ridiculous machine that nauseating foul unclean repulsive television screen and later each and every kid will love you more for what you did ps regarding mike teavee we very much regret that we shall simply have to wait and see if we can get him back his height but if we cant it serves him right only charlie left which room shall it be next said mr wonka as he turned away and darted into the lift come on hurry up we must get going and how many children are there left now little charlie looked at grandpa joe and grandpa joe looked back at little charlie but mr wonka grandpa joe called after him theres theres only charlie left now mr wonka swung round and stared at charlie there was a silence charlie stood there holding tightly on to grandpa joes hand you mean youre the only one left mr wonka said pretending to be surprised why yes whispered charlie yes mr wonka suddenly exploded with excitement but my dear boy he cried out that means youve won he rushed out of the lift and started shaking charlies hand so furiously it nearly came off oh i do congratulate you he cried i really do im absolutely delighted it couldnt be better how wonderful this is i had a hunch you know right from the beginning that it was going to be you well done charlie well done this is terrific now the fun is really going to start but we mustnt dilly we mustnt dally theres even less time to lose now than there was before we have an enormous number of things to do before the day is out just think of the arrangements that have to be made and the people we have to fetch but luckily for us we have the great glass lift to speed things up jump in my dear charlie jump in you too grandpa joe sir no no after you thats the way now then this time i shall choose the button we are going to press mr wonkas bright twinkling blue eyes rested for a moment on charlies face something crazy is going to happen now charlie thought but he wasnt frightened he wasnt even nervous he was just terrifically excited and so was grandpa joe the old mans face was shining with excitement as he watched every move that mr wonka made mr wonka was reaching for a button high up on the glass ceiling of the lift charlie and grandpa joe both craned their necks to read what it said on the little label beside the button it said up and out up and out thought charlie what sort of a room is that mr wonka pressed the button the glass doors closed hold on cried mr wonka then wham the lift shot straight up like a rocket yippee shouted grandpa joe charlie was clinging to grandpa joes legs and mr wonka was holding on to a strap from the ceiling and up they went up up up straight up this time with no twistings or turnings and charlie could hear the whistling of the air outside as the lift went faster and faster yippee shouted grandpa joe again yippee here we go faster cried mr wonka banging the wall of the lift with his hand faster faster if we dont go any faster than this we shall never get through through what shouted grandpa joe what have we got to get through ahha cried mr wonka you wait and see ive been longing to press this button for years but ive never done it until now i was tempted many times oh yes i was tempted but i couldnt bear the thought of making a great big hole in the roof of the factory here we go boys up and out but you dont mean shouted grandpa joe you dont really mean that this lift oh yes i do answered mr wonka you wait and see up and out but but but its made of glass shouted grandpa joe itll break into a million pieces i suppose it might said mr wonka cheerful as ever but its pretty thick glass all the same the lift rushed on going up and up and up faster and faster and faster then suddenly crash and the most tremendous noise of splintering wood and broken tiles came from directly above their heads and grandpa joe shouted help its the end were done for and mr wonka said no were not were through were out sure enough the lift had shot right up through the roof of the factory and was now rising into the sky like a rocket and the sunshine was pouring in through the glass roof in five seconds they were a thousand feet up in the sky the lifts gone mad shouted grandpa joe have no fear my dear sir said mr wonka calmly and he pressed another button the lift stopped it stopped and hung in midair hovering like a helicopter hovering over the factory and over the very town itself which lay spread out below them like a picture postcard looking down through the glass floor on which he was standing charlie could see the small faraway houses and the streets and the snow that lay thickly over everything it was an eerie and frightening feeling to be standing on clear glass high up in the sky it made you feel that you werent standing on anything at all are we all right cried grandpa joe how does this thing stay up sugar power said mr wonka one million sugar power oh look he cried pointing down there go the other children theyre returning home the other children go home we must go down and take a look at our little friends before we do anything else said mr wonka he pressed a different button and the lift dropped lower and soon it was hovering just above the entrance gates to the factory looking down now charlie could see the children and their parents standing in a little group just inside the gates i can only see three he said whos missing i expect its mike teavee mr wonka said but hell be coming along soon do you see the trucks mr wonka pointed to a line of gigantic covered vans parked in a line near by yes charlie said what are they for dont you remember what it said on the golden tickets every child goes home with a lifetimes supply of sweets theres one truckload for each of them loaded to the brim ahha mr wonka went on there goes our friend augustus gloop dyou see him hes getting into the first truck with his mother and father you mean hes really all right asked charlie astonished even after going up that awful pipe hes very much all right said mr wonka hes changed said grandpa joe peering down through the glass wall of the elevator he used to be fat now hes thin as a straw of course hes changed said mr wonka laughing he got squeezed in the pipe dont you remember and look there goes miss violet beauregarde the great gumchewer it seems as though they managed to dejuice her after all im so glad and how healthy she looks much better than before but shes purple in the face cried grandpa joe so she is said mr wonka ah well theres nothing we can do about that good gracious cried charlie look at poor veruca salt and mr salt and mrs salt theyre simply covered with rubbish and here comes mike teavee said grandpa joe good heavens what have they done to him hes about ten feet tall and thin as a wire theyve overstretched him on the gumstretching machine said mr wonka how very careless but how dreadful for him cried charlie nonsense said mr wonka hes very lucky every basketball team in the country will be trying to get him but now he added it is time we left these four silly children i have something very important to talk to you about my dear charlie mr wonka pressed another button and the lift swung upwards into the sky charlies chocolate factory the great glass lift was now hovering high over the town inside the lift stood mr wonka grandpa joe and little charlie how i love my chocolate factory said mr wonka gazing down then he paused and he turned around and looked at charlie with a most serious expression on his face do you love it too charlie he asked oh yes cried charlie i think its the most wonderful place in the whole world i am very pleased to hear you say that said mr wonka looking more serious than ever he went on staring at charlie yes he said i am very pleased indeed to hear you say that and now i shall tell you why mr wonka cocked his head to one side and all at once the tiny twinkling wrinkles of a smile appeared around the corners of his eyes and he said you see my dear boy i have decided to make you a present of the whole place as soon as you are old enough to run it the entire factory will become yours charlie stared at mr wonka grandpa joe opened his mouth to speak but no words came out its quite true mr wonka said smiling broadly now i really am giving it to you thats all right isnt it giving it to him gasped grandpa joe you must be joking im not joking sir im deadly serious but but why should you want to give your factory to little charlie listen mr wonka said im an old man im much older than you think i cant go on for ever ive got no children of my own no family at all so who is going to run the factory when i get too old to do it myself someones got to keep it going if only for the sake of the oompaloompas mind you there are thousands of clever men who would give anything for the chance to come in and take over from me but i dont want that sort of person i dont want a grownup person at all a grownup wont listen to me he wont learn he will try to do things his own way and not mine so i have to have a child i want a good sensible loving child one to whom i can tell all my most precious sweetmaking secrets while i am still alive so that is why you sent out the golden tickets cried charlie exactly said mr wonka i decided to invite five children to the factory and the one i liked best at the end of the day would be the winner but mr wonka stammered grandpa joe do you really and truly mean that you are giving the whole of this enormous factory to little charlie after all theres no time for arguments cried mr wonka we must go at once and fetch the rest of the family charlies father and his mother and anyone else thats around they can all live in the factory from now on they can all help to run it until charlie is old enough to do it by himself where do you live charlie charlie peered down through the glass floor at the snowcovered houses that lay below its over there he said pointing its that little cottage right on the edge of the town the tiny little one i see it cried mr wonka and he pressed some more buttons and the lift shot down towards charlies house im afraid my mother wont come with us charlie said sadly why ever not because she wont leave grandma josephine and grandma georgina and grandpa george but they must come too they cant charlie said theyre very old and they havent been out of bed for twenty years then well take the bed along as well with them in it said mr wonka theres plenty of room in this lift for a bed you couldnt get the bed out of the house said grandpa joe it wont go through the door you mustnt despair cried mr wonka nothing is impossible you watch the lift was now hovering over the roof of the buckets little house what are you going to do cried charlie im going right on in to fetch them said mr wonka how asked grandpa joe through the roof said mr wonka pressing another button no shouted charlie stop shouted grandpa joe crash went the lift right down through the roof of the house into the old peoples bedroom showers of dust and broken tiles and bits of wood and cockroaches and spiders and bricks and cement went raining down on the three old ones who were lying in bed and each of them thought that the end of the world was come grandma georgina fainted grandma josephine dropped her false teeth grandpa george put his head under the blanket and mr and mrs bucket came rushing in from the next room save us cried grandma josephine calm yourself my darling wife said grandpa joe stepping out of the lift its only us mother cried charlie rushing into mrs buckets arms mother mother listen to whats happened were all going back to live in mr wonkas factory and were going to help him to run it and hes given it all to me and and and and what are you talking about said mrs bucket just look at our house cried poor mr bucket its in ruins my dear sir said mr wonka jumping forward and shaking mr bucket warmly by the hand im so very glad to meet you you mustnt worry about your house from now on youre never going to need it again anyway who is this crazy man screamed grandma josephine he could have killed us all this said grandpa joe is mr willy wonka himself it took quite a time for grandpa joe and charlie to explain to everyone exactly what had been happening to them all day and even then they all refused to ride back to the factory in the lift id rather die in my bed shouted grandma josephine so would i cried grandma georgina i refuse to go announced grandpa george so mr wonka and grandpa joe and charlie taking no notice of their screams simply pushed the bed into the lift they pushed mr and mrs bucket in after it then they got in themselves mr wonka pressed a button the doors closed grandma georgina screamed and the lift rose up off the floor and shot through the hole in the roof out into the open sky charlie climbed on to the bed and tried to calm the three old people who were still petrified with fear please dont be frightened he said its quite safe and were going to the most wonderful place in the world charlies right said grandpa joe will there be anything to eat when we get
